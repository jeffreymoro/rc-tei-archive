                  <p>The topic of literary forgery in the eighteenth century and Romantic period has
                  become something of a boom industry in the last few decades.<note place="foot" resp="editors">From the list of studies in the Works Cited, see the
                     following: Haywood, <title level="m">The Making of History</title> and <title level="m">Faking It</title>; Stafford; Gaskill; Baines; Ruthven; Groom,

                     Constantine; Lynch; Garvey; Miles; and Malton.</note> Since I published my own
                  studies on this theme in the 1980s (<title level="m">The Making of History</title>
                  and <title level="m">Faking It</title>), scholarly interest in this area has
                  burgeoned and has contributed much to the remapping and redefining of literary
                  history in this period. One reason for this renaissance is undoubtedly that the
                  eighteenth century is so rich in primary sources. The literary forgeries of the
                  “big three” still continue to fascinate scholars: I refer here of course to James
                  Macpherson, who invented an ancient Scottish epic poet called Ossian; Thomas
                  Chatterton, the boy wonder of Bristol who fabricated a series of poems and other
                  documents supposedly written in the fifteenth century; and William Henry Ireland,
                  who “discovered” a new play by Shakespeare, <title level="m">Vortigern and
                     Rowena</title>. Some of the scholarly interest in these figures and other
                  forgers has been motivated by nationalistic affiliations: the “Ossianic Celtic
                  revival” has produced solid studies by, among others, Fiona Stafford and Howard
                  Gaskill, while Mary Ann Constantine has recently championed the Welsh antiquarian
                  scholar-forger Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams). Other work has perhaps been
                  stimulated by post-Foucauldian concerns about the vexed yet intriguing
                  relationship between creative authorship, originality, and authenticity. As Debbie
                  Lee notes in her chapter on <title level="a">Forgeries</title> in <title level="m">Romanticism: An Oxford Guide</title> (and this inclusion is itself symptomatic
                  of the resurgence I am describing), “One of the things impostors and forgers make
                  strikingly clear is the period’s idolatrous worship of authenticity and truth”
                  (521). Chief among the iconoclasts determined to expose Romanticism’s “idolatrous
                  worship of authenticity and truth” is Nick Groom, whose book <title level="m">The
                     Forger’s Shadow</title> (2002) represents the most sophisticated and searching
                  re-evaluation of the impact of forgery on our conceptions of authorship and
                  authenticity. Groom goes so far as to state that Romanticism “(for want of a
                  better term) would have been very different without literary forgery—indeed it may
                  not have recognisably existed at all” (<title level="m">Forger’s Shadow</title>
                  15); hence the subtitle of his book, <title level="a">How Forgery Changed the
                     Course of Literature.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>Groom’s book, together with recent studies by Debbie Lee, Margaret Russett, Jack
                  Lynch and Robert Miles provide clear evidence that forgery studies have expanded
                  well beyond those paradoxically-defined “original” fakes of the Big Three
                  (supposedly ancient or renowned works of the past actually authored in the present
                  and as such qualifying as new, “valid” creative texts). Forgery now embraces
                  aspects of canonical authors’ poetic practice (such as plagiarism), but
                  increasingly there is an interest in the colourful cases of exotic hoaxes and
                  imposture, a tradition which begins with the sprightly career of the “Formosan”
                  rogue George Psalmanazar. Indeed, the Romantic impostor has graduated into the
                  heroic performer of Butlerian, transgressive gender and identity politics, most
                  notably in the examples of Joanna Southcott (who claimed to be the bride of
                  Christ) and the servant Mary Wilcox/Baker, alias “Princess Caraboo of Javasu.” As
                  Groom remarks on Debbie Lee’s <title level="m">Romantic Liars: Obscure Women who
                     became Impostors and Challenged an Empire</title> (2006), “Lee’s impostors are
                  women who disguised themselves to create social opportunities, which they lacked
                  through gender and class prejudice” (<title level="a">Romanticism and
                     Forgery</title>). This cast of Romantic impostors continues to grow and is not
                  restricted to one gender. One important and lively figure whom Lee overlooks and
                  who takes the theme of forgery into the furthest regions of the British Empire is
                  George Barrington, a celebrated “Prince of pickpockets” who was transported to
                  Australia in 1791 where he supposedly wrote several pioneering biographical
                  accounts of Botany Bay and New South Wales. As Nathan Garvey’s excellent study
                  shows, these influential books were actually fabrications produced by unscrupulous
                  publishers cashing in on Barrington’s celebrity. </p>
                  <p>As these examples demonstrate, the subversive credentials of forgery continue to
                  generate historical curiosity and scholarly passions. In Groom’s words, literary
                  forgers are “by turns spectral, mad, illegitimate and elusive; vilified,
                  criminalised, excluded from the canon” ("Romanticism and Forgery"). However, one
                  area of Romantic forgery which remains under-explored is financial forgery; to be
                  precise, the massive counterfeiting of banknotes which emerged from the credit
                  crisis of the Romantic period. The contemporary tone of the phrase “credit crisis”
                  is quite intentional, as there are some striking (if depressing) parallels between
                  the collapse of faith in paper money which occurred in the early nineteenth
                  century and the current desperate measures to restore faith in an international
                  monetary system based on credit and colossal levels of national debt. In one sense
                  this recurrence attests to Romanticism’s failure to prevent credit becoming (in
                  Brantlinger’s words) “a basic, unavoidable aspect of modern money and modern
                  economic processes” (139) yet, as Brantlinger’s fine study shows, the Romantic
                  period saw some of the most illuminating analyses of credit by both its supporters
                  (such as Coleridge) and its radical critics (such as Blake, Cobbett and Shelley)
                  (114-35). The stakes were extremely high: the controversy about credit struck not
                  only at the roots of national wealth and security but also at the emerging idea of
                  culture as a civilising force which both resisted and transcended commercialism.
                  “Paper” was therefore a massively ambiguous symbol of both the fraudulent power of
                  the state and the democratic medium of print culture and the press. If the problem
                  for Romantic writers was to try to reconcile this contradiction, one course of
                  action was relatively easy: if “paper” was illusory and dangerous, critics of
                  credit could restate their faith in “real” gold and silver. But a remaining
                  concern for “currency radicals” (Poovey 220) was that the rejection of what
                  Cobbett called the “paper promises” of a debt-ridden system did not necessarily
                  reveal a new source of value outside the (dis-credited) economy: what would be the
                  literary or cultural manifestation of the absent gold standard? Hence the Romantic
                  credit crisis may well have sharpened and deepened the Romantic quest for an
                  “egotistical sublime” and a redemptive concept of culture uncontaminated by
                  materialism, conformity and commodification (Williams, chapters 1-2).</p>
                  <p>However, it was not the suspension of cash payments alone but another controversy
                  which pushed the paper-money scam to the forefront of public debate: the
                  spectacular increase in the number of executions for forgery. It was the severity
                  of Britain’s “bloody” penal code which heightened and inflamed public opinion
                  about the invidious connections between paper money and unreformed political
                  power. This theme has been neglected by scholars of both Romantic forgery and the
                  credit crisis, so it is to be hoped that the essays in this volume will open up
                  some new lines of investigation and provide some interesting case studies. For
                  opponents of paper money the public execution of hundreds of lower-class victims
                  of petty forgery crimes (the handling of fake one-pound banknotes) was a
                  spectacular display of the evils of an unreformed state which relied on a credit
                  economy to pursue its goals. As the essays in this volume show, the shockwaves of
                  these judicial crimes reverberate throughout the literature and culture of the
                  Regency period and beyond—all that is needed are the methodological sensors to
                  detect the tremors.</p>
                  <p>My own interest in Romantic financial forgery takes up in a quite literal way the
                  idea that forgery spectacularized the contradictions of the credit economy. The
                  anti-hero of my essay is not the literary forger or bravura impostor but the
                  spectral figure of the engraver: the generic producer of, on the one hand, both
                  genuine and counterfeit currency and, on the other, the “shadow” economy of
                  popular graphic caricatures. By giving the forgery controversy a visual turn, I
                  show that Romantic-period anxieties about authenticity and value achieved a form
                  of visual apotheosis through the “formidable” power of the caricaturist (and the
                  source and significance of that word “formidable” will be revealed later). I
                  propose that Romantic-period caricature actually flourished within the credit and
                  forgery crisis, finding a fertile cultural climate for its own paper economy of
                  “fake” or falsifying representations, and exploring in an inimitably effective way
                  the dubious logic of a system built on “paper promises.”</p>

                  <p>On 25 February 1797, “a day which will long be remembered”, according to William
                  Cobbett (149), Prime Minister William Pitt went to see the King for an emergency
                  meeting. The country was in a state of national alarm, as news had just arrived of
                  a French invasion at Fishguard. In fact this turned out to be easily repelled
                     (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure1.jpg">Figure 1</ref>), but the incident forced
                  Pitt to consider an option he had resisted for some time. Fearing that there would
                  be a run on the Bank of England which would in turn damage the financing of the
                  war against France, he persuaded the King to issue (what turned out to be) a
                  momentous decree: starting immediately, the Bank would no longer issue specie
                  (cash or metal currency) in exchange for paper banknotes. The Bank Restriction
                  Act, as it later passed into law, is a somewhat misleading title, as it actually
                  led to a massive expansion of paper money. Specifically, the Act authorized the
                  mass production of new £1 and £2 banknotes to replace the withdrawn specie, and it
                  was this literal cheapening of the currency which would prove to be so disastrous
                  in its social consequences. The explosion of paper money was seized on immediately
                  by James Gillray, the period’s leading caricaturist. In his wonderful print <title level="m">Midas</title>, published just a few weeks after Restriction came into
                  force (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure2.jpg">Figure 2</ref>), Pitt is shown as a
                  colossus squatting over the Rotunda of the Bank of England which serves him like a
                  toilet. From both his rear end and his mouth Pitt is showering the Bank with the
                  new low denomination notes which also make up his paper crown. We will return to
                  this image throughout this essay as it forms one of the most iconic responses to
                  the credit crisis, matched only by George Cruikshank’s <title level="m">Bank
                     Restriction Note</title> which we will meet shortly. Note that Gillray
                  foregrounds Pitt’s megalomania and plays down the culpability of the Bank:
                  obviously, at this very early stage he could not have foreseen the Bank’s role in
                  securing convictions for forgery and the ensuing public outrage this engendered.
                  Originally, Restriction was meant to last only six months, but as the credit
                  crisis persisted the Act was renewed continually until specie payment was
                  eventually reintroduced in 1821, by which time the national debt was an
                  astonishing £854 million, or 2.7 times the national income (O’Brien 179). During
                  its 24-year reign (which dovetails quite neatly with a large slice of the Romantic
                  period), Restriction provoked a storm of controversy which is still under-valued
                  in Romantic studies. Though the topic is mentioned in a number of books on
                  forgery, the issue of forgery remains marginal in the seminal studies of the role
                  of credit in British culture.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See:
                     Brantlinger, chapters 2-3; Dick, “‘The Ghost of Gold’”; Malton, <title level="m">Forgery, Fiscal Trauma, and the Fauntleroy Case</title>;
                     Gallagher, 17-19.</note> But in light of the fact that, as Margot Finn notes,
                  an “aversion to paper money” was “deeply rooted in Georgian England” (80) this
                  theme clearly deserves more exploration.</p>
                  <p>There were two major problems with Restriction. The first was that it seemed to
                  undermine the very system of credit which it was supposedly safeguarding. Charles
                  James Fox called the stoppage of cash payments “the first day of our national
                  bankruptcy” (Richard, 1: 84). But, as we shall see, the Restriction crisis
                  actually exposed deeper contradictions which had bedevilled the British “financial
                  revolution” from its inception in the Restoration period (Dickson, chapters 1-2).
                  The second problem with Restriction was more visible and sensational: London (the
                  primary zone within which the new low denomination Bank of England notes
                  circulated) saw a massive increase in executions for forgery.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The problem was focused on London as this was the main
                     zone within which Bank of England notes circulated. Outside of London most
                     people used the notes of private or “country” banks; these were still issuing
                     their own notes in the early twentieth century.</note> This catastrophe had
                  three main causes. First, the vulnerability and gullibility of the lower classes
                  who were unused to dealing with banknotes.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Even one of the Restriction Act’s most fervent admirers had to admit that the
                     enforced introduction of banknotes into the “common class of people” could
                     cause “tumultuous proceedings” (Thornton, 114). According to Jerome
                     Christensen, a review of Thornton's book in the first issue of the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> was the first recognition of the
                     “revolutionary” impact of paper money on English history (619).</note> Before
                  this time forgery had been largely a white-collar crime. The best-known
                  eighteenth-century forger was probably the Reverend William Dodd, who was executed
                  in June 1777 for forging the signature of his former pupil Lord Chesterfield on a
                  banknote valued at £4,000. Despite Dr Johnson coming to his aid and writing his
                  pleas for clemency, and despite a large petition of 30,000 signatures in his
                  favour, Dodd went to the gallows. As Boswell puts it in his <title level="m">Life
                     of Johnson</title>, Dodd had committed “the most dangerous crime in a
                  commercial country” (828). </p>
                  <p>The second contributing factor to the rise in Restriction forgery was the poor
                  quality of the banknotes which made them easily counterfeited (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure3.jpg">Figure 3</ref>). The third factor was something
                  which Gillray could not have foreseen: the ruthlessness of the Bank of England -
                  the “head of all circulation” - in prosecuting offenders.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The Bank was called the “head of all circulation” by the
                     Secret Committee of the House of Lords, April 1797 (cited in Ehrman, 7).</note>
                  Indeed, the Bank employed a team of lawyers at great expense to ensure
                  prosecutions. The statistics are dramatic: the period 1783-97 saw only four
                  prosecutions for forgery, but 1797-1821 (the Restriction period) saw over 2000
                  prosecutions and over 300 executions. The Bank spent thousands of pounds to secure
                  these executions, and in some years such as 1819 this amounted to more than was
                  lost through forgery (McGowen para 4). Almost one third of all executions at this
                  time were for forgery, but the vast majority of these were concentrated in the
                  post-Napoleonic war period, when economic depression and demobilization of
                  thousands of troops and sailors produced ever greater incentives for the forger
                  (Handler, <title level="a">Forging the Agenda</title>). When the government
                  reneged on the original promise to abolish Restriction after six months of peace
                  (which eventually came in 1815), public hostility to the growing body count of
                  convicted forgers and handlers (or “utterers”) became vitriolic. James Mackintosh
                  spoke in parliament of the “course of guilt and blood which had followed the
                  stoppage of cash payments”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Cited in
                     Handler, <title level="m">Forging the Agenda</title>, 256.</note> while Henry
                  Brougham railed at the “human sacrifices to the Moloch of Paper Credit.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Brougham, review of <title level="m">Returns of Prosecutions and Convictions for Forging Notes of the Bank of

                  The resurgent radical press—perhaps drawing on memories of similar injustices
                  against the plebeian body, such as the Waltham Black Acts against poaching, or the
                  widespread practice of press-ganging and crimping - persistently and sensationally
                  exposed the injustices of the forgery trials. Thomas Wooler’s <title level="m">Black Dwarf</title> declaimed that “<emph>homicide</emph> has been
                     <emph>legalized</emph>” to defend “the <emph>paper bubbles</emph> which are
                  dignified with the name of <emph>currency</emph>” (2 [9 September 1818], 561). In
                  1818, when almost 30,000 fake banknotes were in circulation, public sympathy for
                  the hapless plebeian forger led to numerous acquittals.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See <title level="m">Black Dwarf</title>, 2 [23 September

                     volume.</note> Doubts were also expressed about the competence of the Bank of
                  England in recognising a fake from the real banknote. As early as 1814 an
                  anonymous caricature called <title level="m">A Peep into the Rag Shop in
                     Threadneedle Street</title> highlighted this theme. The print shows a poor
                  forger pleading with Bank of England directors who are examining a bank note. As
                  the speech bubbles make clear, behind their callous bluster is dire ineptitude: <quote>
                        <emph>“Upon my soul I have my doubts but at all events—we had better declare it
                        bad.”<lb/> “Take him out Thomas !!! he has a d----d hanging lok.”<lb/> “Away
                        with the Vagabond! Do you think we sit here for nothing!”</emph>
                     </quote> By the late 1810s, therefore, forgery was no longer, in Handler’s words,
                  a “uniquely subversive” crime which undermined what William Wilberforce called the
                  “vital principle of a commercial nation”, but a dramatic exposure of the
                  eighteenth-century “bloody code” (Handler, <title level="a">Forging the
                     Agenda,</title> 264, 263). The response of both the Bank of England and the
                  government to this barrage of criticism was characteristically insensitive: rather
                  than campaigning for leniency, they both launched inquiries aimed at finding a
                  foolproof or “inimitable” design for the banknote. However, the clamour of public
                  opinion was proving to be a formidable force and in 1819 official moves began to
                  review both Restriction and capital punishment.</p>
                  <p>There could have been no timelier a moment than January 1819, therefore, for the
                  radical publisher William Hone and the leading Regency caricaturist George
                  Cruikshank to issue their own “inimitable” contribution to the Restriction
                  controversy. The <title level="m">Bank Restriction Note</title> and its companion
                  piece the <title level="m">Bank Restriction Barometer</title> (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure4.jpg">Figures 4</ref> and <ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure5.jpg">5</ref>) were published just days after the Bank
                  of England’s inquiry concluded that a forgery-proof design had to be robust enough
                  to withstand the “formidable power of imitation” of the engraver (<title level="j">Times</title>, 27 January 1819). Hone and Cruikshank undoubtedly appreciated
                  this ironic tribute to their joint production, as the <title level="m">Bank
                     Restriction Note</title> takes the form of a mock-submission to the
                     inquiry.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Patten 1: 146-7. Hone
                     claimed that he composed the basic visual design for the <title level="m">Bank
                        Restriction Note</title> and though Patten is sceptical about this claim he
                     speculates that Hone may well have designed the companion print <title level="m">Bank Restriction Barometer</title>. See also 1: 157-8, 186.</note>
                  Unlike earlier satirical banknotes which resembled actual counterfeits (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure6.jpg">Figure 6</ref>), the Hone-Cruikshank caricature
                  is more than just a “formidable” imitation which exposes the flimsy authenticity
                  of the original. By using visceral and witty gallows symbolism, Hone and
                  Cruikshank inscribed into the banknote the catastrophic social consequences of its
                  circulation: what <title level="m">Black Dwarf</title> called the “blood-cemented
                  fabric of paper currency” (2 [14 October 1818], 611). Reminiscent of the “blood
                  sugar” anti-slavery propaganda of the 1790s, the <title level="m">Bank Restriction
                     Note</title> defamiliarizes and demonizes everyday consumption, transforming
                  banknotes into emblems of blood money: satirically, this is their true appearance
                  and true value (the Bank’s role as surrogate executioner is evidenced by the
                  replacement of its clerks’ signature with that of Jack Ketch, the notorious
                  hangman of the 1680s).</p>
                  <p>The national calamity of Restriction can be gauged by comparing Gillray’s
                  efflorescent vision of paper-money inflation with Hone and Cruikshank’s single
                  banknote: with hindsight, Pitt becomes an apocalyptic monster of destruction,
                  spewing out seemingly innocuous and ephemeral scraps of paper which are actually
                  seeds of future calamity. Put another way, Pitt is spreading his malign influence
                  over the Bank to ensure its compliance in devastating the lower classes, those
                  absent or proleptic victims of the new dispensation (Pitt puts John Bull in the
                  Rotunda but he is clearly incongruous). The Midas legend is brilliantly if
                  ironically apt, as the new notes will bring death to those who touch them and
                  ‘restrict’ the body politic in the most debased way possible. Seen in conjunction
                  with Cruikshank’s caricature, the full significance of the catastrophic
                  transformation of “value” under Restriction becomes terrifyingly apparent. In a
                  series of mock-mythic metamorphoses, a whole national narrative of modernity and
                  progress is unravelled: gold transmutes into paper, paper into its forged
                  “shadow”, and this phantom form of circulation is re-incarnated into the “blood”
                  of the nation, an inverted symbol of national well-being. The function of currency
                  as both the literal and symbolic signifier of national wealth and security is
                  systematically dis-credited by satirically re-encoding its semiotic processes as
                  both fantastical and lethal—as if currency is the Gothic alter-ego of caricature
                  itself.</p>
                  <p>The Hone-Cruikshank prints were an instant success and undoubtedly contributed to
                  raising or inflaming public awareness about the evils of both paper money and
                  capital punishment.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The British Museum has
                     a copy of the Bank Restriction Note in its display of paper currency.</note>
                  Significantly, it was in 1819 that Peel’s Act finally promised the restoration of
                  specie payment by 1823 (though this was achieved by 1821, when Britain formally
                  adopted the gold standard), and during the same year a parliamentary inquiry into
                  capital punishment focused on forgery as one of the main reasons for reforming
                  Britain’s harsh penal code. In his old age Cruikshank claimed that his print had
                  single-handedly led to the abolition of the death penalty for forgery 13 years
                  later, an exaggeration though a forgivable one.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Handler, “Forgery and the End of the ‘Bloody Code’”; Hackwood, 199,

                  </p>
                  <p>But the spectacular achievements of the <title level="m">Bank Restriction
                     Note</title> should not be allowed to overshadow the quiet power of its
                  companion print the <title level="m">Bank Restriction Barometer</title>. Clearly,
                  this print takes a different approach to its companion piece’s mimetic wit. At
                  first sight the <title level="m">Barometer</title> appears to be a simple visual
                  illustration of the radical argument that over-investment in paper currency leads
                  to national ruin, but the satirical dynamic is more complex than this. Many
                  viewers in 1819 would have recognised that the print was a close parody of the
                  Evangelical spiritual barometer of the late eighteenth century (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure7.jpg">Figure 7</ref>). In the caricature, the salutary
                  function of the vertical scale is inverted: the overheated economy replaces
                  sublime spiritual redemption and the gravitational security of gold replaces the
                  sins of the flesh (and note that novel reading is calibrated at minus 40!). This
                  parodic allusion makes clear that the satirical target of the <title level="m">Barometer</title> is the quasi-religious “faith” in paper money which, as we
                  shall see, both underpinned and troubled the “financial revolution” from its
                  Williamite origins. But the process of allusion does not end there, as the
                  spiritual barometer first appears in Hogarth’s anti-Methodist caricature <title level="m">Enthusiasm Delineated</title> (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure8.jpg">Figure 8</ref>). The echo of Hogarth is, I believe, a self-authorizing
                  reference to the English caricature tradition which first accrued substantial
                  cultural authority by critiquing the new monied interest of the early eighteenth
                  century. Like the fake banknote, the satirical print shadowed, mirrored and
                  exposed the new credit economy throughout its history.</p>

                  <p>The Restriction controversy was the breaking point of an ideological instability
                  which lay at the heart of the paper money system. If the Romantic period was
                  haunted by what Shelley in <title level="m">The Mask of Anarchy</title> called the
                  “ghost of gold”,<note place="foot" resp="editors">As Ehrman shows, over
                     two thousand tons of copper coins were minted in the first three years of
                     Restriction (13), but low valuation copper coins did not carry the same
                     symbolic significance as the evanescent gold and silver. As John Clapham
                     remarks, “gradually the age became one of banknotes” (2: 4).</note> the earlier
                  eighteenth century was haunted by the transubstantiation of paper. When Charles
                  James Fox remarked that “the solidity of Notes consisted in their being
                  convertible into cash” (<title level="j">Times</title>, 1 March 1797), he
                  identified that magical process of transformation which underpinned the credit
                  economy and which could maintain the illusion that banknotes were “solid” rather
                  than ephemeral and insubstantial. To its many critics, Pitt’s Restriction Act of
                  1797 jeopardised the nation by undermining the system of credit and national debt
                  which it was supposedly trying to protect. It was this system of deferred payment
                  which lay behind the creation of the Bank of England in 1694 and which allowed
                  Britain to finance wars and imperial gains well beyond its actual stock of
                  bullion—as Roy Porter puts it succinctly, “Britannia”s wars were won on credit”
                  (132). The genius of the “financial revolution” was that it utilized the
                  foundational economic metaphor of circulation to naturalize and anthropomorphize
                     convertibility:<note place="foot" resp="editors">According to David
                     Trotter, the metaphor of circulation was the “vital principle” of the
                     eighteenth-century analysis of wealth (62). See also Klancher, 31-4.</note> In
                  this imaginary, paper money is the blood which periodically returns to the heart
                  (the Bank’s bullion), to be then pumped out into further circulation, revitalized
                  with “real” value. In the words of one of Thomas Love Peacock’s <title level="m">Paper Money Lyrics</title>: <quote>

                     </quote> According to the circulatory or anatomical model, the body politic
                  functions healthily so long as this flow of money is neither “restricted” nor
                  inundated: if one nightmare is economic starvation (as seen in the stereotype of
                  the emaciated French), the other danger—as Gillray imagines—is the inflationary
                  overproduction of worthless and wasteful currency. Another way to read Gillray’s
                     <title level="m">Midas</title> is as a scatological parody of the famous cover
                  illustration to Thomas Hobbes’ <title level="m">Leviathan</title> (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure9.jpg">Figure 9</ref>): instead of the monarch
                  comprised of his people, Pitt’s body is a sack of secreted and hoarded gold; the
                  literal and symbolic wealth of the nation becomes the tyrant’s booty, replacing
                  citizens with financial chicanery (Pitt’s incontinent largesse also, unavoidably,
                  brings the current dis-credited euphemism “quantitative easing” to mind). However,
                  behind Gillray’s scatological effects lies a more acute point: by evoking the
                  Midas legend, Gillray exposed the alchemical delusions and perils of the myth of
                  convertibility—indeed, the critique was anticipated in a print of 1796 (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure10.jpg">Figure 10</ref>) which shows Pitt as a
                  megalomaniac alchemist who is converting the national wealth into a throne for
                  himself. As Gillray understood, it was the magical properties of paper money which
                  mystified both economic and political power. Even political economists (whether
                  supportive or not) invariably resorted to pre-enlightenment tropes of what Marx
                  called “primitive economic superstition” (261): alchemy, allegory, magic, blind
                  allegiance. Debacles like the South Sea Bubble and the John Law Mississippi scheme
                  (both collapsed in 1720) fuelled the idea that paper credit was a powerful and
                  potentially dangerous illusion.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In an
                     essay on Defoe, Srinivas Aravamudan notes of these debacles that “Paper was
                     chasing paper without proper collateral” (54).</note> Daniel Defoe referred to
                  paper money as a “chimera”; Thomas Mortimer called credit a “standing miracle in
                  politics, which at once astonishes and over-awes the states of Europe” while later
                  in the century Benjamin Franklin boasted that the “wonderful machine” of “paper
                  currency” (in this case the dollar) had enabled America to defeat Britain.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Defoe is cited in Shell, 68; Mortimer is
                     cited in Dickson, 154. Defoe also called credit “Air Money,” anticipating both
                     Adam Smith and Gillray: see Lynch, 96. Such anxieties can even be found at the
                     inception of western responses to paper money. When Marco Polo reported that
                     paper money was used in the city of Cambaluc in China, he commented that the
                     Emperor must have a power like a “perfect alchemist” (cited in Shell, 13,
                     n.10). The 14th-century Chinese experiment in paper money collapsed after just
                     a few decades when the Ming dynasty’s attempt to replace metal with banknotes
                     resulted in hyper-inflation: see the discussion of the Ming banknote in the
                     Radio 4 series <title level="m">History of the World in One Hundred

                  </p>
                  <p>Like its over-valued material form, the ideological “miracle” of paper credit
                  required constant investment and re-investment. For all its glaring conceptual
                  weaknesses, the financial revolution became an epistemological revolution: in
                  Pocock’s words, the switch to deferred payment was a “momentous intellectual
                  event.” By locating value in an endlessly receding future, credit changed the
                  whole basis of the individual’s relationship with the state, replacing civic
                  humanist duty with an “imagined” community of desiring individuals.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Pocock, 108 and chapter 6
                        <foreign>passim</foreign>. See also Torre, 4-5, 48, 162.</note> As
                  Brantlinger has shown, this destabilization of what Marx called species being
                  (though perhaps “specie being” is a more appropriate coinage in the current
                  context) both afflicted and empowered the literary imagination (114-35). At the
                  same time as the new monied interest became a regular target for satire, attempts
                  to relocate value outside of the paper economy proved to be difficult and often
                  equally reliant on cultural mythologies: Romanticism’s resort to primitivism
                  (Wordsworth’s “natural” language of the lower classes), and radical nostalgia
                  (Cobbett’s banknoteless past) are just two prominent examples.</p>
                  <p>Alchemical or transubstantiational delusions were not the only obstacles
                  preventing the full assimilation of paper money into Enlightenment modernity. The
                  “momentous” transition to the credit economy was also undermined by the spectre of
                  forgery. This was both a literal and figurative threat. From its inception, paper
                  money was shadowed by forgery: the first fake banknotes appeared in 1695 within
                  months of the genuine issue.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Mackenzie,
                     chapter 1. Jack Lynch refers colourfully to “a strange arms race between the
                     legitimate issuers of banknotes and the counterfeiters” (139).</note> But the
                  greater damage was ideological, as forgery exposed the essentially imaginary or
                  fictive status of the supposedly authentic original (and it is worth a reminder
                  that a banknote is of course a simulacrum, a copy of a non-existent originating
                  source; there is no such thing, except conceptually, as a unique, single banknote
                  from which copies (legal or illegal) are taken). As Paul Baines notes, “The whole
                  system could be typified by the forgery it naturally engendered” (14). Faced with
                  this perplexing intimacy between financial good and evil, the difference between
                  supporters and critics of the new “system” could only be theological: supporters
                  believed the fiction (or refused to question it), critics exposed it.</p>
                  <p>A characteristically ambivalent attitude to paper money can be seen in Joseph
                  Addison’s third <title level="j">Spectator</title> essay (Saturday 3 March 1711).
                  The essay takes the form of an allegorical dream vision of the goddess Credit, a
                  deity who sits on a throne in the Bank of England, surrounded by “a prodigious
                  heap of bags of money” and pyramids of gold piled to the ceiling. It is likely
                  that Addison is alluding to the image of Britannia “sitting and looking on a Bank
                  on Money” which was the logo of banknotes from their earliest issue (Keyworth) and
                  which reassuringly emblematized the “real” value of the note in bullion. Hence
                  Addison likens Credit to the “Lydian king”; Credit can “convert whatever she
                  pleased into that precious metal”—in other words she is a transgendered Midas who
                  guarantees the nation’s wealth with her miraculous powers of transformation.
                  However, at the first sign of political and social unrest the goddess shrivels
                  into a skeleton, the bullion becomes “bags full of wind” and the gold changes into
                  “heaps of paper.” Only when order is restored is the goddess resuscitated and
                  restored to her former beautiful but “delicate” constitution (<title level="j">The
                     Spectator</title>, 1: 17-20). </p>
                  <p>Addison’s nervous allegory of the politically unstable rise of paper rule (a “bag
                  full of wind”) was a vivid and influential expression of residual Enlightenment
                  scepticism towards the new faith of “speculative fantasy” (Nicholson 10).

                  ambition, risk and catastrophic failure. The perils of putting all the nation’s
                  financial eggs into the flimsy basket of credit became only too apparent in the
                  Gordon riots of June 1780. When the Bank of England was attacked, the country

                     persons of all ranks and conditions, in whatever station, in whatever
                     employment, would have been involved, by the annihilation of so many hundreds
                     of millions of property, and the total abolition of all public credit! Who can

                  <p>By the revolutionary 1790s, the idea that “public credit” faced an imminent
                  “Daedalian” disaster became a powerful rhetorical tool in anti-government writing.
                  In <title level="m">The Rights of Man</title> (1791-2), Thomas Paine noted that
                  the “English system of funding” was close to bankruptcy; in order to finance
                  overseas conflicts, Britain was “increasing paper till there is no money left”
                  (133). As the war-torn decade progressed and the national debt grew, Paine
                  realised that the principle of convertibility was about to collapse. From this
                  point on, radical discourse configured paper and gold as class enemies. In his
                  pamphlet <title level="m">Decline of the English System of Finance</title>,
                  published one year before Restriction in 1796, Paine predicted that gold and
                  silver were about to “revolt against depreciation and separate from the value of
                  paper”, in the process destroying the “popular delusion” of the credit system
                  (Foner, 2: 661, 651-2).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In one of the many
                     ripostes to Paine’s tract, Ralph Broome admitted that “In trusting to private
                     paper money, we certainly do very often trust to a shadow” (37).</note> The
                  Restriction Act must have seemed to many a fulfilment of this prophecy and a major
                  boost for the radical critique. The iconoclastic discourse of transparency
                  penetrated so deep into radical thought that it can even be found in a fugitive
                  document issued by the shadowy insurrectionary group the United Britons in 1799.
                  The document calls the English political system as an enormous “Fraud” and adds
                  that <quote> Amidst mock Contentions for Liberty, and real ones for Plunder,
                     [England] vainly imagined herself free, and was thereby induced to pay the
                     Interest of a Debt of greater Amount than the Value of the whole landed
                     Property of the Country, without reflecting that Bankruptcy, however late, must
                     be the consequence of an overstretched Credit. That Bankruptcy has arrived.

                  <p>Alongside the oppositional analysis, caricature added its own distinctive
                  contribution to the debunking of credit by imagining a new national narrative of
                  conflict between the people and the government: John Bullion versus Paper Pitt. In
                     <title level="m">Bank Notes</title> (1 March 1797), Gillray’s first response to
                  the Restriction Act, John Bull is a hapless yokel caught between the insidious
                  “bullionist” temptations of the Jacobin Foxites and the spectacular “paper”
                  rip-off of Pitt and his ministers (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure11.jpg">Figure
                     11</ref>). Characteristically, Gillray mocks all three parties and leaves the
                  viewer uncertain about which is the greatest offence: Fox’s disloyalty, Pitt’s
                  tyranny, or Bull’s idiocy. Bull decides “a’ may as well let my Measter Billy hold
                  the Gold to keep away you Frenchmen, as save it, to gee it you, when ye come over,
                  with your domn’d invasion”, but this reluctant compliance with the lesser evil
                  does not defuse the satirical gusto with which Gillray depicts the “delusion” of
                  paper money: the stash of padlocked money bags beneath Pitt’s counter constitutes
                  both a mock-patriotic bulwark against the French and a new symbol of centralised
                  state power (hence in <title level="m">Midas</title> one such money bag is used
                  for Pitt’s body). The hapless Bull fails to notice that in the background
                  ministers are delivering sacks of increasingly low-denominational notes (including
                  one labelled “one shilling”). Their worthlessness is brilliantly echoed in Pitt’s
                  use of an inflationary scoop, a satirical inversion of the Bank of England’s
                  supposedly authoritative and measured release of currency into the economy. Seen
                  alongside <title level="m">Midas</title>, this print anticipates the dangerous
                  consequences of the Restriction Act for the plebeian classes: in another telling
                  touch, John Bull’s coat-buttons look perilously like gold coins, a tempting prize
                  for the voraciously asset-stripping government. Before very long, as we shall see,
                  the caricature narrative of John Bullion’s victimization will take on a much more
                  violent form.</p>
                  <p>As the cases of forgery multiplied and Restriction became more and more unpopular,
                  the lethal rift between “real” money and paper “delusion” became increasingly
                  exposed in both radical polemic and the caricature imagination. The most
                  successful single radical intervention was almost certainly William Cobbett’s
                  bestseller <title level="m">Paper against Gold</title>, first published in his
                  newspaper the <title level="j">Weekly Register</title> as a series of open
                  letters, and subsequently issued in book form in 1815. Cobbett argued that only
                  “real money” had “real value” (96), but in stating this he was only echoing the
                  Bullion Committee report of 1810 which called cash payments the “natural and true
                  control” against paper inflation.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Report from the Select Committee on the High Price of
                        Bullion</title> (8 June 1810), cited in Cannan, 66. Poovey argues that
                     Cobbett used the mode of direct address to his readers as a way to subvert the
                     impersonal paper economy of commercial print culture (181-96).</note> This
                  re-naturalization of gold and demonization of paper gave an additional force to
                  Hone and Cruikshank’s debunking of the official iconography of the nation state in
                  their <title level="m">Restriction Bank Note</title>. Instead of depicting
                  Britannia staring at a beehive, a symbol of industriousness which replaced the
                  earlier pile of gold, the satirical Britannia is shown as an unnatural mother
                  eating her children, an apt illustration of the state’s dereliction of duty (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure12.jpg">Figure 12</ref>). Reminiscent of the
                  liberticidal monsters of anti-Jacobin caricatures, this grotesque figure reveals
                  that such symbols of authority are now (in Cobbett’s words) a mere “paper promise”
                  of “real value” (98). As Gillray’s successor, Cruikshank was able to see the
                  Restriction narrative through to its grisly end: the cannibalistic Britannia is
                  the tragic climax to the paper assault on John Bullion. The bloated Midas has
                  transmuted into the vampiric mother, and forgery executions are both a literal and
                  symbolic destruction of the democratic body of the nation. </p>
                  <p>A more optimistic note is struck in another caricature which Cruikshank issued in
                  January 1819. <title level="m">Johnny Bull and his Forged Notes!! or Rags and Ruin
                     in the Paper Currency</title> shows John Bull as a small tradesman rather than
                  a plebeian or yokel (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure13.jpg">Figure 13</ref>). He is
                  about to be arrested in his impoverished home for hoarding forged banknotes, but
                  as he says to the foppish inspector, “I took all these notes in the way of Trade—I
                  can’t tell Bad Good ones from Good Bad ones. Even those who issue them are
                  frequently mistaken &amp; have been deceived by Forgeries.” The debunking of paper
                  money is wittily conceived by reducing the bank notes to combustible paper—this is
                  now their only value. But the most important feature of this print is its
                  portrayal of the Bull family. Far from being abject, Johnny Bull is defiant,
                  sturdy, patriarchal and ruggedly masculine. He is the personification of the moral
                  gold standard, the “real value” of the national character, and he is protecting
                  his “little platoon” against a cowardly and intrusive government. His defiance
                  reflects the resurgent mass radicalism of the post-war years which later in 1819
                  will confront the repressive state apparatus at Peterloo. His self-belief is a
                  striking riposte to the more familiar caricature figure of a disempowered John
                  Bullion who is constantly duped, plundered and violated by a paper system of
                  taxes, bills and cheap banknotes. The most striking examples of this extreme
                  exploitation of John Bullion are probably Richard Newton’s <title level="m">The
                     New Paper Mill</title> and <title level="m">The Inexhaustible Mine</title>,
                  both published in 1797 as a response to Restriction (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure14.jpg">Figures 14</ref> and <ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure15.jpg">15</ref>). In <title level="m">The New Paper
                     Mill</title> Bull is being minced by Pitt into paper notes (presumably having
                  been stripped of his gold first, though allegorically Bull himself represents
                  “real” money); in the brutal Restriction age, Pitt’s mincer is the modern state’s
                  industrially efficient yet banal replacement for the alchemical bravura of
                  convertibility. <title level="m">The Inexhaustible Mine</title> is an
                  eye-catching, quasi-pornographic inversion of Gillray’s <title level="m">Midas</title>. John Bull’s spouting orifices are not scatologically rendered:
                  they are the result of a violation which conflates a gang-rape, a mugging and a
                  strip search. The image captures the repressive authoritarianism of
                  counter-revolutionary policy in the 1790s, a period in which “the spirit of
                  despotism” led to “invasions of privacy” (Barrell). With these images (and many
                  others) in mind,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See for example <title level="m">John Bull at His Studies</title> (1799), <title level="m">The

                  for forgery can be understood as the latest components of a wider, interlocking
                  system of mystification, oppression and exploitation which relied on the state’s
                  monopoly of “paper” power. </p>
                  <p>The state’s rationale for such infringements of civil liberty was that some
                  personal freedoms had to be surrendered if the nation was to be protected against
                  invasion and conquest. Unless John Bullion surrendered his specie and allowed more
                  paper money to circulate, Britain faced an unthinkable fate. If Britons found
                  cheap banknotes unpalatable, they should consider the Jacobin alternative: the
                  rule of the revolutionary French assignat (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure16.jpg">Figure 16</ref>). The assignat was the paper currency which the French
                  Assembly introduced in 1790 out of the proceeds of confiscated Church
                     property.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Taws for a discussion of
                     French counter-revolutionary caricatures of the assignat and the similarity
                     between these two forms of “authenticity and falsehood” (104).</note> The
                  policy quickly led to hyperinflation, and by the time the plates which printed the
                  assignat were publicly burned in February 1796, its value had depreciated by an
                  astonishing 95% (compared to about 30% for the pound in the Restriction period).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Buchan, 159. See also Ferguson, <title level="m">The Cash Nexus</title>, 151-3.</note> For Edmund Burke, the
                  assignat was the epitome of Jacobin mischief and the arch enemy of the gold
                  standard. In Pocock’s opinion, it was the introduction of the assignat, and not
                  the invasion of the Queen’s bedchamber, which was for Burke “the central, the
                  absolute and the unforgivable crime of the Revolutionaries” (197). Throughout his
                     <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title>, Burke rails
                  against the revolutionaries’ decision “to force a currency of their own fiction in
                  the place of that which is real” (261). He declaims that “So violent an outrage
                  upon credit, property, and liberty, as this compulsory paper money currency, has
                  seldom been exhibited” (226). Overall: <quote>everything human and divine
                     sacrificed to the idol of public credit, and national bankruptcy the
                     consequence; and to crown all, the paper securities of new, precarious,
                     tottering power, the discredited paper securities of impoverished fraud, and
                     beggared rapine, held out as a currency for the support of an empire, in lieu
                     of the two great recognized species [gold and silver] that represent the
                     lasting conventional credit of mankind, which disappeared and hid themselves in
                     the earth from whence they came, when the principle of property, whose
                     creatures and representatives they are, was systematically subverted. (126)<note place="foot" resp="editors">Brantlinger argues that Burke
                        conceived the “financial mysteries” of the State in sublime terms as a
                        “towering phallic menace” which “could only dimly be apprehended through
                        imagination and a suitably terroristic rhetoric” (108)—a useful gloss on
                        Gillray”s mock-sublime <title level="m">Midas</title>.</note>
                     </quote> Burke castigated English republicans and revolutionary sympathizers who
                  believed that England should follow the French example and worship the “idol of
                  public credit.” These misguided supporters of paper currency <quote>forget that,
                     in England, not one shilling of paper money of any description is received but
                     of choice; that the whole has had its origin in cash actually deposited; and
                     that it is convertible, at pleasure, in an instant, and without the smallest
                     loss, into cash again. (357-8)</quote> But as Tom Furniss notes, Burke’s method
                  of “projecting a negative aspect of Britain’s own financial revolution which had
                  haunted it from the beginning onto a radical ‘other’ across the channel” simply
                  reproduced those endemic anxieties about an economy based on what Furniss calls
                  “imagination” (241). So it is both ironic and poignant that Burke died in the year
                  in which Pitt introduced the English equivalent of the assignat (Gillray’s <title level="m">Midas</title> illustrates this irony in the way in which the tiny
                  Jacobin demons swarming round Pitt’s head merge into banknotes). In Burke’s own
                  terms, paper money was no longer “convertible, at pleasure, in an instant, and
                  without the smallest loss, into cash again.”</p>
                  <p>Yet by freeing paper money from convertibility and the gold standard, it could be
                  argued that Restriction was an unconscious act of modernization, as there was no
                  longer a pretence (or “delusion”) that paper and gold were related (this is surely
                  the case today in so far as no one believes the “promise” on British banknotes to
                  “pay the bearer” the equivalent in gold). By converting currency into
                  “imagination” rather than “real value”, the idea of value migrated into the
                  aesthetic realm, the realm of symbolic circulation. But if Romantic writers
                  remained troubled by the loss of the real, this was not the case for
                  caricaturists, whose work was premised on converting political events into an
                  alternative, parallel and usually controversial fantasy. In this sense,
                  caricature’s generically maverick and ungovernable aesthetics were more in tune
                  with a system of “fabricated pieces of paper”.<note place="foot" resp="editors">P. B. Shelley, <title level="a">A Philosophical View of Reform,</title>

                  <p>The efflorescent character of Gillray’s <title level="m">Midas</title> seems to
                  register this new creative opportunity. Unlike the macabre <title level="m">Bank
                     Restriction Note</title>, Gillray shows that Restriction was actually a dynamic
                  explosion of paper energy. It is as if Gillray found the idea of unconvertible
                  paper currency irresistible, despite the print’s overt political attack on Pitt’s
                  policy. Another way to think about this apparent celebration of paper circulation
                  is to consider how Gillray innovated upon and modernized his satirical sources, so
                  that we understand more clearly how Gillray constructed Pitt/Midas’s bizarre
                  anatomy. The most immediate influence on his fantasy is the figure of the
                  political colossus. This was a well-honed satirical technique which became popular
                  with attacks on Britain’s first Prime Minister Robert Walpole (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure17.jpg">Figure 17</ref>) and quickly became a familiar
                  visual weapon with which to attack overweening ministerial ambitions such as those
                  of the Earl of Bute (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure18.jpg">Figure 18</ref>). Just a
                  few weeks before the introduction of Restriction, Gillray portrayed Pitt as a
                  colossus in <title level="m">The Giant Factotum Amusing Himself</title> (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure19.jpg">Figure 19</ref>), so the novelty of <title level="m">Midas</title> consisted of the change of venue (from parliament to
                  the Bank of England—a clear hint of the true source of the nation’s ills) and the
                  switch of satirical wit from bawdy pun (‘amusing himself’) to scatological
                  extroversion. For the latter effect, Gillray drew on another popular caricature
                  language in which politicians are depicted scatalogically if not always
                  gigantically. These prints visualize tyranny, patronage and sycophancy by showing
                  the powerful leader shitting or vomiting on hangers-on and suitors. The literary
                  sources of such earthy wit included Rabelais and Swift, but caricature could add
                  the unique extra frisson of visuality. Good examples include anti-Walpolian prints
                  such as <title level="m">The Political Vomit for the Ease of Britain</title> and
                     <title level="m">Idol Worship; or the Way to Preferment</title> (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure20.jpg">Figures 20</ref> and <ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure21.jpg">21</ref>) and James Aitken’s <title level="m">Public Credit, or the State Idol</title>—the latter shows Edmund Burke as the
                  arse-licker climbing the mired pole of preferment (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure22.jpg">Figure 22</ref>). Where Gillray innovates on
                  such sources is his remarkable ability to show Pitt/Midas vacating and ingesting
                  at the same time; metaphorically, this strange physiology registers the credit
                  system’s simultaneous mystification and demystification of paper. As the
                  transparent torso shows, this colossus is anatomically far more agile than his
                  scatological predecessors: he is both hoarding and secreting money, an apt image
                  of “convertibility.” This in itself is a considerable artistic achievement, but
                  Gillray goes one step further in his visual dexterity and allusiveness. </p>
                  <p>Another popular visual source for <title level="m">Midas</title> is the medieval
                  fantasy of the money devil, a diabolical yet faintly comic figure who exposes
                  greed and covetousness by raining coins onto people from all his orifices. The
                  genesis of this creature can be seen in Hieronymus Bosch’s <title level="m">Garden
                     of Earthly Delights</title>. Next to the so-called “Prince of Hell” (who sits
                  on a toilet-throne expelling people into a diabolical midden) there is a naked
                  rear end ejecting coins into the same pit, a clear association of lucre and
                  damnation. By the eighteenth century the money devil had become a familiar figure
                  in European and Russian caricatures, some of which Gillray may have known (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure23.jpg">Figure 23</ref>). In <title level="m">Midas</title>, however, the cluster of coins which appear to be dropping from
                  Pitt’s posterior like the money devil are actually defying the laws of gravity;
                  they are being sucked up into Pitt/Midas’s torso while banknotes (the new
                  ‘easing’) now perform the lavatorial function—a brilliant realization of the
                  “delusion” of convertibility. As Marc Shell notes, “many people in the
                  eighteenth-century were used to seeing depictions of a coin-covered money devil”
                  but “they were more puzzled by paper money than by coin, so they were especially
                  leery of the new paper money devil’s graphic powers of production, or poesis”
                  (67). Gillray’s genius lies in his ability to imagine this new “poesis” and make
                     <title level="m">Midas</title> a satirical tribute to “the new paper money
                  devil’s graphic powers of production” rather than to the print’s ostensible theme,
                  the “goodness of guineas” (Cobbett, 204). </p>
                  <p>This contradiction has a wider bearing on the fraught relations between
                  Romanticism and popularity. On the one hand, as already surmised, the loss of
                  “real” currency and the hike in forgery executions made many thinkers mistrustful
                  of the paper money system and for writers and artists these doubts may have
                  extended to the signifying power of “paper” more generally. Simon During describes
                  the post-Restriction mood for Romantic writers as a strange cocktail of
                  “fearfulness, unpredictability, opportunity and weightlessness” (339), perhaps
                  unintentionally echoing Adam Smith’s trope of credit’s perilous “Daedalian”
                  sublimity. Despite clinging to the secure “weight” of bullion, Romantic writers
                  were also impelled to explore new, relatively autonomous and self-authorizing
                  imaginative paradigms which could keep the vexed issue of the tainted paper
                  economy of print circulation and popularity at arm’s length. Though Shelley
                  ventured into Heavy Metal performances in his satires <title level="m">Oedipus
                     Tyrannus; Or Swellfoot the Tyrant</title> (which has a character called
                  “Banknotina”), <title level="m">Peter Bell the Third</title> (which characterises
                  paper money as expropriated bee-honey), and <title level="m">The Mask of
                     Anarchy</title> (which memorably styles the credit economy the “ghost of
                  gold”), such incursions into popular culture were rare.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Hogle, 236-9, Brantlinger 114-19. Significantly, none
                     of these texts was published in Shelley’s lifetime (<title level="m">Swellfoot</title> was published in 1820 but immediately suppressed), nor
                     was the “Philosophical View of Reform”, in which he expounded his critique of
                     credit at greatest length. For a discussion of Shelley’s currency radicalism,
                     which demanded the abolition of the national debt as a condition of returning
                     to the gold standard, see Connell, chapter 4.</note> On the other hand, radical
                  authors like Paine and Cobbett saw the teeming popularity of print circulation as
                  an opportunity for ideological subversion rather than state control. Despite all
                  the government’s efforts to suppress, regulate and neutralize radical writing in
                  the 1790s, Paine was still able to claim (with typical bravado) that Restriction
                  had been precipitated not by the alarm of a French invasion but by the panicky
                  response to cheap editions of his pamphlet <title level="m">Decline of the English
                     System of Finance</title> (Foner, 2: 1387-8). For Paine, cheap radical
                  literature operated like a phoney currency of economic espionage, overloading the
                  system to breaking point. Paper was a medium to be appropriated and carnivalized
                  rather than repressed, displaced or sublimated. When Cobbett asked his readers to
                  flood the market with fake banknotes, he recalled wryly that Pitt had considered
                  deluging France with fake assignats (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title>, 2 [21
                  October 1818], 658-9); <title level="j">Cobbett’s Weekly Political
                     Register</title>, 22 August 1818). Like Paine, Cobbett’s phenomenal success
                  cocked a snoop at the new paper economy from within its own ranks: <title level="m">Paper against Gold</title> sold around 150,000 copies, making it,
                  according to Spater, “probably the most widely read book ever written purely on
                  monetary questions” (1: 315). By converting currency into “imagination”, the
                  Restriction Act released its own critique and sowed the seed of its own
                  destruction.</p>

                  <head>The “formidable” caricaturist</head>
                  <p>But it was the caricaturists, above all, who could have their Restriction cake and
                  eat it: caricature thrived in a cultural environment in which the boundaries
                  between the “real” and the phoney or fake were being so sensationally and publicly
                  challenged, eroded, undermined and continually flouted. Caricature had a
                  productively contradictory relation to Restriction forgery. To begin with, Horace
                  Walpole’s oft-quoted comment that “all the house of forgery are relations” was
                  much truer of engravers than writers. Walpole made this comment to rebut
                  accusations that his rejection of Chatterton’s request for patronage had led to
                  the latter’s suicide, but he was not alone in seeing a slippage from literary to
                  financial forgery. Joseph Ritson, for example, remarked that “a man who will forge
                  a poem, a line or even a word will not hesitate, when the temptation is greater
                  and the impunity equal, to forge a note or steal a guinea” (Ruthven, 57-9). In
                  fact there was little if no evidence to support this claim, whereas there was
                  abundant evidence that engravers were playing both sides of the law. As noted
                  earlier, the state both relied on and feared the “formidable power of imitation”
                  of the engraver. Ironically, the Bank of England subjected all submitted designs
                  for “inimitable” banknotes to a counterfeiting test by its own engravers: not one
                  design passed the test.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The consensus was
                     that the new note should combine, in the words of the Society of Arts report
                     into Restriction forgery, the “highest perfection” of hand engraving with
                     “mathematical accuracy” of “engine engraving” (<title level="m">Report of the
                        Committee of the Society of Arts</title>, 10)—theoretically at least, this
                     fusion of high artistic standards and technological sophistication would put
                     the banknote beyond the reach and resources of the forger.</note> Equally
                  revealing is the fact that one of the eventual solutions to this problem, the use
                  of lithography, was first proposed by the well-known caricature print seller
                  Rudolph Ackermann, yet his suggestion was rejected as “a discovery as applied to
                  the subject of Forgery, infinitely more to be dreaded than encouraged” (cited in
                  Mackenzie, 61).</p>
                  <p>This takes us the second aspect of caricature’s cultural power. Ackermann
                  undoubtedly knew that the single print caricature functioned like an alternative
                  currency, shadowing and transforming “official” history.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Gary Dyer confirms that Regency caricature had a much
                     greater impact on “public perceptions” than literary satires (93).</note>
                  Moreover, society seemed to be imitating art. For critics of the unreformed
                  political system, Regency England had become a caricature of itself, consuming
                  rather than protecting its own children. No event showed this more clearly than
                  the Peterloo massacre of August 1819, an incident which lies at the heart of that
                  extraordinarily productive few years of Romantic literary output which James
                  Chandler (borrowing from Shelley) calls “England in 1819.” But what Chandler fails
                  to note is that these years also represent the crowning achievement of caricature.
                  It is surely no coincidence that the title page of Hone and Cruikshank”s
                  bestselling satire <title level="m">The Political House that Jack Built</title>
                  (1819) shows a pair of scales in which the pen of radicalism outweighs not just
                  Wellington’s sword but a bundle of unjust laws topped by “Bank Restriction” (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure24.jpg">Figure 24</ref>). The image implies that
                  radical critique is the antithesis of Old Corruption’s mystifications, but there
                  could also be an allusion to the <title level="m">Bank Restriction Note</title> of
                  earlier that year. In other words, Cruikshank could be complimenting his own
                  “formidable” imitation of the forged banknotes which (in Baines’ words) were
                  “naturally engendered” by the paper money system and which functioned as an emblem
                  or synecdoche of unreformed political and social structures. This ability to
                  satirically copy a discredited copy of a discredited copy (caricature—forged
                  banknote—original banknote) is a paradigm of the way caricature used its
                  distinctive “imagination” and the medium of paper to critique the “real.”</p>
                  <p>A third way in which caricature mimicked forgery was that the satirical copy had
                  to be sufficiently life-like so that public figures would be recognised. In
                  essence, this constituted a kind of identity theft in which counterfeit images
                  circulated in place of the original and without the original’s consent. Hone and
                  Cruikshank’s Duke of Wellington is simultaneously real and satirical, his
                  (modestly caricatured) visual identity determined by a few key features such as
                  the hook nose, oversize plumed hat and spurs. Ironically, many Georgian authority
                  figures were known to the public primarily through their caricature
                  representations (Charles James Fox would be the obvious example). As Gombrich and
                  Kris argue, graphic satire’s ability to steal an original identity and manufacture
                  phantom copies tapped into pre-Enlightenment superstitions about magical fetishes
                  which “annihilated” individuality. The reason why “portrait” or personalized
                  caricature appeared so late in history was not, they argue, due to the relaxing of
                  censorship; it has more to do with the secularization of society and the
                  desacralization of the image, its dissociation from actual necromancy. Once this
                  tendency merged with “political allegory”, the result was an explosive release of
                  anti-authoritarian visual aggression (14-17, 26-7). In Vic Gatrell’s words,
                  caricature was “a modernized form of an ancient effigy magic delivered against
                  otherwise unassailable enemies … [a] symbolic defilement anciently embedded in
                  ritual destructions of the defamatory image” (227). </p>
                  <p>Relatively untouched by legal prosecutions, unburdened by the aesthetics of
                  originality, masterful in creating allegorical fantasies of politics and culture,
                  firmly embedded in reportage and print culture, the single print caricature
                  circulated like a shadow economy of symbolic representation, pumping out “phantom”
                  versions of political leaders, authority figures and celebrities.<note place="foot" resp="editors">If Julie Carlson is correct to state that
                     Romantic celebrity was about “making a spectacle of one’s self” (503), then
                     caricature celebrity was about making a spectacle of a phantom other.</note>
                  Again, there is a useful parallel here with Marx’s theory of the quasi-divine,
                  transformative power of money which “turns real human and natural powers into
                  purely abstract representations, and therefore imperfections and tormenting
                  phantoms, just as it turns real imperfections and phantoms—truly impotent powers
                  which exist only in the individual’s fantasy—into real essential powers and
                  abilities” (378). Perhaps the final irony of the relationship between caricature
                  and forgery is that the restoration of “real value” in 1821 (which in practice
                  meant a return to convertibility and the abolition of the lethal £1 and £2 notes)
                  also marked the decline of the golden age of British caricature. After the success
                  of the campaign to support Queen Caroline, Cruikshank took a huge bribe from the
                  state and retired from the scene.</p>
                  <p>Paper money, on the other hand, continued to be a controversial issue beyond the
                  Romantic period. In 1830, for example, just two years before the abolition of the
                  death penalty for forgery, the Northamptonshire peasant poet John Clare grumbled
                  that: <quote>The Speculator is looking for a new paper currency which placed a
                     false value on every species of his traffic &amp; thereby enables the cunning
                     to cheat the honest…I would have every bank issuing one pound notes (which is
                     but a shadow of a promise for a substance which the promiser has pocketed)
                     dependent as Branch banks on the Bank of England. (To John Taylor (1 February
                     1830); Storey, 498-500)</quote> The influence of Cobbett over the next
                  generation of radicals who formed the Chartist movement kept the discourse of
                  ‘paper against gold’ alive. In Thomas Doubleday’s satire <title level="m">The
                     Political Pilgrim’s Progress</title> (1839), for example, the hero Radical’s
                  main adversary Political Apollyon is a demon composed of paper money (<ref target="/praxis/forgery/images/figure25.jpg">Figure 25</ref>). But given that forgery ceased
                  to be a capital offence in the early 1830s, the debunking of credit lost much of
                  its sensationalism.</p>
                  <p>To conclude: if Niall Ferguson is correct to say that “Money is not metal. It is
                  trust inscribed” (Ferguson, <title level="m">The Ascent of Money</title>, 29-30),
                  then the key issue remains: who, or what do you put your trust in? If, to quote a
                  popular ditty, “One forgery makes a felon –Millions a statesman!” perhaps you
                  would be wise to invest in caricature. </p>

                  <p>Forgery studies have developed rapidly in the past few years. No longer confined
                  to “fakelit”—the “original” literary forgeries of Chatterton, the controversies
                  surrounding Macpherson’s Ossian and W. H. Ireland’s Shakespeare, and the cultural
                  hoaxes of eighteenth-century antiquarianism—forgery has moved into such areas as
                  the law and character impersonation. The current work of Lionel Bently, as well as
                  that of Simon Stern, is, for example, scrutinizing notions of copying within the
                  legal frameworks of intellectual property and copyright legislation in the
                  eighteenth century, a field tackled in a different way by Richard Terry’s recent
                  book on literary accusations of plagiarism. Jack Lynch, meanwhile, has approached
                  the subject from the opposite perspective, focusing on the practice of detection.
                  In contrast, Margaret Russett, Debbie Lee, and others have focused attention on
                  the proliferation of impostors and fraudsters in the Romantic period.</p>
                  <p>The activities of these variously fraudulent writers and performers—these
                  “texts”—may have been hinted at in earlier work on forgery, but it is most
                  heartening to see it is now bearing rich fruit. And the papers collected here
                  reveal that, influenced in part by the work of Mary Poovey and Margot Finn,
                  another, significant area of forgery studies is emerging in literary finance and
                  forgery. These four essays all, in very different ways, examine the implications
                  that the anxieties and politics surrounding financial fraud had in the early part
                  of the nineteenth century.</p>
                  <p>It is notable that this work concentrates on the first two decades of the century.
                  As Ian Haywood argues, the Bank Restriction Act, which released the Bank of
                  England from issuing metal currency in exchange for paper banknotes, precipitated
                  a credit crisis that exposed “Britain’s system of paper money as tantamount to a
                  form of legalized counterfeiting”, with the result that the entire political
                  system risked becoming effectively a “fraud.” Restriction undermined the system of
                  credit, but it also led to a huge increase in the number of executions for
                  forgery. As Phil Handler puts it, these trials and hangings “provided a stark
                  public reminder of the evils of the paper system and the unreliability of Bank of
                  England notes.” They also galvanized opposition to the government’s financial
                  controls. As Alex Benchimol points out, radical publications such as <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> campaigned against forgery prosecutions.
                  Haywood’s interest here is in investigating the imaginative implications of
                  counterfeit banknotes, a fascinating link that could connect the whole project of
                  Romanticism with the credit crisis. Specifically in this essay, he examines the
                  figure and work of the engraver, demonstrating that “Romantic-period anxieties
                  about authenticity and value achieved a spectacular visual form in the
                  ‘formidable’ power of the caricaturist.” </p>
                  <p>There is perhaps a striking parallel for today’s readers to jokes made about the
                  recent Bank of England’s policy of “quantitative easing”, which has been compared
                  with counterfeiting—and also caricatured. <note resp="editors" place="foot">

                        apparently much older than the current crisis: <quote>
                              <p rend="noCount">It’s a slow day in a little Scottish town. The sun is
                              beating down, and the streets are deserted. Times are tough, everybody
                              is in debt, and everybody lives on credit. On this particular day a
                              rich tourist from down south is driving through town. He stops at the
                              motel and lays a £50 note on the desk saying he wants to inspect the
                              rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">As soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the
                              note and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">The butcher takes the £50 and runs down the street to
                              repay his debt to the pig farmer.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">The pig farmer takes the £50 and heads off to pay his
                              bill at the supplier of feed and fuel.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">The guy at the Farmer’s Co-op takes the £50 and runs to
                              pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard
                              times and has had to offer her “services” on credit.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">The hooker rushes to the hotel and pays off her room
                              bill with the hotel owner.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">The hotel proprietor then places the £50 back on the
                              counter so the rich traveller will not suspect anything.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">At that moment the traveller comes down the stairs,
                              picks up the £50 note, states that the rooms are not satisfactory,
                              pockets the money, and leaves town.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">No one produced anything. No one earned anything.</p>
                              <p rend="noCount">However, the whole town is now out of debt and now
                              looks to the future with a lot more optimism. </p>

                        </p>
                     </note> But the historical context is also compelling. Things had been very
                  different in the early eighteenth-century. As Thomas Levenson has shown, Sir Isaac
                  Newton’s innovations at the Royal Mint were designed to maintain the integrity of
                  the physical fact of the coin. It was Newton who pioneered the use of milled edges
                  to coins and the motto, “<foreign>decus et tutamen</foreign>” (“an ornament and a
                  safeguard”) to ensure that coins could not be clipped (it is also worth noting
                  that he attended the executions of coiners who fell foul of his minting
                  techniques). But over the course of the century the prevalence of paper money
                  eventually created a profoundly different economic environment. Paper was not
                  bullion—it had no inherent value. There were not even objective criteria for
                  determining what constituted an authentic note, and attempts to create a
                  forgery-proof banknote were a constant reminder of the threat of counterfeit
                  bills. Moreover, the persistent slippage between literary and financial forgery (a
                  slippage over the period that has been examined in detail by Paul Baines) meant
                  that the rhetoric of the economy was laced with the terminology of fiction. No
                  wonder it provided abundant raw materials for caricature.</p>
                  <p>The credit crisis (with its attendant language of forgery) also pervaded the
                  politics of the time. Benchimol himself considers the production, representation,
                  and circulation of radical knowledge to show that there was an explicit radical
                  campaign against the system of paper money. William Cobbett energetically exposed
                  the mystifications of the financial system, which, he argued, was spectral: it had
                  no bodily existence and paper money had merely imaginary value. The system was,
                  according to Cobbett, “profoundly immoral, unjust, and constructed upon an
                  unsustainable foundation of monetary abstractions.” His response was to outline a
                  mass campaign of active resistance. Cobbett argued that it was the act of
                     <emph>uttering</emph> (that is, passing as legal tender) forged paper bills
                  that brought the charge of forgery and led to the gallows; he therefore attacked
                  the circulation of paper money by proposing that forged notes be cast about in the
                  streets for anyone to pick up, unuttered.</p>
                  <p>This shift in forgery studies towards legal property and financial forgery also
                  offers opportunities to reconsider authenticity. In legal and financial areas the
                  definitions of forgery and counterfeit are conflated and wholly entangled, and
                  this informs recent work by Robert Hopkins, who argues that aesthetic meanings of
                  forgery should be governed by establishing artistic intentions, in essence
                  mimicking the legal definition of the crime of forgery. Yet it is clear that the
                  distinction between forgery as an “original” composition attributed to another,
                  and counterfeit as an exact copy of a pre-existent work remains a valuable
                  distinction—if only in aesthetics.</p>
                  <p>In one of two essays of literary criticism here, Robert Miles pursues the
                  relationship between aesthetics and economics by usefully arguing that forgery is
                  a “hinge” linking the two systems. Focusing on Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Emma</title>, he discovers that the “social imaginary” of the novel is wholly
                  underpinned by economic values: in particular, the endeavours to “realise” cash by
                  turning it into land and hence political influence. The internalization of such
                  values, brought about by the credit crisis and resulting boom-and-bust economy,
                  generates the conditions for the understanding of value and its circulation
                  throughout the text: Miles argues that Austen “through her economic interests …
                  finds a language for exploring a world where value is inescapably contingent.” </p>
                  <p>Miles’s earlier work on impostors encourages Alex Dick to analyse the figure of
                  the Byronic rogue Sir Gregor MacGregor as an impostor or fraudster inspired in
                  part by Walter Scott’s <title level="m">Waverley</title>. Scott’s money troubles
                  literally underwrote his work and obliged him to mortgage his future
                  writing—consequently readers should be on the alert whenever Scott describes the
                  economy. Dick argues that in Scotland, financial speculation was presented as the
                  solution to the problem of economic diversification, which neatly explains Scott’s
                  tendency in his fiction to present speculative economies as failing economies.
                  Dick’s work is also an important reminder that Scotland retained some degree of
                  economic autonomy compared with the rest of Great Britain (as it does to this
                  day)—an archipelagic perspective that enables Scott’s fiction to become an
                  “instrument of comparison” between different cultures.</p>
                  <p>These four essays therefore indicate some of the directions that this field may
                  take. There will be others: more work is needed for example on the Gold Standard
                  and the national debt (Haywood reveals that by 1821 it was 2.7 times the national
                  income), and it would be good to see legal historians, economic historians, and
                  literary historians work together to trace, for example, counterfeiting,
                  plagiarism, and the emergence of copyright through the eighteenth century and into
                  the nineteenth century. In the meantime, these studies afford a new opportunity to
                  reassess literary finance and forgery in the period.</p>

                  <p>In 1822, the Scottish adventurer Sir Gregor MacGregor issued a bond on the London
                  Stock Exchange to fund a British colony, Poyais, on the Mosquito Coast of Eastern
                  Central America. A veteran of the Peninsular campaign and the Bolivian War of
                  Independence—he was married to Simon de Bolivar’s sister—MacGregor told his
                  investors, mostly fellow Scots, that he had family connections to the Darien
                  expedition of the 1690s and the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. He even claimed to be
                  descended from Rob Roy MacGregor, who had been recently immortalized in a novel by
                  Walter Scott. A national infrastructure and civil service, he bragged, were
                  already waiting in Poyais for lawyers, bankers, and merchants. MacGregor raised
                  close to 200,000 pounds; the next year, three ships carrying 240 settlers crossed
                  the Atlantic. </p>
                  <p>By August, 180 of them were dead. The British press, always on the lookout for
                  charlatans, accused MacGregor for having summarily duped his investors. Poyais,
                  they said, was a fraud, a fiction, a country that didn’t exist. Interestingly,
                  most of the surviving settlers accused MacGregor’s agents and publicists, not
                  MacGregor himself, for spreading false information about the colony. But MacGregor
                  had already decamped to France. For the next fifteen years, he tried to sell his
                  Poyais scheme, at one point even penning a constitution, but he could not attract
                  any further investment. He moved to Venezuela in 1838 and died penniless in
                  1845.</p>
                  <p>Gregor MacGregor was one of many pseudo-aristocratic fraudsters whose stories
                  enliven historical accounts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century bubbles and
                  booms, from John Law’s Missisippi Scheme of 1720 to the Railway Bubble satirized
                  in Trollope’s <title level="m">The Way We Live Now</title> (1875).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Hasbrouk and Sinclair.</note> Recently,
                  however, historians of the Latin American and Caribbean independence movements
                  have reassessed the relationship between military heroism, financial investment,
                  and print culture to suggest that figures like MacGregor embody a complex mixture
                  of fact and fiction, force and fraud, tradition and temerity that underlies the
                  hybrid American identity (Brown). Likewise, literary scholars have argued that
                  forgery and fraud in the Romantic period can hardly be understood simply in terms
                  of a stark difference between fiction and fact; rather they must be treated as
                  evidence of a new kind of subjective and, indeed, aesthetic consciousness in which
                  truth and lies are always blurred.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On
                     literary forgery in the Romantic period see studies by Baines, Ruthven, Groom,
                     Mazzeo, and Russett. On monetary forgery and Romantic aesthetics see Dick,
                        <title level="a">The Ghost of Gold.</title>
                     </note> Studies as different in kind as Tom Mole’s <title level="m">Byron’s
                     Romantic Celebrity</title>, Robert Miles’ <title level="m">Romantic
                     Misfits</title>, and Margot Finn’s <title level="m">The Character of
                     Credit</title> underscore the shifting intersections between gothic heroism,
                  industrial print, personal debt, and media manipulation that constituted a new
                  kind of literary and cultural celebrity. In this perspective, MacGregor seems less
                  like a criminal and more like a Byronic hero.</p>
                  <p>The Waverley Novels, from which MacGregor drew some of his inspiration, also use
                  the historical mystique of a Scottish cultural tradition to manufacture a myth of
                  spectacular heroism to ground both the threat and the banality of Britain’s
                  speculative commerce. Following Burke, Ferguson, and other “conservative”
                  thinkers, Scott put monarchy at the centre of a pan-British
                     <foreign>bildung</foreign> to guarantee national unity and economic purpose.
                  The spectacle of the British monarchy was the standard—both literally and
                  figuratively speaking—for its speculative finance and trade economy. I use the
                  word “speculative” here in two senses: (1) as a synonym for “visual” in the sense
                  that the hero or monarch who guarantees an investment tends to be visible or at
                  least represented in highly iconographic terms; (2) to connote a sense of futurity
                  or wishfulness, thereby acknowledging that the ventures being guaranteed by the
                  hero or monarch are conjectural investments in a possible future. If these two
                  uses of the term seem contradictory, they are, and most especially as they are
                  used by Scott. Thus, to take a familiar example, in <title level="m">Waverley</title> the idea of a reclaimed Stuart monarchy is embodied in the
                  noble figure of Prince Charles, though his gambling and foolhardiness are also
                  indications of the “speculative” nature of the Jacobite campaign. Scott’s monarchs
                  are not absolutists. Bonnie Prince Charlie, Richard the Lionheart, and Charles II,
                  among other of Scott’s monarchs, are fallible and sympathetic, charismatic, but
                  often highly imaginative and, indeed, speculative. They often find themselves in
                  situations where their authority is in doubt and their identities insecure. But,
                  in the context of Scott’s historical romances, these qualities lend them the sheen
                  of realism. Monarchy is seen in Scott to be something imaginary and, indeed,
                  fictional (as it is in Burke) but nevertheless symbolically vital to the unity of
                  the nation. Scott’s brilliant fictionalizations of the monarch as someone that
                  understands the doubts and hesitations of his people, and falls into the same
                  errors and doubts, make its ghostly presence the symbolic earmark of a lost but
                  eminently valued historical tradition, one both ironic and redemptive.<note place="foot" resp="editors">My brief account of the economic subtext of
                     the Waverley Novels is drawn in part from several sources including (among
                     others) Burgess, Duncan, Gamer, Trumpener, Gottlieb, and Sutherland. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But something changed in the crisis of 1825. Scott was confronted with the
                  possibility that the “speculative” national and political identity he had
                  constructed for Scotland in his historical fictions and had linked in several of
                  them with Scotland’s vibrant paper money system—<title level="m">The
                     Antiquary,</title>
                     <title level="m">Rob Roy,</title>
                     <title level="m">The Fortunes of Nigel</title>—would be lost in an ocean of debts
                  and obligations under which both he and the nation found themselves. In the wake
                  of the 1825 crisis, Scott was exposed as a bankrupt and the Scottish financial
                  system, one of the most extensive in Europe, was charged with insolvency and
                  impracticability. The solution to the crash, which included the reformation of the
                  Scottish system, was not simply the institutionalization of a fixed standard of
                  value—that had actually existed in England for a decade already—but rather the
                  centralization or, in the language of the time, consolidation of British finance
                  under the auspices of a central but largely invisible authority: the Bank of
                  England. What is important about these reforms is that this central authority had
                  no symbolic or visual presence: with the introduction of branch and deposit
                  banking and by offering many, small alternatives for investment, the Bank of
                  England assumed a new authority by diversifying itself and its services into a
                  myriad of new exchange forms. In this way, the Bank succeeded where the London
                  Corresponding Society and the <title level="j">Political Register</title> had
                  failed in loosening the government’s grip on economic decisions, only this was not
                  in the service of social reform but rather of financial (and profitable)
                  centralization.</p>
                  <p>My argument is that much of Scott’s later writing can be interpreted as a response
                  to the process of financial consolidation through diversification. In several
                  works published in the years during and following his financial collapse,
                  including his most direct and sustained contribution to the debates about money,
                  authority, and standardization <title level="m">The Letters of Malachi
                     Malagrowther</title>, Scott would attempt to revive rhetorically a spectacular
                  standard of value. In my reading, “speculation” is not the problem which Scott and
                  other critics of the Bank of England were trying to solve. Rather speculation was
                  an alternative to the perceived consequences of financial diversification: that
                  is, the way that the end of the wartime economy and the breakdown of the old
                  monopoly trade networks produced a highly varied field of investment opportunities
                  all existing as free but interconnected network of values and units that made the
                  financial market almost impossible to conceive in humanistic or political terms.
                  My sense is that this attempt to revive an economics of spectacle, which Scott
                  writes into <title level="m">Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</title> succeeded as
                  a work of rhetorical polemic but failed as a work of monetary economics, in much
                  the same way that Gregor MacGregor’s efforts to fund a colony on the back of a
                  fictionalized heritage and military exploits both succeeded and failed to create a
                  nation called Poyais. But the <title level="m">Chronicles of the
                  Canongate</title>, the collection of connected short narratives that Scott wrote
                  in the aftermath of his own bankruptcy hearings and published in early 1827,
                  suggests a different tone and a new purpose for historical fiction in the wake of
                  the changes to the financial system precipitated by the 1825 crash. While many
                  critics appreciate the melancholia that pervades these stories and the authorial
                  narrative that connects them, I want to suggest that the dismay at the failure of
                  spectacular heroism which Scott documents in <title level="m">Chronicles</title>
                  also offered a new way to conceive of the relation between fiction and finance. In
                     <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title> recurrent episodes of
                  awkward or disturbed reading signal the failure of heroic specularity and mark a
                  new kind of aesthetic expression. </p>

                  <head>The Panic of 1825: Speculation or Diversification?</head>
                  <p>Throughout the 1820s, Scott’s publishers, Archibald Constable and James
                  Ballantyne, issued handsome advances to their authors. They hoped to generate a
                  culture of gentlemanly condescension and respect that would belie their
                  fundamentally commercial provenance (Eliot 94). In the meantime, through his
                  London agents, Constable had invested heavily in the Latin American mining boom.
                  By the end of 1825, caught in the tailspin of a financial bust, both houses were
                  in serious trouble. Their most coveted asset and heaviest backer, Walter Scott,
                  found himself in debt for more than 120,000 pounds. The following spring, in a
                  hearing at Chancery meant to preempt bankruptcy proceedings, the judges gave Scott
                  a choice: either sell Abbotsford or assign a sizeable proportion of the proceeds
                  for all forthcoming works to his creditors. Scott agreed to the latter. Scott’s
                  publishing interests were signed over to Robert Cadell, whom Scott regarded as a
                  middle-class upstart. </p>
                  <p>To fulfill his financial obligations, but also to stem the tide of depression,
                  Scott embarked on one his most productive periods: he completed a novel, <title level="m">Woodstock</title>, the 9-volume <title level="m">Life of
                     Napoleon</title>, a collection of stories, <emph>Chronicles of the
                     Canongate</emph>, the first volumes of his history of Scotland, <emph>Tales of
                     Grandfather</emph>, several essays and reviews, and, in a brazen act of
                  authorial truculence, the <emph>Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</emph>, an
                  impassioned defense of the Scottish credit and banking systems.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The letters were first published in <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Weekly Journal</title>, Feb 22, March 1, and March 8,

                  knew that he was working with literary gold. Plans were already afoot to republish
                  the complete Waverley series, the Magnum Opus. What connects these various
                  projects is their testimony to a change in Scott’s authorial appearance. No longer
                  mystified as a singular presence through the serial publication of individual
                  novels, Scott and the Author of Waverley were systematically and serially
                  “unbound” (to borrow a phrase from Benedict Anderson), that is spread through a
                  myriad of genres and venues, from the shortest note to the complete works that
                  never quite measure up to the totality they are meant to comprise. Rather than a
                  mysterious presence on which the reading public could speculate as it absorbed
                  each successive work in turn, Scott, his pseudonyms and personae, his editors and
                  his publishers, became pieces in a puzzle that never produced a coherent
                  image.</p>
                  <p>My interpretation of Scott’s late career is meant to suggest what happens to
                  Romanticism in the 1820s and especially in the wake of the financial crisis of
                  1825. This crisis of 1825 is generally thought of as a “speculative bubble,”
                  similar to earlier crises such as the South Sea Bubble of 1722. But there are
                  important differences. The South Sea bubble and the Mississippi Scheme were caused
                  by massive amounts of investment, much of it fraudulent, in monopoly “Adventuring”
                  companies. The 1825 panic was caused by neither delusory investment nor
                  imperialist autocracy but rather by a series of institutional adjustments that
                  helped turn Britain from a centralized war economy to a decentralized peace
                     economy.<note place="foot" resp="editors">My account of the 1825
                     financial panic is drawn largely from Neal with corrections from Bordo.</note>
                  What made these adjustments precarious was not speculation but diversification.
                  When the war against Napoleon ended, the decision was made in 1816 to adopt a
                  fully mono-metallic gold standard and begin the processes necessary to resume cash
                  payments. This could not happen until the Bank of England had accrued sufficient
                  cash reserves. But an immediate curtailing of loans and notes would have caused a
                  massive recession (which happened anyway, though for different reasons). The Bank
                  was compelled to balance the need to reduce the amount of credit in circulation
                  with the need to maintain commercial credit and sustain both the economy and its
                  own profits. They did this in several ways, none of them entirely honest. First,
                  they stockpiled a massive amount of gold (newly available from the continent) in
                  order to keep its price high and prevent its customers from cashing in their
                  notes. Then they withdrew a large number of notes from circulation that the
                  government had been relying on for various repayments. Then they refused to lower
                  discount rates to farmers and traders who had been adversely affected by the
                  post-war recession. Not surprisingly, the Bank and the government received a good
                  deal of negative press. But they received more criticism, notably from radicals
                  like Cobbett, for delaying the return to cash payments than for trying, albeit for
                  selfish motives, to slow its adverse effects.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Cobbett’s attacks on the Bank of England see Poovey, Gilmartin and
                     Alex Benchimol’s essay in this volume.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once convertibility was in place, the bank and the government had to maintain
                  their own solvency. Again, several tactics were employed. The government, which
                  had not only built up a massive amount of public debt during the war years but had
                  also, in a fit of post-war political fervor, eliminated the income tax that had
                  funded that debt in the first place, issued a series of new 3% consols—bonds sold
                  to investors on the proceeds of indentured aristocratic estates and other
                  government owned property—in an attempt to stimulate investment without direct
                  monetary controls.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a brief but
                     sufficient description of consols as an early and successful form of government
                     bonds see Ferguson, 76-85.</note> Similarly, the Bank of England did its utmost
                  to maintain consistent price levels by issuing low-yield, low-risk stocks at
                  reduced discounts. The East-India Company followed suit. As a result, brokers and
                  consumers had a range of investment choices, but this also meant that the prices
                  of each stock tended to fluctuate in a way that had not been seen during the war
                  years when all investment had been directed at a common goal. Two other factors
                  diversified the market further. First, the government introduced several
                  infrastructure initiatives: road works, ship-building, gas lighting, schools, and
                  the like. This in turn helped to stimulate new manufacture and trade and led to
                  the formation of new firms, funds, banks, and even insurance agencies in which the
                  public could invest. Second, the resumption of cash payments and the newly-won
                  political independence of several Latin American states threw open the market in
                  precious metals. Many of the major metropolitan banks invested heavily in these
                  mining ventures. The credit produced by them stimulated the domestic securities
                  market which in turn led to the opening of more joint stock companies and country
                  banks outside the capital. </p>
                  <p>Of course, there were charlatans and rapscallions among the mining and gasworks
                  companies: Gregor MacGregor was only the most notorious. Eventually, the amount of
                  cheap credit circulating through the market and the irregularities that the mining
                  industry seems inevitably to confront began to make investors uneasy. By the end
                  of 1825, there were bankruptcies and bank failures everywhere: some of the leading
                  London firms went under. But what is interesting about the financial “bubble” of
                  the early 1820s is that for the most part, and unlike the South Sea and Missisippi
                  bubbles of 100 years earlier, the economic activity was “real” rather than
                  fictitious, that is, the investment actually produced tangible, material results.
                  Indeed, the leading cause of the boom was the rush to invest in precious metals,
                  the very “real” thing that was—and is—often assumed to be the only correct
                  alternative to such fictitious schemes.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The
                     question of the “reality” of paper credit is, of course, controversial, though
                     economic and finance historians largely agree now that it has always been
                     credit rather than coin that has acted as the real medium of capital production
                     and exchange. </note> The real cause of the panic was not credit itself, but
                  its ready availability in small, diversified portions. On their own, each of these
                  investments represented a tangible moment of economic transaction—purchasing an
                  insurance policy, buying stock, or broking a loan—and all of them have real
                  economic intents and benefits. Collectively, however, these individual
                  transactions added up to far more activity than could be conceived within the
                  terms of a “national economy,” that is, the domestic foundation on which most
                  people based their confidence in the financial system.</p>
                  <p>When the bubble finally burst, the government and the Bank of England had no
                  option but to react in a seemingly tangible manner. The country already had a
                  convertible gold standard and, thanks to a sudden influx of metals from their
                  trusted agent, Nathan Rothschild, the Governors of the Bank of England did not
                  have to suspend cash payments (as they did in 1797) to prevent a bank run. But the
                  Governors of the Bank of England also decided to extend their note issues in 1826
                  as a way to slow down incidences of bankruptcy. To the Liverpool administration,
                  this was an alarming proposition because it entailed further increases in public
                  debt, which the government felt it could not sustain, economically or politically.
                  The source of the problem, the government contended, lay with smaller banks and
                  investment firms through which local credit was apparently being channeled into
                  diverse and uncharted investments. In January, 1826, the government made three
                  suggestions. First, the Bank of England would set up its own branches to replace
                  the smaller firms. Second, it would allow competition for government business from
                  other London firms within the metropolis. Third, they would finally extend the
                  gold standard to Scotland—where it had not been in effect before—as a way to
                  curtail the Scot’s dependence on paper money and thus their dangerous inclination
                  for financial adventure. The administration did not really believe that any of
                  these suggestions would be implemented, the first being very difficult, the second
                  being unwarrantable, and the third political suicide. </p>
                  <p>In the first instance, however, the Bank called the Prime Minister’s bluff and
                  proceeded to open branches around the country, leading eventually to the demise of
                  the country bank and independent note issues. Consequently, other London firms
                  increased their share of the financial market, since they no longer had direct
                  competition from country bankers. Rather than curtail investment, though, these
                  actions encouraged it in even more diversified ways thanks to the new practices of
                  deposit banking and credit facilitation that large and more secure banks,
                  including the Bank of England, could offer. This meant that at the same time as it
                  was diversifying so radically, the financial system also became more
                  centralized—though exactly where that central power lay was hard to discern. For a
                  single scheme, it is possible to cultivate a visible, intentional, symbolic
                  standard, something toward which the money promised can be balanced against: a
                  commodity to be produced, a service to be procured, a hero to found a colony. Even
                  in gigantic schemes like a war such symbols—king and country and all that —
                  usefully defray the fear and anxiety that accompanies massive debts. But when a
                  network of diversified investments exceeds the bounds of customary symbolic
                  associations, when the channels of these investments are controlled by a huge
                  consortium of competing interests, when the real value of money can no longer be
                  “seen,” where does it lie? What is its standard? These are the questions that
                  Scott asked in his responses to the panic of 1825. </p>

                  <p>Scott defended the Scottish banks on the essentially nationalist grounds that a
                  “diversity” of financial institutions will better serve the mixed British economy
                  than either an abstract principle of “uniformity” or “innovation.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">The historian N. T. Phillipson observed in
                     1968 that the <title level="m">Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</title>, which
                     Scott wrote to protest the incursion of centralizing English financial policy
                     on the Scottish “free banking system,” exemplify the general resentment
                     Scottish rural people and Edinburgh elites alike felt toward London’s various
                     attempts to integrate the bureaucracies of Scotland and England between 1780
                     and 1830, though ultimately, Phillipson concluded, like many such campaigns
                     Scott’s letters did little more than express an “ideology of noisy inaction”
                     (186). Caroline McCracken-Flesher in <title level="m">Possible
                        Scotlands</title> documents the wide support that Scott’s letters received,
                     even from those like Henry Dundas Lord Melville who had originally approved of
                     Parliament’s motion. Scott turned to his readers’ sense of their own
                     “otherness” to recharge Scottish nationalism with a new progressive sense of
                     its own difference within a changing British union. Those few scholars who have
                     examined these works in relation to his financial troubles have tended to do so
                     with an eye still trained firmly on the problem of Scottish national identity.
                     See also Colella. </note> His ground for such a claim was essentially
                  nationalistic. “For God’s sake,” Scott declared, “let us remain as Nature made us,
                  Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen, with something like the impress of our
                  several countries upon each! We could not become better subjects…if we all
                  resembled each other like so many smooth shillings!” (373). Via such contentions,
                  the attempt to bring the gold standard to Scotland is thus easily interpreted as
                  an act of rank imperialism and its failure a triumph of the Scottish anti-colonial
                  spirit; as Silvana Colella points out, “the banks present a specifically Scottish
                  alternative to the English search for uniformity . . . . Diversity rather than
                  uniformity is, in fact, the distinguishing feature of the Scottish monetary
                  system” (58). Beyond national autonomy, though, Scott also committed himself to a
                     <emph>speculative</emph> system based on local trust or “confidence” as opposed
                  to a consolidated system based on diversified, mathematical equivalence. Because
                  its relatively small population and rugged geography prevented the easy transport
                  of metallic currencies, Scotland had little in the way of metallic reserves,
                  relying instead on locally-issued paper credit. This credit was kept afloat by the
                  combination of private diligence and public accountability. To English charges
                  that Scottish banks were financially suspect because they did not rely on reserves
                  of precious metals, Scott answered that the security of the Scottish banking
                  system is based on a form of public accountability, “the watchful superintendence
                  of the whole profession being extended to the strength and weakness of the general
                  system at each particular point; or, in other words, to the management of each
                  individual Company” (336). The mechanism of this security is publication: “every
                  Bank throughout Scotland is obliged to submit its circulation, twice a-week in
                  Edinburgh, to the inspection of the Argus-eyed tribunal“ (337). The Scottish
                  banking system is a “republic” and “the public have, in this manner, the best
                  possible guarantee against rash and ill-concocted speculations, from those who are
                  not only best informed on the subject, but, being most interested in examining
                  each new project of the kind, are least likely to be betrayed intro a rash
                  confidence, and have the power of preventing a doubtful undertaking at the very
                  outset” (337). Scott models his idea of the “republic” of Scottish finance on the
                  model of the sociable public sphere of the Scottish Enlightenment republic of
                  letters. The English “seized with a jealous tenacious, wrangling, overbearing
                  humour” intended to undermine the very Enlightenment principles, Scottish of
                  course, which had brought Britain its economic power in the first place. “We cease
                  at once to be the Northern Athenians… we have become the caterpillars of the
                  island instead of its pillars” (361). In letter three, Scott invents an English
                  rival, Christopher Chrysal, who defends the English system on a decidedly
                  irrational love for gold. This is why Scott can give Scottish banking the somewhat
                  paradoxical epithet of “practical system.” It is a system, to be sure, but it is
                  one that embodies the dynamics of real practice and not the enthusiasms of theory.
                  As a system, then, Scottish financial practicality is something to be admired, a
                  mark or “impress” (as I quoted early) of their national spirit. </p>
                  <p>The association of Scottish bankers and “the Northern Athenians” points to a
                  speculative strain of early nineteenth-century Scottish economic thought. This is
                  not the political economy of Ricardo and McCulloch that “rose” in the period just
                  prior to the 1825 crash, and strongly influenced the policy decisions made after
                  it, but a conservative economics that looked to the country estate rather than the
                  trading house for its guarantees against “rashness.” For what scholars of this
                  period often overlook is that the field we call “political economy” consisted of a
                  wide variety of doctrines and perspectives; these differences, moreover, had a
                  profound influence on the ways money was used and defined during the 1810s and
                  1820s. The root of this branching tree of monetary positions, surprisingly, is
                  Adam Smith’s <title level="m">Wealth of Nations</title> (1776). Smith actually
                  offers two quite distinct theories of money. The first, in Book I, chapter 4,
                     <title level="a">Of the Origin and Use of Money,</title> cribbed from Francis
                  Hutcheson’s <title level="m">System of Moral Philosophy</title>, uses classical
                  history and legal arguments to suggest that the value of money lies not only in
                  the scarcity and utility of precious metals but, more importantly, in the “virtue”
                  of those governments that have been able to keep the inherent value that results
                  from the scarcity pure (2.53-64). This historical aesthetics was given pride of
                  place by Dugald Stewart in his lectures on political economy at the University of
                  Edinburgh and then disseminated throughout England by his students Francis Horner,
                  Henry Brougham, James Mackintosh, and James Mill in several articles in the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>. Smith’s second chapter on money, in Book
                  II, chapter 2, <title level="a">Of Money Considered as a particular Branch of the
                     general Stock of the Society</title> is a much more technical description of
                  the way money circulates in relation to other forms of capital. It is here that
                  Smith warns that an extensive paper money system was only so many “wagons in air”
                  borne by “Daedalian wings.” Smith argued here that the most effective way of
                  regulating paper credit is not to associate it with unadulterated coin, but to
                  limit it to small communities in which the various borrowers and lenders are
                  already known to each other and to terms of short, manageable durations: the
                  so-called “Real Bills Doctrine.” By contrast to the defense of gold, this more
                  nuanced defense of paper credit was appropriated by financial experts and bankers
                  to give some credence to their actions during the wartime financial crash—most
                  notably the continuation of the suspension of cash payments—though by and large
                  they appealed to practical expediency more often than they did philosophical
                  precedent. </p>
                  <p>The “bullion controversy,” the pamphlet war debating the link between the market
                  price of gold and the amount of banknotes in circulation that took place between
                  1809 and 1812, was a contest between those who appealed to Smith’s classical
                  theory of value and those who looked to his modern account of paper credit. But
                  after the war, there was a shift in the intellectual valence of this debate.
                  Smith’s historical account of the gold standard gave way to David Ricardo’s
                  argument in his <title level="m">Principles of Political Economy and
                     Taxation</title> (1817) that money does not need a standard of value. The ebb
                  and flow of commodities and exchange is all the market needs. For Ricardo,
                  exchange value was determined only by market forces and had nothing to do with
                  utility. Corn, which had held pride of place as the most useful commodity
                  available, was valuable only to the extent of its supply or demand. Labour, the
                  ultimate source of value, was marginal to the exchange value of the commodities
                  produced by it. For Ricardo and his followers—notably J. R. McCulloch who
                  popularized Ricardo’s ideas in the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> and
                  elsewhere—the economy had no symbolic guarantees, no inherent values. It was a
                  diverse field of competing interests and, for the first time, classes:
                  agriculturalists vs. merchants vs. labourers. And it was this model of economic
                  diversity that drove the consolidation of economic policy after the crisis of
                  1825. </p>
                  <p>In response to these developments, conservative critics complained that economy
                  was loquacious, impenetrable, and ultimately self-serving on one hand and built on
                  little more than pure self-interest on the other. <note place="foot" resp="editors">As Peacock pithily remarked, it was “the real art of
                     talking about the imaginary art of teaching every man his own business” (321).
                     Many of these conservative attacks came from Scotland. Writing in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> in 1824, the conservative critic and
                     philosopher John Wilson claimed that “political economy cannot be studied with
                     advantage and satisfaction in the modern writers on the subject, by any person
                     who wishes to be convinced of the soundness of its first principles;—who
                     expects perspicacity, consistency, and accurate reasoning in the deductions
                     from these principles, or to find them applicable to, and explanatory of what
                     is occurring, or sure guides in the advancement and acquisition of social
                     wealth” because it is so replete with “obscurity, contradiction, and ambiguity
                     in the use of words [and] illogicalness in reasoning.” </note> But behind these
                  complaints, many of them Scottish in origin, lay a counter-model of economic
                  organization. Agriculturalists like Sir John Sinclair and Lord Lansdowne argued in
                  pamphlet after pamphlet that the benevolent state, modeled on the manor, should
                  control the economy paternalistically. The guarantee of this control was the
                  managerial acumen and moral fiber of the benevolent landowner. Many were prepared
                  to accept Ricardo’s practical account of how the market economy worked, though
                  they refuted his claim that capitalism was the only possible basis for the idea of
                  economic or, more to the point, social value. In an 1817 issue of <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>, for instance, John Gibson Lockhart wrote a positive
                  review of Ricardo’s <title level="m">Principles</title>. But he followed it with a
                  blistering attack on McCulloch’s claim that Ricardo had proven that the various
                  classes of society exist in a state of perpetual antagonism. “If political
                  economists chuse to depart from the common use of language,” Lockhart wrote, to
                  label the relations between classes “a perpetual opposition of interests, and,
                  consequently, a state of perpetual hostility, let them have the consistency to
                  call it a <emph>general</emph> opposition of interests; and let the rest of
                  mankind admit that, if in one sense they be mutual enemies, in a more
                  comprehensive view of the matter, they are mutual friends and cannot do without
                  one another.” This contention leads Lockhart to compare the benefits of landed
                  property and inherited wealth against the cut-throat competitiveness of the
                  Ricardian marketplace: <quote>a rich man, like a watering-pan in the hands of
                     Providence, serves to diffuse more generally and usefully the means of
                     subsistence while the envious absurdity of the human heart grudges even
                     existence to that which feeds it! As if the flesh of our bodies should rise, in
                     unhallowed insurrection, against the heart. All would be watering-pans, all
                     would be hearts; but this is not the order of nature nor of Providence, which
                     must ultimately prevail. After derangement shall be succeeded by derangement,
                     and revolution to revolution—after having exhausted all the forms of madness of
                     misery, of murder, and of blood, it is only by returning to the order and
                     subordination of nature, that wretched and weary mortals can escape from
                     anarchy and despotism, and expect to find, if not happiness, at least safety
                     and repose. (59)</quote> In one way, this is a paternalist argument in which
                  the landlord extends the means of subsistence to those he deems worthy and in the
                  interest of his own public standing. But the diction of this passage also points
                  to a moral claim that once the competitive marketplace collapses, a “natural”
                  hierarchical order will return. Lockhart’s economics is speculative: conjectural,
                  yes, but also dedicated to manifest symbolic values. </p>
                  <p>Temperamentally, Scott sympathized with Sinclair, Lockhart, and other conservative
                  critics: the true standard of value lay in the symbolic order of the country
                     estate.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Lockhart is performing a fairly
                     standard conservative turn on the stadial theory of history, extending it
                     toward redemption from the rather fraught present as described by Ferguson.
                     Scott recounted a similar scheme in a chapter entitled <title level="a">The
                        Progress of Civilized Society</title> that opened the second series of
                        <title level="m">Tales of a Grandfather</title> (1828). For more see my
                        <title level="a">Scott and Political Economy</title> in <title level="m">The
                        Edinburgh Companion to Walter Scott</title>. </note> Indeed, my sense is
                  that Scott’s description of Scottish banking in the <title level="m">Letters of
                     Malachi Malagrowther</title> comes directly from this Blackwoodian branch of
                  conservative economic thought, the roots of which lie in the same Smithian
                  economics as the Ricardian’s branch. To be sure, Scott was conscious of his own
                  dependence on “speculation”—the flow of capital that sold his books—that he never
                  endorsed outright his contemporaries’ more extreme paternalism. But his admiration
                  for the practical “republic” and “tribunals” of Scottish finance, based like
                  Lockhart’s “nature” on the traditional confidence of the country estate, at times
                  led Scott, as it did Wilson, Lockhart, and others, toward a more affective, even
                  violent defense. Several times in the letters, Scott hints that the Scots might
                  take up arms to defend their financial liberty, such as the moment when he alludes
                  to the magically-numbered “45” Scottish members of Parliament or refers to the
                  government as “the enemy.” Initially, Scott claims that the “body politic” in
                  Scotland is healthy and thus is in no need of “physic” as the English quack
                  economists seem to think. By the third letter, that same body is being encouraged
                  to lift the blazon for the “auld cause.” Scott’s respondents, including John
                  Wilson Croker, writing in the character of “Edward Bradwardine” disparagingly
                  pointed out the allusions to cudgels and regiments and the lost 45. Respondents
                  were also quick to point out that suspension of cash payments and the credit
                  system it endorsed were instituted and maintained largely for the symbolic purpose
                  of fighting a patriotic war. In <title level="m">Familiar Epistles</title> Daniel
                  Dreadnaught denounced Scott’s argument on precisely these anti-Jacobite grounds.
                  “I abominate the system,” he proclaimed, “which has heaped countless injuries on
                  my country, for the navigation of a river with which she had nothing to do; for
                  the restoration of an old man, about whose concerns we ought to have been
                  regardless, and for the possession of a barren rock!” (11).</p>
                  <p>Scott was conscious of these dangers. In a letter to Croker written sometime after
                  the Malagrowther skirmish was over, Scott explained what this rhetoric was meant
                  to accomplish. “Scotland, completely liberalized,” Scott wrote, <quote>will be the
                     most dangerous neighbour to England that she has been since 1639. There is yet
                     time to make a stand, for there is yet a great deal of good and genuine feeling
                     in the country. But if you <emph>unscotch</emph> us you will find us damned
                     mischievous Englishmen. The restless and yet laborious and constantly watchful
                     character of the people, their desire for speculation in politics or any thing
                     else, only restrained by some proud feelings about their own country, now
                     become antiquated and which late measure will tend much to destroy, will make
                     them, under a wrong direction, the most formidable revolutionists who ever took
                     the field of innovation. (qtd. in Croker 3: 318)</quote> Scott’s used of the
                  term “antiquated” is critical here.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                     OED attributes this use of the term “antiquate” to two sources, an <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> article of 1821 and a letter from Scott
                     to Lockhart, 1823.</note> As Susan Manning observes, late eighteenth-century
                  antiquarians’ “investment in the immediate pleasures of the particular, without
                  investigation or sublimation of that pleasure, made them vulnerable, in the
                  cultural currency of the eighteenth century not only of incivility but of
                  ‘enthusiasm’, defined as [the] incapacity to link things with thoughts” (63). In a
                  similar way, the “speculative” but “watchful character” of the Scots—the very
                  character that makes their paper credit work—would become an object of antiquarian
                  “investment” or Jacobite nostalgia once outlawed by English policy. Within Scott’s
                  argument on behalf of the confident “republic” of Scottish banking, then, there
                  lies a fiercer, almost overwrought attachment to the symbolic value of Scottish
                  banks as <emph>Scottish</emph>, a commitment with the potential to undermine the
                  confidence, trust, and social stability of the Scottish economy that Scott
                  suggested was its national character. In the final section of this paper, I will
                  argue that this complex array of commitments, sentiments, and misgivings is the
                  thematic crux of <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>. </p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I have been arguing that <title level="m">The Letters of Malachi
                     Malagrowther</title> represent Scott’s attempt to revive an economy of
                  speculation, in the sense of both the unbacked credit system it defends and the
                  spectacular or iconic confidence that it rhetorically conveys, in the face of its
                  loss to the faceless powers of “innovation” and centralized diversification. Many
                  of the fictional and historical works that Scott wrote in the years following the
                  publication of the <title level="m">Letters</title> project that same hoped-for
                  revival. <title level="m">Woodstock</title>, for instance, which Scott began in
                  Autumn 1825 and published in May 1826, concerns Charles II’s escape from the
                  Battle of Woodstock just prior to his flight to France by way of the “Royal Oak”
                  in which it is said he hid. In Scott’s novelization, the Oak is on the Estate of
                  Sir Henry Everard, whose family is divided between Royalist and Parliamentarian
                  sympathies and much of the novel concerns Charles’ various attempts to hide from
                  Cromwell and his proselytizing minions and convince the Everard family of his
                  virtue. He succeeds, and the closing tableau of the novel, set on the day of his
                  Coronation in 1660, might be seen as a testament to Scott’s belief in the power of
                  enlightened monarchy—or at least his hope in its possible revival. </p>
                  <p>But by the time he began <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>, in
                  mid-1826, much of this renewed confidence had receded to be replaced by its very
                  opposite quality, the perplexity or “embarrassment” that Ricardo had warned
                  against. Not a novel per se but a compendium of linked stories, <title level="m">Chronicles</title> is already moving away from the hopefulness of <title level="m">Woodstock</title> and the other romances and toward a darker, more
                  fragmented sense of the end of speculative confidence in the face of financial
                  diversification. The frame narrative, which is about Chrystal Croftangry, the last
                  in a line of Scottish landowners who, having squandered the family fortunes,
                  returns to Edinburgh to set up as an antiques dealer, is in itself a quite
                  fully-realized statement of Scott’s misgivings about the possibility of national
                  or Romantic revival. But I want to focus here on what I will describe as a pattern
                  of deliberate misreading in the three stories that make up the <title level="m">Chronicle</title> all of which point to the failure of the speculative economy
                  that Scott had tried to resurrect. The violent consequences of “antiquing” as
                  Scott warns in his letter to Croker, is the basic theme of the first two stories
                  in <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>. <title level="a">The
                     Highland Widow</title> is the story of Elspeth, wife of the Highland outlaw
                  Hamish McTavish, killed while garrisoned by the English after Culloden, and her
                  son, also Hamish, who refuses to become an outlaw like his father and joins a
                  Scottish regiment to fight in America. When Hamish visits his mother before he is
                  due to depart, she drugs him and, having exceeded his furlough, shoots a sergeant
                  who had come to apprehend him, is taken prisoner, court-martialed, and shot.
                  Elspeth is the literal embodiment of “antiquated” feelings, but more than that she
                  also represents the need to make a symbolic or speculative understanding of life,
                  including money, meaningful at a time when such efforts are overshadowed by modern
                  exchange practices. In a memorable scene, Hamish sends his mother a 5-guinea coin,
                  the proceeds from his enlistment in the Highland regiment; she “remained gazing on
                  the money as if the impress of the coin could have conveyed information how it was
                  procured” (82). Re-employing the metaphor of impression that, in the first
                  Malagrowther letter, Scott had used to define both the national feeling behind the
                  distinct cohesiveness of Scottish banking and its grounding in Scottish empirical
                  philosophy, Scott has Elspeth deliberately fail to read the coin and misunderstand
                  its now strictly economic function. For Scott, coins, like the monarchs whose
                  faces are imprinted on them, have both symbolic value and financial value as
                  guarantees of the vitality of the nation. But to Elspeth, whose whole world is
                  appreciable <emph>only</emph> as a series of meaningful icons, the systemic
                  “meaning” of coins as instruments of fluid exchange makes no sense. </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">The Two Drovers</title> is a complex tale about a Highland
                  cattleman, Robin Oig, and his sometime English friend, also a cowman, Harry
                  Wakefield. Having made their way to Cumberland, Oig and Wakefield unfortunately
                  negotiate respectively with the squire and the bailiff for the same pasture. When
                  the two arrive at the local alehouse, Wakefield is egged on by his fellow
                  Englishman to challenge Oig, who initially refuses to fight, but then when
                  provoked, stabs Wakefield with his dirk, which he had been keeping in trust for a
                  lowland drover. Again, feelings and sensations become focused on an object which
                  then becomes the means of a proto-revolutionary murder. The crisis at the heart of
                  the “Two Drovers” is the substitution of Oig’s economy of trust and honour with an
                  economy of omnipresent though invisible reason. The presiding judge at Oig’s trial
                  offers this general assessment of what <emph>should have</emph> happened:
                     <quote>The first object of civilization is to place the general protection of
                     the law, especially administered, in the room of the wild justice, which every

                     strength of his arm. The law says to the subjects, with a voice only inferior
                     to that of the Deity, “Vengeance is mine.” The instant there is time for
                     passion to cool, and reason to interpose, an injured party must become aware,
                     that the law assumes the exclusive cognizance of the right and wrong betwixt
                     the parties, and opposes her inviolable buckler to every attempt of the private
                     party to right itself. (146)</quote> What I want to stress here is Scott’s
                  sense that law can also become the “buckler” of retribution. This is a clear case
                  of what Foucault called a disciplinary process: a law-abiding “subject” is created
                  out of an external injunction to suppress certain feelings of desire or
                  self-identification. Through education people are taught to respect civility. But
                  if they transgress that civility the law “antiquates” into its archaic violent
                  form. The relationship between law and subject also changes from one based on
                  mutual respect to one based on affective responses and overt domination. The
                  danger of any symbolic system, no matter how rational or unifying it may be, is
                  that it has the potential to become violent, especially for the sake of its
                  coherence.</p>
                  <p>Similar complexities surround Richard Middlemas, the ambitious anti-hero of <title level="a">The Surgeon’s Daughter.</title> The longest of the three tales,
                  really a novella in its own right, <title level="a">The Surgeon’s Daughter</title>
                  tells the story of Menie Gray, daughter of the Selkirk doctor, Gideon Gray, and
                  the rivals for her hand, the doctor’s two students, Adam Hartley and Richard
                  Middlemas, the latter the ward of Dr. Gray. Famous for its setting in colonial
                  India (a setting in which not one but <emph>two</emph> colonial British armies
                  operate, the regulars and the East India Company’s, the latter to which both
                  Middlemas and General Tresham/Witherington belong), most of the story focuses on
                  the circumstances and consequences of Middlemas’ birth. His parents, we eventually
                  learn, are the eloping General, then only a captain, who is also both a Jacobite
                  and a Catholic, and the daughter of a wealthy Portugese-Jewish merchant who pays
                  Middlemas’ adopted Highland guardian, Dr. Gray, for his upkeep without any regard
                  or fondness. Middlemas’ claim in early-adolescence that he is a “free-born
                  Englishman” is ironic not only because he in conventional terms anything but, but
                  also because his lineage acts to demonstrate just how fetishistic such national
                  designations are becoming in an increasingly global economy. </p>
                  <p>Scott’s financial metaphors focus on the interplay between the economics of
                  exchange and the affective power of persuasion and (self-) love. The scene in
                  which Middlemas confronts his parents is a parody of similar scenes of familial
                  recognition, such as, for instance, at the end of Burney’s <title level="m">Evelina</title>. In Scott’s take, instead of “seeing” his parents as the
                  fulfillment of his ambition to discover his “true” identity, Middlemas abjects
                  them: “O, my more than father… how much greater a debt do I owe to you than to the
                  unnatural parents, who brought me into this world by their sin, and deserted me
                  through their cruelty!” (231). The result of this ignorant declaration is complete
                  confusion: Zilia dies after bashing out a discordant lament on the harpsichord
                  while the General forces his son to “look upon [his] parents who [he] hast so much
                  envied—whom thou hast so often cursed. Look at that pale emaciated form, a figure
                  of wax, rather than flesh and blood—that is thy mother—that is, the unhappy Zilia
                  de Moncada, to whom thy birth was the source of shame and misery, and to whom thy
                  ill-omened presence hath now brought death itself” (232). He then rages into a
                  fury and threatens to kill his other children. The General’s, Zilia’s, and
                  Middlemas’ understanding of themselves are revealed in this moment not to be
                  ratified by a hidden bond, but rather by their individual miscomprehension of
                  their systematic existences. Once set into contention by the exposure of this
                  system, the organization breaks down. </p>
                  <p>The tragedy, then, is that the standard of value that might underlie the
                  characters’ attempts to vindicate themselves before the others or serve as a
                  possible point of comparison between them has been replaced by a new standard of
                  systemic inevitability, much as the symbolic standards trusted by Oig are replaced
                  at the end of the story by the “buckler” of the law. Not even Hartley and Menie
                  Grey can withstand the “agitation” and “shock” of the events of their story:
                  Hartley dies of a colonial disease two years later and Menie refuses to marry
                  probably in memory of Hartley but also in her continual irrational devotion to
                  Richard. Once again affection undermines security. This is not to say that the
                  novella does not <emph>suppose</emph> a standard, that is, of fetishistic glamour
                  of wealth and adventure such as is presented to Richard Middlemas by his credulous
                  Nurse and Tom Hilary. But at the same time, it also presents to us the way in
                  which these fantasies circulate as, in a word, systems and by extension, empires.
                  As Tara Ghoshal Wallace observes, it is “such instances of the reality of imperial
                  fantasies that constructs the imperial identity” (322). The trouble is, it is not
                  the imperial fantasy that wins, but rather the ebb and flow of a diversified
                  global capitalism. </p>
                  <p>Yet, I would also venture to suggest that <title level="a">The Surgeon’s
                     Daughter</title> provides a different kind of standard to <emph>both</emph> the
                  “fantasy” of glory that Scott associates with empire <emph>and</emph> the systemic
                  intransigence of finance. In a strange scene, Hartley and Menie are on their way
                  into the interior of India when they come upon the near-lifeless body of Sadhu
                  Sing and hear the story of how his bride was taken from him on their wedding day
                  by a tiger. Via Hartley, the narrator makes the rather facile analogy between this
                  story and “the probable fate of [Menie] almost within the grasp of a more
                  formidable tiger than that whose skeleton lay beside Sadhu Sing” (271), the Indian
                  Prince for whom Middlemas fought and whose wedding is disrupted by a tiger attack.
                  But Scott also makes us aware that a comparison between these two marriages is
                     <emph>possible</emph>: at the creek in the jungle, “the travelers stopped to
                  drink, and to refresh themselves and their horses; and it was near this spot that
                  Hartley saw a sight which forced him to compare the subject which engrossed his
                  own thoughts, with the distress that had afflicted another” (270). Scott is here
                  projecting a frame of reference outside the narrative that will be able to bring
                  the two “systems” of the story—the British and the Indian—into a hybrid
                  construction. They are not the same, as the narrative makes clear, for Menie’s
                  fate is <emph>not</emph> that of Sing’s bride, any more than Scottish farms
                  cultivated by free credit (as Scott describes in the <title level="m">Letters of
                     Malachi Malagrowther</title>) are the same as the “impenetrable thicket” that
                  the plain has become once war has “suspended the labours of industry” (270). The
                  end of the tale offers not a speculative vision of imperial or financial unity
                  that might regulate or oppose the flow of finance, but rather an opportunity to
                  view both the failure of speculation and the consolidation of capital flow as
                  parts of a constellated object of a critical and comparative judgment, to see
                  them, that is, <emph>as</emph> the “thicket” that they really are once the
                  “labours” and “industry” of narrative are over. </p>
                  <p>In this way, <title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>, provides a
                  standard of comparison through which various cultures can be measured against each
                  other—Britain and India, Scotland and England, The Highlands and India—which is
                  apparent, in a way that the consolidated standard of financial diversification is
                     <emph>not</emph>, in the tensions and contradictions of literary form. This is
                  not the same thing as saying that Scott invents an imperial ideology, for there is
                  no specific imperial agenda associated with the standard of comparison as such.
                  The novel neither represents a standard (on the contrary all its speculative,
                  monarchical figures are either absent, corrupt, or destroyed) nor embodies a
                  particular economic system (as the <title level="m">Letters</title> had done).
                  Rather, the text itself, viewed as a collective whole, is an effect of the
                  continual comparisons between different economic and cultural systems, manifest in
                  the antiquarian tendencies of Croftangry and in the process of reading that he and
                  other collectors in the frame narrative exemplify. By contrast to his polemical
                  writings, Scott’s fiction allows us to recognize the conflicts and unevenness of
                  the economic field by staging their de-consolidation. In this respect, while the
                  Waverley Novels might be partly responsible for popularizing and acclimatizing the
                  “heroism” of capitalism’s entrepreneurial spirit, they can also be seen to
                  foreshadow the kinds of formal and logical critiques of capitalism, both
                  conservative and radical, that would emerge in the nineteenth century and after.

               <p>Reviewing Austen’s <title level="m">Emma</title> Walter Scott sums up the denouement
               like this: <quote>Mr. Woodhouse’s objections to the marriage of his daughter are
                  overpowered by the fears of housebreakers, and the comfort which he hopes to
                  derive from having a stout son-in-law resident in the family; and the facile
                  affections of Harriet Smith are transferred, like a bank bill by indorsation, to
                  her former suitor, the honest farmer, who had obtained a favourable opportunity of
                  renewing his addresses.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Walter Scott, Review of <title level="m">Emma</title>, in Southam, 70. </note>
                  </quote> Scott’s financial metaphor is deeply apt. In Emma’s speculative imagination,
               Harriet Smith is the illegitimate offspring of aristocratic, Whig capital, of
               “nobility or wealth,”<note resp="editors" place="foot">Austen,
                     <title level="m">Emma</title>, 404. Subsequent references are cited
                  parenthetically in the text. </note> rather than what she proves to be, the
               natural daughter of a modest “tradesman” (403). Harriet’s history is introduced
               through what the reader will come to realize is free indirect discourse: “Harriet
               Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed her, several years
               back, at Mrs. Goddard’s school, and somebody had lately raised her from the condition
               of scholar to that of parlour-boarder” (68). Somebody, or a nobody: the antithetical
               possibilities vary as we imagine the voice Emma’s, or Knightley’s, or, indeed,
               Emma’s, retrospectively, once chastened by experience. In the interim Harriet
               circulates like a bank bill whose questionable legitimacy is deepened by the facility
               of her transference. I shall be arguing that the financial metaphors that pervade
                  <title level="m">Emma</title>, including the one perceptively noted by Scott, are
               not a fortuitous aspect of the novel, but a product of forces that may be said to be
               constitutive of Romanticism itself. My argument is based on the following thesis: the
               conceptual field in which forgery finds itself placed is not Romanticism’s repressed
               secret but rather its enabling condition. In <title level="m">Emma</title>’s case,
               the suspicions that attach to readily-endorsed bank bills have their origins in a
               newly shaped “social imaginary” coming to terms with “discounting” (inflation), paper
               money, and unbacked securities: phenomena following on from the suspension of
               cash-payment in 1797. </p>
               <p>The term “social imaginary” derives from Charles Taylor’s <title level="m">Modern
                  Social Imaginaries</title>. Taylor’s ultimate aim in this book is to substantiate
               his thesis that we had best speak of multiple modernities rather than a single,
               uniform one; that <emph>pace</emph> the World Bank, putting in place a modern economy
               is not simply a matter of pulling on the usual policy levers. In each culture a
               unique social imaginary is at work, producing inevitable difference. The social
               imaginary refers to the way—analogous to Benedict Anderson and communities—we imagine
               a moral order, including that which legitimates it. Taylor aims to reveal the
               historical uniqueness of the social imaginary of the West over the last four hundred
               years, to those of us who live within it, where our social imaginary has become
               second nature, and unless prodded into introspection, invisible. </p>
               <p>The broad transition Taylor has in mind, is from “Platonic-modeled orders of
               hierarchical complementarity” to a contingent model whose “two main ends, security
               and prosperity, are now the principal goals of organized society (12, 13-14). In
               contradistinction to the former, “the modern order gives no ontological status to
               hierarchy or any particular structure of differentiation” (12). Taylor refers to
               modern liberalism rising from the natural law theories of Grotius and Locke, to the
               imagining of societies composed of equal free agents who pool sovereignty in order to
               advance individual goals, en masse. We tend to think of such individualism as
               inherently atomistic, but as Taylor notes, in its original conception private ends
               and public goods found themselves in a balanced, productive tension, as it is only
               through the latter (including, notably, security) that the former may be realized. </p>
               <p>If one were thinking of the modern, Western, moral order as a system, it would be
               “structuralist” in that no element would have an a priori meaning, but gains
               significance as it furthers or hinders the ultimate goals of prosperity and security.
               Originally the preserve of a few philosophers, the ideas underlying the modern
               Western order migrate “from one niche to many, and from moral theory to social
               imaginary” (6). However, remarkably, a third axis is at work. Summing up his
               distinctions, Taylor notes “that an idea of moral or political order can either be
               ultimate”, as in eschatology, “or for the here and now, and if the latter, it can
               either be hermeneutic or prescriptive” (7). The modern idea of order begins as a
               hermeneutic inquiry into the origin and nature of the “unquestioned legitimacy”
               underlying governments. But over time the “hermeneutic of legitimation” found in
               natural law theory travels along its axis towards prescription, so that notions of
               fundamental equality between social agents and the consensual nature of legitimacy
               become ethical constraints, taking on revolutionary force in the process. </p>
               <p>Taylor employs the term “social imaginary” because he wants to avoid the idealist
               pitfalls of “culture” and “ideology”, both of which he sees as covertly teleological.
               His definition is worth attending to: <quote>By social imaginary, I mean something
                  much broader and deeper than intellectual schemes people may entertain when they
                  think about social reality in a disengaged mode. I am thinking, rather, of the
                  ways people imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how
                  things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that normally met,
                  and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations.
                  (23)</quote> Taylor’s project is emphatically not a history of ideas (although it
               may be mistaken for such at first glance). He does not believe that natural law
               theory accounts for, or explains, the Western modern order. The task of explanation,
               rather, would fall on why the theory moved along its “three axes” into the Western
               social imaginary, from few to many, abstraction to practice, hermeneutic to
               prescription. While Taylor argues that the materialist substrate is an essential part
               of the story, arguments predicated on materialism as the primum mobile inevitably
               traduce the complexity of the process. By the same token “culture” is an unhelpful
               metaphor, suggesting, as it does, something contained, with a singular axis of
               causality, of a medium in which agents act on objects (think petri dish). Taylor’s
               preferred term is “background”, a philosophical concept meaning “that largely
               unstructured and inarticulate understanding of our whole situation, within which
               particular features of our world show up for us in the sense they have. It can never
               be adequately expressed in the form of explicit doctrines because of its unlimited
               and indefinite nature”. Hence the need to speak of an “imaginary” rather than a
               “theory” (30). </p>
               <p> The Romantic era looms large in all of Taylor’s many accounts of the history of the
               instantiation of what is now a salient aspect of our social imaginary, something we
               familiarly know as the “economy“.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Besides <title level="m">Social Imaginaries</title>, see Taylor 1989 and
                  2007. </note> For Taylor it is a period of late transition and early
               consolidation, and therefore Janus faced. Thus <title level="m">Emma</title>, which
               contains at once “hierarchical complementarity” and the new moral order of equal
               acquisitive agents, a tension comically evident, as we shall discover, in Emma’s
               transparent snobbery. So when I say that in <title level="m">Emma</title> suspicions
               attaching to readily-endorsed bank bills ramify within a newly shaped “social
               imaginary”, I mean a process that goes very deep.</p>
               <p>The point can be illustrated through an argument Lynn Hunt makes about how, for the
               population at large, the French Revolution was mediated through the family romance
               (Hunt). Prior to the Revolution the king was commonly regarded as the father of the
               nation; by the same token his subjects were his children. The point Hunt stresses is
               that within the social imaginary the relationship pulsed with literal, rather than
               figurative, force. </p>
               <p>Within the Pre-Revolutionary mentality, legitimacy was a concrete affair, insofar as
               it could be materialized as blood. The shift to thinking of citizenship and state
               legitimacy in abstract terms, as matters of universal principles and rights, or,
               indeed, as the expression of Rousseau’s “general will”, was, indeed, revolutionary.
               In support of her argument Hunt provides evidence of the profound disorientation of
               the common citizenry, who felt bereft, indeed “orphaned”, by the king’s execution;
               they had severed connections with a visible “father”, and were now at sea with a host
               of abstractions. In Taylor’s terms the transition was from a previous model of
               “hierarchical complementarity”, concretely instantiated in the king’s body, haloed by
               an ontological investment, to a new order predicated on the universal human rights of
               equality, security and prosperity, so that we may concur with Saree Makdisi who
               argues, along with Burke, that Jacobins were the advanced guard of economic
               liberalism (Makdisi). The point of introducing Hunt’s perspective, is that it cues us
               into what this crisis in the social imaginary meant at the level of narrative: an
               explosion of stories of families and fathers, rebellions and repressions, unities and
               disunities, in which the paternal figure was divested of its ontological aura through
               the father’s endlessly repeated symbolic decapitation in the Gothic plots of the
               Minerva school; plots turning on sons and daughters somehow prevailing in their quest
               to marry in accordance with their emotional needs, rather than the family’s dynastic
               ambitions (Miles 2002). In Freudian terms, it’s as if contemporary readers
               administered their own talking cure, vicariously experienced through endless symbolic
               repetitions of the new order’s primal scene where abstract right was conceived (in
               the daughter’s stubborn adherence to her love), and the king’s body dispatched (in
               the father’s failure to impose his will), the whole psychomachia mediated through the
               cultural debris of an exploded feudal system. </p>
               <p>I want to argue that the change in the social imaginary attendant upon the suspension
               of cash payments was equally far reaching, as value lost its concrete embodiments in
               favour of abstract promises: where there used to be stamped portions of precious
               metal, there were now paper bank notes unsecured by specie. This was hardly a
               phenomenon anyone could have missed, who lived through it. Prior to the suspension
               country banks were prohibited from issuing notes smaller than five pounds, while the
               Bank of England had none smaller than ten. According to John Clapham’s history of the
               Bank of England, up until 1797 “Englishmen of the rank and file—wage-earners and
               small traders—knew little of paper money” (Clapham 2-3). Over a period of twenty
               years paper or its substitutes replaced traditional coins: “Gradually the age became
               one of bank notes and tradesmen’s tokens and Spanish dollars stamped with the head of
               King George III and put into circulation by the Bank in England” (Clapham, 4). There
               was an explosion of country banks, made possible by the relaxation in the rules
               governing the supply of money (an explosion involving Austen’s brother, Henry). The
               surge in the supply of money was in turn linked to a rapid cycle of boom and bust, of
               speculative fevers momentarily cured by bone-numbing recessions. The journals were
               filled with the “bullion controversy”—with the first finest hour of the dismal
               science, as it came to grips, conceptually, with the underlying causes of boom and
               bust, “inflation” and “deflation” (as yet, not the common currency of economic
               discussion). Meanwhile, the suspension was a forger’s charter. When bank notes were
               of large denomination, counterfeiting was difficult, as palming-off a dodgy note was
               an act you did up close and personal: only with the emergence of small notes in
               common and daily use could you anonymously slip them into circulation, and then
               disappear; hence, as Ian Haywood explains, the draconian practice of stringing up any
               unfortunate wretch insufficiently eagle-eyed to catch the minute signs of the
               counterfeiter’s art.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See
                  Haywood’s essay in this volume. </note> Before special paper, with unreproducible
               water-marks (let alone holograms) counterfeiters were on the whole even more skilled
               than their engraving counterparts in the treasury; and whatever the treasury could
               do, as regards intricate patterns and secret signs, the counterfeiters could do as
               well, if not better (Dick, 389). Hence one of the more unlikely public movements of
               the age: the societies forming for the prevention of the wholesale hanging of
               market-traders caught with bent bills. </p>
               <p>Romanticism—at any rate, Romantic ideology—may be understood as the dream of
               achieving permanent or transcendent value against a background of value rendered
               radically unstable and contested (McGann). In this respect forgery signifies the
               possibility of the endemic instability that fed the transcendental desires that
               peculiarly distinguish Romanticism. Although this is a version of the familiar story
               told about Romanticism—a story about the rise of secularization, with temporal
               theories of value replacing atemporal ones—the constitutive role of the bullion
               controversy (with its concomitant ills, such as the forgery epidemic) as a necessary
               condition for the historical rise of Romanticism has only recently been directly
               addressed, for example in Mary Poovey’s <title level="m">Genres of the Credit
                  Economy</title>, and in Alex Dick’s forthcoming <title level="m">Realms of Gold:
                  British Romanticism and the Standard of Value</title>.</p>
               <p>My aim is not to change prevailing notions of Romanticism so much as it is to change
               prevailing notions of forgery in relation to it, from forgery as Romanticism’s dark
               other (an expression of the critical imaginary understandably present in, for
               instance, Nick Groom’s ground-breaking 1994 issue of <title level="j">Angelaki</title> devoted to the subject) to forgery as a logically necessary
               constituent of Romanticism. In effect I am positing the interchangeability of two
               systems of value: the aesthetic, and the economic (see Thompson). As disciplines, or
               fields, aesthetics and economics both famously come into being (as regards their
               modern shape) around the same time: think, for instance, of Adam Smith’s <title level="m">Wealth of Nations</title> (1776) and Lord Kames' <title level="m">The
                  Elements of Criticism</title> (1762). Each needs the other, to think itself into
               being.</p>
               <p>The hinge, linking the two systems, is forgery. In recent years there has been a
               great deal of critical interest in the history of literary forgery, an interest K.K.
               Ruthven links to “two intellectual developments in the final decades of the twentieth
               century”: “post-structuralist critical theory” and the “continuing anatomy of . . .
               'the postmodern condition'“. The first forced a rethinking of traditional assumptions
               about “authorship, originality, authenticity and value” while the second
               fundamentally undermined commonsense apprehensions of the real and the simulated
               (Ruthven, 63). The eighteenth-century habit of positing the ideal of “original
               genius” axiomatically produced the allied condition of anxiety about its failure,
               which is to say, fakery, or, where it was with malice prepense, forgery.
               Post-structuralist critical theory certainly pounced on this hare, once set running;
               my aim, rather, is to take us back to a moment where a linkage was made, that now
               seems self-evident, but was hardly so at the time: the linkage, that is, between
               forgery in its dominant figurative sense (the unauthorized replication of bank
               notes), and a secondary one: the unauthorized replication of literary property.
               Originally a forger was simply a metal-basher, and forgery “the action or craft of
               forging metal”. So what connects the innocent act of making something (a poem, say,
               attributed to a long-dead poet), with the criminal act of counterfeiting bank bills?
               Blackstone in his <title level="m">Commentaries</title> (1769) appears to provide an
               answer: “the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another
               man’s right.”<note resp="editors" place="foot">See the entry on
                  forgery in the <title level="m">Oxford English Dictionary</title>. </note> Prior
               to the suspension of 1797, most forged bills were to the detriment of a named
               individual, fraudulently endorsed (rather than to a faceless bank). Blackstone’s
               legal definition stretches to encompass both robbery through counterfeit bank notes,
               and the theft of literary property though imposition; both the Reverend Dodds, and
               Chatterton. But of course, only Dodds was stretched, and not just because Chatterton
               checked out early. The famous cases of literary forgery in the eighteenth century did
               not involve infringements of copyright “to the prejudice of another man’s right”.
               Rowley’s poems not having been previously published, the copyright could not have
               been snapped up by a publisher, so none was injured. The same was true of Ireland’s
               Shakespeare forgeries, where the worst that could be said, was that Ireland had
               trampled on Shakespeare’s “moral rights”, as later iterations of the copyright law
               would come to call the right of not having one’s work traduced, and its brand
               tarnished, by fraudsters; but in the 1790’s this concept lay in the future. When
               Horace Walpole famously claimed that all inmates of the house of forgery were
               relations, he was the one doing the stretching (see Baines). The circle he was
               drawing, was greatly in excess of what was then logically, or legally, possible. We
               do well to listen to natural contrarians, such as Cobbett, who is here righteously
               tearing strips off the fools who rounded on W. H. Ireland, once his ingenuity as a
               Shakespeare-basher was revealed: <quote>instantly the base wretches, from every
                  quarter, poured in upon him; instead of admiring his ingenuity, and apologising,
                  as well as they could, for their own folly, in having been Shakespeare-mad, they
                  pitched upon him, like tigers, called him a forger, called him an impostor, and
                  almost hunted him from the face of the earth.</quote> Cobbett continues:
                  <quote>With regard to Mr. Ireland, let these facts be borne in mind; that he was
                  no forger, no impostor, according to the usual meaning of those words; that he had
                  a perfect right to put forth the publications he put forth; that there was nothing
                  illegal and nothing immoral in any of his proceedings as to this matter; that
                  Doctors Wharton and Parr were deemed the two most learned men in the Kingdom; that
                  they declared and certified that it was their conviction that no human being could
                  write those manuscripts but Shakespeare; that when Mr Ireland was discovered to be
                  the real author, the whole band of literary ruffians fell upon him, and would have
                  destroyed him, if they had been able, with as little remorse as men destroy a mad
                     dog...<note resp="editors" place="foot">The article is W.H.

                     831. </note>
                  </quote> Cobbett is correct. “According to the usual meaning” of the word, Ireland
               was no forger. But in the minds of those hunting him down, like a mad dog, he was,
               because the concept of forgery had been stretched to link together the aesthetic with
               the monetary value the aesthetic generates (where the aesthetic is arbitrarily
               confined to a single, “original” source). From Cobbett’s perspective, these are
               heterogeneous notions yoked together by force. The “con” was not Ireland pretending
               to be Shakespeare, but the pretence of a rare and precious literary value only the
               cognoscenti could discern. Ireland’s true crime, Cobbett suggests, was his laying
               bare the pretence. </p>
               <p>One could say that mine is a secularization argument; that the late Enlightenment
               throws us into a state of irony, contingency, and subjectivity; and the hinged
               relationship between numismatic and literary forgery is just another indication that
               we are in the free-floating realm of shifting values. But I prefer to put it like
               this: the suspension of cash payments ushered in a period in which the modern
               economic cycle first began to intensify, a period, that is, of rapid capital growth,
               speculation, and savage retrenchments; it was one where paper replaced metal as
               common, circulating tokens of value; and where the economic discourse of value (on
               why, for instance, gold and silver have value in the first place: the common answer
               looping back to the scarcity-value attendant upon the limits of South American mines
               and the labour that worked them) infiltrates other discursive systems of value. All
               three developments altered the social imaginary, not least through the pervasive
               example of economic agents rising and falling, as the economy booms and busts, along
               with the allied lesson that the modern moral order presupposes deep interconnection
               and dependence. And I put it like that, because it is the best way of understanding
               something really peculiar about Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Emma</title>.</p>
               <p>And that is, that <title level="m">Emma</title> is a deeply meditated work on the
               same interpenetration of literary and economic systems of value that we found in
               Cobbett’s analysis of Ireland’s persecution. We can start with the fact that Highbury
               is sixteen miles South of London, in Surrey—insofar as Austen had a location in mind,
               it was Leatherhead, the epicentre of what is now the stockbroker belt. The obvious
               point—for contemporary readers, screamingly so—is that the Woodhouses are
                  rentiers.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Beth Tobin
                  speculates that the Woodhouse fortune “was most likely made by someone who retired
                  to Highbury, not far from London and its money market, where he could have bought
                  and sold stocks in corporations and colonialist ventures like the East India or
                  South Seas Companies, or lent money to the government for William III’s and Anne’s
                  wars” (Tobin 238).</note> In the following passage, the humour is very broad
               indeed. Emma is wondering to herself about what could have possessed Mr. Elton into
               imagining himself her equal: <quote>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how
                  very much he was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very
                  want of such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that in
                  fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know that the
                  Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the younger
                  branch of a very ancient family—and that the Eltons were nobody. The landed
                  property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in
                  the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their
                  fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to
                  Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence... (153)</quote> We never
               learn about these mysterious “other sources”—Emma is doubtless vague herself—but
               almost certainly the Woodhouses have their money in the funds: and like many others
               living the good life among England’s ancient gentry, they are but one or two
               generations removed from the trade in which they earned their pile, before “cashing
               out”. As Shinobu Minma observes, “we may assume that the progenitor of the Hartfield
               Woodhouses was a younger brother in a landed family, who entered trade, made his
               fortune, purchased the Hartfield estate (from the Knightleys no doubt) and settled in
                  Highbury.”<note resp="editors" place="foot">Quoted in

               </p>
               <p> Of course stock-jobbers and kindred scoundrels are always trying to cash-out: as the
               current joke has it, they made off, like Madoff. The eighteenth-century had their own
               word for the phenomenon: “realise”. Here is the OED defining the word: <quote>To
                  convert (securities, paper money, etc.) into cash, or (property of any kind) into
                  money. After F. <emph>réaliser</emph>, first used <emph>c</emph> 1719 in connexion
                  with the speculations over Law’s scheme,<note resp="editors" place="foot"> John Law’s Mississippi scheme in France was the inspiration
                     for the South Sea bubble. </note> in the sense of converting securities into
                  cash or permanently valuable property. Hence Johnson, perhaps influenced by the
                  phrase “real property”, gives as one sense of the word “To convert money into
                  land”; this, however, is unsupported by quotations.</quote> In Highbury, everyone
               is trying to realize themselves (apart from George Knightley, who has the opposite
               problem to contend with, of turning land to cash). Thus we learn that Mr Weston had
               “realized an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little estate
               adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for” (16). Buoyed by the unexpected
               profits of their London “House”, meaning business, the Coles are looking to realize
               their fortune, by buying property in Highbury and insinuating themselves into the
               best circles, to Emma’s chagrin. The obvious point, for a contemporary reader, is
               that Emma is drawing distinctions without a difference; or rather, the slight
               difference of the Woodhouses being superior to the Coles, by dint of cashing out a
               generation or two earlier.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For
                  a contemporary notice commenting on the middling nature of Highbury’s residents,
                  and the slight degree of social difference among them, see Anon (1816). </note>
               The irony is equally broad in this passage (Emma is explaining to Harriet why Robert
               Martin is not a desirable catch): <quote>“Well, and that is as early as most men can
                  afford to marry, who are not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has
                  his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever
                  money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family
                  property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth;
                  and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to
                  impossible that he should have <emph>realised</emph> any thing yet.” (74) (my
                  italics).</quote> This is the second instance of “realize”, used in its modern,
               financial sense, found in the novel. Emma is speculating about Robert Martin’s
               speculation, his attempt at the “high farming” as it was called, that was then
               transforming British agriculture, as the speculative boom involved capital investment
               in land, in new farming methods that were reaping strong returns owing to the
               unprecedented high prices in corn.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For instance, in 1815, Thomas Malthus observed that there had been "a great
                  consequent extension of cultivation and improvement," especially over the last
                  seven years: "the system of spirited improvement and high farming, as it is
                  technically called, has been principally encouraged by the progressive rise of
                  prices..." (Quoted Anon 1815, 493).</note> Or were the prices simply inflated? As
               Niall Ferguson points out, at around this time (just before the end of the Napoleonic
               wars) the Funds were a mere 60% of their historic value, undermined by inflation
               (Ferguson, 80). At the point of the novel’s writing, rentiers such as the Woodhouses
               are on their way down, while high farmers and capital speculators such as Robert
               Martin are on their way up. Emma notes this without quite taking it in (she predicts
               Robert Martin will be rich in time). </p>
               <p>How broad is the irony? “. . .his share of the family property . . . is . . . all
               afloat, all employed in his stock”. Note the pun on stock (obviously livestock, but
               also the financial variety). The pun develops the double meaning of Robert Martin as
               a high farmer (a passion he incidentally shares with Mr. Knightley), but it also
               brings out this latent irony: Emma is talking as the very thing she is: a speculator,
               who is, herself, the daughter of speculators (that is, business people), who have
               realised themselves, having cashed out.</p>
               <p>The novel has a word for this conjunction of the two senses of speculation: Emma, we
               are told, is an “imaginist...on fire with speculation and foresight!” (295). The
               conjunction is also evident in the novel’s core plot device, where Emma speculates on
               Harriet Smith’s origin. Emma prefers romance (Harriet is the natural daughter of a
               Merchant Prince, or Whig Grandee, someone, ideally, combining both nobility and
               wealth, so “bleaching” the stain of her dodgy origin [404]), but has to learn
               novelistic realism (Harriet’s father is a tradesman decent enough to remain
               anonymous). In its sly way, <title level="m">Emma</title> is also a novel about
               novel-writing. As someone who speculates, and predicts marriage, Emma is linked—at
               least theoretically—with the main business of the novel, of narrating marriage. When
               she takes on her protégé, Harriet Smith, the theoretical point becomes practical: in
               developing Harriet, Emma speculates through the medium of romance conventions, much
               as Catherine Morland does. She views the world through the prism of the wrong kind of
               novels. At the same time, the Harriet Smith romance encapsulates the main fear of
               Tory ideology: that feckless, irresponsible, illegitimate capital (engendered in the
               City) will be set lose to circulate freely, transforming the shires, by turning the
               social order upside down. With this allegorical dimension in mind, the gypsy episode
               is ironically inverted: the real menace, is not the raggedy offspring of a few
               tinkers, but Harriet Smith, the ambulatory bank note, the daughter of God-knows-who,
               who promises capital transformation (in Emma’s speculation), a threat further
               ironically intensified given the hero’s association with the Churchills. Frank
               Churchill, who gallantly disperses the gypsies, is the adopted son of the self-same
               class of Whig nabobs who are the putative parents of illegitimate Harriet. Where
               legitimacy is defined by land, a form of property where the social contract (of
               obligations and responsibilities, as well as privilege) is legible to all, capital
               has the taint of illegitimacy, or irresponsible pleasure. Frank himself generates the
               hugger-mugger Tory ideologues typically associated with large city fortunes. In other
               words, <title level="m">Emma</title> reprises the plot of <title level="m">Northanger
                  Abbey</title> where a romance-addled heroine is unable to recognize the very thing
               that obsesses her when it’s in front of her face: in Emma’s case, the perils of new
               (City) money and marriage across class lines. Even as she spurns the Coles, as
               socially illegitimate new money, she promotes Harriet (its epitome). </p>
               <p>One could argue that Harriet is a counterfeit banknote, in that she is, from Emma’s
               perspective, a “fake”, but that is taking the allegory too far. The point, rather, is
               that two competing discourses inhabit the same space in the novel, and through the
               punning capacity of language, often the same words. You can try the experiment. Get
               an e-text of the novel and plug in “resources”, “speculate”, “improve”, “stock”,
               “credit”, “realize”: the terms recur, pointedly. The competing discourses are drawn
               from aesthetics and economics, where the correction of one kind of speculation (the
               economic) is linked to the improvement of another (novel-writing). </p>
               <p>Austen’s fascination with the dismal science arguably pervades her work, but most
               notably <title level="m">Emma</title>, <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, and
                  <title level="m">Sanditon</title>. It is not a sign of her famed Enlightenment
               realism; rather, it is where she is at her most Romantic, for it is through her
               economic interests that she finds a language for exploring a world where value is
               inescapably contingent. Contingent value is not thematized in her novels—rather it is
               part of the web-and-woof of a social imaginary that in a manner of speaking thinks
               itself out through the medium of her novels.</p>
               <p> I want to conclude by considering the aspect of the novel that most severely tries
               my interpretation: the idealization of Knightley and Donwell Abbey. The marriage
               between Emma and Knightley repairs the “notch” in the latter’s property, making it
               whole again, while her thirty thousand pounds is safely placed in the service of an
               ancient estate, the pinnacle of a “well-connected” community presumably stretching
               back to the English Reformation and the dissolution of the monasteries. In his brisk
               pedestrianism, frugal habits, and active concern for all the “citizens of Highbury”,
               Knightley appears to be the embodiment of the responsible, enlivening spirit that
               draws the community together, transforming it (through self-regulation) into a living
               example of the Tory ideal. Emma’s epiphany, when she strolls around Knightley’s
               grounds, as she escapes the wretched Mrs. Elton and her inane mercantile chatter,
               appears Austen’s own, ventriloquized by Edmund Burke: “It was a sweet view—sweet to
               the eye and the mind. English verdure, English culture, English comfort, seen under a
               sun bright, without being oppressive” (315). At the heart of this glorious, organic,
               vital media is a crucial representation of social relation: “The considerable slope,
               at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond
               its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and
               grandeur, well clothed with wood; and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed
               and sheltered, rose the Abbey-Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making
               a close and handsome curve around it” (315). Knightley, and Robert Martin, the Abbey
               and the Abbey-Mill farm, seem chthonically present, as if spontaneously grown from
               the sinuous earth, as close as one can get, in a realist novel, to an instantiation
               of the ontic force of “hierarchical complementarity”. On this reading, the mysterious
               power that makes the English home counties the home counties of England, and nowhere
               else—continuous across space and time, a unique identity enduring through the
               aeons—is made manifest in the novel as the healing force that repairs notches in
               ancient estates, excludes frightful sorts like the Eltons, while lodging dangerous
               females (wild imaginists and ambulatory banknotes alike) snugly within the confines
               of appropriate marriages. </p>
               <p> This “heritage” fantasy is indisputably at work in the novel, but it works as one
               pole in irresolvable tension with another reality, of independent, and equal,
               economic actors, engaged in a mutual-aid society, as they seek to prosper in giddy
               financial times. For if <title level="m">Emma</title> was written at a time of
               faltering boom, it was quickly followed by a spectacular bust.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For the timing of the novel’s composition see
                  Miles (2003-04). </note> Hence the stress on what Robert Martin and George
               Knightley have in common: an insatiable appetite for “information”, especially
               information relating to “improvement”—another of the novel’s key terms. “Improvement”
               resonates ironically in the text, as the watch word of enclosures, engrossments, and
               the capital transformation of land at a time of rising prices and rents: it’s what
               Robert Martin does with his sheep, and other farmers with oxen, and what Emma does
               with Harriet, even as Mr. Knightley wishes that Emma would exert more effort in her
               own reading, to improve herself. When Mr. Knightley says he can as “ill spare Robert
               Martin” (397) as his canny steward, William Larkins, he means, not the umbilical
               connection of master and tenant farmer, but a collaborator in their joint project of
               improving their lands and profits. The social imaginary in which <title level="m">Emma</title> ramifies, is a modern one of equal, mutually dependent actors where
               the older moral outlook exists as an outdated cast of mind satirized through Emma’s
               snobbery, and as an idealization ironically presented as just that: the era of “gold
               standards” has passed, and ever-shifting relation ushered in. As Alex Dick notes, the
               “gold standard” was first conceptualized in the course of the bullion controversy, at
               which point it was retrospectively projected onto the past, onto the era preceding
               the suspension of cash-payments in 1797, as a fantasy of origin.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See the essay in this volume.</note>
               </p>
               <p>J.G.A. Pocock influentially argued that the rise of a polite and commercial society
               in the eighteenth century eclipsed the mentality in which land was automatically
               assumed to be the proper source of wealth and the true foundation of political
                  legitimacy.<note resp="editors" place="foot"> See Pocock,
                  who makes it clear that the ideal of a settled landed interest was a later
                  retrospective simplification of the past.</note> But as Beth Tobin notes, although
               this ideal had waned, it began to wax after the post-Waterloo economic crash as an
               ideological defence of the corn laws that were used to prop up farming prices, thus
               ensuring the continued pre-eminence of “land” in the British social imaginary (Tobin,
               249). At this juncture the ideological formation assumed its modern form: the Tory
               ideal of the “knights of the shires” as the true pillars of English society. <title level="m">Emma</title> puts both things in play: the fantasy (the gold standard of
               “land”; Donwell Abbey; the immutabilities of rank) and its opposite (contingency; the
               stockbroker belt; permeable class). It is in this tension that Austen finds her
               Romantic irony.</p>

               <p>The production, representation and circulation of radical knowledge have become
               important areas of scholarly investigation in Romantic period studies over the last
               twenty years. In books like Kevin Gilmartin’s <title level="m">Print Politics</title>
               (1996), Michael Scrivener’s <title level="m">Seditious Allegories</title> (2001) and
               Ian Haywood’s <title level="m">The Revolution in Popular Literature</title> (2004),
               radical Romantic intellectual and cultural production is mapped as a means to
               highlighting the wider ideological struggle against dominant economic, social and
               political narratives in the period. Haywood has demonstrated in his <title level="m">Bloody Romanticism</title> (2006) that this struggle against a corrupt economic
               and political system was often a bloody process, emphasizing the centrality of what
               he calls “spectacular violence” in the wider public sphere: “In order for the
               Romantic period to develop an unprecedented self-awareness about the depravities of
               public violence, and in order for the radical critique of cyclical State violence to
               be disseminated throughout the public sphere, spectacular violence had to become a
               major cultural force” (3). The radical campaign against the paper money system, and
               the corrupt polity that facilitated its emergence and unsteady existence in the early
               nineteenth century, provides one illustration of how the production and circulation
               of radical knowledge in the public sphere helped to create an oppositional site of
               “spectacular violence” in the Romantic period for its popular audience. The print
               protests of William Cobbett and T. J. Wooler against the paper money system and its
               brutal political enforcement demonstrate how the depiction of state violence can be
               used as a vehicle of ideological resistance in the service of radical political and
               economic reform. As Wooler put it in <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> about
               the judicial crisis sparked by the forgery executions of December 1818, even the
               “many admirers of ‘<emph>the system</emph>,’ confess they do not like it disfigured
               with blood” (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [16 Dec. 1818], 789).</p>
               <p>“Gentlemen; we, the people of this country, have been persuaded to believe many
               things,” writes Cobbett almost a decade earlier in the first letter of his “Paper
               Against Gold” article series in the <title level="j">Political Register</title>. “We
               have been persuaded to believe ourselves to be ‘the <emph>most thinking</emph> people
               in Europe;’ but, to what purpose do men think, unless they arrive at useful knowledge
               by thinking?” (<title level="j">Register</title> 18 [1 Sep. 1810], 260). This essay
               will firstly examine the strategy of radical education in the early
               nineteenth-century plebeian public sphere around the issue of paper money,
               illustrated by Cobbett in his article series “Paper Against Gold”, published in the
                  <title level="j">Political Register</title> during 1810-11. Cobbett’s role as a
               counter-hegemonic intellectual in the series and the conception of popular knowledge
               it championed will be emphasized, in part through his attempts to expose the complex
               workings of the wider financial system he described as a “place… of a sort of
               mysterious existence; a sort of Financial Ark; a place not, perhaps, to be touched,
               or even seen” (<title level="j">Register</title> 18 [8 Sep. 1810], 294). The second
               part of the essay will demonstrate how this form of critical publicity was
               transformed in the postwar years into an active project of resistance against the
               worst abuses of the paper money system, culminating in Cobbett’s “puff out” campaign
               in the <title level="j">Register</title> to materially undermine Bank of England
               paper currency and Wooler’s print protests in <title level="j">The Black
                  Dwarf</title> directly confronting the enforcement of the “bloody code” in the
               capital forgery trials of late 1818. This postwar print campaign against the paper
               money system illustrates key aspects of the wider radical intellectual project in the
               plebeian public sphere, highlighting how the radical press “converted” popular public
               debate into a new form of cultural currency in the Romantic period, a currency that
               emblematized a continuing concern for the material welfare of its readers and
               listeners in the face of a corrupt and bloody political and economic system. </p>

                  <p>In their carefully constructed thematic sections and transparently didactic tone
                  the articles in “Paper Against Gold” resemble a popular lecture series in the form
                  of correspondence. The subtitle to the articles, “Being An Examination Of The
                  Report Of The Bullion Committee In A Series Of Letters To The Tradesmen And
                  Farmers In And Near Salisbury”, gives an indication of the audience Cobbett sought
                  to address. It was this important group of petit-bourgeois local stakeholders in
                  the national economy that he believed to be at risk in the rapidly expanding
                  paper-money system. As in his “Perish Commerce” <title level="j">Register</title>
                  articles published in 1807-8 attacking the corrupt roots and corrosive social
                  effects of free trade in England, Cobbett’s argument presumes class interest to be
                  at the heart of the current fiscal and monetary policies pursued by the
                  government.</p>
                  <p>In the introduction to the first letter Cobbett lays out the theme he will pursue
                  throughout the series: “I think it may not be amiss, if, upon this occasion, I
                  address myself to you. I have introduced myself to you without any ceremony; but
                  before we part, we shall become well acquainted; and, I make no doubt, that you
                  will understand the distinction between Paper-Money and Gold-Money much too well
                  for it to be in the power of any one ever again to deceive you...” (<title level="j">Register</title> 18 [1 Sep. 1810], 259). Cobbett views his
                  intellectual function as facilitating public understanding of the official
                  conclusions published in the Bullion Report<note resp="editors" place="foot">For an illuminating discussion of the Bullion Committee
                     Report see Fontana 118-26.</note>, an influential document chiefly composed by
                  the Scottish Whig economist Francis Horner from the Select Committee tasked with
                  investigating the associated values of Gold Bullion and paper currency in the
                  national economy. The conclusions of this Report, as Cobbett sceptically relates,
                  suggest “that it is possible to lessen the quantity of the paper-money, and to
                  cause guineas to come back again and to pass from hand to hand as in former times”
                  without “the total destruction of the paper-money” system. Mocking the
                  intellectual arrogance and moral self-regard reflected in the Report, Cobbett
                  reminds his audience of the practical material issues at stake in public debates
                  like this one: “such is our present situation in this country, that every man, who
                  has a family to preserve from want, ought to endeavour to make himself acquainted
                  with the nature, and with the probable consequences, of the paper-money now
                  afloat” (261). </p>
                  <p>He begins his interrogation of the paper-money system with a simple reminder of
                  the use value of money as a method of exchange for goods: “<emph>Money</emph> is
                     the<emph> representative</emph>, or the<emph> token</emph> of property, or
                     <emph>things of value</emph>. The money, while used as money, is of no other
                  use; and, therefore, a bit of lead or of wood or of leather, would be as good as
                  gold or silver, to be used as money” (261). Ever the practical materialist,
                  Cobbett wants his audience to see the root causes of their domestic discomfort,
                  causes concealed by the increasingly dominant method of paper currency
                  transaction: <quote>while we are all acquainted with the fact, and while many of
                     us are most sensibly feeling the <emph>effects</emph>, scarcely a man amongst
                     us takes the trouble to inquire into the cause... We see the country abounding
                     with paper-money; we see every man’s band full of it; we frequently talk of it
                     as a strange thing, and a great evil; but never do we inquire into the cause of
                     it. </quote> With an appeal to popular collective memory, he traces the spread
                  of paper currency by focusing on the changing pattern of social relations in the
                  English countryside: “There are few of you, who cannot remember the time, when
                  there was scarcely ever a bank note among Tradesmen and Farmers... People, in
                  those days, used to carry little bags to put their money in, instead of the
                  paste-board or leather cases that they now carry” (262). </p>
                  <p>In the second letter published in the <title level="m">Register</title>, Cobbett
                  continues with his investigation of paper money, this time focusing on the way it
                  functioned to sustain the current funding system. He begins with a cautionary note
                  regarding the popular mystification surrounding key terms like “Fund” and
                  “National Debt” used in the new discourse of commercial finance. “These are
                  words,” he writes, “which are frequently made use of; but, like many other words,
                  they stand for things which are little understood, and the less, perhaps, because
                  the words are so very commonly used” (<title level="j">Register</title> 18 [8 Sep.
                  1810], 290). He continues: <quote>if a right understanding of the meaning of these
                     words be, in all cases where the words are used, of some consequence, it is of
                     peculiar consequence here, where... we shall find the <emph>Funds</emph>, the
                        <emph>Stocks</emph>, and the <emph>National Debt</emph>, to be so closely
                     interwoven with the <emph>Bank Notes</emph>, as to be quite inseparable
                     therefrom in every possible state or stage of their existence. </quote> Cobbett
                  here seeks to be both practical pedagogue as well as engaged social critic,
                  patiently deciphering the reifying language deployed by the new financial elite in
                  order to rally some kind of collective resistance to the paper money system and
                  the political order it served. This was “an inquiry”, he explains, “worthy of the
                  undivided attention of every true Englishman” and “every man who wishes to see
                  this country of his forefathers preserved from ruin and subjugation” (291). </p>
                  <p>Cobbett developed his discourse of economic populism as an explicit appeal to the
                  suspicion and scepticism of the plebeian classes about the new paper money system.
                  He also stressed the need for different indicators of what the political
                  economists called “national prosperity”—a powerful abstraction utilized to promote
                  the benefits of economic modernization from the perspective of a small elite of
                  financiers, company directors, wealthy consumers, and high level government
                  bureaucrats. This conception of national prosperity, Cobbett argued in the third
                  letter, was demonstrated in “the increase of the number of chariots and of
                  fine-dressed people”, rather than in the “good morals, of <emph>the labouring
                     classes of the people</emph>” (<title level="j">Register</title> 18 [12 Sep.
                  1810], 331-32). Far from promoting the health and productive energies of the
                  labouring classes, this notion of prosperity, according to Cobbett, has had the
                  opposite effect. In a series of questions to those farmers and tradesmen—the local
                  stakeholders with a direct responsibility for the well-being of their labourers—he
                  highlights the material inequalities produced by the new financial system and its
                  shambolic notion of prosperity: “Have our labourers a plentiful meal of food fit
                  for man? Do they taste meat once in <emph>a day</emph>? Are they decently clothed?
                  Have they the means of obtaining firing? Are they and their children healthy and
                  happy?” With reference to the direct experience of his audience, he adds, “I put
                  these questions to you, Gentlemen, who have the means of knowing the facts, and
                  who must, I am afraid, answer them all in the negative” (332).</p>
                  <p>In the twenty-fifth letter of the series, published in July 1811, Cobbett reduces
                  the concept of paper money to its original function as a unit of exchange in the
                  wider economy. By doing this, he attempts to revive a native plebeian
                  scepticism—still residually present—toward the financial abstractions promoted by
                  the new system. He opens with a simple lesson about inflation: “Money, of whatever
                  sort, is, like everything else, lowered in its value in proportion as it becomes
                     <emph>abundant</emph> or <emph>plenty</emph>” (<title level="j">Register</title> 20 [6 July 1811], 2). Always keen to return the focus in this
                  debate back to the world of material<emph> things</emph>, he continues: <quote>The
                     use of money is to serve men as a sign of the amount of the value of
                        <hi>things</hi> that pass from man to man in the way of purchase and sale.
                     It is <emph>plenty</emph>, or <emph>scarce</emph>, in proportion as its
                     quantity is great or small compared with the quantity of things purchased and
                     sold in the community; and, whenever it becomes, from any cause, plenty, it
                        <emph>depreciates</emph>, or sinks in value (2). </quote> This was
                  ultimately a lesson in the use-value of paper money in the day-to-day lives of
                  ordinary labourers. To this end, Cobbett points out the difference between paper
                  money and a staple commodity like bread, “one having a <emph>real</emph> value in
                  its utility in supporting man, and the money having only an<emph> imaginary</emph>
                  value” (3). He is making an important distinction between these things of “real
                  value”—which were the product of “our soil or of our labour” and hence subject to
                  a natural, if self-sustaining, scarcity—and the artificiality of paper currency in
                  the commercial market system, where an increase in the amount of paper money in
                  circulation meant that “any given quantity of it would purchase less bread” (4).
                  This had more than an abstract meaning to his audience. As a result of the
                  inflation generated by the new paper money system, prices rose by some eighty
                  percent between 1797 and 1818, making staple items for the ordinary household
                  prohibitively expensive.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See

                  </p>
                  <p>Exposing the ideological interests of the new financial elite who promoted the
                  paper-money system, those men “<emph>that had profited from that</emph>
                     <emph>borrowing</emph>” on the National Debt, was perhaps the most important of
                  Cobbett’s critical objectives in the series. According to him the new financial
                  system was based upon the activities of a small, parasitic group of capitalists
                  who both compelled the payment of the interest on the National Debt as well as
                  constructed the means for doing so through the expanding system of paper money.
                  For Cobbett, the only question worth asking was not being addressed by the Bullion
                  Committee. The question was whether the people can “<emph>by any means, diminish
                     the amount of the Dividends</emph>” paid on the debt: “if that question had
                  been answered in the negative, there was no course, for those who wished to
                  support the Pitt system, to pursue but that of letting things take their own
                  course, and aid the paper with their <emph>wishes</emph>” (17). But this attempt
                  by the elite at public legitimation was in danger of backfiring. The issue had now
                  been brought to the attention of the “public mind”, and the mystification
                  surrounding it had been punctured, not least through pioneering efforts in
                     counter-publicity<note resp="editors" place="foot"> For a
                     conceptually valuable notion of counter-publicity in the period see Gilmartin,
                     “Popular Radicalism and the Public Sphere” 553. </note> and popular education
                  like Cobbett’s article series. By considering the Committee’s recommendations in
                  Parliament in May of 1811, the economic elite had by no means closed off all
                  debate on the larger political issues surrounding the paper money system. Still a
                  believer in the possibilities of democratic discourse, Cobbett’s twenty-fifth
                  letter suggests that the political establishment had now opened the issue up to
                  the wider scrutiny of the labouring classes, and, through the efforts of
                  interlocutors like himself in the public sphere, this establishment was in danger
                  of losing control of the debate (17-18). </p>
                  <p>Throughout this extraordinary series of letters published in the <title level="j">Political Register</title>, Cobbett was above all attempting to initiate a
                  “legitimation crisis”—to use Jürgen Habermas’s influential phrase<note resp="editors" place="foot">See Habermas.</note>—for a
                  system he viewed as profoundly immoral, unjust, and constructed upon an
                  unsustainable foundation of monetary abstractions. It was an essential, if often
                  overlooked, prelude to Cobbett’s project of radical political reform pursued in
                  the postwar period. His economic theories stemmed from a firm conviction, as A. L.
                  Morton has bluntly put it in <title level="m">A People’s History of
                     England</title>, “that the common people, his people, had been robbed, were
                  being robbed and would continue to be robbed until they combined to check and
                  control the property-owning class” (318). This oppositional imperative is perhaps
                  best illustrated by Cobbett’s address “To The Journeymen And Labourers Of England,
                  Wales, Scotland And Ireland” in November of 1816 (<title level="j">Register</title> 31 [2 Nov. 1816], 545-76).</p>
                  <p>Cobbett’s address—published in a two-penny, unstamped pamphlet designed for the
                  widest possible circulation—also marked a new stage of the radical intellectual
                  project in the plebeian public sphere, building on the critical insights into the
                  new paper money system and its political economy developed in “Paper Against
                  Gold”. Beginning with the 1816 address a complementary strategy of collective
                  protest—co-ordinated through the radical press—was initiated for the political and
                  economic liberation of the labouring classes. These were the peak years of
                  political activity in the plebeian public sphere, with the radical weekly
                  occupying a central role in the wider Radical movement. Along with the founding of
                  Wooler’s <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> a year later in 1817, this address
                  by Cobbett signalled a new role for the unstamped weekly press as a vehicle for
                  collective action. After long years of patient education of his public, Cobbett
                  recognized that the time had now come for action: “Meeting after meeting, petition
                  on petition, remonstrance on remonstrance, until the country be saved!” (<title level="j">Register</title> 31 [16 Nov. 1816], 622).</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>II</head>
                  <p>This new strategic orientation of the plebeian public sphere was exemplified in
                  events like the Spa Fields meetings of late 1816, where mass direct action in
                  favour of broad constitutional rights proved, according to E. P. Thompson, “more
                  revolutionary in its implication than the policy of conspiracy and insurrection”
                  (682). Indeed, the combination of this form of “popular constitutionalism” with
                  the mass mobilization potential of the unstamped weeklies provoked intense
                  Government surveillance of all radical activities, with two secret committees
                  appointed to report on any links to “revolutionary” acts like the attack on the
                  Prince Regent at the opening of Parliament in early 1817. Directly out of this
                  parliamentary backlash against the Radical movement came the suspension of Habeas
                  Corpus and the “Gagging Acts”. Not long after Cobbett left England and almost
                  certain arrest, sailing from Liverpool in March and arriving in New York in May.
                  This “defection” from the Radical movement, as Thompson has called it in <title level="m">The Making of the English Working Class</title> (674), prompted much
                  consternation from those that remained, not least Wooler, but Cobbett persisted as
                  a powerful print presence through the publication of his two-pence <title level="j">Register</title> from July, and with the contemporaneous acceleration
                  of the forgery prosecutions, the absent radical leader made a dramatic print
                  intervention from America with an audacious attack on the entire paper money
                  system in the cause of political reform.</p>
                  <p>The immediate context for this kind of intervention was especially favourable to
                  the critiques being made of the economic and political system by radical reformers
                  like Cobbett and Wooler. With the suspension of gold payments in 1797, the Bank of
                  England introduced £1 and £2 paper notes for mass circulation, and, due to the
                  uneven quality of these notes, a precipitous rise in prosecutions for both
                  uttering and forging Banknotes was the inevitable outcome. According to the legal
                  historian Phil Handler in his essay “Forging the Agenda: The 1819 Select Committee
                  on the Criminal Laws Revisited”, the number of prosecutions rose from 4 in the
                  fourteen years prior to 1797, to 972 in the twenty years that followed the
                  Restriction. London, with its complex commercial economy, was at the centre of
                  these prosecutions, and, as Handler observes, the Bank “was able to manipulate the
                  system by allowing some offenders to plead guilty to a non-capital charge of
                  possession, whilst prosecuting those who refused to plead guilty or who were
                  particularly persistent offenders, with the capital offence of forging or uttering
                  counterfeit notes” (252). The result of such an inherently arbitrary application
                  of the law was that nearly one third of those hanged in the capital in the first
                  eighteen years of the century were convicted of forgery. “This severity ensured
                  that forgery retained a central position in public perceptions of the criminal
                  law”, writes Handler, and in the postwar period, “when the volume of forged notes
                  in circulation increased rapidly…the Bank’s prosecutions began to arouse serious
                  controversy” (252). The Bank of England—the single most important financial
                  institution in the country—was now seen, through penalty of death, to be enforcing
                  the nation’s corrupt economic order. </p>
                  <p>In August of 1818, amidst an increasing public crisis over the forgery
                  prosecutions, Cobbett used his two-penny <title level="j">Register</title> to
                  highlight the illegitimacy of Bank of England notes, extending his argument from
                  the “Paper Against Gold” series almost a decade earlier about the paper money
                  system and proposing specific actions to undermine its very foundations in the
                  country. Writing from his Long Island, New York exile, he assails the continued
                  legislative support for the suspension of cash payments and its intimate
                  connection to the entire material edifice of Old Corruption: “The truth is, that
                  it is <emph>impossible</emph> for them to pay in coin, <emph>without putting an
                     end to their power</emph>, which exists only because people imagine, that the
                  bubble is not a bubble. They are more in debt than all the lands, houses, mines
                  and canals would sell for by auction, if there were any bidders to lay down the
                  money.” As in his earlier article series, Cobbett highlights the political economy
                  of this financial arrangement constructed by the nation’s elite. “They throw off
                  the burden, at present, upon <emph>the labour of the people</emph>”, he argues,
                  and, adds darkly: “but, will they do this at <emph>a day of reckoning!</emph>”
                     (<title level="j">Register</title> 34 [22 Aug. 1818], 8). The means for
                  facilitating this financial “day of reckoning”—Cobbett’s so-called “puff-out”
                  plan—features in much of the article’s subsequent discussion. </p>
                  <p>Before he lays out the details of his plan for undermining the paper money system,
                  Cobbett reminds his audience of the ideological nature of what he calls the
                  “infernal funding system’—a system that “must produce misery as general as the
                  air, and more severe than misery was ever before known” (13). What began as a
                  wartime expedient to account for the shortage of gold was now being perpetuated in
                  the postwar economy as part of the fiction of financial solvency for the Bank of
                  England and its associated fundholders. The current debates in Parliament about
                  delaying cash payments have only served to highlight how the nation’s financial
                  and political elite, those who “live on the Funds and Taxes”, “had an interest in
                  upholding the credit of the mischievous bubble” (14). For Cobbett, this
                  relationship between organized financial corruption and the unrepresentative
                  political system in the country was key to the sustaining of both, and hence a
                  central target of his own postwar intellectual project, embodied in efforts like
                  his 1816 print address and the present article. “It is now clear to
                     <emph>you</emph>, my friends”, he writes, “that the existence of the Borough
                  System depends entirely on that of the credit of the <emph>Paper Money</emph>; and
                  it is, I think, equally clear, that the credit of the Paper Money may, at any
                  hour, be <emph>destroyed in a moment</emph>, and that, too, as
                     <emph>quietly</emph> as we can kill a frog or toad” (15-16).</p>
                  <p>In his “puff out” scheme Cobbett cleverly amplifies the public controversy around
                  the forgery prosecutions to both undermine the legitimacy of Bank-produced paper
                  currency as well as to underscore the material social injustice of the corrupt
                  postwar economic system it emblematized. “It is the <emph>uttering </emph>of the
                  forged paper that causes all the detections and all the hangings. Men utter it,
                  because they want food, raiment, and drink, in exchange”, he reasons. “But, if the
                  nation, goaded into deep enterprize, should, one of these fine mornings, find
                  itself amidst abundance of Bank Notes, <emph>picked up in the streets</emph>, or
                  taken out of <emph>post-letters</emph>, who, from that day forth, would ever
                     <emph>take a Bank Note</emph>? Hard money alone would pass. Wheat would be
                     <emph>three shillings a bushel</emph>. The bubble and the Borough-mongers would
                  drop dead as a clod” (16). Drawing upon the moral currency of the unstamped press
                  as his vehicle of radical resistance, Cobbett provides his substantial audience of
                  readers and listeners with the methods for bringing down the postwar economic and
                  political system, announcing: “To throw forged Bank notes (<emph>knowing them to
                     be forged</emph>) about the street, or on the highways, or to put them into
                  letters to go by post, is to <emph>utter </emph>them. But, who is to
                     <emph>detect</emph> the <emph>utterer</emph>?” (17). This strategy has the
                  practical effect of undermining the basic currency of London’s complex commercial
                  economy while also demonstrating the manifest absurdity of the current policy of
                  enforcement: “All money transactions would be at a stand. No buying, no selling. A
                  Bank note would be rejected as something beneath contempt,” Cobbett observes
                  (21).</p>
                  <p>Cobbett’s scheme was premised on the assumption that paper currency was, as Kevin
                  Gilmartin has put it, “the weakest link in a corrupt system, and the most
                  promising ‘point’ of radical resistance” (<title level="m">Print Politics</title>
                  163-4). It indicated a wider transition in Cobbett’s project of radical
                  opposition, mirroring the means by which the corrupt political order attempted to
                  maintain its dominance, as Gilmartin has argued: “Cobbett's ‘puff-out’ rested on
                  the sense that a historical shift in oppressive power from force to fraud required
                  a corresponding shift in political resistance” (164). In this 1818 <title level="j">Register</title> article, much like in his 1816 print address, he
                  empowers a marginalized and persecuted section of the postwar economy with a
                  political agency otherwise unavailable to it. “And, as to the means of making this
                  attack; as to the means of dealing this <emph>decisive blow</emph>,” Cobbett
                  writes, “they are in the hands of thousands upon thousands of men, who are now in
                  England, and who <emph>must</emph> wish to see the system destroyed.” Crucially,
                  this plan of popular forgery rests on the democratization of printing, using
                  forged notes as a material counterweight to the official paper money system in a
                  suitably symbolic response to Government attempts at the regulation of the radical
                  press: “The means are <emph>graving tools</emph>, price five shillings, perhaps
                     A<emph> printing apparatus </emph>that a man may keep in a cubic foot of space.
                     <emph>Some paper</emph>. And the operator’s <emph>own dwelling
                  house</emph>”(18).</p>
                  <p>The aim of this proposed act of mass forgery is made perfectly clear: “There are
                  no means of preventing it except that of <emph>putting an end to the</emph>
                     <emph>Paper-Money</emph>; and that is all that any one would wish to accomplish;
                  for, then we know that the Borough and Dungeon, and Spy system is at an end” (19).
                  Cobbett’s “puff-out” scheme would be very difficult to enforce against,
                  highlighting the structural weaknesses of a corrupt and elitely administered
                  political and economic system, as he emphasizes: “Neither Judge nor packed Jury,
                  nor Circular Letter, nor Bill of Indemnity, could avail aught against <emph>this
                     blow</emph>. Their Yeomanry Cavalry might sally forth prancing and swearing to
                  hack the wind. The Bank would meet in <emph>select committee</emph> and the Privy
                  Council, with Eldon and Canning amongst them, would be called together by Lord
                  Liverpool, who, when proposing the Dungeon Bill, said that Ministers were
                  ‘resolved to pursue the STERN path of <emph>duty</emph>’ ” (20-21). Perhaps the
                  most important feature of Cobbett’s “puff-out” plan is that it serves to remind
                  his audience of the profoundly ideological nature of the paper money system, with
                  a clear attack on the wealth and power of its primary beneficiaries, the
                  “fund-holders” and their political servants, the “Boroughmongers”. The political
                  function of the current financial arrangements —a key point of discussion in
                  “Paper Against Gold”—would be exposed for all to see: “They fear, that the nation
                  would never suffer them to keep estates, bought principally with the borrowed
                  money, while the lenders, however foolish and base, were starving; and, I am sure,
                  that their fear is well-founded” (23-4). The plan would strike this corrupt
                  politico-economic system at its roots, as Cobbett declares: “What a pretty
                     <emph>foundation</emph> does the Boroughmonger system stand upon, then? This is
                  their ‘solid system of finance,’ is it?” (25).</p>
                  <p>As these assessments demonstrate, Cobbett’s “puff-out” plan should be understood
                  in the wider context of the Radical reform movement during an episode of political
                  crisis in the country’s capital city and financial centre. The increasing sense of
                  injustice surrounding the forgery prosecutions and widespread suspicion cast upon
                  Bank currency at this time only served to emphasize the need for immediate and
                  major reform of the nation’s political and economic system. Cobbett is at pains to
                  make clear that his mass forgery plan is above all intended to assist in the
                  larger cause of radical reform, something he was keen to remind a British radical
                  audience from his exile across the Atlantic: “If I am asked, what <emph>inducement
                  </emph>any body can have to make Bank Notes in order to scatter them about the
                  streets and high-ways, I answer; what <emph>inducements</emph> have any of us
                  Reformers had, and have, for any of our exertions in the cause of Reform?” (24).
                  Eliminating the hold of paper money on the postwar economy was a precondition to
                  political reform: “A Reform would certainly put an end to the paper-money; but,
                  the <emph>existence</emph> of the latter it is that has hitherto
                     <emph>prevented</emph> the Reform” (27). Empowering his plebeian audience with
                  such a key role in the larger struggle for political reform was surely a
                  continuing reminder to the Establishment of the potency of the radical press in
                  general and his <title level="j">Register</title> in particular: “This, then, is
                  the <emph>mighty </emph>Boroughmonger System! A thing which a Cobler with his awl
                  may annihilate. There is no need of daggers for the many-headed monster. It may be
                  killed as easy as a Hanoverian cracks a louse that he finds in his whiskers. A
                  little money to buy <emph>paper</emph>. That is all that is wanted; and, as to
                  such a sum for such a purpose, what is it!” (26). The same could be said, of
                  course, for the two pence paid by those reading about Cobbett’s audacious
                  “puff-out” plan throughout the country. </p>
                  <p>Almost three weeks later Cobbett’s main rival in the plebeian public sphere, T. J.
                  Wooler, published an impassioned protest against the forgery prosecutions in his
                     <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> that complemented the exiled radical
                  leader’s attack on the morality of the regime brutally enforcing the paper money
                  system. In an article from September 1818 entitled “FORGERY OF BANK NOTES”, Wooler
                  expressed profound scepticism about the means by which those accused of forging
                  and uttering Bank notes had been convicted, arguing: “Before life is taken, the
                     <emph>best</emph> and <emph>strongest</emph> proof that can be obtained, ought
                  assuredly to be demanded.” The use of Bank employees as primary witnesses in
                  recent successful prosecutions “has given <emph>value</emph> and
                     <emph>force</emph> to…<emph>vague assertions</emph>, and they pass for proof”,
                  with the result that the accused “is sacrificed to <emph>protect the Bank</emph>”
                  with his life (<title level="j">Black Dwarf </title>2 [9 Sep. 1818], 562). In
                  situations like this, the aim behind Cobbett’s “puff-out” plan is presented as a
                  valid means to highlighting the deeply corrupt enforcement system in the service
                  of the Bank of England: “Suppose it should assert that <emph>all its notes</emph>
                  were <emph>forgeries!</emph> and bring <emph>all its servants</emph> to assert
                     <emph>the fact!</emph> What would the Judge recommend the Juries to do with the
                  possessors of them?” (562).</p>
                  <p>Unlike Cobbett’s “puff-out” scheme in the <title level="j">Register</title>,
                  however, Wooler’s impressive print battle against the forgery prosecutions in
                     <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> places the judicial system itself on
                  public trial for its role in the wider paper money system, as Phil Handler notes:
                  “He conducted a campaign designed to subvert the Bank prosecutions and
                  specifically urged jurors to reject the Bank’s evidence in the trials” (“Forging
                  the Agenda” 253). This aim is dramatically set out in “FORGERY OF BANK NOTES”,
                  with Wooler citing a contemporary case to add a sense of immediacy to his crusade:
                  “To support the system, <emph>homicide</emph> has been <emph>legalized</emph>; and
                  the name of <emph>law</emph> has been prostituted, and perverted to such a degree,
                  that <emph>a</emph>
                     <emph>Judge</emph> exclaims in the most <emph>evident astonishment</emph>,
                     <emph>‘What! come into a Court of Justice to talk about moral right, or moral
                     wrong!’</emph> There is something so monstrous in this, as imperiously to
                  demand the public interference, lest justice should indeed <emph>perish</emph>
                  beneath the load which miscalled <emph>law</emph> has heaped upon her” (561). That
                  this judicial farce in the service of the Bank of England often ends in death for
                  those accused only reinforces the urgency of the cultural resistance carried out
                  in the pages of <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> against the paper money
                  system. “The <emph>authors</emph> of the misery that prevails, <emph>ought</emph>
                     <emph>to be</emph> more honest,” Wooler implores, “than to drive men to
                  wretchedness, to tempt them into a commission of a crime, and then to seize the
                  life as forfeit to their power, which has been overcome by their temptation.”
                  Echoing Cobbett, he asserts: “Nothing is easier than <emph>to forge bank
                     notes</emph>—except <emph>the uttering of them</emph> when they are forged—and
                     <emph>both</emph> are punished with the last of human sacrifices, the
                  punishment of death!!!” (561).</p>
                  <p>Wooler’s sustained print campaign in the plebeian public sphere against the
                  forgery prosecutions focused on the integrity of the jury system as a symbolic
                  battleground for wider public opinion around the issue of paper money.<note resp="editors" place="foot">A more thorough discussion of
                     Wooler’s jury-focused campaign can be found in Handler, “The Limits of
                     Discretion” 160-65. </note> In a follow up front-page <title level="j">Black
                     Dwarf</title> article published two weeks after the “FORGERY OF BANK NOTES”,
                  Wooler defended the intellectual autonomy of the British jury system as an
                  essential moral counterweight to an inherently corrupt legal process. “To suppose
                     <emph>because a bad law exists</emph>, affecting the <emph>lives</emph> of
                  Englishmen, that Juries must become <emph>parties to its execution</emph>, is an
                  absurdity,” he writes. Elaborating on this theme, Wooler observes: <quote>The Jury
                     is called, by the <emph>intent</emph> and <emph>spirit </emph>of all just
                     legislation, to decide upon the <emph>moral guilt</emph> of the party
                     accused—to ascertain <emph>what injury</emph> he has done to society—and to
                     determine what punishment is merited:—and if there be no medium between
                     inflicting an unjust, and cruelly severe punishment upon the offender, and
                     suffering him entirely to escape, few juries will hereafter hesitate to
                     pronounce, “that it is better <emph>many</emph> should <emph>escape</emph>,
                     than one unjustly suffer.” </quote> Crucially, he presents the moral and
                  intellectual autonomy of the jury in these forgery prosecutions as an extension of
                  a wider—and more compassionate—public opinion on the issue, adding: “Public
                  feeling always revolts at <emph>unnecessary cruelty </emph>:—but when cruelly is
                     <emph>useless,</emph> as well as <emph>unnecessary</emph>, there is an end to
                  all reasoning against it” (<title level="m">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [23 Sep. 1818],
                  593). A key element of this public outrage centred around the arbitrary nature of
                  Bank-sponsored prosecutions and executions for forging and uttering Banknotes,
                  something that Wooler directs his audience’s attention to as a rallying point for
                  wider political resistance on the issue: “The Bank is perfectly aware, if it
                  attempted to execute <emph>half its victims</emph>, they would be rescued from the
                  scaffold by the public indignation. A mere statement of the numbers implicated
                  will sufficiently prove that no government dare carry the law into effect,” he
                  suggests, in a clear echo of Cobbett’s immediate objectives for his “puff-out”
                  plan (597). With the judicial system so distorted by its obligations to the Bank
                  over the prosecutions, Wooler argues that juries in these cases have now become
                  the public embodiment of political justice, constituting a kind of symbolic
                  avant-garde of radical resistance to the entire paper money regime in the country:
                  “the whole system is sadly in want of a revision—and if the legislature should
                  continue to neglect its duty, let a few humane and resolute jurymen refuse to find
                  verdicts for the Bank, and necessity will effect what ought to be the result of
                  justice” (600).</p>
                  <p>This campaign against the forgery prosecutions in <title level="j">The Black
                     Dwarf</title> emphasized the transformative role of radical knowledge in the
                  public sphere. In a headline article from October 1818 Wooler attempts to clarify
                  the immediate duty of the radical press as a democratic check on the corrupt
                  political and economic system, while demonstrating how it can also be used as an
                  important vehicle for reform in its own right. He recounts a typical case of
                  prosecution for uttering Banknotes as a thematic preface to the editorial
                  article—where the poor quality of official Banknotes and confusion over what
                  constitutes an expert opinion on forged notes makes the capital nature of the
                  offence so morally appalling. “The deformity of the system encreases, as it is
                  developed; and the hideous features of the paper demon become blacker as they are
                  exposed to the sun,” Wooler declares to his audience, inviting them to share in
                  his indignation. “The mind sickens to disgust at the hideous measures taken to
                  sustain the blood-cemented fabric of paper currency; and turn with horror from the
                  perspective immolations, which are destined to supply the future appetite for
                  carnage,” he adds (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [14 Oct. 1818], 641).
                  With the clarity of an expert prosecutor probing the criminal malfeasance of the
                  accused in the court of public opinion, Wooler gets to the heart of the injustice
                  surrounding the forgery trials, “No one can read the uncertainty which pervades
                  all the proceedings on this rotten foundation, without being convinced that
                     <emph>the Bank</emph> is guilty of nearly all the mischiefs that flow from the
                  offence of forgery,” he charges. “<emph>It has no certain means of distinguishing
                     its own notes</emph>. This is demonstrated by <emph>its servants paying bad
                     ones</emph>—those <emph>very servants</emph> who are called upon
                     <emph>occasionally</emph>, and who ought always to be called, to pronounce upon
                  the authenticity of those stated to be forgeries” (642). Without an objective and
                  transparent basis for what constitutes a forged Banknote, Wooler argues, the
                  entire legal edifice upon which the prosecutions are being conducted is
                  undermined. Appealing to a plebeian public familiar with the importance of skill
                  and accuracy in their working practices, Wooler asserts: “In the present advanced
                  state of the arts, it is impossible to produce any engraving that might not be
                  imitated more or less perfectly.” When “bank notes are so <emph>miserably
                     executed</emph>”, he suggests, “<emph>any engraver’s</emph> apprentice could
                  counterfeit them with the utmost facility” (644). This is followed by a lengthy
                  critique of the Bank’s production process from a Liverpool correspondent that
                  highlights the lack of craftsmanship and precision in its practices (644-45). In
                  short, Wooler provides his own “expert” witness in print form to add to his public
                  indictment of the Bank in the executions associated with the forgery crisis. </p>
                  <p>It is fitting that the leading radical journal of the postwar plebeian public
                  sphere would emphasize the importance of older, artisanal production practices as
                  a necessary corrective to the contemporary problems associated with the paper
                  money system, but Wooler’s aims go beyond this kind of local reform. As both Alex
                  Dick and Phil Handler have argued in respective studies of the forgery crisis,
                  Wooler was instrumental in publicizing the immorality of the forgery executions as
                  an emblem of the “bloody code” in the nineteenth century, where death was still
                  used as a punishment for property crime.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See Dick 390-91; and Handler, “Forging the Agenda” 253 and

                     <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> lead article, he reminds his audience of
                  just what was at stake in the public debates over the forgery prosecutions:
                     <quote>To contribute to rescue one from the scaffold, will be a greater
                     consolation to the BLACK DWARF, than the death of a million of sacrifices to
                     the system can be to the ministry, or to the Bank. The policy of capital
                     punishment for <emph>any crime save that of murder</emph>, begins to be doubted
                     by every humane mind; but that forgery and the utterance of forged notes,
                     should be punished with death, excites disgust in all, save those who profit by
                     the law (646).</quote> By drawing attention to the key role played by his
                  journal in these battles for public opinion during the forgery crisis, Wooler
                  underscores how radical knowledge can help to transform the wider public debate by
                  identifying those economic and political agents who work against the establishment
                  of democratic values in the country. “Awaked as the public mind is at present to
                  the subject, it is not to be expected that the repose of the Bank should be left
                  quite undisturbed as it has been,” he writes. “Insult and oppression have been all
                  that the public have received from an acquiescence in the paper system. To that
                  public is committed the expression of its own opinion, when the collected facts
                  are laid before the public tribunal” (646-47). </p>
                  <p>In an opening <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> article from 25 November
                  directly addressed to “the Directors of the Bank of England”, Wooler extends his
                  trial of the forgery prosecutions in the court of public opinion, presenting
                  himself as a lead spokesman for a radical and rational public sphere capable of
                  providing some effective moral judgement upon the shambolic nature of the official
                  legal proceedings. “To appeal to your humanity, or sense of justice, would be
                  useless,” he begins. “Your interest has perverted the one and deadened the other
                  to a degree which would render you entirely callous to such an appeal.” In place
                  of any “appeal” to the Bank—or the courts who have so shamelessly served it during
                  the forgery crisis—Wooler instead emphasizes the moral autonomy and ideological
                  authority of the radical press as an alternative vehicle for justice: “It remains,
                  therefore, for the public to do itself that justice which you deny—to express its
                  abhorrence of the system, in which you triumph, and as far as in them lies, to
                  lend themselves no longer to the destructive practices of the system to which your
                  establishment belongs, as an integral part.” This is a significant moment in the
                  forgery crisis, where the leading intellectual opponent of the prosecutions
                  asserts the full force of radical public opinion against the moral authority of a
                  corrupt state and its principal financial institution. “To enlighten that public,”
                  Wooler continues, “and not with the hope of converting you, is the object of the
                  present compilation of the evidences of the falsehood of the fabric upon which
                  prosecutions for the utterance of forged, or pretended forged, notes is erected”
                     (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [25 Nov. 1818], 737). </p>
                  <p>Wooler lists a series of “charges” against the Bank that the “pages of the Black
                  Dwarf have already recorded”, “sufficient testimony”, he argues, “to induce every
                  honest juryman to pause before he surrenders his <emph>conscience to the
                     Bank</emph>, and his sense of <emph>mercy</emph> to the <emph>Bench</emph>”
                  (737). These include the following: the ease and accuracy of forgery; the
                  ignorance and duplicity of the chief witnesses; the poor quality of official
                  Banknotes; the lack of substantial evidence against the accused; the obvious
                  ideological interests of the court Judges; and finally—and perhaps most morally
                  dubious in capital cases—the lack of judicial rigour in accepting “expert” opinion
                  for what he calls “positive evidence” (737-38). With the threat of the full force
                  of popular radical opinion behind him, Wooler writes to the Bank Directors: “You
                  can no longer hope to <emph>deceive</emph>. Your practices are exposed; and the
                  exposition will proceed with increasing conviction of their fatal—their unjust
                  tendency” (738). The paper currency of the radical weekly is here presented as the
                  true emblem of national democratic values and the only real repository of justice
                  in the affair, in place of the elaborate monetary deceptions, judicial corruption
                  and elite political interests represented by the now blood-stained paper currency
                  of the Bank of England. In the pages that follow, Wooler enacts a radical print
                  trial of the Bank and its prosecutions, complete with his own “expert witness” (“a
                     <emph>practical workman</emph>”), re-creation of relevant court arguments, and
                  critiques of the tenuous legal basis for guilty verdicts, taken in part from
                  correspondence with <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> by readers and
                  subscribers (738-43). He also reminds the Bank Directors of the increasing
                  national reach of opposition to the paper money system, owed in no small part to
                  the role played by periodicals like <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title>: “It
                  is not only in <emph>London </emph>that ‘<emph>the System</emph>,’ is known and
                     <emph>hated</emph>. Common sense has travelled into the country; and every mail
                  brings to the ear some fresh remonstrance, or some fresh proof of the discontent
                  that so generally prevails against your ‘<emph>system</emph>”’ (741). </p>
                  <p>In December 1818 the Old Bailey became the principal battleground over the fate of
                  the paper money system. Wooler’s print crusade in <title level="j">The Black
                     Dwarf</title> against the evidential basis of the forgery prosecutions was
                  beginning to resonate, as Phil Handler has noted: “the dominant feeling of jurors
                  in the forgery trials towards the end of 1818 was distrust of the Bank and the
                  paper money system it was concerned to protect” (“The Limits of Discretion” 162).
                  Juries at the trials of John Williams and John Dye acquitted the accused based on
                  the dubious nature of Bank-sponsored evidence.<note resp="editors" place="foot"> See Handler, “The Limits of Discretion” 161. </note>
                  Wooler’s response to the acquittals celebrates the efficacy of radical public
                  opinion in the crisis. “We have not attacked the wicked system adopted on behalf
                  of this <emph>tottering Mammoth</emph> without effect,” he opens the lead article
                  in the 9 December issue of <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title>, titled
                  “DEFEAT OF THE BANK”. He continues, “We have aroused, and concentrated, public
                  opinion on this vital question; and enjoy the triumph which we were only able to
                  suggest, with the most heartfelt congratulation.” Wooler adds, “ALL is
                     <emph>safe</emph>, when a BRITISH JURY is fairly appealed to” (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [9 Dec. 1818], 769), in a reference perhaps to recent
                  high profile radical acquittals by juries defying judicial prejudice, like that of
                  William Hone a year earlier at the Guildhall. </p>
                  <p>It is clear, however, that Wooler has a much larger target than the issue of
                  judicial corruption in these cases. For him, the dominance of the paper money
                  system—as well as its corrupt legal apparatus—was shown to be vulnerable when
                  challenged by directed radical publicity in the public sphere. “To destroy these
                  practices was worthy the ambition of a <emph>giant</emph>; and the success, it is
                  hoped, will do some credit to the efforts of a <emph>Dwarf</emph>,” he suggests to
                  his audience, with a considerable degree of pride (769). The paper money system
                  “has now a <emph>rough road </emph>to proceed upon, and is stumbling at every pace
                  upon some fragments of the wreck of national and individual welfare.” He asks:
                  “Who will be found to lend any assistance to its wheels, that he may be himself
                     <emph>crushed under them</emph>?” (769-70). At the article’s conclusion Wooler
                  links the immediate triumph of the December forgery acquittals to the wider
                  project for radical political reform: <quote>The system feels the shock through
                     all the ramifications of corruption—and trembles through every fibre of its
                     dependents. It is in Threadneedle Street that the foundation of our miseries
                     was laid—it is <emph>there</emph> they must be redressed. <emph>There</emph>,
                     in the very temple of our oppressors must the banner of our emancipation be
                     erected; and it is <emph>there</emph>, that national justice, and national
                     humanity, ought to inscribe on tablets of brass the immortal names of those
                     Jurymen, who have “dared to be honest, in the worst of times!” (775). </quote>
                  This call for the heroic memorialisation of the forgery jurors in <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> was echoed during another period of crisis in the
                  radical reform movement, when Wooler would suggest to his audience that the names
                  of those martyred at Peterloo “should be collected, and a pretty little book
                  compiled, to keep in memory for ever the bloody transactions of the day” (<title level="m">Black Dwarf</title> 3 [25 Aug. 1819], 552). This comparison between
                  the forgery jurors and the Radical protesters is significant, and not simply for
                  the link it provides between two key episodes in postwar radicalism. Alex Dick has
                  observed that “the same class of people that acquitted the Banknote forgers in
                  December, 1818 were also those who gathered at St. Peter’s field eight months
                  later” (393), drawing our attention back to the manner in which Wooler used the
                  forgery jurors as symbolic surrogates for his audience in the wider plebeian
                  public sphere, and how he would reprise this in his Peterloo writings about those
                  martyred demonstrators for a wider Radical movement in desperate need of
                  alternative means of protesting the state’s brutal political repression in
                     Manchester.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For an

                  </p>
                  <p>Despite the euphoria that accompanied the acquittals, in the 16 December 1818
                  issue of <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title>, under the headline of
                  “MURDER!!!”, Wooler depicts a paper money system both soaking in blood and scarred
                  by legal hypocrisy after the execution orders for three men were announced for
                  “passing bad notes”, as he puts it (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [16
                  Dec. 1818], 784). That they were convicted on a similar evidentiary basis to those
                  who were acquitted the week earlier only adds to the public perception of
                  calculated state injustice. In a direct attack on the Home Secretary, Lord
                  Sidmouth, Wooler again sets himself the role as the spokesman for an outraged
                  popular public casting damning moral judgement on a corrupt and murderous regime
                  in dire need of radical reform. “The public has been insulted by the deliberate
                  sacrifice of three wretched individuals: and Lord Sidmouth has been the
                  officiating priest at the altar of our infuriate Moloch,” he writes, in reference
                  to the paper money system. “The public must speak,” Wooler implores, “and speak in
                  thunder, to the feelings of this heartless man” (783). This lead article includes
                  a petition written on behalf of the condemned utterers to the Prince Regent, a
                  letter of protest to the Home Secretary, and perhaps most poignantly, a petition
                  from the men themselves taken from a Sunday newspaper to conclude the piece
                  (784-86, 789-90).</p>
                  <p>In his final comments Wooler returns to a theme pursued throughout <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> print campaign against the forgery
                  prosecutions. “An <emph>unjust law</emph> is NO LAW, and ought not to influence
                  juries to <emph>do wrong</emph>,” he argues. In an appeal to his audience in the
                  wider plebeian public sphere—many of whom, like the condemned, with a first-hand
                  experience of the corrupt paper money system—Wooler writes: “A partial law is a
                  disgrace to justice: and while hundreds of utterers of forged notes are allowed to
                  escape the penalty of the law, all who are made to undergo that penalty are
                  unjustly put to death; and before a higher than an earthly tribunal, the offence
                  will not be deemed the less, because it is shared by many, and justified by a
                  perverted statute.” To emphasize the political nature of the executions—and the
                  bloody monetary system they are intended to protect—Wooler directly implicates
                  Sidmouth in the murder of the condemned: “May the spectres of his victims be
                  constantly before his eyes! May his sleep never again be tranquil, until he atones
                  for his fault by laying down an office he is every way unqualified to fill.” “Even
                  his friends startle at his conduct,” Wooler adds, “and many admirers of ‘<emph>the
                     system</emph>,’ confess they do not like it disfigured with blood” (789).</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the legal historian Phil Handler has commented that the immediate effect
                  of the executions, along with the earlier acquittals, “precipitated a crisis
                  within the criminal justice system and a widespread debate on the best means of
                  preventing forgery” (“Forging the Agenda” 253). Handler argues that the “trials
                  and executions for forgery provided a stark public reminder of the evils of the
                  paper system and the unreliability of Bank of England notes”, thus adding to “the
                  political momentum towards a resumption of cash payments” and galvanizing “the
                  criminal law reform movement”. He observes: “At the beginning of the 1819
                  parliamentary session the government had no intention of tackling the cash
                  payments issue or initiating a full-scale inquiry into the operation of the
                  criminal laws, but by March it had conceded both issues” (256). These comments
                  remind us of the political efficacy of directed publicity in the plebeian public
                  sphere, where sustained analysis and argument transmitted by leading radical
                  weeklies like Cobbett’s <title level="j">Political Register</title> and Wooler’s
                     <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> provided a national platform for
                  issues—like the paper money system—that had a disproportionate material impact on
                  the everyday lives of their audience. The ideological relevance of the radical
                  press at this time even provoked a reconsideration of the “bloody code” itself, as
                  Handler has demonstrated. The report of a parliamentary Select Committee appointed
                  to examine the legal basis of capital punishment explicitly cited the forgery
                  executions as a manifestation of public alienation with the capital laws, and in a
                  tone of moral disapproval similar to that found in the pages of the radical press:
                  “There is no offence in which the infliction of death seems more repugnant to the
                  strong and general and declared sense of the Public, than forgery; there is no
                  other in which there appears to prevail a greater compassion for the offender and
                  more horror at capital executions” (qtd. in “Forging the Agenda” 259). </p>
                  <p>Cobbett and Wooler’s opposition to the paper money system and its often brutal
                  legal enforcement demonstrate how the production and dissemination of radical
                  knowledge in the plebeian public sphere effectively confronted a corrupt and
                  bloody political and economic order. More significantly, the critical debates
                  around the paper money system initiated by these two leading radical intellectuals
                  of the early nineteenth century allow us to see how dedicated strategies of
                  cultural resistance were developed in response to the immediate needs of their
                  readers and listeners, and how these popular concerns were fed back into the wider
                  public debate about the relationship between paper money and judicial violence in
                  an unreformed polity. “Resentment of the Bank and the paper system was at the
                  heart of the forgery crisis,” Phil Handler observes. “Radicals harnessed public
                  concern over the problem of forged notes to further their own attack on Old
                  Corruption, which in turn threw many of the inadequacies of the criminal justice
                  system into sharp relief” (“Forging the Agenda” 262). Perhaps fittingly,
                  throughout this episode of political repression and economic crisis the paper
                  currency of radical periodicals like the <title level="j">Register</title> and
                     <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> became, for its audience, the most
                  prominent emblem of their democratic aspirations, material welfare and desire for
                  justice against the multifarious deceptions of the Bank, state and judicial
                  systems. </p>
