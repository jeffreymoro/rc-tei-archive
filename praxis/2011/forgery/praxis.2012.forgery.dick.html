               <p>In 1822, the Scottish adventurer Sir Gregor MacGregor issued a bond on the London
                  Stock Exchange to fund a British colony, Poyais, on the Mosquito Coast of Eastern
                  Central America. A veteran of the Peninsular campaign and the Bolivian War of Independence—he
                  was married to Simon de Bolivar’s sister—MacGregor told his investors, mostly fellow
                  Scots, that he had family connections to the Darien expedition of the 1690s and the
                  Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. He even claimed to be descended from Rob Roy MacGregor,
                  who had been recently immortalized in a novel by Walter Scott. A national infrastructure
                  and civil service, he bragged, were already waiting in Poyais for lawyers, bankers,
                  and merchants. MacGregor raised close to 200,000 pounds; the next year, three ships
                  carrying 240 settlers crossed the Atlantic. </p>
               <p>By August, 180 of them were dead. The British press, always on the lookout for charlatans,
                  accused MacGregor for having summarily duped his investors. Poyais, they said, was
                  a fraud, a fiction, a country that didn’t exist. Interestingly, most of the surviving
                  settlers accused MacGregor’s agents and publicists, not MacGregor himself, for spreading
                  false information about the colony. But MacGregor had already decamped to France.
                  For the next fifteen years, he tried to sell his Poyais scheme, at one point even
                  penning a constitution, but he could not attract any further investment. He moved
                  to Venezuela in 1838 and died penniless in 1845.</p>

                  <p>Gregor MacGregor was one of many pseudo-aristocratic fraudsters whose stories enliven
                     historical accounts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century bubbles and booms, from
                     John Law’s Missisippi Scheme of 1720 to the Railway Bubble satirized in Trollope’s <em>The Way We Live Now</em> (1875).

                     </div> Recently, however, historians of the Latin American and Caribbean independence movements
                     have reassessed the relationship between military heroism, financial investment, and
                     print culture to suggest that figures like MacGregor embody a complex mixture of fact
                     and fiction, force and fraud, tradition and temerity that underlies the hybrid American
                     identity (Brown). Likewise, literary scholars have argued that forgery and fraud in
                     the Romantic period can hardly be understood simply in terms of a stark difference
                     between fiction and fact; rather they must be treated as evidence of a new kind of
                     subjective and, indeed, aesthetic consciousness in which truth and lies are always
                     blurred.

                     </div> Studies as different in kind as Tom Mole’s <em>Byron’s Romantic Celebrity</em>, Robert Miles’ <em>Romantic Misfits</em>, and Margot Finn’s <em>The Character of Credit</em> underscore the shifting intersections between gothic heroism, industrial print, personal
                     debt, and media manipulation that constituted a new kind of literary and cultural
                     celebrity. In this perspective, MacGregor seems less like a criminal and more like
                     a Byronic hero.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Waverley Novels, from which MacGregor drew some of his inspiration, also use the
                     historical mystique of a Scottish cultural tradition to manufacture a myth of spectacular
                     heroism to ground both the threat and the banality of Britain’s speculative commerce.
                     Following Burke, Ferguson, and other “conservative” thinkers, Scott put monarchy at
                     the centre of a pan-British <span class="foreign">bildung</span> to guarantee national unity and economic purpose. The spectacle of the British monarchy
                     was the standard—both literally and figuratively speaking—for its speculative finance
                     and trade economy. I use the word “speculative” here in two senses: (1) as a synonym
                     for “visual” in the sense that the hero or monarch who guarantees an investment tends
                     to be visible or at least represented in highly iconographic terms; (2) to connote
                     a sense of futurity or wishfulness, thereby acknowledging that the ventures being
                     guaranteed by the hero or monarch are conjectural investments in a possible future.
                     If these two uses of the term seem contradictory, they are, and most especially as
                     they are used by Scott. Thus, to take a familiar example, in <em>Waverley</em> the idea of a reclaimed Stuart monarchy is embodied in the noble figure of Prince
                     Charles, though his gambling and foolhardiness are also indications of the “speculative”
                     nature of the Jacobite campaign. Scott’s monarchs are not absolutists. Bonnie Prince
                     Charlie, Richard the Lionheart, and Charles II, among other of Scott’s monarchs, are
                     fallible and sympathetic, charismatic, but often highly imaginative and, indeed, speculative.
                     They often find themselves in situations where their authority is in doubt and their
                     identities insecure. But, in the context of Scott’s historical romances, these qualities
                     lend them the sheen of realism. Monarchy is seen in Scott to be something imaginary
                     and, indeed, fictional (as it is in Burke) but nevertheless symbolically vital to
                     the unity of the nation. Scott’s brilliant fictionalizations of the monarch as someone
                     that understands the doubts and hesitations of his people, and falls into the same
                     errors and doubts, make its ghostly presence the symbolic earmark of a lost but eminently
                     valued historical tradition, one both ironic and redemptive.

               </div>
               <p>But something changed in the crisis of 1825. Scott was confronted with the possibility
                  that the “speculative” national and political identity he had constructed for Scotland
                  in his historical fictions and had linked in several of them with Scotland’s vibrant
                  paper money system—<em>The Antiquary,</em> <em>Rob Roy,</em> <em>The Fortunes of Nigel</em>—would be lost in an ocean of debts and obligations under which both he and the nation
                  found themselves. In the wake of the 1825 crisis, Scott was exposed as a bankrupt
                  and the Scottish financial system, one of the most extensive in Europe, was charged
                  with insolvency and impracticability. The solution to the crash, which included the
                  reformation of the Scottish system, was not simply the institutionalization of a fixed
                  standard of value—that had actually existed in England for a decade already—but rather
                  the centralization or, in the language of the time, consolidation of British finance
                  under the auspices of a central but largely invisible authority: the Bank of England.
                  What is important about these reforms is that this central authority had no symbolic
                  or visual presence: with the introduction of branch and deposit banking and by offering
                  many, small alternatives for investment, the Bank of England assumed a new authority
                  by diversifying itself and its services into a myriad of new exchange forms. In this
                  way, the Bank succeeded where the London Corresponding Society and the <em>Political Register</em> had failed in loosening the government’s grip on economic decisions, only this was
                  not in the service of social reform but rather of financial (and profitable) centralization.</p>
               <p>My argument is that much of Scott’s later writing can be interpreted as a response
                  to the process of financial consolidation through diversification. In several works
                  published in the years during and following his financial collapse, including his
                  most direct and sustained contribution to the debates about money, authority, and
                  standardization <em>The Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</em>, Scott would attempt to revive rhetorically a spectacular standard of value. In my
                  reading, “speculation” is not the problem which Scott and other critics of the Bank
                  of England were trying to solve. Rather speculation was an alternative to the perceived
                  consequences of financial diversification: that is, the way that the end of the wartime
                  economy and the breakdown of the old monopoly trade networks produced a highly varied
                  field of investment opportunities all existing as free but interconnected network
                  of values and units that made the financial market almost impossible to conceive in
                  humanistic or political terms. My sense is that this attempt to revive an economics
                  of spectacle, which Scott writes into <em>Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</em> succeeded as a work of rhetorical polemic but failed as a work of monetary economics,
                  in much the same way that Gregor MacGregor’s efforts to fund a colony on the back
                  of a fictionalized heritage and military exploits both succeeded and failed to create
                  a nation called Poyais. But the <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>, the collection of connected short narratives that Scott wrote in the aftermath of
                  his own bankruptcy hearings and published in early 1827, suggests a different tone
                  and a new purpose for historical fiction in the wake of the changes to the financial
                  system precipitated by the 1825 crash. While many critics appreciate the melancholia
                  that pervades these stories and the authorial narrative that connects them, I want
                  to suggest that the dismay at the failure of spectacular heroism which Scott documents
                  in <em>Chronicles</em> also offered a new way to conceive of the relation between fiction and finance. In
                  <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em> recurrent episodes of awkward or disturbed reading signal the failure of heroic specularity
                  and mark a new kind of aesthetic expression.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The Panic of 1825: Speculation or Diversification?</span></h2>
               <p>Throughout the 1820s, Scott’s publishers, Archibald Constable and James Ballantyne,
                  issued handsome advances to their authors. They hoped to generate a culture of gentlemanly
                  condescension and respect that would belie their fundamentally commercial provenance
                  (Eliot 94). In the meantime, through his London agents, Constable had invested heavily
                  in the Latin American mining boom. By the end of 1825, caught in the tailspin of a
                  financial bust, both houses were in serious trouble. Their most coveted asset and
                  heaviest backer, Walter Scott, found himself in debt for more than 120,000 pounds.
                  The following spring, in a hearing at Chancery meant to preempt bankruptcy proceedings,
                  the judges gave Scott a choice: either sell Abbotsford or assign a sizeable proportion
                  of the proceeds for all forthcoming works to his creditors. Scott agreed to the latter.
                  Scott’s publishing interests were signed over to Robert Cadell, whom Scott regarded
                  as a middle-class upstart. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To fulfill his financial obligations, but also to stem the tide of depression, Scott
                     embarked on one his most productive periods: he completed a novel, <em>Woodstock</em>, the 9-volume <em>Life of Napoleon</em>, a collection of stories, <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>, the first volumes of his history of Scotland, <em>Tales of Grandfather</em>, several essays and reviews, and, in a brazen act of authorial truculence, the <em>Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</em>, an impassioned defense of the Scottish credit and banking systems.

                     the complete Waverley series, the Magnum Opus. What connects these various projects
                     is their testimony to a change in Scott’s authorial appearance. No longer mystified
                     as a singular presence through the serial publication of individual novels, Scott
                     and the Author of Waverley were systematically and serially “unbound” (to borrow a
                     phrase from Benedict Anderson), that is spread through a myriad of genres and venues,
                     from the shortest note to the complete works that never quite measure up to the totality
                     they are meant to comprise. Rather than a mysterious presence on which the reading
                     public could speculate as it absorbed each successive work in turn, Scott, his pseudonyms
                     and personae, his editors and his publishers, became pieces in a puzzle that never
                     produced a coherent image.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>My interpretation of Scott’s late career is meant to suggest what happens to Romanticism
                     in the 1820s and especially in the wake of the financial crisis of 1825. This crisis
                     of 1825 is generally thought of as a “speculative bubble,” similar to earlier crises
                     such as the South Sea Bubble of 1722. But there are important differences. The South
                     Sea bubble and the Mississippi Scheme were caused by massive amounts of investment,
                     much of it fraudulent, in monopoly “Adventuring” companies. The 1825 panic was caused
                     by neither delusory investment nor imperialist autocracy but rather by a series of
                     institutional adjustments that helped turn Britain from a centralized war economy
                     to a decentralized peace economy.

                     </div> What made these adjustments precarious was not speculation but diversification. When
                     the war against Napoleon ended, the decision was made in 1816 to adopt a fully mono-metallic
                     gold standard and begin the processes necessary to resume cash payments. This could
                     not happen until the Bank of England had accrued sufficient cash reserves. But an
                     immediate curtailing of loans and notes would have caused a massive recession (which
                     happened anyway, though for different reasons). The Bank was compelled to balance
                     the need to reduce the amount of credit in circulation with the need to maintain commercial
                     credit and sustain both the economy and its own profits. They did this in several
                     ways, none of them entirely honest. First, they stockpiled a massive amount of gold
                     (newly available from the continent) in order to keep its price high and prevent its
                     customers from cashing in their notes. Then they withdrew a large number of notes
                     from circulation that the government had been relying on for various repayments. Then
                     they refused to lower discount rates to farmers and traders who had been adversely
                     affected by the post-war recession. Not surprisingly, the Bank and the government
                     received a good deal of negative press. But they received more criticism, notably
                     from radicals like Cobbett, for delaying the return to cash payments than for trying,
                     albeit for selfish motives, to slow its adverse effects.

                  <p>Once convertibility was in place, the bank and the government had to maintain their
                     own solvency. Again, several tactics were employed. The government, which had not
                     only built up a massive amount of public debt during the war years but had also, in
                     a fit of post-war political fervor, eliminated the income tax that had funded that
                     debt in the first place, issued a series of new 3% consols—bonds sold to investors
                     on the proceeds of indentured aristocratic estates and other government owned property—in
                     an attempt to stimulate investment without direct monetary controls.

                     </div> Similarly, the Bank of England did its utmost to maintain consistent price levels
                     by issuing low-yield, low-risk stocks at reduced discounts. The East-India Company
                     followed suit. As a result, brokers and consumers had a range of investment choices,
                     but this also meant that the prices of each stock tended to fluctuate in a way that
                     had not been seen during the war years when all investment had been directed at a
                     common goal. Two other factors diversified the market further. First, the government
                     introduced several infrastructure initiatives: road works, ship-building, gas lighting,
                     schools, and the like. This in turn helped to stimulate new manufacture and trade
                     and led to the formation of new firms, funds, banks, and even insurance agencies in
                     which the public could invest. Second, the resumption of cash payments and the newly-won
                     political independence of several Latin American states threw open the market in precious
                     metals. Many of the major metropolitan banks invested heavily in these mining ventures.
                     The credit produced by them stimulated the domestic securities market which in turn
                     led to the opening of more joint stock companies and country banks outside the capital.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Of course, there were charlatans and rapscallions among the mining and gasworks companies:
                     Gregor MacGregor was only the most notorious. Eventually, the amount of cheap credit
                     circulating through the market and the irregularities that the mining industry seems
                     inevitably to confront began to make investors uneasy. By the end of 1825, there were
                     bankruptcies and bank failures everywhere: some of the leading London firms went under.
                     But what is interesting about the financial “bubble” of the early 1820s is that for
                     the most part, and unlike the South Sea and Missisippi bubbles of 100 years earlier,
                     the economic activity was “real” rather than fictitious, that is, the investment actually
                     produced tangible, material results. Indeed, the leading cause of the boom was the
                     rush to invest in precious metals, the very “real” thing that was—and is—often assumed
                     to be the only correct alternative to such fictitious schemes.

                              than coin that has acted as the real medium of capital production and exchange. </span></div>
                     </div> The real cause of the panic was not credit itself, but its ready availability in small,
                     diversified portions. On their own, each of these investments represented a tangible
                     moment of economic transaction—purchasing an insurance policy, buying stock, or broking
                     a loan—and all of them have real economic intents and benefits. Collectively, however,
                     these individual transactions added up to far more activity than could be conceived
                     within the terms of a “national economy,” that is, the domestic foundation on which
                     most people based their confidence in the financial system.</p>
               </div>
               <p>When the bubble finally burst, the government and the Bank of England had no option
                  but to react in a seemingly tangible manner. The country already had a convertible
                  gold standard and, thanks to a sudden influx of metals from their trusted agent, Nathan
                  Rothschild, the Governors of the Bank of England did not have to suspend cash payments
                  (as they did in 1797) to prevent a bank run. But the Governors of the Bank of England
                  also decided to extend their note issues in 1826 as a way to slow down incidences
                  of bankruptcy. To the Liverpool administration, this was an alarming proposition because
                  it entailed further increases in public debt, which the government felt it could not
                  sustain, economically or politically. The source of the problem, the government contended,
                  lay with smaller banks and investment firms through which local credit was apparently
                  being channeled into diverse and uncharted investments. In January, 1826, the government
                  made three suggestions. First, the Bank of England would set up its own branches to
                  replace the smaller firms. Second, it would allow competition for government business
                  from other London firms within the metropolis. Third, they would finally extend the
                  gold standard to Scotland—where it had not been in effect before—as a way to curtail
                  the Scot’s dependence on paper money and thus their dangerous inclination for financial
                  adventure. The administration did not really believe that any of these suggestions
                  would be implemented, the first being very difficult, the second being unwarrantable,
                  and the third political suicide. </p>
               <p>In the first instance, however, the Bank called the Prime Minister’s bluff and proceeded
                  to open branches around the country, leading eventually to the demise of the country
                  bank and independent note issues. Consequently, other London firms increased their
                  share of the financial market, since they no longer had direct competition from country
                  bankers. Rather than curtail investment, though, these actions encouraged it in even
                  more diversified ways thanks to the new practices of deposit banking and credit facilitation
                  that large and more secure banks, including the Bank of England, could offer. This
                  meant that at the same time as it was diversifying so radically, the financial system
                  also became more centralized—though exactly where that central power lay was hard
                  to discern. For a single scheme, it is possible to cultivate a visible, intentional,
                  symbolic standard, something toward which the money promised can be balanced against:
                  a commodity to be produced, a service to be procured, a hero to found a colony. Even
                  in gigantic schemes like a war such symbols—king and country and all that — usefully
                  defray the fear and anxiety that accompanies massive debts. But when a network of
                  diversified investments exceeds the bounds of customary symbolic associations, when
                  the channels of these investments are controlled by a huge consortium of competing
                  interests, when the real value of money can no longer be “seen,” where does it lie?
                  What is its standard? These are the questions that Scott asked in his responses to
                  the panic of 1825. </p>

                              on the Scottish “free banking system,” exemplify the general resentment Scottish rural
                              people and Edinburgh elites alike felt toward London’s various attempts to integrate
                              the bureaucracies of Scotland and England between 1780 and 1830, though ultimately,
                              Phillipson concluded, like many such campaigns Scott’s letters did little more than

                     </div> His ground for such a claim was essentially nationalistic. “For God’s sake,” Scott
                     declared, “let us remain as Nature made us, Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen, with
                     something like the impress of our several countries upon each! We could not become
                     better subjects…if we all resembled each other like so many smooth shillings!” (373).
                     Via such contentions, the attempt to bring the gold standard to Scotland is thus easily
                     interpreted as an act of rank imperialism and its failure a triumph of the Scottish
                     anti-colonial spirit; as Silvana Colella points out, “the banks present a specifically
                     Scottish alternative to the English search for uniformity . . . . Diversity rather
                     than uniformity is, in fact, the distinguishing feature of the Scottish monetary system”
                     (58). Beyond national autonomy, though, Scott also committed himself to a <em>speculative</em> system based on local trust or “confidence” as opposed to a consolidated system based
                     on diversified, mathematical equivalence. Because its relatively small population
                     and rugged geography prevented the easy transport of metallic currencies, Scotland
                     had little in the way of metallic reserves, relying instead on locally-issued paper
                     credit. This credit was kept afloat by the combination of private diligence and public
                     accountability. To English charges that Scottish banks were financially suspect because
                     they did not rely on reserves of precious metals, Scott answered that the security
                     of the Scottish banking system is based on a form of public accountability, “the watchful
                     superintendence of the whole profession being extended to the strength and weakness
                     of the general system at each particular point; or, in other words, to the management
                     of each individual Company” (336). The mechanism of this security is publication:
                     “every Bank throughout Scotland is obliged to submit its circulation, twice a-week
                     in Edinburgh, to the inspection of the Argus-eyed tribunal“ (337). The Scottish banking
                     system is a “republic” and “the public have, in this manner, the best possible guarantee
                     against rash and ill-concocted speculations, from those who are not only best informed
                     on the subject, but, being most interested in examining each new project of the kind,
                     are least likely to be betrayed intro a rash confidence, and have the power of preventing
                     a doubtful undertaking at the very outset” (337). Scott models his idea of the “republic”
                     of Scottish finance on the model of the sociable public sphere of the Scottish Enlightenment
                     republic of letters. The English “seized with a jealous tenacious, wrangling, overbearing
                     humour” intended to undermine the very Enlightenment principles, Scottish of course,
                     which had brought Britain its economic power in the first place. “We cease at once
                     to be the Northern Athenians… we have become the caterpillars of the island instead
                     of its pillars” (361). In letter three, Scott invents an English rival, Christopher
                     Chrysal, who defends the English system on a decidedly irrational love for gold. This
                     is why Scott can give Scottish banking the somewhat paradoxical epithet of “practical
                     system.” It is a system, to be sure, but it is one that embodies the dynamics of real
                     practice and not the enthusiasms of theory. As a system, then, Scottish financial
                     practicality is something to be admired, a mark or “impress” (as I quoted early) of
                     their national spirit.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The association of Scottish bankers and “the Northern Athenians” points to a speculative
                  strain of early nineteenth-century Scottish economic thought. This is not the political
                  economy of Ricardo and McCulloch that “rose” in the period just prior to the 1825
                  crash, and strongly influenced the policy decisions made after it, but a conservative
                  economics that looked to the country estate rather than the trading house for its
                  guarantees against “rashness.” For what scholars of this period often overlook is
                  that the field we call “political economy” consisted of a wide variety of doctrines
                  and perspectives; these differences, moreover, had a profound influence on the ways
                  money was used and defined during the 1810s and 1820s. The root of this branching
                  tree of monetary positions, surprisingly, is Adam Smith’s <em>Wealth of Nations</em> (1776). Smith actually offers two quite distinct theories of money. The first, in
                  Book I, chapter 4, 
                  “Of the Origin and Use of Money,”
                  cribbed from Francis Hutcheson’s <em>System of Moral Philosophy</em>, uses classical history and legal arguments to suggest that the value of money lies
                  not only in the scarcity and utility of precious metals but, more importantly, in
                  the “virtue” of those governments that have been able to keep the inherent value that
                  results from the scarcity pure (2.53-64). This historical aesthetics was given pride
                  of place by Dugald Stewart in his lectures on political economy at the University
                  of Edinburgh and then disseminated throughout England by his students Francis Horner,
                  Henry Brougham, James Mackintosh, and James Mill in several articles in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>. Smith’s second chapter on money, in Book II, chapter 2, 
                  “Of Money Considered as a particular Branch of the general Stock of the Society”
                  is a much more technical description of the way money circulates in relation to other
                  forms of capital. It is here that Smith warns that an extensive paper money system
                  was only so many “wagons in air” borne by “Daedalian wings.” Smith argued here that
                  the most effective way of regulating paper credit is not to associate it with unadulterated
                  coin, but to limit it to small communities in which the various borrowers and lenders
                  are already known to each other and to terms of short, manageable durations: the so-called
                  “Real Bills Doctrine.” By contrast to the defense of gold, this more nuanced defense
                  of paper credit was appropriated by financial experts and bankers to give some credence
                  to their actions during the wartime financial crash—most notably the continuation
                  of the suspension of cash payments—though by and large they appealed to practical
                  expediency more often than they did philosophical precedent.</p>
               <p>The “bullion controversy,” the pamphlet war debating the link between the market price
                  of gold and the amount of banknotes in circulation that took place between 1809 and
                  1812, was a contest between those who appealed to Smith’s classical theory of value
                  and those who looked to his modern account of paper credit. But after the war, there
                  was a shift in the intellectual valence of this debate. Smith’s historical account
                  of the gold standard gave way to David Ricardo’s argument in his <em>Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</em> (1817) that money does not need a standard of value. The ebb and flow of commodities
                  and exchange is all the market needs. For Ricardo, exchange value was determined only
                  by market forces and had nothing to do with utility. Corn, which had held pride of
                  place as the most useful commodity available, was valuable only to the extent of its
                  supply or demand. Labour, the ultimate source of value, was marginal to the exchange
                  value of the commodities produced by it. For Ricardo and his followers—notably J.
                  R. McCulloch who popularized Ricardo’s ideas in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> and elsewhere—the economy had no symbolic guarantees, no inherent values. It was
                  a diverse field of competing interests and, for the first time, classes: agriculturalists
                  vs. merchants vs. labourers. And it was this model of economic diversity that drove
                  the consolidation of economic policy after the crisis of 1825.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In response to these developments, conservative critics complained that economy was
                     loquacious, impenetrable, and ultimately self-serving on one hand and built on little
                     more than pure self-interest on the other.

                              of teaching every man his own business” (321). Many of these conservative attacks
                              came from Scotland. Writing in Blackwood’s in 1824, the conservative critic and philosopher
                              John Wilson claimed that “political economy cannot be studied with advantage and satisfaction

                     </div> But behind these complaints, many of them Scottish in origin, lay a counter-model
                     of economic organization. Agriculturalists like Sir John Sinclair and Lord Lansdowne
                     argued in pamphlet after pamphlet that the benevolent state, modeled on the manor,
                     should control the economy paternalistically. The guarantee of this control was the
                     managerial acumen and moral fiber of the benevolent landowner. Many were prepared
                     to accept Ricardo’s practical account of how the market economy worked, though they
                     refuted his claim that capitalism was the only possible basis for the idea of economic
                     or, more to the point, social value. In an 1817 issue of <em>Blackwood’s</em>, for instance, John Gibson Lockhart wrote a positive review of Ricardo’s <em>Principles</em>. But he followed it with a blistering attack on McCulloch’s claim that Ricardo had
                     proven that the various classes of society exist in a state of perpetual antagonism.
                     “If political economists chuse to depart from the common use of language,” Lockhart
                     wrote, to label the relations between classes “a perpetual opposition of interests,
                     and, consequently, a state of perpetual hostility, let them have the consistency to
                     call it a <em>general</em> opposition of interests; and let the rest of mankind admit that, if in one sense they
                     be mutual enemies, in a more comprehensive view of the matter, they are mutual friends
                     and cannot do without one another.” This contention leads Lockhart to compare the
                     benefits of landed property and inherited wealth against the cut-throat competitiveness
                     of the Ricardian marketplace: <span class="quote">‘a rich man, like a watering-pan in the hands of Providence, serves to diffuse more
                        generally and usefully the means of subsistence while the envious absurdity of the
                        human heart grudges even existence to that which feeds it! As if the flesh of our
                        bodies should rise, in unhallowed insurrection, against the heart. All would be watering-pans,
                        all would be hearts; but this is not the order of nature nor of Providence, which
                        must ultimately prevail. After derangement shall be succeeded by derangement, and
                        revolution to revolution—after having exhausted all the forms of madness of misery,
                        of murder, and of blood, it is only by returning to the order and subordination of
                        nature, that wretched and weary mortals can escape from anarchy and despotism, and
                        expect to find, if not happiness, at least safety and repose. (59)’</span> In one way, this is a paternalist argument in which the landlord extends the means
                     of subsistence to those he deems worthy and in the interest of his own public standing.
                     But the diction of this passage also points to a moral claim that once the competitive
                     marketplace collapses, a “natural” hierarchical order will return. Lockhart’s economics
                     is speculative: conjectural, yes, but also dedicated to manifest symbolic values.</p>

                              history, extending it toward redemption from the rather fraught present as described
                              by Ferguson. Scott recounted a similar scheme in a chapter entitled 
                              “The Progress of Civilized Society”
                              that opened the second series of Tales of a Grandfather (1828). For more see my

                              in The Edinburgh Companion to Walter Scott.</span></div>
                     </div> Indeed, my sense is that Scott’s description of Scottish banking in the <em>Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</em> comes directly from this Blackwoodian branch of conservative economic thought, the
                     roots of which lie in the same Smithian economics as the Ricardian’s branch. To be
                     sure, Scott was conscious of his own dependence on “speculation”—the flow of capital
                     that sold his books—that he never endorsed outright his contemporaries’ more extreme
                     paternalism. But his admiration for the practical “republic” and “tribunals” of Scottish
                     finance, based like Lockhart’s “nature” on the traditional confidence of the country
                     estate, at times led Scott, as it did Wilson, Lockhart, and others, toward a more
                     affective, even violent defense. Several times in the letters, Scott hints that the
                     Scots might take up arms to defend their financial liberty, such as the moment when
                     he alludes to the magically-numbered “45” Scottish members of Parliament or refers
                     to the government as “the enemy.” Initially, Scott claims that the “body politic”
                     in Scotland is healthy and thus is in no need of “physic” as the English quack economists
                     seem to think. By the third letter, that same body is being encouraged to lift the
                     blazon for the “auld cause.” Scott’s respondents, including John Wilson Croker, writing
                     in the character of “Edward Bradwardine” disparagingly pointed out the allusions to
                     cudgels and regiments and the lost 45. Respondents were also quick to point out that
                     suspension of cash payments and the credit system it endorsed were instituted and
                     maintained largely for the symbolic purpose of fighting a patriotic war. In <em>Familiar Epistles</em> Daniel Dreadnaught denounced Scott’s argument on precisely these anti-Jacobite grounds.
                     “I abominate the system,” he proclaimed, “which has heaped countless injuries on my
                     country, for the navigation of a river with which she had nothing to do; for the restoration
                     of an old man, about whose concerns we ought to have been regardless, and for the
                     possession of a barren rock!” (11).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Scott was conscious of these dangers. In a letter to Croker written sometime after
                     the Malagrowther skirmish was over, Scott explained what this rhetoric was meant to
                     accomplish. “Scotland, completely liberalized,” Scott wrote, <span class="quote">‘will be the most dangerous neighbour to England that she has been since 1639. There

                        in the country. But if you <em>unscotch</em> us you will find us damned mischievous Englishmen. The restless and yet laborious
                        and constantly watchful character of the people, their desire for speculation in politics
                        or any thing else, only restrained by some proud feelings about their own country,
                        now become antiquated and which late measure will tend much to destroy, will make
                        them, under a wrong direction, the most formidable revolutionists who ever took the
                        field of innovation. (qtd. in Croker 3: 318)’</span> Scott’s used of the term “antiquated” is critical here.

                     </div> As Susan Manning observes, late eighteenth-century antiquarians’ “investment in the
                     immediate pleasures of the particular, without investigation or sublimation of that
                     pleasure, made them vulnerable, in the cultural currency of the eighteenth century
                     not only of incivility but of ‘enthusiasm’, defined as [the] incapacity to link things
                     with thoughts” (63). In a similar way, the “speculative” but “watchful character”
                     of the Scots—the very character that makes their paper credit work—would become an
                     object of antiquarian “investment” or Jacobite nostalgia once outlawed by English
                     policy. Within Scott’s argument on behalf of the confident “republic” of Scottish
                     banking, then, there lies a fiercer, almost overwrought attachment to the symbolic
                     value of Scottish banks as <em>Scottish</em>, a commitment with the potential to undermine the confidence, trust, and social stability
                     of the Scottish economy that Scott suggested was its national character. In the final
                     section of this paper, I will argue that this complex array of commitments, sentiments,
                     and misgivings is the thematic crux of <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Speculation and Comparison in <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em></span></h2>
               <p>I have been arguing that <em>The Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</em> represent Scott’s attempt to revive an economy of speculation, in the sense of both
                  the unbacked credit system it defends and the spectacular or iconic confidence that
                  it rhetorically conveys, in the face of its loss to the faceless powers of “innovation”
                  and centralized diversification. Many of the fictional and historical works that Scott
                  wrote in the years following the publication of the <em>Letters</em> project that same hoped-for revival. <em>Woodstock</em>, for instance, which Scott began in Autumn 1825 and published in May 1826, concerns
                  Charles II’s escape from the Battle of Woodstock just prior to his flight to France
                  by way of the “Royal Oak” in which it is said he hid. In Scott’s novelization, the
                  Oak is on the Estate of Sir Henry Everard, whose family is divided between Royalist
                  and Parliamentarian sympathies and much of the novel concerns Charles’ various attempts
                  to hide from Cromwell and his proselytizing minions and convince the Everard family
                  of his virtue. He succeeds, and the closing tableau of the novel, set on the day of
                  his Coronation in 1660, might be seen as a testament to Scott’s belief in the power
                  of enlightened monarchy—or at least his hope in its possible revival.</p>
               <p>But by the time he began <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>, in mid-1826, much of this renewed confidence had receded to be replaced by its very
                  opposite quality, the perplexity or “embarrassment” that Ricardo had warned against.
                  Not a novel per se but a compendium of linked stories, <em>Chronicles</em> is already moving away from the hopefulness of <em>Woodstock</em> and the other romances and toward a darker, more fragmented sense of the end of speculative
                  confidence in the face of financial diversification. The frame narrative, which is
                  about Chrystal Croftangry, the last in a line of Scottish landowners who, having squandered
                  the family fortunes, returns to Edinburgh to set up as an antiques dealer, is in itself
                  a quite fully-realized statement of Scott’s misgivings about the possibility of national
                  or Romantic revival. But I want to focus here on what I will describe as a pattern
                  of deliberate misreading in the three stories that make up the <em>Chronicle</em> all of which point to the failure of the speculative economy that Scott had tried
                  to resurrect. The violent consequences of “antiquing” as Scott warns in his letter
                  to Croker, is the basic theme of the first two stories in <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>. 
                  “The Highland Widow”
                  is the story of Elspeth, wife of the Highland outlaw Hamish McTavish, killed while
                  garrisoned by the English after Culloden, and her son, also Hamish, who refuses to
                  become an outlaw like his father and joins a Scottish regiment to fight in America.
                  When Hamish visits his mother before he is due to depart, she drugs him and, having
                  exceeded his furlough, shoots a sergeant who had come to apprehend him, is taken prisoner,
                  court-martialed, and shot. Elspeth is the literal embodiment of “antiquated” feelings,
                  but more than that she also represents the need to make a symbolic or speculative
                  understanding of life, including money, meaningful at a time when such efforts are
                  overshadowed by modern exchange practices. In a memorable scene, Hamish sends his
                  mother a 5-guinea coin, the proceeds from his enlistment in the Highland regiment;
                  she “remained gazing on the money as if the impress of the coin could have conveyed
                  information how it was procured” (82). Re-employing the metaphor of impression that,
                  in the first Malagrowther letter, Scott had used to define both the national feeling
                  behind the distinct cohesiveness of Scottish banking and its grounding in Scottish
                  empirical philosophy, Scott has Elspeth deliberately fail to read the coin and misunderstand
                  its now strictly economic function. For Scott, coins, like the monarchs whose faces
                  are imprinted on them, have both symbolic value and financial value as guarantees
                  of the vitality of the nation. But to Elspeth, whose whole world is appreciable <em>only</em> as a series of meaningful icons, the systemic “meaning” of coins as instruments of
                  fluid exchange makes no sense.</p>
               <p>
                  “The Two Drovers”
                  is a complex tale about a Highland cattleman, Robin Oig, and his sometime English
                  friend, also a cowman, Harry Wakefield. Having made their way to Cumberland, Oig and
                  Wakefield unfortunately negotiate respectively with the squire and the bailiff for
                  the same pasture. When the two arrive at the local alehouse, Wakefield is egged on
                  by his fellow Englishman to challenge Oig, who initially refuses to fight, but then
                  when provoked, stabs Wakefield with his dirk, which he had been keeping in trust for
                  a lowland drover. Again, feelings and sensations become focused on an object which
                  then becomes the means of a proto-revolutionary murder. The crisis at the heart of
                  the “Two Drovers” is the substitution of Oig’s economy of trust and honour with an
                  economy of omnipresent though invisible reason. The presiding judge at Oig’s trial
                  offers this general assessment of what <em>should have</em> happened: <span class="quote">‘The first object of civilization is to place the general protection of the law, especially
                     administered, in the room of the wild justice, which every man cut and carved for
                     himself, according to the length of his sword and the strength of his arm. The law
                     says to the subjects, with a voice only inferior to that of the Deity, “Vengeance
                     is mine.” The instant there is time for passion to cool, and reason to interpose,
                     an injured party must become aware, that the law assumes the exclusive cognizance
                     of the right and wrong betwixt the parties, and opposes her inviolable buckler to
                     every attempt of the private party to right itself. (146)’</span> What I want to stress here is Scott’s sense that law can also become the “buckler”
                  of retribution. This is a clear case of what Foucault called a disciplinary process:
                  a law-abiding “subject” is created out of an external injunction to suppress certain
                  feelings of desire or self-identification. Through education people are taught to
                  respect civility. But if they transgress that civility the law “antiquates” into its
                  archaic violent form. The relationship between law and subject also changes from one
                  based on mutual respect to one based on affective responses and overt domination.
                  The danger of any symbolic system, no matter how rational or unifying it may be, is
                  that it has the potential to become violent, especially for the sake of its coherence.</p>
               <p>Similar complexities surround Richard Middlemas, the ambitious anti-hero of 
                  “The Surgeon’s Daughter.”
                  The longest of the three tales, really a novella in its own right, 
                  “The Surgeon’s Daughter”
                  tells the story of Menie Gray, daughter of the Selkirk doctor, Gideon Gray, and the
                  rivals for her hand, the doctor’s two students, Adam Hartley and Richard Middlemas,
                  the latter the ward of Dr. Gray. Famous for its setting in colonial India (a setting
                  in which not one but <em>two</em> colonial British armies operate, the regulars and the East India Company’s, the latter
                  to which both Middlemas and General Tresham/Witherington belong), most of the story
                  focuses on the circumstances and consequences of Middlemas’ birth. His parents, we
                  eventually learn, are the eloping General, then only a captain, who is also both a
                  Jacobite and a Catholic, and the daughter of a wealthy Portugese-Jewish merchant who
                  pays Middlemas’ adopted Highland guardian, Dr. Gray, for his upkeep without any regard
                  or fondness. Middlemas’ claim in early-adolescence that he is a “free-born Englishman”
                  is ironic not only because he in conventional terms anything but, but also because
                  his lineage acts to demonstrate just how fetishistic such national designations are
                  becoming in an increasingly global economy.</p>
               <p>Scott’s financial metaphors focus on the interplay between the economics of exchange
                  and the affective power of persuasion and (self-) love. The scene in which Middlemas
                  confronts his parents is a parody of similar scenes of familial recognition, such
                  as, for instance, at the end of Burney’s <em>Evelina</em>. In Scott’s take, instead of “seeing” his parents as the fulfillment of his ambition
                  to discover his “true” identity, Middlemas abjects them: “O, my more than father…
                  how much greater a debt do I owe to you than to the unnatural parents, who brought
                  me into this world by their sin, and deserted me through their cruelty!” (231). The
                  result of this ignorant declaration is complete confusion: Zilia dies after bashing
                  out a discordant lament on the harpsichord while the General forces his son to “look
                  upon [his] parents who [he] hast so much envied—whom thou hast so often cursed. Look
                  at that pale emaciated form, a figure of wax, rather than flesh and blood—that is
                  thy mother—that is, the unhappy Zilia de Moncada, to whom thy birth was the source
                  of shame and misery, and to whom thy ill-omened presence hath now brought death itself”
                  (232). He then rages into a fury and threatens to kill his other children. The General’s,
                  Zilia’s, and Middlemas’ understanding of themselves are revealed in this moment not
                  to be ratified by a hidden bond, but rather by their individual miscomprehension of
                  their systematic existences. Once set into contention by the exposure of this system,
                  the organization breaks down.</p>
               <p>The tragedy, then, is that the standard of value that might underlie the characters’
                  attempts to vindicate themselves before the others or serve as a possible point of
                  comparison between them has been replaced by a new standard of systemic inevitability,
                  much as the symbolic standards trusted by Oig are replaced at the end of the story
                  by the “buckler” of the law. Not even Hartley and Menie Grey can withstand the “agitation”
                  and “shock” of the events of their story: Hartley dies of a colonial disease two years
                  later and Menie refuses to marry probably in memory of Hartley but also in her continual
                  irrational devotion to Richard. Once again affection undermines security. This is
                  not to say that the novella does not <em>suppose</em> a standard, that is, of fetishistic glamour of wealth and adventure such as is presented
                  to Richard Middlemas by his credulous Nurse and Tom Hilary. But at the same time,
                  it also presents to us the way in which these fantasies circulate as, in a word, systems
                  and by extension, empires. As Tara Ghoshal Wallace observes, it is “such instances
                  of the reality of imperial fantasies that constructs the imperial identity” (322).
                  The trouble is, it is not the imperial fantasy that wins, but rather the ebb and flow
                  of a diversified global capitalism.</p>
               <p>Yet, I would also venture to suggest that 
                  “The Surgeon’s Daughter”
                  provides a different kind of standard to <em>both</em> the “fantasy” of glory that Scott associates with empire <em>and</em> the systemic intransigence of finance. In a strange scene, Hartley and Menie are
                  on their way into the interior of India when they come upon the near-lifeless body
                  of Sadhu Sing and hear the story of how his bride was taken from him on their wedding
                  day by a tiger. Via Hartley, the narrator makes the rather facile analogy between
                  this story and “the probable fate of [Menie] almost within the grasp of a more formidable
                  tiger than that whose skeleton lay beside Sadhu Sing” (271), the Indian Prince for
                  whom Middlemas fought and whose wedding is disrupted by a tiger attack. But Scott
                  also makes us aware that a comparison between these two marriages is <em>possible</em>: at the creek in the jungle, “the travelers stopped to drink, and to refresh themselves
                  and their horses; and it was near this spot that Hartley saw a sight which forced
                  him to compare the subject which engrossed his own thoughts, with the distress that
                  had afflicted another” (270). Scott is here projecting a frame of reference outside
                  the narrative that will be able to bring the two “systems” of the story—the British
                  and the Indian—into a hybrid construction. They are not the same, as the narrative
                  makes clear, for Menie’s fate is <em>not</em> that of Sing’s bride, any more than Scottish farms cultivated by free credit (as
                  Scott describes in the <em>Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</em>) are the same as the “impenetrable thicket” that the plain has become once war has
                  “suspended the labours of industry” (270). The end of the tale offers not a speculative
                  vision of imperial or financial unity that might regulate or oppose the flow of finance,
                  but rather an opportunity to view both the failure of speculation and the consolidation
                  of capital flow as parts of a constellated object of a critical and comparative judgment,
                  to see them, that is, <em>as</em> the “thicket” that they really are once the “labours” and “industry” of narrative
                  are over.</p>
               <p>In this way, <em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>, provides a standard of comparison through which various cultures can be measured
                  against each other—Britain and India, Scotland and England, The Highlands and India—which
                  is apparent, in a way that the consolidated standard of financial diversification
                  is <em>not</em>, in the tensions and contradictions of literary form. This is not the same thing
                  as saying that Scott invents an imperial ideology, for there is no specific imperial
                  agenda associated with the standard of comparison as such. The novel neither represents
                  a standard (on the contrary all its speculative, monarchical figures are either absent,
                  corrupt, or destroyed) nor embodies a particular economic system (as the <em>Letters</em> had done). Rather, the text itself, viewed as a collective whole, is an effect of
                  the continual comparisons between different economic and cultural systems, manifest
                  in the antiquarian tendencies of Croftangry and in the process of reading that he
                  and other collectors in the frame narrative exemplify. By contrast to his polemical
                  writings, Scott’s fiction allows us to recognize the conflicts and unevenness of the
                  economic field by staging their de-consolidation. In this respect, while the Waverley
                  Novels might be partly responsible for popularizing and acclimatizing the “heroism”
                  of capitalism’s entrepreneurial spirit, they can also be seen to foreshadow the kinds
                  of formal and logical critiques of capitalism, both conservative and radical, that
                  would emerge in the nineteenth century and after.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">The historian N. T. Phillipson observed in 1968 that the <em>Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</em>, which Scott wrote to protest the incursion of centralizing English financial policy
               on the Scottish “free banking system,” exemplify the general resentment Scottish rural
               people and Edinburgh elites alike felt toward London’s various attempts to integrate
               the bureaucracies of Scotland and England between 1780 and 1830, though ultimately,
               Phillipson concluded, like many such campaigns Scott’s letters did little more than
               express an “ideology of noisy inaction” (186). Caroline McCracken-Flesher in <em>Possible Scotlands</em> documents the wide support that Scott’s letters received, even from those like Henry
               Dundas Lord Melville who had originally approved of Parliament’s motion. Scott turned
               to his readers’ sense of their own “otherness” to recharge Scottish nationalism with
               a new progressive sense of its own difference within a changing British union. Those
               few scholars who have examined these works in relation to his financial troubles have
               tended to do so with an eye still trained firmly on the problem of Scottish national
               identity. See also Colella.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of teaching every man his own business” (321). Many of these conservative attacks
               came from Scotland. Writing in <em>Blackwood’s</em> in 1824, the conservative critic and philosopher John Wilson claimed that “political
               economy cannot be studied with advantage and satisfaction in the modern writers on
               the subject, by any person who wishes to be convinced of the soundness of its first
               principles;—who expects perspicacity, consistency, and accurate reasoning in the deductions
               from these principles, or to find them applicable to, and explanatory of what is occurring,
               or sure guides in the advancement and acquisition of social wealth” because it is
               so replete with “obscurity, contradiction, and ambiguity in the use of words [and]
               illogicalness in reasoning.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               history, extending it toward redemption from the rather fraught present as described
               by Ferguson. Scott recounted a similar scheme in a chapter entitled 
               “The Progress of Civilized Society”
               that opened the second series of <em>Tales of a Grandfather</em> (1828). For more see my
