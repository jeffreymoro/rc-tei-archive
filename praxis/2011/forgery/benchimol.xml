                  <item>The essay examines the strategy of radical education and critical publicity
                     in the early nineteenth-century plebeian public sphere around the issue of
                     paper money, and demonstrates how this strategy was transformed in the postwar
                     years into an active project of resistance against the worst abuses of the
                     paper money system, culminating in William Cobbett’s "puff out" campaign in
                     the <title level="j">Political Register</title> to materially undermine Bank of England paper currency
                     and T. J. Wooler’s print protests in <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> directly confronting the
                     enforcement of the "bloody code" in the capital forgery trials of late 1818.
                     This postwar print campaign against the paper money system illustrates key
                     aspects of the wider radical intellectual project in the plebeian public
                     sphere, highlighting how the radical press "converted" popular public debate
                     into a new form of cultural currency in the Romantic period, a currency that
                     emblematized a continuing concern for the material welfare of its readers and
                     listeners in the face of a corrupt and bloody political and economic
                     system.</item>

            <p>The production, representation and circulation of radical knowledge have become
               important areas of scholarly investigation in Romantic period studies over the last
               twenty years. In books like Kevin Gilmartin’s <title level="m">Print Politics</title>
               (1996), Michael Scrivener’s <title level="m">Seditious Allegories</title> (2001) and
               Ian Haywood’s <title level="m">The Revolution in Popular Literature</title> (2004),
               radical Romantic intellectual and cultural production is mapped as a means to
               highlighting the wider ideological struggle against dominant economic, social and
               political narratives in the period. Haywood has demonstrated in his <title level="m"
                  >Bloody Romanticism</title> (2006) that this struggle against a corrupt economic
               and political system was often a bloody process, emphasizing the centrality of what
               he calls “spectacular violence” in the wider public sphere: “In order for the
               Romantic period to develop an unprecedented self-awareness about the depravities of
               public violence, and in order for the radical critique of cyclical State violence to
               be disseminated throughout the public sphere, spectacular violence had to become a
               major cultural force” (3). The radical campaign against the paper money system, and
               the corrupt polity that facilitated its emergence and unsteady existence in the early
               nineteenth century, provides one illustration of how the production and circulation
               of radical knowledge in the public sphere helped to create an oppositional site of
               “spectacular violence” in the Romantic period for its popular audience. The print
               protests of William Cobbett and T. J. Wooler against the paper money system and its
               brutal political enforcement demonstrate how the depiction of state violence can be
               used as a vehicle of ideological resistance in the service of radical political and
               economic reform. As Wooler put it in <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> about
               the judicial crisis sparked by the forgery executions of December 1818, even the
               “many admirers of ‘<emph>the system</emph>,’ confess they do not like it disfigured
               with blood” (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [16 Dec. 1818], 789).</p>
            <p>“Gentlemen; we, the people of this country, have been persuaded to believe many
               things,” writes Cobbett almost a decade earlier in the first letter of his “Paper
               Against Gold” article series in the <title level="j">Political Register</title>.
               “We have been persuaded to believe ourselves to be ‘the <emph>most thinking</emph>
               people in Europe;’ but, to what purpose do men think, unless they arrive at useful
               knowledge by thinking?” (<title level="j">Register</title> 18 [1 Sep. 1810], 260).
               This essay will firstly examine the strategy of radical education in the early
               nineteenth-century plebeian public sphere around the issue of paper money,
               illustrated by Cobbett in his article series “Paper Against Gold”, published in the
                  <title level="j">Political Register</title> during 1810-11. Cobbett’s role as a
               counter-hegemonic intellectual in the series and the conception of popular knowledge
               it championed will be emphasized, in part through his attempts to expose the complex
               workings of the wider financial system he described as a “place… of a sort of
               mysterious existence; a sort of Financial Ark; a place not, perhaps, to be touched,
               or even seen” (<title level="j">Register</title> 18 [8 Sep. 1810], 294). The second
               part of the essay will demonstrate how this form of critical publicity was
               transformed in the postwar years into an active project of resistance against the
               worst abuses of the paper money system, culminating in Cobbett’s “puff out”
               campaign in the <title level="j">Register</title> to materially undermine Bank of
               England paper currency and Wooler’s print protests in <title level="j">The Black
                  Dwarf</title> directly confronting the enforcement of the “bloody code” in the
               capital forgery trials of late 1818. This postwar print campaign against the paper
               money system illustrates key aspects of the wider radical intellectual project in the
               plebeian public sphere, highlighting how the radical press “converted” popular
               public debate into a new form of cultural currency in the Romantic period, a currency
               that emblematized a continuing concern for the material welfare of its readers and
               listeners in the face of a corrupt and bloody political and economic system. </p>

               <p>In their carefully constructed thematic sections and transparently didactic tone
                  the articles in “Paper Against Gold” resemble a popular lecture series in the
                  form of correspondence. The subtitle to the articles, “Being An Examination Of
                  The Report Of The Bullion Committee In A Series Of Letters To The Tradesmen And
                  Farmers In And Near Salisbury”, gives an indication of the audience Cobbett
                  sought to address. It was this important group of petit-bourgeois local
                  stakeholders in the national economy that he believed to be at risk in the rapidly
                  expanding paper-money system. As in his “Perish Commerce” <title level="j"
                     >Register</title> articles published in 1807-8 attacking the corrupt roots and
                  corrosive social effects of free trade in England, Cobbett’s argument presumes
                  class interest to be at the heart of the current fiscal and monetary policies
                  pursued by the government.</p>
               <p>In the introduction to the first letter Cobbett lays out the theme he will pursue
                  throughout the series: “I think it may not be amiss, if, upon this occasion, I
                  address myself to you. I have introduced myself to you without any ceremony; but
                  before we part, we shall become well acquainted; and, I make no doubt, that you
                  will understand the distinction between Paper-Money and Gold-Money much too well
                  for it to be in the power of any one ever again to deceive you...” (<title
                     level="j">Register</title> 18 [1 Sep. 1810], 259). Cobbett views his
                  intellectual function as facilitating public understanding of the official
                  conclusions published in the Bullion Report<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1"
                     place="foot" n="1">For an illuminating discussion of the Bullion Committee
                     Report see Fontana 118-26.</note>, an influential document chiefly composed by
                  the Scottish Whig economist Francis Horner from the Select Committee tasked with
                  investigating the associated values of Gold Bullion and paper currency in the
                  national economy. The conclusions of this Report, as Cobbett sceptically relates,
                  suggest “that it is possible to lessen the quantity of the paper-money, and to
                  cause guineas to come back again and to pass from hand to hand as in former
                  times” without “the total destruction of the paper-money” system. Mocking the
                  intellectual arrogance and moral self-regard reflected in the Report, Cobbett
                  reminds his audience of the practical material issues at stake in public debates
                  like this one: “such is our present situation in this country, that every man,
                  who has a family to preserve from want, ought to endeavour to make himself
                  acquainted with the nature, and with the probable consequences, of the paper-money
                  now afloat” (261). </p>
               <p>He begins his interrogation of the paper-money system with a simple reminder of
                  the use value of money as a method of exchange for goods: “<emph>Money</emph> is
                     the<emph> representative</emph>, or the<emph> token</emph> of property, or
                     <emph>things of value</emph>. The money, while used as money, is of no other
                  use; and, therefore, a bit of lead or of wood or of leather, would be as good as
                  gold or silver, to be used as money” (261). Ever the practical materialist,
                  Cobbett wants his audience to see the root causes of their domestic discomfort,
                  causes concealed by the increasingly dominant method of paper currency
                  transaction: <quote>while we are all acquainted with the fact, and while many of
                     us are most sensibly feeling the <emph>effects</emph>, scarcely a man amongst
                     us takes the trouble to inquire into the cause... We see the country abounding
                     with paper-money; we see every man’s band full of it; we frequently talk of it
                     as a strange thing, and a great evil; but never do we inquire into the cause of
                     it. </quote> With an appeal to popular collective memory, he traces the spread
                  of paper currency by focusing on the changing pattern of social relations in the
                  English countryside: “There are few of you, who cannot remember the time, when
                  there was scarcely ever a bank note among Tradesmen and Farmers... People, in
                  those days, used to carry little bags to put their money in, instead of the
                  paste-board or leather cases that they now carry” (262). </p>
               <p>In the second letter published in the <title level="m">Register</title>, Cobbett
                  continues with his investigation of paper money, this time focusing on the way it
                  functioned to sustain the current funding system. He begins with a cautionary note
                  regarding the popular mystification surrounding key terms like “Fund” and
                  “National Debt” used in the new discourse of commercial finance. “These are
                  words,” he writes, “which are frequently made use of; but, like many other
                  words, they stand for things which are little understood, and the less, perhaps,
                  because the words are so very commonly used” (<title level="j">Register</title>
                  18 [8 Sep. 1810], 290). He continues: <quote>if a right understanding of the
                     meaning of these words be, in all cases where the words are used, of some
                     consequence, it is of peculiar consequence here, where... we shall find the
                        <emph>Funds</emph>, the <emph>Stocks</emph>, and the <emph>National
                        Debt</emph>, to be so closely interwoven with the <emph>Bank Notes</emph>,
                     as to be quite inseparable therefrom in every possible state or stage of their
                     existence. </quote> Cobbett here seeks to be both practical pedagogue as well
                  as engaged social critic, patiently deciphering the reifying language deployed by
                  the new financial elite in order to rally some kind of collective resistance to
                  the paper money system and the political order it served. This was “an inquiry”,
                  he explains, “worthy of the undivided attention of every true Englishman” and
                  “every man who wishes to see this country of his forefathers preserved from ruin
                  and subjugation” (291). </p>
               <p>Cobbett developed his discourse of economic populism as an explicit appeal to the
                  suspicion and scepticism of the plebeian classes about the new paper money system.
                  He also stressed the need for different indicators of what the political
                  economists called “national prosperity”—a powerful abstraction utilized to
                  promote the benefits of economic modernization from the perspective of a small
                  elite of financiers, company directors, wealthy consumers, and high level
                  government bureaucrats. This conception of national prosperity, Cobbett argued in
                  the third letter, was demonstrated in “the increase of the number of chariots and
                  of fine-dressed people”, rather than in the “good morals, of <emph>the labouring
                     classes of the people</emph>” (<title level="j">Register</title> 18 [12 Sep.
                  1810], 331-32). Far from promoting the health and productive energies of the
                  labouring classes, this notion of prosperity, according to Cobbett, has had the
                  opposite effect. In a series of questions to those farmers and tradesmen—the local
                  stakeholders with a direct responsibility for the well-being of their labourers—he
                  highlights the material inequalities produced by the new financial system and its
                  shambolic notion of prosperity: “Have our labourers a plentiful meal of food fit
                  for man? Do they taste meat once in <emph>a day</emph>? Are they decently clothed?
                  Have they the means of obtaining firing? Are they and their children healthy and
                  happy?” With reference to the direct experience of his audience, he adds, “I put
                  these questions to you, Gentlemen, who have the means of knowing the facts, and
                  who must, I am afraid, answer them all in the negative” (332).</p>
               <p>In the twenty-fifth letter of the series, published in July 1811, Cobbett reduces
                  the concept of paper money to its original function as a unit of exchange in the
                  wider economy. By doing this, he attempts to revive a native plebeian
                  scepticism—still residually present—toward the financial abstractions promoted by
                  the new system. He opens with a simple lesson about inflation: “Money, of
                  whatever sort, is, like everything else, lowered in its value in proportion as it
                  becomes <emph>abundant</emph> or <emph>plenty</emph>” (<title level="j"
                     >Register</title> 20 [6 July 1811], 2). Always keen to return the focus in this
                  debate back to the world of material<emph> things</emph>, he continues: <quote>The
                     use of money is to serve men as a sign of the amount of the value of
                        <hi>things</hi> that pass from man to man in the way of purchase and sale.
                     It is <emph>plenty</emph>, or <emph>scarce</emph>, in proportion as its
                     quantity is great or small compared with the quantity of things purchased and
                     sold in the community; and, whenever it becomes, from any cause, plenty, it
                        <emph>depreciates</emph>, or sinks in value (2). </quote> This was
                  ultimately a lesson in the use-value of paper money in the day-to-day lives of
                  ordinary labourers. To this end, Cobbett points out the difference between paper
                  money and a staple commodity like bread, “one having a <emph>real</emph> value in
                  its utility in supporting man, and the money having only an<emph> imaginary</emph>
                  value” (3). He is making an important distinction between these things of “real
                  value”—which were the product of “our soil or of our labour” and hence subject
                  to a natural, if self-sustaining, scarcity—and the artificiality of paper currency
                  in the commercial market system, where an increase in the amount of paper money in
                  circulation meant that “any given quantity of it would purchase less bread” (4).
                  This had more than an abstract meaning to his audience. As a result of the
                  inflation generated by the new paper money system, prices rose by some eighty
                  percent between 1797 and 1818, making staple items for the ordinary household
                  prohibitively expensive.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" n="2">See
                     Ferguson 153.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Exposing the ideological interests of the new financial elite who promoted the
                  paper-money system, those men “<emph>that had profited from that</emph>
                  <emph>borrowing</emph>” on the National Debt, was perhaps the most important of
                  Cobbett’s critical objectives in the series. According to him the new financial
                  system was based upon the activities of a small, parasitic group of capitalists
                  who both compelled the payment of the interest on the National Debt as well as
                  constructed the means for doing so through the expanding system of paper money.
                  For Cobbett, the only question worth asking was not being addressed by the Bullion
                  Committee. The question was whether the people can “<emph>by any means, diminish
                     the amount of the Dividends</emph>” paid on the debt: “if that question had
                  been answered in the negative, there was no course, for those who wished to
                  support the Pitt system, to pursue but that of letting things take their own
                  course, and aid the paper with their <emph>wishes</emph>” (17). But this attempt
                  by the elite at public legitimation was in danger of backfiring. The issue had now
                  been brought to the attention of the “public mind”, and the mystification
                  surrounding it had been punctured, not least through pioneering efforts in
                     counter-publicity<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" place="foot" n="3"> For a
                     conceptually valuable notion of counter-publicity in the period see Gilmartin,
                     “Popular Radicalism and the Public Sphere” 553. </note> and popular education
                  like Cobbett’s article series. By considering the Committee’s recommendations in
                  Parliament in May of 1811, the economic elite had by no means closed off all
                  debate on the larger political issues surrounding the paper money system. Still a
                  believer in the possibilities of democratic discourse, Cobbett’s twenty-fifth
                  letter suggests that the political establishment had now opened the issue up to
                  the wider scrutiny of the labouring classes, and, through the efforts of
                  interlocutors like himself in the public sphere, this establishment was in danger
                  of losing control of the debate (17-18). </p>
               <p>Throughout this extraordinary series of letters published in the <title level="j"
                     >Political Register</title>, Cobbett was above all attempting to initiate a
                  “legitimation crisis”—to use Jürgen Habermas’s influential phrase<note
                     resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" n="4">See Habermas.</note>—for a
                  system he viewed as profoundly immoral, unjust, and constructed upon an
                  unsustainable foundation of monetary abstractions. It was an essential, if often
                  overlooked, prelude to Cobbett’s project of radical political reform pursued in
                  the postwar period. His economic theories stemmed from a firm conviction, as A. L.
                  Morton has bluntly put it in <title level="m">A People’s History of
                     England</title>, “that the common people, his people, had been robbed, were
                  being robbed and would continue to be robbed until they combined to check and
                  control the property-owning class” (318). This oppositional imperative is perhaps
                  best illustrated by Cobbett’s address “To The Journeymen And Labourers Of
                  England, Wales, Scotland And Ireland” in November of 1816 (<title level="j"
                     >Register</title> 31 [2 Nov. 1816], 545-76).</p>
               <p>Cobbett’s address—published in a two-penny, unstamped pamphlet designed for the
                  widest possible circulation—also marked a new stage of the radical intellectual
                  project in the plebeian public sphere, building on the critical insights into the
                  new paper money system and its political economy developed in “Paper Against
                  Gold”. Beginning with the 1816 address a complementary strategy of collective
                  protest—co-ordinated through the radical press—was initiated for the political and
                  economic liberation of the labouring classes. These were the peak years of
                  political activity in the plebeian public sphere, with the radical weekly
                  occupying a central role in the wider Radical movement. Along with the founding of
                  Wooler’s <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> a year later in 1817, this address
                  by Cobbett signalled a new role for the unstamped weekly press as a vehicle for
                  collective action. After long years of patient education of his public, Cobbett
                  recognized that the time had now come for action: “Meeting after meeting,
                  petition on petition, remonstrance on remonstrance, until the country be saved!”

               <p>This new strategic orientation of the plebeian public sphere was exemplified in
                  events like the Spa Fields meetings of late 1816, where mass direct action in
                  favour of broad constitutional rights proved, according to E. P. Thompson, “more
                  revolutionary in its implication than the policy of conspiracy and insurrection”
                  (682). Indeed, the combination of this form of “popular constitutionalism” with
                  the mass mobilization potential of the unstamped weeklies provoked intense
                  Government surveillance of all radical activities, with two secret committees
                  appointed to report on any links to “revolutionary” acts like the attack on the
                  Prince Regent at the opening of Parliament in early 1817. Directly out of this
                  parliamentary backlash against the Radical movement came the suspension of Habeas
                  Corpus and the “Gagging Acts”. Not long after Cobbett left England and almost
                  certain arrest, sailing from Liverpool in March and arriving in New York in May.
                  This “defection” from the Radical movement, as Thompson has called it in <title
                     level="m">The Making of the English Working Class</title> (674), prompted much
                  consternation from those that remained, not least Wooler, but Cobbett persisted as
                  a powerful print presence through the publication of his two-pence <title
                     level="j">Register</title> from July, and with the contemporaneous acceleration
                  of the forgery prosecutions, the absent radical leader made a dramatic print
                  intervention from America with an audacious attack on the entire paper money
                  system in the cause of political reform.</p>
               <p>The immediate context for this kind of intervention was especially favourable to
                  the critiques being made of the economic and political system by radical reformers
                  like Cobbett and Wooler. With the suspension of gold payments in 1797, the Bank of
                  England introduced £1 and £2 paper notes for mass circulation, and, due to the
                  uneven quality of these notes, a precipitous rise in prosecutions for both
                  uttering and forging Banknotes was the inevitable outcome. According to the legal
                  historian Phil Handler in his essay “Forging the Agenda: The 1819 Select
                  Committee on the Criminal Laws Revisited”, the number of prosecutions rose from 4
                  in the fourteen years prior to 1797, to 972 in the twenty years that followed the
                  Restriction. London, with its complex commercial economy, was at the centre of
                  these prosecutions, and, as Handler observes, the Bank “was able to manipulate
                  the system by allowing some offenders to plead guilty to a non-capital charge of
                  possession, whilst prosecuting those who refused to plead guilty or who were
                  particularly persistent offenders, with the capital offence of forging or uttering
                  counterfeit notes” (252). The result of such an inherently arbitrary application
                  of the law was that nearly one third of those hanged in the capital in the first
                  eighteen years of the century were convicted of forgery. “This severity ensured
                  that forgery retained a central position in public perceptions of the criminal
                  law”, writes Handler, and in the postwar period, “when the volume of forged
                  notes in circulation increased rapidly…the Bank’s prosecutions began to arouse
                  serious controversy” (252). The Bank of England—the single most important
                  financial institution in the country—was now seen, through penalty of death, to be
                  enforcing the nation’s corrupt economic order. </p>
               <p>In August of 1818, amidst an increasing public crisis over the forgery
                  prosecutions, Cobbett used his two-penny <title level="j">Register</title> to
                  highlight the illegitimacy of Bank of England notes, extending his argument from
                  the “Paper Against Gold” series almost a decade earlier about the paper money
                  system and proposing specific actions to undermine its very foundations in the
                  country. Writing from his Long Island, New York exile, he assails the continued
                  legislative support for the suspension of cash payments and its intimate
                  connection to the entire material edifice of Old Corruption: “The truth is, that
                  it is <emph>impossible</emph> for them to pay in coin, <emph>without putting an
                     end to their power</emph>, which exists only because people imagine, that the
                  bubble is not a bubble. They are more in debt than all the lands, houses, mines
                  and canals would sell for by auction, if there were any bidders to lay down the
                  money.” As in his earlier article series, Cobbett highlights the political
                  economy of this financial arrangement constructed by the nation’s elite. “They
                  throw off the burden, at present, upon <emph>the labour of the people</emph>”, he
                  argues, and, adds darkly: “but, will they do this at <emph>a day of
                     reckoning!</emph>” (<title level="j">Register</title> 34 [22 Aug. 1818], 8).
                  The means for facilitating this financial “day of reckoning”—Cobbett’s so-called
                  “puff-out” plan—features in much of the article’s subsequent discussion. </p>
               <p>Before he lays out the details of his plan for undermining the paper money system,
                  Cobbett reminds his audience of the ideological nature of what he calls the
                  “infernal funding system’—a system that “must produce misery as general as the
                  air, and more severe than misery was ever before known” (13). What began as a
                  wartime expedient to account for the shortage of gold was now being perpetuated in
                  the postwar economy as part of the fiction of financial solvency for the Bank of
                  England and its associated fundholders. The current debates in Parliament about
                  delaying cash payments have only served to highlight how the nation’s financial
                  and political elite, those who “live on the Funds and Taxes”, “had an interest
                  in upholding the credit of the mischievous bubble” (14). For Cobbett, this
                  relationship between organized financial corruption and the unrepresentative
                  political system in the country was key to the sustaining of both, and hence a
                  central target of his own postwar intellectual project, embodied in efforts like
                  his 1816 print address and the present article. “It is now clear to
                     <emph>you</emph>, my friends”, he writes, “that the existence of the Borough
                  System depends entirely on that of the credit of the <emph>Paper Money</emph>; and
                  it is, I think, equally clear, that the credit of the Paper Money may, at any
                  hour, be <emph>destroyed in a moment</emph>, and that, too, as
                     <emph>quietly</emph> as we can kill a frog or toad” (15-16).</p>
               <p>In his “puff out” scheme Cobbett cleverly amplifies the public controversy
                  around the forgery prosecutions to both undermine the legitimacy of Bank-produced
                  paper currency as well as to underscore the material social injustice of the
                  corrupt postwar economic system it emblematized. “It is the <emph>uttering
                  </emph>of the forged paper that causes all the detections and all the hangings.
                  Men utter it, because they want food, raiment, and drink, in exchange”, he
                  reasons. “But, if the nation, goaded into deep enterprize, should, one of these
                  fine mornings, find itself amidst abundance of Bank Notes, <emph>picked up in the
                     streets</emph>, or taken out of <emph>post-letters</emph>, who, from that day
                  forth, would ever <emph>take a Bank Note</emph>? Hard money alone would pass.
                  Wheat would be <emph>three shillings a bushel</emph>. The bubble and the
                  Borough-mongers would drop dead as a clod” (16). Drawing upon the moral currency
                  of the unstamped press as his vehicle of radical resistance, Cobbett provides his
                  substantial audience of readers and listeners with the methods for bringing down
                  the postwar economic and political system, announcing: “To throw forged Bank
                  notes (<emph>knowing them to be forged</emph>) about the street, or on the
                  highways, or to put them into letters to go by post, is to <emph>utter
                  </emph>them. But, who is to <emph>detect</emph> the <emph>utterer</emph>?” (17).
                  This strategy has the practical effect of undermining the basic currency of
                  London’s complex commercial economy while also demonstrating the manifest
                  absurdity of the current policy of enforcement: “All money transactions would be
                  at a stand. No buying, no selling. A Bank note would be rejected as something
                  beneath contempt,” Cobbett observes (21).</p>
               <p>Cobbett’s scheme was premised on the assumption that paper currency was, as Kevin
                  Gilmartin has put it, “the weakest link in a corrupt system, and the most
                  promising ‘point’ of radical resistance” (<title level="m">Print Politics</title>
                  163-4). It indicated a wider transition in Cobbett’s project of radical
                  opposition, mirroring the means by which the corrupt political order attempted to
                  maintain its dominance, as Gilmartin has argued: “Cobbett's ‘puff-out’ rested on
                  the sense that a historical shift in oppressive power from force to fraud required
                  a corresponding shift in political resistance” (164). In this 1818 <title
                     level="j">Register</title> article, much like in his 1816 print address, he
                  empowers a marginalized and persecuted section of the postwar economy with a
                  political agency otherwise unavailable to it. “And, as to the means of making
                  this attack; as to the means of dealing this <emph>decisive blow</emph>,” Cobbett
                  writes, “they are in the hands of thousands upon thousands of men, who are now in
                  England, and who <emph>must</emph> wish to see the system destroyed.” Crucially,
                  this plan of popular forgery rests on the democratization of printing, using
                  forged notes as a material counterweight to the official paper money system in a
                  suitably symbolic response to Government attempts at the regulation of the radical
                  press: “The means are <emph>graving tools</emph>, price five shillings, perhaps
                     A<emph> printing apparatus </emph>that a man may keep in a cubic foot of space.
                     <emph>Some paper</emph>. And the operator’s <emph>own dwelling
                  house</emph>”(18).</p>
               <p>The aim of this proposed act of mass forgery is made perfectly clear: “There are
                  no means of preventing it except that of <emph>putting an end to the</emph>
                  <emph>Paper-Money</emph>; and that is all that any one would wish to accomplish;
                  for, then we know that the Borough and Dungeon, and Spy system is at an end”
                  (19). Cobbett’s “puff-out” scheme would be very difficult to enforce against,
                  highlighting the structural weaknesses of a corrupt and elitely administered
                  political and economic system, as he emphasizes: “Neither Judge nor packed Jury,
                  nor Circular Letter, nor Bill of Indemnity, could avail aught against <emph>this
                     blow</emph>. Their Yeomanry Cavalry might sally forth prancing and swearing to
                  hack the wind. The Bank would meet in <emph>select committee</emph> and the Privy
                  Council, with Eldon and Canning amongst them, would be called together by Lord
                  Liverpool, who, when proposing the Dungeon Bill, said that Ministers were
                  ‘resolved to pursue the STERN path of <emph>duty</emph>’ ” (20-21). Perhaps the
                  most important feature of Cobbett’s “puff-out” plan is that it serves to remind
                  his audience of the profoundly ideological nature of the paper money system, with
                  a clear attack on the wealth and power of its primary beneficiaries, the
                  “fund-holders” and their political servants, the “Boroughmongers”. The
                  political function of the current financial arrangements —a key point of
                  discussion in “Paper Against Gold”—would be exposed for all to see: “They fear,
                  that the nation would never suffer them to keep estates, bought principally with
                  the borrowed money, while the lenders, however foolish and base, were starving;
                  and, I am sure, that their fear is well-founded” (23-4). The plan would strike
                  this corrupt politico-economic system at its roots, as Cobbett declares: “What a
                  pretty <emph>foundation</emph> does the Boroughmonger system stand upon, then?
                  This is their ‘solid system of finance,’ is it?” (25).</p>
               <p>As these assessments demonstrate, Cobbett’s “puff-out” plan should be understood
                  in the wider context of the Radical reform movement during an episode of political
                  crisis in the country’s capital city and financial centre. The increasing sense of
                  injustice surrounding the forgery prosecutions and widespread suspicion cast upon
                  Bank currency at this time only served to emphasize the need for immediate and
                  major reform of the nation’s political and economic system. Cobbett is at pains to
                  make clear that his mass forgery plan is above all intended to assist in the
                  larger cause of radical reform, something he was keen to remind a British radical
                  audience from his exile across the Atlantic: “If I am asked, what
                     <emph>inducement </emph>any body can have to make Bank Notes in order to
                  scatter them about the streets and high-ways, I answer; what
                     <emph>inducements</emph> have any of us Reformers had, and have, for any of our
                  exertions in the cause of Reform?” (24). Eliminating the hold of paper money on
                  the postwar economy was a precondition to political reform: “A Reform would
                  certainly put an end to the paper-money; but, the <emph>existence</emph> of the
                  latter it is that has hitherto <emph>prevented</emph> the Reform” (27).
                  Empowering his plebeian audience with such a key role in the larger struggle for
                  political reform was surely a continuing reminder to the Establishment of the
                  potency of the radical press in general and his <title level="j">Register</title>
                  in particular: “This, then, is the <emph>mighty </emph>Boroughmonger System! A
                  thing which a Cobler with his awl may annihilate. There is no need of daggers for
                  the many-headed monster. It may be killed as easy as a Hanoverian cracks a louse
                  that he finds in his whiskers. A little money to buy <emph>paper</emph>. That is
                  all that is wanted; and, as to such a sum for such a purpose, what is it!” (26).
                  The same could be said, of course, for the two pence paid by those reading about
                  Cobbett’s audacious “puff-out” plan throughout the country. </p>
               <p>Almost three weeks later Cobbett’s main rival in the plebeian public sphere, T. J.
                  Wooler, published an impassioned protest against the forgery prosecutions in his
                     <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> that complemented the exiled radical
                  leader’s attack on the morality of the regime brutally enforcing the paper money
                  system. In an article from September 1818 entitled “FORGERY OF BANK NOTES”,
                  Wooler expressed profound scepticism about the means by which those accused of
                  forging and uttering Bank notes had been convicted, arguing: “Before life is
                  taken, the <emph>best</emph> and <emph>strongest</emph> proof that can be
                  obtained, ought assuredly to be demanded.” The use of Bank employees as primary
                  witnesses in recent successful prosecutions “has given <emph>value</emph> and
                     <emph>force</emph> to…<emph>vague assertions</emph>, and they pass for proof”,
                  with the result that the accused “is sacrificed to <emph>protect the
                  Bank</emph>” with his life (<title level="j">Black Dwarf </title>2 [9 Sep. 1818],
                  562). In situations like this, the aim behind Cobbett’s “puff-out” plan is
                  presented as a valid means to highlighting the deeply corrupt enforcement system
                  in the service of the Bank of England: “Suppose it should assert that <emph>all
                     its notes</emph> were <emph>forgeries!</emph> and bring <emph>all its
                     servants</emph> to assert <emph>the fact!</emph> What would the Judge recommend
                  the Juries to do with the possessors of them?” (562).</p>
               <p>Unlike Cobbett’s “puff-out” scheme in the <title level="j">Register</title>,
                  however, Wooler’s impressive print battle against the forgery prosecutions in
                     <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> places the judicial system itself on
                  public trial for its role in the wider paper money system, as Phil Handler notes:
                  “He conducted a campaign designed to subvert the Bank prosecutions and
                  specifically urged jurors to reject the Bank’s evidence in the trials” (“Forging
                  the Agenda” 253). This aim is dramatically set out in “FORGERY OF BANK NOTES”,
                  with Wooler citing a contemporary case to add a sense of immediacy to his crusade:
                  “To support the system, <emph>homicide</emph> has been <emph>legalized</emph>;
                  and the name of <emph>law</emph> has been prostituted, and perverted to such a
                  degree, that <emph>a</emph>
                  <emph>Judge</emph> exclaims in the most <emph>evident astonishment</emph>,
                     <emph>‘What! come into a Court of Justice to talk about moral right, or moral
                     wrong!’</emph> There is something so monstrous in this, as imperiously to
                  demand the public interference, lest justice should indeed <emph>perish</emph>
                  beneath the load which miscalled <emph>law</emph> has heaped upon her” (561).
                  That this judicial farce in the service of the Bank of England often ends in death
                  for those accused only reinforces the urgency of the cultural resistance carried
                  out in the pages of <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> against the paper
                  money system. “The <emph>authors</emph> of the misery that prevails,
                     <emph>ought</emph>
                  <emph>to be</emph> more honest,” Wooler implores, “than to drive men to
                  wretchedness, to tempt them into a commission of a crime, and then to seize the
                  life as forfeit to their power, which has been overcome by their temptation.”
                  Echoing Cobbett, he asserts: “Nothing is easier than <emph>to forge bank
                     notes</emph>—except <emph>the uttering of them</emph> when they are forged—and
                     <emph>both</emph> are punished with the last of human sacrifices, the
                  punishment of death!!!” (561).</p>
               <p>Wooler’s sustained print campaign in the plebeian public sphere against the
                  forgery prosecutions focused on the integrity of the jury system as a symbolic
                  battleground for wider public opinion around the issue of paper money.<note
                     resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" n="5">A more thorough discussion of
                     Wooler’s jury-focused campaign can be found in Handler, “The Limits of
                     Discretion” 160-65. </note> In a follow up front-page <title level="j">Black
                     Dwarf</title> article published two weeks after the “FORGERY OF BANK NOTES”,
                  Wooler defended the intellectual autonomy of the British jury system as an
                  essential moral counterweight to an inherently corrupt legal process. “To suppose
                     <emph>because a bad law exists</emph>, affecting the <emph>lives</emph> of
                  Englishmen, that Juries must become <emph>parties to its execution</emph>, is an
                  absurdity,” he writes. Elaborating on this theme, Wooler observes: <quote>The
                     Jury is called, by the <emph>intent</emph> and <emph>spirit </emph>of all just
                     legislation, to decide upon the <emph>moral guilt</emph> of the party
                     accused—to ascertain <emph>what injury</emph> he has done to society—and to
                     determine what punishment is merited:—and if there be no medium between
                     inflicting an unjust, and cruelly severe punishment upon the offender, and
                     suffering him entirely to escape, few juries will hereafter hesitate to
                     pronounce, “that it is better <emph>many</emph> should <emph>escape</emph>,
                     than one unjustly suffer.” </quote> Crucially, he presents the moral and
                  intellectual autonomy of the jury in these forgery prosecutions as an extension of
                  a wider—and more compassionate—public opinion on the issue, adding: “Public
                  feeling always revolts at <emph>unnecessary cruelty </emph>:—but when cruelly is
                     <emph>useless,</emph> as well as <emph>unnecessary</emph>, there is an end to
                  all reasoning against it” (<title level="m">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [23 Sep. 1818],
                  593). A key element of this public outrage centred around the arbitrary nature of
                  Bank-sponsored prosecutions and executions for forging and uttering Banknotes,
                  something that Wooler directs his audience’s attention to as a rallying point for
                  wider political resistance on the issue: “The Bank is perfectly aware, if it
                  attempted to execute <emph>half its victims</emph>, they would be rescued from the
                  scaffold by the public indignation. A mere statement of the numbers implicated
                  will sufficiently prove that no government dare carry the law into effect,” he
                  suggests, in a clear echo of Cobbett’s immediate objectives for his “puff-out”
                  plan (597). With the judicial system so distorted by its obligations to the Bank
                  over the prosecutions, Wooler argues that juries in these cases have now become
                  the public embodiment of political justice, constituting a kind of symbolic
                  avant-garde of radical resistance to the entire paper money regime in the country:
                  “the whole system is sadly in want of a revision—and if the legislature should
                  continue to neglect its duty, let a few humane and resolute jurymen refuse to find
                  verdicts for the Bank, and necessity will effect what ought to be the result of
                  justice” (600).</p>
               <p>This campaign against the forgery prosecutions in <title level="j">The Black
                     Dwarf</title> emphasized the transformative role of radical knowledge in the
                  public sphere. In a headline article from October 1818 Wooler attempts to clarify
                  the immediate duty of the radical press as a democratic check on the corrupt
                  political and economic system, while demonstrating how it can also be used as an
                  important vehicle for reform in its own right. He recounts a typical case of
                  prosecution for uttering Banknotes as a thematic preface to the editorial
                  article—where the poor quality of official Banknotes and confusion over what
                  constitutes an expert opinion on forged notes makes the capital nature of the
                  offence so morally appalling. “The deformity of the system encreases, as it is
                  developed; and the hideous features of the paper demon become blacker as they are
                  exposed to the sun,” Wooler declares to his audience, inviting them to share in
                  his indignation. “The mind sickens to disgust at the hideous measures taken to
                  sustain the blood-cemented fabric of paper currency; and turn with horror from the
                  perspective immolations, which are destined to supply the future appetite for
                  carnage,” he adds (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [14 Oct. 1818], 641).
                  With the clarity of an expert prosecutor probing the criminal malfeasance of the
                  accused in the court of public opinion, Wooler gets to the heart of the injustice
                  surrounding the forgery trials, “No one can read the uncertainty which pervades
                  all the proceedings on this rotten foundation, without being convinced that
                     <emph>the Bank</emph> is guilty of nearly all the mischiefs that flow from the
                  offence of forgery,” he charges. “<emph>It has no certain means of
                     distinguishing its own notes</emph>. This is demonstrated by <emph>its servants
                     paying bad ones</emph>—those <emph>very servants</emph> who are called upon
                     <emph>occasionally</emph>, and who ought always to be called, to pronounce upon
                  the authenticity of those stated to be forgeries” (642). Without an objective and
                  transparent basis for what constitutes a forged Banknote, Wooler argues, the
                  entire legal edifice upon which the prosecutions are being conducted is
                  undermined. Appealing to a plebeian public familiar with the importance of skill
                  and accuracy in their working practices, Wooler asserts: “In the present advanced
                  state of the arts, it is impossible to produce any engraving that might not be
                  imitated more or less perfectly.” When “bank notes are so <emph>miserably
                     executed</emph>”, he suggests, “<emph>any engraver’s</emph> apprentice could
                  counterfeit them with the utmost facility” (644). This is followed by a lengthy
                  critique of the Bank’s production process from a Liverpool correspondent that
                  highlights the lack of craftsmanship and precision in its practices (644-45). In
                  short, Wooler provides his own “expert” witness in print form to add to his
                  public indictment of the Bank in the executions associated with the forgery
                  crisis. </p>
               <p>It is fitting that the leading radical journal of the postwar plebeian public
                  sphere would emphasize the importance of older, artisanal production practices as
                  a necessary corrective to the contemporary problems associated with the paper
                  money system, but Wooler’s aims go beyond this kind of local reform. As both Alex
                  Dick and Phil Handler have argued in respective studies of the forgery crisis,
                  Wooler was instrumental in publicizing the immorality of the forgery executions as
                  an emblem of the “bloody code” in the nineteenth century, where death was still
                  used as a punishment for property crime.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6"

                     <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> lead article, he reminds his audience of
                  just what was at stake in the public debates over the forgery prosecutions:
                     <quote>To contribute to rescue one from the scaffold, will be a greater
                     consolation to the BLACK DWARF, than the death of a million of sacrifices to
                     the system can be to the ministry, or to the Bank. The policy of capital
                     punishment for <emph>any crime save that of murder</emph>, begins to be doubted
                     by every humane mind; but that forgery and the utterance of forged notes,
                     should be punished with death, excites disgust in all, save those who profit by
                     the law (646).</quote> By drawing attention to the key role played by his
                  journal in these battles for public opinion during the forgery crisis, Wooler
                  underscores how radical knowledge can help to transform the wider public debate by
                  identifying those economic and political agents who work against the establishment
                  of democratic values in the country. “Awaked as the public mind is at present to
                  the subject, it is not to be expected that the repose of the Bank should be left
                  quite undisturbed as it has been,” he writes. “Insult and oppression have been
                  all that the public have received from an acquiescence in the paper system. To
                  that public is committed the expression of its own opinion, when the collected
                  facts are laid before the public tribunal” (646-47). </p>
               <p>In an opening <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> article from 25 November
                  directly addressed to “the Directors of the Bank of England”, Wooler extends his
                  trial of the forgery prosecutions in the court of public opinion, presenting
                  himself as a lead spokesman for a radical and rational public sphere capable of
                  providing some effective moral judgement upon the shambolic nature of the official
                  legal proceedings. “To appeal to your humanity, or sense of justice, would be
                  useless,” he begins. “Your interest has perverted the one and deadened the other
                  to a degree which would render you entirely callous to such an appeal.” In place
                  of any “appeal” to the Bank—or the courts who have so shamelessly served it
                  during the forgery crisis—Wooler instead emphasizes the moral autonomy and
                  ideological authority of the radical press as an alternative vehicle for justice:
                  “It remains, therefore, for the public to do itself that justice which you
                  deny—to express its abhorrence of the system, in which you triumph, and as far as
                  in them lies, to lend themselves no longer to the destructive practices of the
                  system to which your establishment belongs, as an integral part.” This is a
                  significant moment in the forgery crisis, where the leading intellectual opponent
                  of the prosecutions asserts the full force of radical public opinion against the
                  moral authority of a corrupt state and its principal financial institution. “To
                  enlighten that public,” Wooler continues, “and not with the hope of converting
                  you, is the object of the present compilation of the evidences of the falsehood of
                  the fabric upon which prosecutions for the utterance of forged, or pretended
                  forged, notes is erected” (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [25 Nov. 1818],
                  737). </p>
               <p>Wooler lists a series of “charges” against the Bank that the “pages of the
                  Black Dwarf have already recorded”, “sufficient testimony”, he argues, “to
                  induce every honest juryman to pause before he surrenders his <emph>conscience to
                     the Bank</emph>, and his sense of <emph>mercy</emph> to the
                  <emph>Bench</emph>” (737). These include the following: the ease and accuracy of
                  forgery; the ignorance and duplicity of the chief witnesses; the poor quality of
                  official Banknotes; the lack of substantial evidence against the accused; the
                  obvious ideological interests of the court Judges; and finally—and perhaps most
                  morally dubious in capital cases—the lack of judicial rigour in accepting
                  “expert” opinion for what he calls “positive evidence” (737-38). With the
                  threat of the full force of popular radical opinion behind him, Wooler writes to
                  the Bank Directors: “You can no longer hope to <emph>deceive</emph>. Your
                  practices are exposed; and the exposition will proceed with increasing conviction
                  of their fatal—their unjust tendency” (738). The paper currency of the radical
                  weekly is here presented as the true emblem of national democratic values and the
                  only real repository of justice in the affair, in place of the elaborate monetary
                  deceptions, judicial corruption and elite political interests represented by the
                  now blood-stained paper currency of the Bank of England. In the pages that follow,
                  Wooler enacts a radical print trial of the Bank and its prosecutions, complete
                  with his own “expert witness” (“a <emph>practical workman</emph>”),
                  re-creation of relevant court arguments, and critiques of the tenuous legal basis
                  for guilty verdicts, taken in part from correspondence with <title level="j">The
                     Black Dwarf</title> by readers and subscribers (738-43). He also reminds the
                  Bank Directors of the increasing national reach of opposition to the paper money
                  system, owed in no small part to the role played by periodicals like <title
                     level="j">The Black Dwarf</title>: “It is not only in <emph>London </emph>that
                     ‘<emph>the System</emph>,’ is known and <emph>hated</emph>. Common sense has
                  travelled into the country; and every mail brings to the ear some fresh
                  remonstrance, or some fresh proof of the discontent that so generally prevails
                  against your ‘<emph>system</emph>”’ (741). </p>
               <p>In December 1818 the Old Bailey became the principal battleground over the fate of
                  the paper money system. Wooler’s print crusade in <title level="j">The Black
                     Dwarf</title> against the evidential basis of the forgery prosecutions was
                  beginning to resonate, as Phil Handler has noted: “the dominant feeling of jurors
                  in the forgery trials towards the end of 1818 was distrust of the Bank and the
                  paper money system it was concerned to protect” (“The Limits of Discretion”
                  162). Juries at the trials of John Williams and John Dye acquitted the accused
                  based on the dubious nature of Bank-sponsored evidence.<note resp="editors"
                     xml:id="ftn7" place="foot" n="7"> See Handler, “The Limits of Discretion”
                     161. </note> Wooler’s response to the acquittals celebrates the efficacy of
                  radical public opinion in the crisis. “We have not attacked the wicked system
                  adopted on behalf of this <emph>tottering Mammoth</emph> without effect,” he
                  opens the lead article in the 9 December issue of <title level="j">The Black
                     Dwarf</title>, titled “DEFEAT OF THE BANK”. He continues, “We have aroused,
                  and concentrated, public opinion on this vital question; and enjoy the triumph
                  which we were only able to suggest, with the most heartfelt congratulation.”
                  Wooler adds, “ALL is <emph>safe</emph>, when a BRITISH JURY is fairly appealed
                  to” (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2 [9 Dec. 1818], 769), in a reference
                  perhaps to recent high profile radical acquittals by juries defying judicial
                  prejudice, like that of William Hone a year earlier at the Guildhall. </p>
               <p>It is clear, however, that Wooler has a much larger target than the issue of
                  judicial corruption in these cases. For him, the dominance of the paper money
                  system—as well as its corrupt legal apparatus—was shown to be vulnerable when
                  challenged by directed radical publicity in the public sphere. “To destroy these
                  practices was worthy the ambition of a <emph>giant</emph>; and the success, it is
                  hoped, will do some credit to the efforts of a <emph>Dwarf</emph>,” he suggests
                  to his audience, with a considerable degree of pride (769). The paper money system
                  “has now a <emph>rough road </emph>to proceed upon, and is stumbling at every
                  pace upon some fragments of the wreck of national and individual welfare.” He
                  asks: “Who will be found to lend any assistance to its wheels, that he may be
                  himself <emph>crushed under them</emph>?” (769-70). At the article’s conclusion
                  Wooler links the immediate triumph of the December forgery acquittals to the wider
                  project for radical political reform: <quote>The system feels the shock through
                     all the ramifications of corruption—and trembles through every fibre of its
                     dependents. It is in Threadneedle Street that the foundation of our miseries
                     was laid—it is <emph>there</emph> they must be redressed. <emph>There</emph>,
                     in the very temple of our oppressors must the banner of our emancipation be
                     erected; and it is <emph>there</emph>, that national justice, and national
                     humanity, ought to inscribe on tablets of brass the immortal names of those
                     Jurymen, who have “dared to be honest, in the worst of times!” (775). </quote>
                  This call for the heroic memorialisation of the forgery jurors in <title level="j"
                     >The Black Dwarf</title> was echoed during another period of crisis in the
                  radical reform movement, when Wooler would suggest to his audience that the names
                  of those martyred at Peterloo “should be collected, and a pretty little book
                  compiled, to keep in memory for ever the bloody transactions of the day” (<title
                     level="m">Black Dwarf</title> 3 [25 Aug. 1819], 552). This comparison between
                  the forgery jurors and the Radical protesters is significant, and not simply for
                  the link it provides between two key episodes in postwar radicalism. Alex Dick has
                  observed that “the same class of people that acquitted the Banknote forgers in
                  December, 1818 were also those who gathered at St. Peter’s field eight months
                  later” (393), drawing our attention back to the manner in which Wooler used the
                  forgery jurors as symbolic surrogates for his audience in the wider plebeian
                  public sphere, and how he would reprise this in his Peterloo writings about those
                  martyred demonstrators for a wider Radical movement in desperate need of
                  alternative means of protesting the state’s brutal political repression in
                     Manchester.<note resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" place="foot" n="8">For an

               </p>
               <p>Despite the euphoria that accompanied the acquittals, in the 16 December 1818
                  issue of <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title>, under the headline of
                  “MURDER!!!”, Wooler depicts a paper money system both soaking in blood and
                  scarred by legal hypocrisy after the execution orders for three men were announced
                  for “passing bad notes”, as he puts it (<title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> 2
                  [16 Dec. 1818], 784). That they were convicted on a similar evidentiary basis to
                  those who were acquitted the week earlier only adds to the public perception of
                  calculated state injustice. In a direct attack on the Home Secretary, Lord
                  Sidmouth, Wooler again sets himself the role as the spokesman for an outraged
                  popular public casting damning moral judgement on a corrupt and murderous regime
                  in dire need of radical reform. “The public has been insulted by the deliberate
                  sacrifice of three wretched individuals: and Lord Sidmouth has been the
                  officiating priest at the altar of our infuriate Moloch,” he writes, in reference
                  to the paper money system. “The public must speak,” Wooler implores, “and speak
                  in thunder, to the feelings of this heartless man” (783). This lead article
                  includes a petition written on behalf of the condemned utterers to the Prince
                  Regent, a letter of protest to the Home Secretary, and perhaps most poignantly, a
                  petition from the men themselves taken from a Sunday newspaper to conclude the
                  piece (784-86, 789-90).</p>
               <p>In his final comments Wooler returns to a theme pursued throughout <title
                     level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> print campaign against the forgery
                  prosecutions. “An <emph>unjust law</emph> is NO LAW, and ought not to influence
                  juries to <emph>do wrong</emph>,” he argues. In an appeal to his audience in the
                  wider plebeian public sphere—many of whom, like the condemned, with a first-hand
                  experience of the corrupt paper money system—Wooler writes: “A partial law is a
                  disgrace to justice: and while hundreds of utterers of forged notes are allowed to
                  escape the penalty of the law, all who are made to undergo that penalty are
                  unjustly put to death; and before a higher than an earthly tribunal, the offence
                  will not be deemed the less, because it is shared by many, and justified by a
                  perverted statute.” To emphasize the political nature of the executions—and the
                  bloody monetary system they are intended to protect—Wooler directly implicates
                  Sidmouth in the murder of the condemned: “May the spectres of his victims be
                  constantly before his eyes! May his sleep never again be tranquil, until he atones
                  for his fault by laying down an office he is every way unqualified to fill.”
                  “Even his friends startle at his conduct,” Wooler adds, “and many admirers of
                     ‘<emph>the system</emph>,’ confess they do not like it disfigured with blood”
                  (789).</p>
               <p>Indeed, the legal historian Phil Handler has commented that the immediate effect
                  of the executions, along with the earlier acquittals, “precipitated a crisis
                  within the criminal justice system and a widespread debate on the best means of
                  preventing forgery” (“Forging the Agenda” 253). Handler argues that the
                  “trials and executions for forgery provided a stark public reminder of the evils
                  of the paper system and the unreliability of Bank of England notes”, thus adding
                  to “the political momentum towards a resumption of cash payments” and
                  galvanizing “the criminal law reform movement”. He observes: “At the beginning
                  of the 1819 parliamentary session the government had no intention of tackling the
                  cash payments issue or initiating a full-scale inquiry into the operation of the
                  criminal laws, but by March it had conceded both issues” (256). These comments
                  remind us of the political efficacy of directed publicity in the plebeian public
                  sphere, where sustained analysis and argument transmitted by leading radical
                  weeklies like Cobbett’s <title level="j">Political Register</title> and Wooler’s
                     <title level="j">Black Dwarf</title> provided a national platform for
                  issues—like the paper money system—that had a disproportionate material impact on
                  the everyday lives of their audience. The ideological relevance of the radical
                  press at this time even provoked a reconsideration of the “bloody code” itself,
                  as Handler has demonstrated. The report of a parliamentary Select Committee
                  appointed to examine the legal basis of capital punishment explicitly cited the
                  forgery executions as a manifestation of public alienation with the capital laws,
                  and in a tone of moral disapproval similar to that found in the pages of the
                  radical press: “There is no offence in which the infliction of death seems more
                  repugnant to the strong and general and declared sense of the Public, than
                  forgery; there is no other in which there appears to prevail a greater compassion
                  for the offender and more horror at capital executions” (qtd. in “Forging the
                  Agenda” 259). </p>
               <p>Cobbett and Wooler’s opposition to the paper money system and its often brutal
                  legal enforcement demonstrate how the production and dissemination of radical
                  knowledge in the plebeian public sphere effectively confronted a corrupt and
                  bloody political and economic order. More significantly, the critical debates
                  around the paper money system initiated by these two leading radical intellectuals
                  of the early nineteenth century allow us to see how dedicated strategies of
                  cultural resistance were developed in response to the immediate needs of their
                  readers and listeners, and how these popular concerns were fed back into the wider
                  public debate about the relationship between paper money and judicial violence in
                  an unreformed polity. “Resentment of the Bank and the paper system was at the
                  heart of the forgery crisis,” Phil Handler observes. “Radicals harnessed public
                  concern over the problem of forged notes to further their own attack on Old
                  Corruption, which in turn threw many of the inadequacies of the criminal justice
                  system into sharp relief” (“Forging the Agenda” 262). Perhaps fittingly,
                  throughout this episode of political repression and economic crisis the paper
                  currency of radical periodicals like the <title level="j">Register</title> and
                     <title level="j">The Black Dwarf</title> became, for its audience, the most
                  prominent emblem of their democratic aspirations, material welfare and desire for
                  justice against the multifarious deceptions of the Bank, state and judicial
                  systems. </p>
