               <p>Forgery studies have developed rapidly in the past few years. No longer confined
                  to “fakelit”—the “original” literary forgeries of Chatterton, the controversies
                  surrounding Macpherson’s Ossian and W. H. Ireland’s Shakespeare, and the cultural
                  hoaxes of eighteenth-century antiquarianism—forgery has moved into such areas as
                  the law and character impersonation. The current work of Lionel Bently, as well as
                  that of Simon Stern, is, for example, scrutinizing notions of copying within the
                  legal frameworks of intellectual property and copyright legislation in the
                  eighteenth century, a field tackled in a different way by Richard Terry’s recent
                  book on literary accusations of plagiarism. Jack Lynch, meanwhile, has approached
                  the subject from the opposite perspective, focusing on the practice of detection.
                  In contrast, Margaret Russett, Debbie Lee, and others have focused attention on
                  the proliferation of impostors and fraudsters in the Romantic period.</p>
               <p>The activities of these variously fraudulent writers and performers—these
                  “texts”—may have been hinted at in earlier work on forgery, but it is most
                  heartening to see it is now bearing rich fruit. And the papers collected here
                  reveal that, influenced in part by the work of Mary Poovey and Margot Finn,
                  another, significant area of forgery studies is emerging in literary finance and
                  forgery. These four essays all, in very different ways, examine the implications
                  that the anxieties and politics surrounding financial fraud had in the early part
                  of the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>It is notable that this work concentrates on the first two decades of the century.
                  As Ian Haywood argues, the Bank Restriction Act, which released the Bank of
                  England from issuing metal currency in exchange for paper banknotes, precipitated
                  a credit crisis that exposed “Britain’s system of paper money as tantamount to a
                  form of legalized counterfeiting”, with the result that the entire political
                  system risked becoming effectively a “fraud.” Restriction undermined the system of
                  credit, but it also led to a huge increase in the number of executions for
                  forgery. As Phil Handler puts it, these trials and hangings “provided a stark
                  public reminder of the evils of the paper system and the unreliability of Bank of
                  England notes.” They also galvanized opposition to the government’s financial
                  controls. As Alex Benchimol points out, radical publications such as <title
                     level="j">Black Dwarf</title> campaigned against forgery prosecutions.
                  Haywood’s interest here is in investigating the imaginative implications of
                  counterfeit banknotes, a fascinating link that could connect the whole project of
                  Romanticism with the credit crisis. Specifically in this essay, he examines the
                  figure and work of the engraver, demonstrating that “Romantic-period anxieties
                  about authenticity and value achieved a spectacular visual form in the
                  ‘formidable’ power of the caricaturist.” </p>
               <p>There is perhaps a striking parallel for today’s readers to jokes made about the
                  recent Bank of England’s policy of “quantitative easing”, which has been compared
                  with counterfeiting—and also caricatured. <note resp="editors" place="foot">

                              beating down, and the streets are deserted. Times are tough, everybody
                              is in debt, and everybody lives on credit. On this particular day a
                              rich tourist from down south is driving through town. He stops at the
                              motel and lays a £50 note on the desk saying he wants to inspect the
                              rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.</p>
                           <p rend="noCount">As soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the
                              note and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.</p>
                           <p rend="noCount">The butcher takes the £50 and runs down the street to
                              repay his debt to the pig farmer.</p>
                           <p rend="noCount">The pig farmer takes the £50 and heads off to pay his

                  </note> But the historical context is also compelling. Things had been very
                  different in the early eighteenth-century. As Thomas Levenson has shown, Sir Isaac
                  Newton’s innovations at the Royal Mint were designed to maintain the integrity of
                  the physical fact of the coin. It was Newton who pioneered the use of milled edges
                  to coins and the motto, “<foreign>decus et tutamen</foreign>” (“an ornament and a
                  safeguard”) to ensure that coins could not be clipped (it is also worth noting
                  that he attended the executions of coiners who fell foul of his minting
                  techniques). But over the course of the century the prevalence of paper money
                  eventually created a profoundly different economic environment. Paper was not
                  bullion—it had no inherent value. There were not even objective criteria for
                  determining what constituted an authentic note, and attempts to create a
                  forgery-proof banknote were a constant reminder of the threat of counterfeit
                  bills. Moreover, the persistent slippage between literary and financial forgery (a
                  slippage over the period that has been examined in detail by Paul Baines) meant
                  that the rhetoric of the economy was laced with the terminology of fiction. No
                  wonder it provided abundant raw materials for caricature.</p>
               <p>The credit crisis (with its attendant language of forgery) also pervaded the
                  politics of the time. Benchimol himself considers the production, representation,
                  and circulation of radical knowledge to show that there was an explicit radical
                  campaign against the system of paper money. William Cobbett energetically exposed
                  the mystifications of the financial system, which, he argued, was spectral: it had
                  no bodily existence and paper money had merely imaginary value. The system was,
                  according to Cobbett, “profoundly immoral, unjust, and constructed upon an
                  unsustainable foundation of monetary abstractions.” His response was to outline a
                  mass campaign of active resistance. Cobbett argued that it was the act of
                     <emph>uttering</emph> (that is, passing as legal tender) forged paper bills
                  that brought the charge of forgery and led to the gallows; he therefore attacked
                  the circulation of paper money by proposing that forged notes be cast about in the
                  streets for anyone to pick up, unuttered.</p>
               <p>This shift in forgery studies towards legal property and financial forgery also
                  offers opportunities to reconsider authenticity. In legal and financial areas the
                  definitions of forgery and counterfeit are conflated and wholly entangled, and
                  this informs recent work by Robert Hopkins, who argues that aesthetic meanings of
                  forgery should be governed by establishing artistic intentions, in essence
                  mimicking the legal definition of the crime of forgery. Yet it is clear that the
                  distinction between forgery as an “original” composition attributed to another,
                  and counterfeit as an exact copy of a pre-existent work remains a valuable
                  distinction—if only in aesthetics.</p>
               <p>In one of two essays of literary criticism here, Robert Miles pursues the
                  relationship between aesthetics and economics by usefully arguing that forgery is
                  a “hinge” linking the two systems. Focusing on Jane Austen’s <title level="m"
                     >Emma</title>, he discovers that the “social imaginary” of the novel is wholly
                  underpinned by economic values: in particular, the endeavours to “realise” cash by
                  turning it into land and hence political influence. The internalization of such
                  values, brought about by the credit crisis and resulting boom-and-bust economy,
                  generates the conditions for the understanding of value and its circulation
                  throughout the text: Miles argues that Austen “through her economic interests …
                  finds a language for exploring a world where value is inescapably contingent.” </p>
               <p>Miles’s earlier work on impostors encourages Alex Dick to analyse the figure of
                  the Byronic rogue Sir Gregor MacGregor as an impostor or fraudster inspired in
                  part by Walter Scott’s <title level="m">Waverley</title>. Scott’s money troubles
                  literally underwrote his work and obliged him to mortgage his future
                  writing—consequently readers should be on the alert whenever Scott describes the
                  economy. Dick argues that in Scotland, financial speculation was presented as the
                  solution to the problem of economic diversification, which neatly explains Scott’s
                  tendency in his fiction to present speculative economies as failing economies.
                  Dick’s work is also an important reminder that Scotland retained some degree of
                  economic autonomy compared with the rest of Great Britain (as it does to this
                  day)—an archipelagic perspective that enables Scott’s fiction to become an
                  “instrument of comparison” between different cultures.</p>
               <p>These four essays therefore indicate some of the directions that this field may
                  take. There will be others: more work is needed for example on the Gold Standard
                  and the national debt (Haywood reveals that by 1821 it was 2.7 times the national
                  income), and it would be good to see legal historians, economic historians, and
                  literary historians work together to trace, for example, counterfeiting,
                  plagiarism, and the emergence of copyright through the eighteenth century and into
                  the nineteenth century. In the meantime, these studies afford a new opportunity to
                  reassess literary finance and forgery in the period.</p>
