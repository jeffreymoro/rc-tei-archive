                     “Introduction”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">In recent decades skirmishes about how to read literature and culture have at times
                  polarized critics, who find themselves identified, or identify themselves, with distinct
                  critical dispositions toward either historicism or toward some version of poststructuralist
                  writing, in particular deconstruction, supposed to be suspicious of historicism for
                  espousing an empiricist, neo-positivist perspective on the past. What emerges from
                  this standoff can seem comical or simply bizarre as one side imagines the other as
                  its constitutive other, and as such productive of readings in which something is missing.
                  Deconstructive and poststructural readers who ground their readings in philosophical
                  argument and rhetorical nuance are at the very least bemused by the focus on detail
                  in new historicist readings or the large gestures of cultural studies readings. In
                  reply historicist and cultural critics find the lacunae in arguments from philosophical
                  points of departure damaging to the lived temporality of writing and culture. Although
                  this dispute animates more than one moment of literary study (it has become more marked
                  in Victorian studies), its most sustained version has concerned Romanticism, understood
                  variously since the 1980s as the disputed subject of new historicism and deconstruction.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Whatever else it is, Romanticism arises in a moment of extraordinary and divisive
                  recognition of differences among races, peoples, and political programs. And at least
                  since the 1980s, the era has remained the focus of critical dissent as deconstructive,
                  new historicist and other critical arguments debated whose Romanticism was theirs.
                  This debate has in turn helped to shape public understanding of how we read literature
                  and culture now as an enterprise strangely and contentiously divided between thinking
                  about the work of language or the character of historical difference as though each
                  goal could be separated from the other. This opposition is strangely rigid, easy to
                  caricature and, as importantly, easy to dismiss. What gets lost in this critical antagonism
                  is the shimmer of historical and philosophical friction in Romanticism itself and
                  in compelling Romantic criticism in the last decade.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><em>Romantic Frictions</em> emphasizes this important critical turn, which supposes that the pressure of Romantic
                  difference is as much historical and cultural as it is philosophical and theoretical
                  and that it is ongoing in critical discourse. So positioned, these essays address
                  the rub of critical differences as the work at hand as well as the work that Romanticism
                  itself frequently performed. Hearing critical voices rather than taking stands, these
                  essays stage frictions that make Romanticism engaging for modern readers, precisely
                  because this era and its modern critics remind us of the value of difference as the
                  work of thought in time and culture. The essays in <em>Romantic Frictions</em> find in Romanticism what philosophical modernity has often found there: a disposition
                  to recognize oppositions that cannot be squared or resolved precisely because they
                  constitute the ongoing work of culture and writing. Such frictions are embedded in
                  a shifting temporal moment whose inner complexity is similarly textured such that
                  neither history nor philosophy assumes a master (and fictional) disguise. Both are
                  instead crosscut and assembled in ways that sustain an inner friction that invites
                  being read.</p>

                     “The Trouble with Man: Scott, Romance, and World History in the Age of Lamarck”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Sylvan the giant captive Ourang-Outang is only the most spectacular figure in an array
                  of monsters, prodigies, and other anomalous characters who trouble the categories
                  not just of culture, gender, ethnicity and race but of humanity as a species in Walter
                  Scott's late romance <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> (1831). Dismissed by most commentators as a bizarre effusion of Scott’s dotage, <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> sets its scene decisively outside the developmental continuum specified for “the
                  classical form of the historical novel” by Georg Lukács. Eleventh-century Constantinople
                  is scarcely the scene of “our own” past, a setting that may provide “a concrete prehistory
                  of the present” (<em>The Historical Novel</em> 269). It is doubly divided from modern British readers: by the schism between the
                  Greek and Roman churches, which cast Byzantium as the decadent shadow of a more vigorous
                  “western civilization”; and by the Ottoman conquest of 1453, which cut off the Greek
                  empire from the progressive path to modernity. J. H. Alexander’s new edition of <em>Count Robert of Paris </em>(Edinburgh, 2006), restoring extensive passages that were cut by Scott’s executors,
                  allows us to see more clearly than was hitherto possible the novel’s philosophical
                  investment in alien histories, alien origins.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Among the passages published for the first time is a conclusion in which Scott acknowledges
                  the unprecedented, experimental character of what is “probably the last of my fictitious
                  compositions” (362). The quest for “novelty at whatever rate” has driven him to “lay
                  his scene in distant countries, among stranger nations, whose manners are imagined
                  for the purpose of the story – nay, whose powers are extended beyond those of human
                  nature.” Scott’s prime example of a romance that goes beyond human nature is “a late
                  novel . . . by the name of Frankenstein” (363). Scott had reviewed <em>Frankenstein </em>for <em>Blackwood’s </em>in 1818, and a new edition of the novel, revised by Mary Shelley, was published just
                  over one month after he completed <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> (and less than two months before its publication). On Scott’s own authority, then,
                  this essay will read <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> not as a historical novel but as a work of anthropological science fiction. Scott’s
                  late romance reveals the link between the historical novel and science fiction to
                  be more intimate than we might have thought, genetic as well as analogical, soon after
                  the foundation of both genres (<em>Waverley</em>, <em>Frankenstein</em>) in British Romanticism.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The name of that link, “man,” designates the philosophical problematic of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> and marks the novel’s station not just at the end of Scott’s career but at the end
                  of a century-long project of cultural modernization, the so-called Scottish Enlightenment.
                  In 1739 David Hume had given that project a name, “the science of man.” By the 1770s
                  it seemed as though history had become established as the discipline best equipped
                  to realize the science of man, in conjectural histories of society, of manners and
                  institutions, the arts and sciences, as well as of particular nations. It was the
                  attempt to totalize these projects, to write the history of man as a species that
                  laid bare a fault-line in the secular category of “man”—a fault-line constituted by
                  its biological foundation. “The Human Species is in every view an interesting subject,”
                  wrote Lord Kames in the preface to his <em>Sketches of the History of Man</em> (1774): however, “there is still wanting a history of the species, in its progress
                  from the savage state to its highest civilization and improvement.” “The subject of
                  this volume is the History of Man, by which I mean, not what is commonly called History,
                  that is the History of Nations and Empires, but the History of the Species Man”: thus
                  Lord Monboddo, introducing the fourth volume of his <em>Antient Metaphysics</em> (1795). These best-known of Scottish essays in the history of man as a species<span class="hi"> </span>are notorious for their disruption of the category they invoke: Kames for his argument
                  that humankind consists of different species (originally unified but then marked with
                  biological as well as linguistic difference after Babel), Monboddo for his insistence
                  that the mysterious great ape, the Orang-Outang, is man in his natural state, lacking
                  only the artificial acquirement of language. For these accounts, it seems, “man” signifies
                  at once too much and too little. By the time Scott was writing <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>, in 1830-31, the trouble with man had blown up into a scandal. Amid a rising tide
                  of mainly French morphological speculation on the transmutation of species, Jean-Baptiste
                  Lamarck had cited the orang-utan as a human prototype—not just a type of natural man
                  but a figure for man’s animal origins and the mutability of species. Lamarck’s work
                  was diffused across British literature by the controversy that peaked in the early
                  1830s, in endorsements by “Edinburgh Lamarckians” such as Robert Jameson and Robert
                  E. Grant, as well as in refutations, most notably by Charles Lyell in the second volume
                  of <em>Principles of Geology</em> (published one month after <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>, in January 1832).</p>
               <p class="noCount"><em>Count Robert of Paris</em> finds its imaginative opening in the contemporary crisis of world history and the
                  science of man. Scott’s Constantinople swarms with different creeds, nations, races
                  and species, in which the boundaries between nation and race and species, and between
                  human and non-human species, shift and blur. The main figure for this boundary-flux
                  is the Orang-Outang, who, among his other accomplishments, understands instructions
                  given in Anglo-Saxon and kills off the principal villain of the story. The newly restored
                  text of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> allows us to see that various forms of biological difference (including sexual as
                  well as racial and species difference) are everywhere in play in the novel. <em>Count Robert</em> earns its place beside <em>Frankenstein</em>, if we understand Shelley’s novel (following Maureen McLane’s analysis in <em>Romanticism and the Human Sciences</em>) as enacting a radical critique of the “specifically anthropological discourse of
                  man” that underwrites the newly-won autonomy of imaginative literature in British
                  Romanticism. Scott’s Constantinople opens a new kind of setting for a new kind of
                  historical romance: the cosmopolis or world-city as conjectural arena for the natural
                  history of man. Within this radically heterodox imaginary space, <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> explodes the monogenetic trajectories of national progress charted in the Scottish
                  Waverley Novels for a fantastic exploration of the multiplicity of developmental paths
                  and forms that humankind might take.</p>

                     “Field of History, Field of Battle”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Over the course of the eighteenth-century, Great Britain built a formidable military
                  power stoked in no small part by financial instruments devised not by merchants but
                  by the state. "The ability of government administrators to establish the routine by
                  which revenues were collected, money raised and supplies requisitioned," writes historian
                  John Brewer, "could make the difference between victory and humiliation." The rise
                  of the "fiscal-military state" strengthened both British military forces and the state
                  itself to an unprecedented degree. The financial, even clerical mode of waging war
                  gained extraordinary value over the course of the eighteenth-century; hardly visible
                  to the public at large, their effects were felt more than they were seen. New modes
                  of taxation and deficit spending "put muscle on the bones of the British body politic,
                  increasing its endurance, strength and reach" (xvii). Brewer's magisterial account
                  deliberately turns attention away from military exploits and heroes, even away from
                  devastating violence, to focus on the driest aspects of a nation dedicated to its
                  martial power: taxes, book-keeping, numbers. In doing so, his account translates a
                  system of fragile abstractions into corporeal tissue, converting what might be dead
                  matter—the bare bones of the field of history or the field of battle—into a robust
                  "body politic." More curious perhaps, and a sign of the uneasy passage of numbers
                  to bodies, is Brewer's acknowledgement that the fictive body is also a feeling one:
                  "humiliation," rather than defeat per se, is the haunting alternative to British victory.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The figurative conjunction and conversion of numbers and flesh under the banner of
                  war remains familiar. Harder to analyze in these verbal maneuvers is the level of
                  sentience involved: what can the bodies born of numbers feel? The form of modern war
                  emergent in the eighteenth century via taxes and debt financing is allied with other
                  emergent regimes associated with numbers and finance: to what degree did the force
                  of numbers amplify, dampen or otherwise transform the feeling body? If, as Brewer
                  suggests, the economic repercussions of war in this period "are difficult to measure,"
                  how much more difficult is measurement when it tries to align what one contemporary
                  called "the system of war" with the nervous system (xxi)? I would like to argue for
                  a particular emphasis and delineation in the Romantic period on feeling numbers, especially
                  among a group of reform-minded tinkers: Bentham, Godwin and Shelley—often in conversation
                  with non-reformists such as Malthus. Heirs to and subjects of the fiscal military
                  state, commenting both during and after the cataclysmic global wars with France that
                  opened the new century, these writers unravel the neat allegory that Brewer paints,
                  where the numbers of state finance and the cells of human bodies appear neatly woven
                  together in the history of war. They employ numbers, by contrast, that tax the body
                  to the point of disintegration so that, in fact, only numbers are left to register
                  feeling. </p>
               <p class="noCount">Following recent critical studies on numbers and finance capital by Mary Poovey and
                  Ian Baucom; and studies of the history of affect, I consider Romantic debates on the
                  numbers of war, and how reformists developed philosophical and rhetorical instruments
                  to convert a system of value so closely associated with and productive of imperial
                  warfare, into a system of feeling numbers that resists and works to disintegrate the
                  fiction of the robust body politic. My aim is less to show how these writers argued
                  against the system of numbers, but rather how they embraced and reconstituted numbers,
                  insisting on the correspondence between pained and suffering bodies and state accounting,
                  pushing that correspondence for its affective yield. In these cases, it is difficult
                  and perhaps counter-productive to decide whether the appeal to numbers by opponents
                  of the "war system" can be read as irony or complicity. "In the scale of just calculation,"
                  observes James Callender, a reformist forced to leave Britain for his criticism of
                  Britain's war policies, "the most valuable commodity, next to human blood, is money."
                  In his tirade against the "war system," Callender literally seethes with numbers.
                  Here is just his concluding flourish: “The question to be decided is, are we to proceed
                  with the war system? Are we, in the progress of the nineteenth-century, to embrace
                  five thousand fresh taxes, to squander a second five hundred millions sterling, and
                  to extirpate twenty millions of people?” (8) The question that motivates my essay
                  concerns what "just calculation" might mean in this view of history. I argue for war
                  as a particularly potent site, indeed, perhaps the most potent and generative site
                  for friction between universals and particulars, between theoretical (or in this case,
                  numerical) systems and those forces (in this case, feeling or affect) that accompany
                  as much as they disrupt such systems. The putative "difference" between calculation
                  and sentience may be more complex than conventional accounts of Romanticism have led
                  us to believe, especially when we are asked to respond to something like an unembodied
                  sentience. </p>

                     “Of Extension and Durability: Romanticism’s Imperial Re-Memberings”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">William Hodges’s <em>Travels in India During the Years 1780, 1781, 1782 and 1783</em> (1793) is a text literally structured by war. Hodges’s travels and his narrative
                  are repeatedly interrupted by armed conflict between the forces of the East India
                  Company and resistant native powers across the subcontinent. The particular conflicts
                  in question did not go well for the British and the humiliating loss at Pollilur not
                  only raised questions regarding Warren Hastings’s bellicosity, but also haunted representations
                  of British rule in India until the final defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1799. In spite of
                  the fact that the <em>Travels</em> appears to be a pro-Hastings document, published in London at the turning point in
                  the impeachment proceedings against the former Governor-General of Bengal, the narrative
                  disjunctions instantiated by these conflicts destabilize Hodges’s explicit argument
                  that British governance in the region is not only benevolent, but also far superior
                  to prior examples of Moslem rule. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the
                  text’s figural economy–both textual and visual–attempts to ameliorate the narrative
                  disjunctions which everywhere threaten to disclose the Company’s precarious claim
                  to sovereignty. Through a close analysis of Hodges’s figuration of good and bad governance
                  in the region, the argument will isolate precisely how his–and by extension, the Company’s--historical
                  predicament erupts into the text and call in to question the very models of governmentality
                  figured forth in his remarkable rendering of the banyan tree.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Michel Foucault, in his essay “Governmentality”, defined “Government as the right
                  disposition of things”. From the period immediately prior to the passing of the Regulating
                  Act to the East India Company Charter Act, the hybridity of the East India Company
                  generated significant controversy regarding the appropriate form and quality of colonial
                  rule. Hodges’s text engages with this problematic by presenting figures of the right
                  disposition of men and things. The most important of these, the banyan tree, is the
                  subject of an extensive textual description and also one of the volumes most accomplished
                  engravings. In the text, the tree offers shade and sustenance to all who come under
                  its canopy and it is metaphorically linked to Hastings’s management of Indian affairs.
                  Its vitality and above all its naturalness accrue to the governmentality of the Company
                  and thus it ostensibly stands as a figure of prosperity, hope and stability in a time
                  of war and economic uncertainty. It also stands in marked contrast to Hodges similarly
                  iconic description of the ruins of Agra and especially of Acbar’s tomb later in the
                  text. As ruins architectural traces of a similarly ruined Mughal empire, these descriptions
                  ostensibly testify to the fundamental inability despotic powers to rule effectively.
                  Akbar’s tomb is especially important in this regard because it is Akbar’s name itself,
                  as rendered on the mausoleum that operates as the ultimate contrast to the banyan
                  tree. In other words, a dead name, an almost Wordsworthian epitaph, figures forth
                  the disappearance and obsolescence of entire period in Indian history and in its place,
                  Hodges offers a living thing. What interests me about this contrast is that in both
                  cases the historical obfuscations depend upon key slippages in the distinction between
                  word and image, between living and dead, between name and metaphor.</p>
               <p class="noCount">My essay’s concluding gesture demonstrates how the visual renderings of the banyan
                  tree and of architectural ruins attempt to contain or regulate what amounts to a crisis
                  in figuration. Of particular importance is the way Hodges’s image engages with prior
                  images, most notably in Picart, which link the tree to suspect forms of sexuality.
                  At the heart of Hodges engraving is a resonant act of visual surrogation which figures
                  forth a remarkable fantasy of phallic Company rule well before the East India Company
                  fully consolidated its power in the region. In other words, one can discern within
                  the relationship between textual figuration and the visual strategies of the engravings
                  the kind of “wishful thinking” or self-delusion that C. A. Bayly has identified as
                  a crucial element of British governance prior to and during the imposition of the
                  Permanent Settlement.</p>

                     “Allegory and Exchange in the Waverley Novels”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay will propose that for an historical understanding of Scott’s fiction—or
                  Romantic texts more generally—we should read them not as representations but rather
                  as objects of exchange that embody social labor. The historically specific forms of
                  the exchanges in which they took part and of the equivalents in which their value
                  was realized determined the texts’ formal traits, which when this determination is
                  ignored have the appearance of unmotivated play. The essay will offer its critical
                  practice as an example to show that by a formalist reading of Scott’s fiction we can
                  gain an historical understanding of textual production in the years of British publishing’s
                  takeoff into capitalism. This reading will attend above all to the topic of signature,
                  to the differentiations of text and paratext, and to those of writing as material
                  practice and as abstraction, both as motifs in the Waverley novels and as problems
                  in their social production and circulation.</p>
               <p class="noCount">In Marx, capital is formally a moment of self-referentiality in the system of mediations
                  that is a money economy. As capital money appears to lose the mediating relation to
                  other commodities that normally defines it, and to relate only to itself in a process
                  for which Marx gives the elementary formula M-&gt;M. The project of <em>Capital</em> is to dissolve this appearance of capital’s identity. In discussing Scott, however,
                  we are concerned with an historical moment at which that identity has scarcely yet
                  been constituted. Scott wrote at a time and in a place where the money supply was
                  in practice extremely heterogeneous and the question of money’s identity was a hotly
                  debated topic in political economy.</p>
               <p class="noCount">My main theoretical claim in this essay is that the indeterminacy of the money form
                  for which Scott exchanged his labor as a novelist is allegorized in traits of the
                  novels themselves. I will make this case principally through a reading of <em>The Antiquary</em> (1816), the third Waverley novel and one of the most playfully self-referential.
                  In this novel the inhomogeneity of money and the difficulty of recognizing it is a
                  recurrent topic; two of the novel’s subplots turn on representations of transactions
                  in the form M-&gt;M as comedies of error. In one, the Tory Baronet Sir Arthur Wardour
                  becomes the dupe of a German swindler, who in exchange for an investment of “dirty
                  Fairport banknotes” promises him “pure gold and silver, I cannot tell how much!" In
                  the other, Wardour’s comic foil, Jonathan Oldbuck, the antiquary of the title, pays
                  in good money for what he takes to be curious old coins, only to find that what he
                  has purchased, though old, is a still-current instance of Scottish token coinage.
                  Money, far from providing a uniform standard of value, becomes the novel’s principal
                  instance of irreducible difference.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Monetary difference in <em>The Antiquary</em> certainly allegorizes cultural and political difference; elsewhere in Scott’s work,
                  in <em>The Letters of Malachi Malagrowther</em> (1826), written to defend Scots’ use of small denomination banknotes where the British
                  system used coin, this allegory becomes explicit. The Scottish monetary system is
                  defended not as superior to others, but on the grounds of difference itself. The frugality
                  of a paper circulation that does not withdraw any useful commodity from circulation
                  is explained as the expression of a frugal national character, formed by a harsh climate
                  and poor land.</p>
               <p class="noCount">This essay argues, however, that the monetary difference that repeatedly disrupts
                  exchange within the diegesis of <em>The Antiquary</em> also corresponds to formal traits of the text that do not readily lend themselves
                  to culturalist interpretations of the kind that Scott himself pioneered. The uncertain
                  boundary between what is and what is not money in the novel is the expression of a
                  specific conjuncture in the historical development of capital and also an instance
                  of a general problematic of the textual boundary that pervades the Waverley novels,
                  with their serial form, indistinguishable protagonists, and extensive textual periphery
                  in Scott’s introductions, prefaces, notes and other apparatus. When money is represented
                  in <em>The Antiquary</em> as bearing effaced or illegible signatures the novel incorporates within itself another
                  instance of one of its own formal traits, framed as it is by the long performance
                  of his own anonymity that Scott carried on before finally acknowledging in 1827 that
                  he was the author of the Waverley novels. These formal traits of the Waverley novels,
                  I will show, are determined by the historically specific forms of exchange by which
                  the value of Scott’s labor was realized and ultimately transformed into capital.</p>

                     “Can We Talk About Consciousness Again?: (Emergence, Natural Piety, Wordsworth)”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Talk about consciousness has largely disappeared from Romantic studies and, indeed,
                  from literary studies more generally. As a symbol of this disappearance we might look
                  to Harold Bloom’s edited volume <em>Romanticism and Consciousness</em> (1970). While the volume was officially dedicated to the proposition that to talk
                  about Romanticism simply <em>was</em> to talk about consciousness, its inclusion of Paul de Man’s proto-deconstructive
                  essay “Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image” in fact marked the beginning of
                  the end of the association between Romanticism and consciousness. Sometime later de
                  Man could retrospectively mark his own deconstructive turn as a break, however imperfect,
                  from consciousness-talk. Noting the emphasis on “rhetorical terminology” in his landmark
                  essay “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” de Man writes in 1983: “[t]his terminology is
                  still uncomfortably intertwined with the thematic vocabulary of consciousness … that
                  was current at the time, but it signals a turn that, at least for me, has proven to
                  be productive.” One could note other similar turns at about this same time, not only
                  within the “Yale School” and its turn away from phenomenology (Geoffrey Hartman and
                  J. Hillis Miller) but also for example in Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy’s <em>Literary Absolute</em> (1978).</p>
               <p class="noCount">Meanwhile, the historicism that has dominated Romantic studies for the past-quarter
                  century has likewise had little patience with consciousness talk, which, particularly
                  under the influence of Marx and Engels’s <em>German Ideology</em>, it has tended to identify with “false consciousness.” The Frankfurt School, from
                  Horkheimer and Adorno through to Habermas, has also been suspicious of consciousness,
                  for largely cognate reasons.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The end result of these powerful intellectual movements has been to deprive students
                  of literature in general, and of Romanticism in particular, of a vocabulary for describing
                  what goes on in the mind as anything other than a series of effects produced by some
                  other structure, such rhetoric, history, or ideology. </p>
               <p class="noCount">There are, of course, many good reasons to be skeptical about consciousness-talk,
                  and this essay is not intended as a jeremiad. Rather, I seek here to remark upon an
                  ironic countermovement in intellectual history, namely that just as consciousness-talk
                  was disappearing from literary study it was re-emerging in the disciplines of cognitive
                  science and analytic philosophy of mind. The result of this re-emergence has been
                  an extraordinarily rich body of work—empirical and conceptual—on consciousness over
                  the past 20 years: a rich body of work about which literary scholars, with one or
                  two exceptions, has had nothing to say. It is that lack of conversation, the missed
                  opportunity, which my essay dwells upon.</p>
               <p class="noCount">One immediate objection to any effort in this direction is that reintroducing consciousness
                  will result in mind-body dualism, and this result needs to be avoided for a variety
                  of political and intellectual reasons. A stronger version of this claim is that the
                  Romantic writers themselves were anti-dualist, but that this fact went unappreciated
                  until the advent of deconstructive and historicist criticism. Talking about consciousness
                  again would thus be like turning back the clock. And yet almost all cognitive scientists
                  and philosophers of mind writing today agree that consciousness-talk and materialism
                  are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, this is precisely the issue around which much
                  of the current conversation circles: whether a non-reductive physicalism is possible,
                  and what it would look like. The mind-body problem, that is to say, remains just that:
                  a problem. One implication of this claim is that it may be impossible <em>not</em> to talk about consciousness. Any position on the mind body-problem (which would include
                  virtually any theory of how literature produces meaning, as Knapp and Michaels demonstrated
                  a number of years ago in “Against Theory”) is also implicitly a theory of consciousness,
                  even if a strictly negative one. There is value, therefore, in getting such hidden
                  theories out into the open.</p>
               <p class="noCount">My essay examines two approaches to the question of consciousness that have lately
                  caught the attention of Romanticists. The first approach is a neurological one. The
                  strong version of this approach is that because the mind is identical to the brain,
                  consciousness is an illusion (though perhaps an evolutionarily necessary one). This
                  is sometimes referred to as “eliminative materialism,” and it is a popular position
                  among neuroscientists (Francis Crick, Christophe Koch) and some philosophers (Daniel
                  Dennett). Alan Richardson’s <em>British Romanticism and the Science of Mind</em> (2001), which argues for what Richardson calls the “embodied mind,” is considerably
                  influenced by eliminative materialism. I will critique Richardson on the grounds that
                  his neurologically-derived model cannot ultimately find a place for representation:
                  a problem for any discussion of literary meaning, and (a larger claim) for discussions
                  of culture in general.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The second approach is emergence theory, which has a longer track record (stretching
                  back to the nineteenth century) but is currently less popular among cognitive scientists
                  and philosophers. Neither bees nor ants possess consciousness, and yet a bee-hive
                  or an ant colony could be said to possess consciousness; in much the same way, emergence
                  theory proposes that consciousness “emerges” from lower-level self-organizing and
                  self- modifying systems. Some properties emerge from a physical substrate in a way
                  that cannot be explained from the perspective of that substrate (eg. from the perspective
                  of physics), nor are those properties reducible to the properties of their physical
                  parts. Emergence has one decided advantage: the issue of phenomenal experience (“qualia”)
                  is a problem for eliminative materialism (David Chalmers calls this the “hard problem”),
                  but it is not a problem for emergence theory. Thus emergence seems a more promising
                  route for discussions of cognitive science and literature, since it makes room for
                  discussions of representation and of culture, as Alan Liu has recently demonstrated
                  in his consideration of Romanticism and creative destruction. </p>
               <p class="noCount">Emergence theory faces a problem, however, that eliminative materialism avoids: causation.
                  This includes both bottom-up causation (from physical property to mental property)
                  and top-down causation (whether a mental property can change the organization of its
                  own physical substrate). Confronting this problem, Samuel Alexander, the late nineteenth-century
                  emergence theorist, hit upon a phrase that ought to interest any Romanticist. The
                  mystery of causation, Alexander wrote, had simply to accept with “natural piety.”
                  My paper ends, then, with a consideration of Wordsworth’s “My Heart Leaps Up” in the
                  context of emergence theory. </p>

               <p class="noCount">"I see around me here / Things which you cannot see: we die, my Friend, / Nor we alone,

                  him, or is changed." </p>
               <p class="noCount">Speaking to the narrator of <em>The Ruined Cottage</em>, Armytage perceives what Adorno and Horkheimer call “disaster triumphant”: the invisible
                  and intangible things of the destroyed environment, or things which in their utter
                  lack of specificity and waste define the circulation of sentimental value that the
                  poem has traditionally been thought to sustain. Part of that value depends precisely
                  on this waste or decay that the poem proposes; after all, these things are not simply
                  ghostly revenants but half-material entities on their way to death. Like Margaret,
                  like the broken objects outside the cottage, and finally, like Armytage and the narrator,
                  all things break down in the disaster that the poem paints, and their differences
                  are rehydrated by its lines of sympathy, “in spite of things silently gone out of
                  mind and things violently destroyed” (Preface). And yet, if Romanticism has often
                  been read as synonymous with discourses of humanism, personhood, and community, how
                  should we read Wordsworth’s insistence that we not look away from the disaster, from
                  things in their states of destruction <em>and </em>difference? And more specifically, what would it mean to think of persons as different
                  things themselves? In this paper, I want to consider the non-pathological and transformative
                  effects produced by disaster—that is to say, how apocalypticism in certain Romantic
                  poems is denatured or flattened out to the point where “disaster triumphant” expresses
                  new forms of non-triumphal, wasted life that evoke different ethical versions of social
                  vulnerability. I will work toward a ruined cottage as the place where Wordsworth explores
                  the hospitality of dwelling in the rubble of disaster; in other words, disaster as
                  not the pessimistic obliteration of enlightenment promise, but rather as a kindly
                  reimagination of sociality without a future.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The spectral quality of things unseen echoes the commodity form itself which, as David
                  Simpson has argued, describes not simply things-in-themselves but things as they leave
                  the world. Although Wordsworth appears to be striving for a language of “thingification”
                  in his scenes of disaster, he tries to think through a different kind of object relations
                  that is not reducible to the logic of the commodity. The kind of interest in disaster
                  that a poem like <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> appears to evoke is not simply a rehumanization of our relationship with things in
                  the world, but rather an unworking or <em>desoeuvrement</em> of our modes of being, troubling the kinds of economies which shuttle persons and
                  things between durability and transience, gain and loss, wealth and waste. I trace
                  how persons live through and are readily thingified in the disaster, and why the desire
                  to treat persons <em>as things</em> becomes a necessary component of Romantic modernity—to re circulate persons in an
                  aesthetic economy that cannot bear to possess anything, that treats persons as <em>res nullius</em>, and would have us literally waste life.</p>
