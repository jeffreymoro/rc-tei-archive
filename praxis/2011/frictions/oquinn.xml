                              <p>What difference does a critical awareness of imperial history make for the study of British Romanticism? Material that was formerly
                                    the domain of anthropologists, art historians, archaeologists,
                                    military historians and historians of empire has become an
                                    important archive both for re-thinking canonical texts and
                                    for re-imagining the social and cultural dynamics of Georgian
                                    society. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">See for example
                                          Teltscher.</note> Important critical studies have laid the
                                    groundwork for expanding scholars&#8217; sense of the ways in
                                    which Romantic discourse was thoroughly permeated by global
                                    geopolitical concerns. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"
                                          >See Baucom, Makdisi, Franklin, Coleman, Leask, Barrell,
                                          and Richardson and Hofkosh, for a sense of the range of
                                          work in this area.</note> We can read the editorial
                                    consensus among recent anthologies of British Romanticism, all
                                    of which contain subsections on anti-slavery and orientalism, as
                                    a symptomatic recognition of the importance of these materials.
                                    That said, there are also few surprises here. Earlier scholars
                                    such as David Erdman established beyond question the importance
                                    of imperial problematics to Blake&#8217;s work, and there are
                                    many other similar examples. What remains constant is a
                                    recognition that the period conventionally associated with
                                    Romantic discourse saw crucial transformations in imperial
                                    governance and colonial discourse. And yet there has been a
                                    remarkable containment of this recognition by relegating this
                                    scholarship into sub-fields. Scholars who work on British India
                                    are well aware of this predicament, for in spite of widespread
                                    recognition of the importance of developments on the Indian
                                    subcontinent to British society in the late eighteenth and early
                                    nineteenth centuries, important work on Romantic
                                    interculturalism, on the emergence of proto-anthropological
                                    disciplines, on models of racialization, on global economics and
                                    other topics remains either the domain of a few scholars
                                    bridging the divide between literary studies and history or it
                                    remains largely unexplored. A similar problem exists for
                                    scholars of trans-Atlantic Romanticism whose work has the
                                    potential to undermine the recalcitrant division of literary
                                    studies into the study of national literatures.</p>
                              <p>My concern here is not simply one of disciplinary
                                    exclusion&#8212;although that is an important issue&#8212;or of
                                    expanding the field of enquiry yet again. The question with
                                    which I opened this essay does not pertain simply to questions
                                    of &#8220;context&#8221; or of &#8220;canon&#8221;. The issue I
                                    want to address here is how increasing awareness of the global
                                    flow of people, commodities, and cultural products impinges on
                                    how we analyze Romantic culture. Obviously, I cannot provide an
                                    exhaustive answer to such a question in an essay. What I will do
                                    instead is offer a set of linked examples of the kind of analysis
                                    that might begin to give a sense of the potential afforded by
                                    allowing knowledge of imperial history to permeate close reading
                                    and vice versa. I use the word permeation advisedly, because
                                    beyond demonstrating how historical context enables cultural
                                    analysis, I also show how close reading itself does historical
                                    work, and thus cannot be separated from some world beyond the
                                    text.</p>
                             
                              <p>In the process, I am going to make at least two grand claims,
                                    hardly new, but which inform everything which follows. The first
                                    concerns the unabated prosecution of war throughout the late
                                    eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As Mary Favret has
                                    persuasively argued, Romantic literature is a wartime
                                    literature, and from the Seven Years War onward Britain&#8217;s
                                    wars were global affairs. <note n="3" place="foot"
                                          resp="editors">See Favret <title level="m">War at a
                                                Distance</title> (2010) and <title level="a">War in
                                                the Air</title> (2004).</note> The second follows
                                    from the first and has to do with chronology. The more that one
                                    reads the imperial archive, the more it becomes clear that
                                    consideration of the emergence and practice of what we call
                                    Romanticism needs to start with the loss of the American
                                    colonies. In my opinion, the preponderance of scholarship on the
                                    French Revolution is one of the decisive critical obstacles to a
                                    genealogical analysis of the relationship between Romanticism
                                    and empire because it so frequently re-inscribes the nation as
                                    the primary political entity. This is not to say that this
                                    scholarship is invalid or wrong-headed, but rather that it
                                    radically limits the historical purview of cultural analysis. </p>
                              <p>Historians as differently motivated as J.G.A. Pocock and Dror
                                    Wahrman have argued that something fundamental happens to
                                    British culture and society during the American crisis. <note

                                    theory of confederation in British political thought and the

                                    of empire following &#8220;the momentous if transitory
                                    establishment of an English-speaking universal empire in the
                                    North Atlantic and Alleghanian America&#8221; following the
                                    Seven Years War. Instabilities in the governance of this
                                    extensive empire undermined triumphalist rhetoric from an early
                                    stage and thus analysis of the colonial challenge to imperial
                                    rule looked back to earlier moments of instability in the realm.
                                    The recent experience of the historical trauma of civil war and
                                    the hard won sense of stability following the Glorious
                                    Revolution and the quelling of the Jacobite rebellion inflected
                                    all of the responses to the American crisis. &#8220;Englishmen
                                    could see that the American programme entailed the separation of
                                    crown from parliament, threatening the unity of
                                    &#8216;empire&#8217; which was the only guarantee against civil
                                    war and dissolution of government, those deep and still bleeding
                                    wounds in their historical memory&#8221;. <note n="5"

                                    This history proved to be decisive for Britain, because it meant
                                    that &#8220;the heart of the American problem for Britain was
                                    less the maintenance of imperial control than the preservation
                                    of essentially English institutions which the claims of empire
                                    were calling into question&#8221;. <note n="6" place="foot"
                                          resp="editors">Pocock, 278.</note> As Pocock demonstrates,
                                    American secession allowed for the maintenance of
                                    &#8220;colony&#8221; as a constitutive outside for British
                                    sovereignty because America acceded to the condition of a state.
                                    Thus one of the crucial adjustments in the era following the
                                    American war was a redefinition of coloniality itself such that
                                    colonial governance was carried out not by legislatures, but
                                    rather by governors, &#8220;often military men, [who] directly
                                    exercised their sovereign&#8217;s authority, representing him in
                                    his personal, imperial and parliamentary character&#8221; (Pocock 301). This
                                    new imperial regime stabilized both the notion of
                                    King-in-Parliament, and the global economic networks which it
                                    governed.</p>
                              <p>Losses in America in the early 1780s are inextricably bound up with
                                    reverses in India during the same period. As Linda Colley has
                                    reminded us, news of Haider Ali&#8217;s victory over the British
                                    at Pollilur in 1780 arrived in London in 1781 and provoked
                                    &#8216;universal consternation&#8217; in part because the news
                                    coincided with reports of the fall of Yorktown.(270) To
                                    commentators in the American colonies, in Britain and in India
                                    at this time, the East India Company&#8217;s hold over territory
                                    in India empire seemed in equal jeopardy. Like the first war
                                    with Mysore in 1767-9, the Second Mysore War ended
                                    inconclusively in 1784, and it cost the East India Company a
                                    great deal both in resources and confidence. According to a
                                    British medical officer stationed in Calcutta at the time,

                              The close affiliation between Tipu Sultan and French forces not
                                    only raised the question of renewed French intervention in
                                    India, but also replicated the trajectory of the American
                                    campaign, in which the French played a decisive role from 1778
                                    onward. Metropolitan anxiety about these defeats was at its
                                    height throughout the 1780s, and when the Third Mysore War
                                    commenced in 1790 both the newspapers and the print satirists
                                    predicted further humiliation of the British forces. Cornwallis
                                    defeated Tipu in the Third Mysore War and the elaborate
                                    settlement which ensued from his victory at Seringapatam played
                                    a crucial part in the shift from anxiety to triumphalism in the
                                    1790s.</p>
                              <p>In contrast to Stephen Conway&#8217;s influential argument that the

                                    attitudes to war and empire (315), this essay contends that the
                                    transit from the early 1780s to the early 1790s involved
                                    extremely complex shifts in British subjectification&#8212;i.e.
                                    the processes through which subjects make themselves accountable
                                    to normative discourses which in turn recognise and make them
                                    visible&#8212;and that these shifts are perceptible in the

                                    not only how changes in imperial governance can be traced in the
                                    formal and aesthetic elements being analyzed, but also how close
                                    reading of these formal elements can elucidate the historical
                                    dynamics of global empire. In both cases, I argue that the works
                                    themselves act as conduits from the early 1780s to the early
                                    1790s, from one revolutionary situation to another, and thus
                                    need to be considered in light of this transit through
                                    historical time. Specifically, I will be looking at the
                                    emblematic representation of trees as metaphors for governance
                                    in order to show how each reconfigures the relationship between
                                    men and things in a way that cancels the memory of past imperial
                                    reverses. Lurking in the centre of the essay is brief reading of
                                    another notable tree, Burke&#8217;s famous oak from the <title

                                    in order to show how the figural exchange between empire and
                                    nation can productively engage with extant scholarship on the
                                    1790s. In my readings of Hodges, Burke and Cowper, these
                                    botanical figures become surrogative in Joseph Roach&#8217;s
                                    sense of the term in that they overwrite a historical wound in
                                    order to allow an enabling supplemental fantasy to gain traction
                                    in a time of national and imperial crisis (2). As prosthetic

                                    Hodges&#8217;s deployment of the Banyan tree, and Cowper&#8217;s
                                    re-orientation of the oak metaphor allow us to see what kind of
                                    cultural work was needed to reconfigure imperial subjectivity at
                                    this transitional juncture.</p>

                                    his narrative are repeatedly interrupted by armed conflict
                                    between the forces of the East India Company and resistant
                                    native powers across the subcontinent. The first chapter records
                                    the humiliating loss at Pollilur in the Second Mysore War which
                                    not only raised questions regarding Warren Hastings&#8217;s
                                    bellicosity, but also haunted representations of British rule in
                                    India until the final defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1799. Later
                                    chapters are closely intertwined with the East India

                                    of British representation of India at this juncture. The

                                    obfuscation intervene not only in the rhetorical assault on

                                    during the Cornwallis era. What I wish to demonstrate, through
                                    the close reading of compositional adjacency and metonymic

                                    larger historical and political developments which transformed
                                    not only British rule in the Asian subcontinent, but also the

                                    Company&#8217;s humiliating defeat at Pollilur? It is important
                                    to recognize the chain of associations invoked by this material.
                                    The loss at Pollilur resulted in the captivity and enslavement
                                    of numerous British soldiers. As Kate Teltscher and Linda Colley
                                    have demonstrated, accounts of their forced conversion and
                                    circumcision were widely circulated throughout the 1780s, and
                                    they generated significant anxiety regarding the blurring of
                                    lines between Mysorean and British identities. <note n="11"

                                          285-90.</note> These anxieties were exacerbated by reports
                                    of British atrocities at Anantpaur, of the overall mismanagement
                                    of the second Mysore war and of the indecisive treaty of
                                    Mangalore. In short, war with Mysore in the 1780s is traversed
                                    by fantasies of castration, loss and failure that are largely
                                    responsible for the construction of Tipu Sultan as the
                                    arch-enemy of British imperial activity in India.</p>
                              <p>This entire assemblage of associations establishes a frame of
                                    imperial anxiety and, like Giles Tillotson, I believe that the
                                    war with Mysore casts a long shadow in the <title level="m"

                                    time in Madras, Hodges presents the conflict with Hyder Ali as
                                    an interruption in artistic and commercial production:
                              <quote>I prepared eagerly for a tour through the country; but my route was
                                    scarcely fixed, when I was interrupted by the great scourge of
                                    human nature, the great enemy of the arts, war, which, with
                                    horrors perhaps unknown to the civilized regions of Europe,
                                    descended like a torrent over the whole face of the country,
                                    driving the peaceful husbandman from his plow, and the
                                    manufacturer from his loom. (5)</quote>
                              This image of the manufacturer separated from his loom is extremely
                                    important not only because there is an implicit comparison
                                    between his inactivity and the inactivity of the artist, but
                                    also because this trope becomes a lynch-pin in Hodges&#8217;s
                                    later account of the banyan tree. At this point in the text, the
                                    populace is starving and the reader is starved for images. This
                                    passage is followed by an extended and detailed account of the
                                    British reversals and by the introduction of the volume&#8217;s
                                    first plate—a view of the great pagoda at Tanjore, which Hodges
                                    emphasizes was worked up from &#8220;an accurate drawing from

                                    assertion of Hodges&#8217;s aesthetic commitment to plein air
                                    landscape painting but rather with its repudiation by historical
                                    events. Chapter 1 therefore is about military and aesthetic
                                    failure. And it is about surrogation: here is something else in
                                    lieu of what I could not give you. This is important because
                                    Chapter 2 opens with a turning away from this problematic:
                                    Hodges removes to Bengal, comes more directly under the
                                    patronage of Hastings and undertakes the journey towards Benares
                                    and Agra which became the basis of much of his representation of
                                    India. </p>
                              <p>From the period immediately prior to the passing of the Regulating
                                    Act to the East India Company Charter Act, the governance of the
                                    East India Company generated significant controversy regarding
                                    the appropriate form and quality of colonial rule. Michel
                                    Foucault, in his essay <title level="a">Governmentality,</title>
                                    defined &#8220;Government as the right disposition of
                                    things,&#8221; and his notion of disposition is useful here,
                                    because it draws attention to how power is distributed by the
                                    very selection and arrangement of populations, commodities and
                                    flows. Hodges&#8217;s text engages with this problematic by
                                    presenting figures of the right disposition of men and things.
                                    The absence of women in this phrase is intended because it lies
                                    at the core not only of Hodges image of the banyan tree, but
                                    also in key developments in colonial discourse in the early
                                    1790s. Harriet Guest&#8217;s recent reading of the deployment of
                                    femininity in Hodges&#8217;s narrative argues that the
                                    &#8220;great distinction&#8221; between Indian and European
                                    society is negotiated by the ascription of femininity to Indian
                                    peoples, places and things (2007, 28-32). Within the chain of
                                    images engraved for the <title level="m">Travels</title>, the
                                    banyan tree image is caught in the tangle of gendered fantasies
                                    which inflected much of the European and specifically British
                                    account of imperial rule. It is preceded by a Mughal painting of
                                    a Zenanah (24) and followed by a highly sentimental image of
                                          <title level="a">Mahommedan Women attending the Tombs of
                                          their Parents, Relatives, or Friends at Night</title> (28).
                                    Two of the next three images focus specifically on Hindu women:
                                    first, an image of mother and child (30) and then the famous
                                    stele-like image of the <title level="a">Procession of a Hindoo
                                          woman to sacrifice on the funeral pile</title> (84). At
                                    the risk of simplifying this chain of images, I would suggest
                                    that the banyan tree is ensconced in a series of
                                    proto-ethnographic images which focus almost exclusively on the
                                    lives of women. The subjects here are not incidental for they
                                    are connected to precisely the social and religious practices
                                    most frequently remarked upon by European travelers—the
                                    sequestration of women, marital constancy and suttee—as signs
                                    either of Moslem despotism or Hindu fanaticism/superstition. And
                                    each in their own way argues against prior visualizations of
                                    these elements of Indian sociability. The Zenanah image hands
                                    over representational agency to an unnamed Mughal artist, thereby
                                    squelching any imputation of voyeurism. The mourning image
                                    figures it as a scene of exemplary sensibility; and the suttee
                                    scene is rendered as a scene of horrified yet erotically charged
                                    observation. <note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">For an

                                    </figure> In this image the viewer is placed beneath the canopy
                                    of the tree as a witness to what Picart and Tavernier before him
                                    refer to as idolatrous practices. The key issue here is one of
                                    metonymic adjacency: the tree takes on monstrous qualities
                                    because it is adjacent to the superstitious practices of the
                                    fakirs. That metonymic relation is the ground on which a much
                                    more complex metaphorical relationship is built. The
                                    tree&#8217;s excessive extension and the confusion between
                                    parent and child trees are equated with the excessive practices
                                    of the fakirs. That excess has specifically non-normative sexual
                                    connotations because in the groups of figures we have women
                                    consorting with naked fakirs.</p>
                              <p>That monstrous excess is figured forth by the face on the
                                    tree&#8217;s trunk, which occupies the centre of the
                                    composition, and which is framed by the central temple.
                                    Picart&#8217;s adjoining text identifies that face: <quote>You
                                          may see, says he [Tavernier], about the Borders of Surat,
                                          under a spacious Tree where the Banians resort, several
                                          Pagods, consecrated to their Idols. The Pagod that leans
                                          against the Body of the Tree is dedicated to
                                                <foreign>Mamaniva</foreign>, whose formidable Head
                                          may be discerned in the Middle of the hollow Trunk. Hither
                                          resort several Votaries, who prostrate themselves before
                                          this monstrous Idol, and a Bramin collects at the same
                                          time their Free-will offerings, which consist of Rice,
                                          Millet, &amp;c. Whoever comes to offer up their
                                          Supplications before this Pagod of
                                                <foreign>Mamaniva</foreign>, are marked on the
                                          Forehead with Vermillion, with which they beautify and
                                          adorn their Idol. Honoured with this Mark, their Votaries
                                          imagine no evil Spirit can have the least prevailing Power
                                          over them. (7-8)</quote> Mamaniva is a corruption of
                                    Mahadevi the great mother goddess of Hinduism, therefore both
                                    the metonymical and metaphorical correlations of the image
                                    conspire to represent Hindu religion, and by extension, its
                                    practitioners, as a monstrous mother which reproduces either
                                    autonomously or with its own children. In this light, the
                                    framing function of the central pagod gains a certain eloquence
                                    because it effectively envaginates the face. The
                                    hyper-maternalization of the scene effectively evacuates the
                                    father from this visual and textual assemblage.<note n="18"

                              <p>Hodges&#8217;s rendering of the banyan tree effectively interrupts
                                    the entire network of associations mobilized by Picart and
                                    performs a complex series of displacements. Again the key lies
                                    in compositional adjacency, in the disposition of the
                                    image&#8217;s component elements. A metonymic relation is built
                                    between the two shaded figures and the tree. In contrast to the
                                    Picart image, the two figures are unloading the boat on the
                                    extreme left so the tree is adjacent, not to fanaticism, but to
                                    idealized labour and prosperity. This specifically contrasts
                                    with the Bramin from Picart&#8217;s text who ostensibly profits
                                    from the &#8220;superstition&#8221; of the votaries. This
                                    substitution of one kind of accumulation for another is crucial
                                    to Hodges&#8217;s textual description of the banyan tree:
                                          <quote>I proceeded from Sultungunge to Bauglepoor, where
                                          my pursuits were promoted with a degree of liberality that
                                          peculiarly marked the mind of the gentleman [Augustus
                                          Cleveland] who then governed this district; and of whom,
                                          in common gratitude, I must ever speak with veneration and
                                          esteem. At the entrance of the town of Bauglepoor, I made
                                          a drawing of a banyan tree, of which a plate is annexed.
                                          This is one of those curious productions of nature which
                                          cannot fail to excite the attention of the traveller. The
                                          branches of this tree having shoots depending from them,
                                          and taking root, again produce, and become the parents of
                                          others. These trees, in many instances, cover such an
                                          extent of ground, that hundreds of people may take shelter
                                          under one of them from the scorching rays of the sun. The
                                          care that was taken in the government, and the minute
                                          attention to the happiness of the people, rendered this
                                          district, at this time, (1781) a perfect paradise. It was
                                          not uncommon to see the manufacturer at his loom, in the
                                          cool shade, attended by his friend softening his labour by
                                          the tender strains of music. There are to be met with in
                                          India many old pictures representing similar subjects, in
                                          the happy times of the Mogul government. (27)</quote> In
                                    the text, the tree offers shade and sustenance to all who come
                                    under its canopy and it is figuratively linked to Augustus
                                    Cleveland&#8217;s, and by extension Hastings&#8217;s, management
                                    of the region. Its vitality and, above all, its naturalness
                                    accrue to the governmentality of the East India Company, and
                                    thus it ostensibly stands as a figure of prosperity, hope and
                                    stability in a time of war and economic uncertainty.</p>
                              <p>The text achieves this rhetorical sleight of hand through the
                                    careful management of adjacent sentences and figures. The first
                                    sentence indicates that it is Cleveland who not only governs the
                                    district, but also fosters Hodges&#8217;s artistic production.
                                    This has a kind of inaugural effect because Hodges ostensibly
                                    made no art in Madras during the campaign against Mysore. This
                                    frames the next four sentences which specifically address the
                                    banyan tree. The final three sentences of the paragraph then
                                    suddenly cut back to the framing issue by speaking directly
                                    about good governance. If we break the paragraph into these
                                    three, the gap between the internal description of the tree and
                                    the framing remarks on governmentality become immediately
                                    conspicuous. It is literally the paratactic adjacency of the
                                    frame to the internal description that allows the tree to figure
                                    for good government. And each of the sentences of this internal
                                    unit is notable for how it re-writes prior descriptions of the
                                    banyan tree. By describing the tree as a natural curiosity which
                                    &#8220;cannot fail to excite the attention of the
                                    traveller&#8221;, Hodges invokes the long line of travel
                                    narratives and quasi-scientific accounts of Asia, which includes
                                    Tavernier, Picart and Fenning. However, the subsequent sentence
                                    performs a key divagation from these prior discourses when it
                                    refuses to refer to the tree as a mother and when it rigorously
                                    separates the child-like dependent shoots from the newly rooted
                                    &#8220;parents of others&#8221;. This effectively counters not
                                    only the feminization of the tree, and hence its connection to
                                    Mamaniva in Picart, but also replaces non-normative sexuality
                                    with a carefully managed sphere of reproduction where parents
                                    and children are never confused.<note n="19" place="foot"

                                          reading of the multivalent possibilities of the

                                          gives some sense of the closure effected in Hodges&#8217;s
                                          representation of the banyan tree. As we will see later in
                                          this essay, Milton&#8217;s deployment of the banyan tree
                                          is important to Cowper&#8217;s rendering of the oak
                                          tree.</note> So much for the threat of monstrous maternal
                                    Hinduism nascent in Picart. The next sentence picks up on the
                                    tree&#8217;s ability to shade &#8220;hundreds of people&#8221;,
                                    but does not refer to this group as a regiment as in Fenning.
                                    This erases the military in favour of a subject people and thus
                                    erases both native insurgency and British military activity in
                                    one rhetorical stroke.</p>
                              <p>The final three sentences of the paragraph play out the
                                    implications of Hodges&#8217;s re-writing of prior discourses on
                                    the banyan tree with an uncompromising logic. When we jump the
                                    gap from the fifth to the six sentence, Cleveland&#8217;s good
                                    governance has generated a paradise on earth. In light of the
                                    prior evacuation of the tree&#8217;s metonymic and metaphorical
                                    connections to Mahadevi, this declaration seems to imply that
                                    Cleveland, and by extension, the East India Company, operate as
                                    a benevolent God who, rather than inculcating fanaticism and
                                    non-productivity, fosters both commercial and artistic
                                    production. This helps explain why the religious elements of
                                    Picart&#8217;s image are invoked but visually contained in both
                                    the church-like building in the background and the walking
                                    figure in the foreground.</p>
                              <p>The face of Mamaniva is doubly displaced, and I would argue that
                                    this doubling poses a series of complex problems. The
                                    architectural element in the background still occupies the
                                    precise centre of the composition, but it no longer frames the
                                    trunk and if anything its tiny church-like spire replaces the
                                    envaginated female face in Picart with a certain quiet
                                    phallicism. Could we not argue that the monstrous mother of
                                    Hinduism has been replaced by a pagod whose undecidable
                                    construction suspiciously resonates with the Christian discourse
                                    used to legitimate Cleveland&#8217;s governance? The
                                    compositional displacement and the undecidable architectural
                                    element figures forth a form of Hindu culture dissociated from
                                    fanaticism at precisely the moment when the question of
                                    Chrisitianizing the Asian subcontinent is very much in the air.

                                          disseminated at the same time as Hodges&#8217;s <title

                                    undecidability of the architectural figure is resonant because
                                    it sits at the juncture of two governmental paths—one aimed at
                                    containing Hindu excess and one aimed at converting the
                                    population—when arguments for both options were being weighed
                                    and counter-weighed.</p>
                              <p>In this context the tree itself becomes iconically phallic or
                                    indeed hyper-phallicized. As a huge penis with myriad dependent
                                    penises, this figure for the governmentality of the East India
                                    Company not only puts thousands of years of Hindu religious and
                                    social practices into abeyance, but also equates the Company
                                    with the autonomous production of both food and art. This is
                                    bolstered by the final sentence of the paragraph which links
                                    this new period of productivity to earlier periods of Mughal
                                    stability, presumably under the Akbar&#8217;s rule, wherein good
                                    governance fostered art and happiness. This linkage between
                                    Akbar and Hastings not only legitimates Company rule as a
                                    repetition of past models of good government, but also firmly
                                    locates any competent form of Moslem rule in the historical
                                    past. As Tobin, Eaton and others have argued, <note n="21"

                                    particularly well suited to rendering India society and culture
                                    as one vast ruin, and this same thematic suffuses Hodges&#8217;s
                                    description of Akbar&#8217;s tomb: <quote>A blazing eastern sun
                                          shining full on this building, composed of such varied
                                          materials, produces a glare of splendour almost beyond the
                                          imagination of an inhabitant of these northern climates to
                                          conceive; and the present solitude that reigns over the
                                          whole of the neglected garden, excites involuntarily a
                                          melancholy pensiveness....The inside of the tomb is a vast
                                          hall, occupying the whole space of the interior of the

                                          melancholy proof of the consequences of a bad government,
                                          of wild ambition, and horrors attending civil dissentions;
                                          for when the governors of this country were in plenitude
                                          of power, exercised their rights with wisdom, from the
                                          excellence of its climate, with some degree of industry,
                                          it must have been a perfect garden; but now is all
                                          desolation and silence. (122-3)</quote></p>
                              <p>Hodges' sense of &#8220;pensive melancholy&#8221; has multiple
                                    valences in 1793—its year of publication—and it is hard not to
                                    hear, in the phrase &#8220;civil dissentions&#8221;, a certain
                                    cautionary admonition regarding not only imperial, but also
                                    national affairs. In light of the melancholy prompted by this
                                    icon of the mutability of dynastic power is thus entirely
                                    appropriate that phallic British governance be figured forth not
                                    architecturally but rather as a living organism whose extension
                                    constitutes a fantasy of paternal self-replication. </p>
                              <p>The style of paternal masculinity which Hodges associates with both
                                    Akbar and Hastings resonates with the emergence of a crucial
                                    trope—both visual and textual—from Britain&#8217;s ongoing
                                    struggles with Mysore. In his careful management of the famous
                                    hostage transaction which ended the third Mysore War in 1793,
                                    Cornwallis, and those representing the event, did everything
                                    possible to suggest that Tipu Sultan&#8217;s sons would receive
                                    a form of paternal care previously unknown to them in their
                                    father&#8217;s household. This declaration of paternal
                                    benevolence was explicitly mobilized to contrast with the
                                    treatment of British captives by Hyder Ali following Pollilur.

                                          240-43.</note> This gesture coalesced with the emergence
                                    of a proto-ethnographic &#8220;explanation&#8221; for why Indian
                                    populations were incapable of governing themselves that linked
                                    subject populations to non-normative sexualities. In this
                                    rhetoric, the native population of India was divided along
                                    religious and ethnic lines and polarized by gendered fantasies
                                    of identity. <note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors">See Sen,

                                    rulers, such as Tipu Sultan, lies an internal capsule of
                                    normative masculinity. Hodges&#8217;s complex deployment of
                                    gender and sexuality in the description of the banyan tree
                                    speaks to the ongoing spectre of loss in Mysore set into motion
                                    in the first chapter of the <title level="m">Travels</title>, but it does so in a way
                                    that both forecloses and opens the problematic of
                                    governmentality. In Hodges&#8217;s text, the former rule of
                                    Akbar and the present example of the East India Company exist
                                    uneasily in this realm of normativity because the distinction
                                    between past and present is the only thing preventing the
                                    collapse between Moslem and Christian rule. </p>
                              <p>If we take one last look at the banyan tree image we can discern
                                    three layers of displacement. In the background, the ancient
                                    pagod which framed Mahadewi in Picart&#8217;s picture has given
                                    way to an image from the future: a small parsonage superimposed
                                    on a now obsolete Hindu temple. In the middle ground,
                                    Mahadewi&#8217;s envaginated face has been erased and the tree
                                    itself emerges as a fantasy of phallic British rule. And the
                                    ancient religious practices of the faqirs have been replaced by
                                    present commerce. And in the foreground, something new emerges.
                                    The aged Hindu man looking out at the viewer is not only
                                    detached from the past of Picart&#8217;s image, but he seems to
                                    hail the viewer, or perhaps even Hodges, into a new temporal
                                    relationship beyond the conventional aesthetic objectives of the
                                    picturesque. It is as though the old man&#8217;s gaze
                                    establishes precisely what Hodges and by extension his audience
                                    desired all along: a relationship which figures forth the
                                    artist/observer as a phallic ruler over the subject of the
                                    image. Remember Hodges asserts that during the time of truly
                                    successful native insurgency there is no art. Here in 1793
                                    following what was supposed to be victory over Tipu, Hodges text
                                    can revel in the power of domination. Isn&#8217;t that what is
                                    coded into the penitential pose of the figure in the foreground,
                                    for this is not an intersubjective glance, but a gaze of
                                    subjection. And the viewer accedes to the scene of paternal
                                    forgiveness perhaps needed to overcome the psychic, governmental
                                    and historical impasse occasioned in 1781. In this re-figuring
                                    of the past Hodges has sketched the future for himself and for
                                    those to whom he wishes to sell the <title level="m">Travels</title>—a future that brings
                                    his art through the picturesque distancing from the political
                                    towards the moral exemplifications and re-invigorated Georgic
                                    tropes associated with Romanticism. <note n="24" place="foot"

                                    surprising. As Quilley and Bonehill indicate, &#8220;the picture
                                    gives a panoramic view across the park and countryside with the
                                    focal point of the castle in the centre distance, in an
                                    evocation of an ordered, harmonious landscape that is to be
                                    understood as at once natural and political&#8221; (194). The
                                    pair of oaks on the right frames both the stags in the
                                    foreground and the castle in the background, and thus perform
                                    precisely the sheltering function that oaks had performed in
                                    numerous contexts from at least the time of Locke. Pope&#8217;s

                              <p>But something is amiss. In both Pope and Whitehead, British oaks
                                    have a global reach either through their transformation into
                                    warships in the case of Windsor Forest, or through a certain
                                    political extension in Whitehead. <note n="27" place="foot"

                              <p>This figure of the spreading branches of the British oak—here
                                    extending across the Atlantic itself—is simply not possible in
                                    the 1780s. The loss of the American colonies has lead to a
                                    certain restraint in this emblematic figure. But this spatial
                                    restraint is supplemented by a renewed investment in the
                                    oak&#8217;s capacity to figure forth historical continuity:
                                    spatial extension gives way to temporal reach.</p>
                              <p>I think we can see something of this in Hodges' picture, for its
                                    rendering of power is remarkably contained and in many ways
                                    looped in on itself. The oak frames the stags which rest before
                                    the seat of the King. All three pictorial elements are the
                                    literal possessions of the Crown and each one figures for the
                                    Crown. In this sense, they are doubled versions of each other
                                    and thus the concentration of power is in a sense
                                    overdetermined. That overdetermination suggests that the entire
                                    composition is attempting to shore up something that may not be
                                    as solid as it first appears. This is only exacerbated by the
                                    format of the print itself. Modelled on his iconic pictures of
                                    the ruins of former Mughal stability, Hodges&#8217;s view of
                                    Windsor has the potential to be read not only as the
                                    consolidation of dynastic power, but also as a further example
                                    of the mutability of empire. In other words, the allegorical
                                    relation set up between Windsor and the Tomb of Akbar
                                    establishes the British crown as both the substitute for Mughal
                                    power and its double. This reaffirms Britain&#8217;s claim to
                                    governance in the present, but uses the Mughal past to
                                    interrogate the future of British rule not only in the colonies,
                                    but also at the very centre of the empire. The question posed by
                                    the comparison is what will prevent the British state from
                                    receding into obsolescence in roughly the same manner as
                                    Akbar&#8217;s regime?</p>
                              <p>Hodges&#8217;s picture allows us to recognize a similar combination
                                    of restraint and overdetermination in what is perhaps the most
                                    significant mobilization of the oak figure in the late
                                    eighteenth century. I am referring of course to Burke&#8217;s
                                    use of the oak to figure forth the British constitution in

                                          are the only inhabitants of the field; that of course they
                                          are many in number; or that, after all, they are other

                                          and troublesome insects of the hour. (180)</quote> As a
                                    figure for the nation/constitution the important feature of this
                                    oak is its capacity of its branches to give shade, but the
                                    animalization of British subjects—whether they be revolutionary
                                    grasshoppers or loyal cattle—not only privileges the silence of
                                    the cows, but also renders the entire political arrangement
                                    quite compact. As in Hodges&#8217;s picture, the oak&#8217;s
                                    protection is nativist; there is none of the extensibility which
                                    played such a key role in Pope or Whitehead. This marks a
                                    significant curtailment of the diffusion of British liberty
                                    beyond the shores of the British Isles. And we need to recognize
                                    that this constitutes a re-calibration of imperial governance as
                                    much as it does a rejection of Whig suggestions at the time that
                                    Burke was writing the <title level="m">Reflections</title> that the revolution in France
                                    had the potential to diffuse English models of liberty into the
                                    heart of Europe. Burke&#8217;s supplementation of the oak figure
                                    with that of the cattle is aimed at ensuring that the oak does

                              <p>It is for this reason that Burke&#8217;s figure sacrifices
                                    extensibility to duration by intertwining the life cycle of the
                                    tree with the bonds of the family: <quote>Our political system
                                          is placed in a just correspondence and symmetry with the
                                          order of the world, and with the mode of existence decreed
                                          to permanent body composed of transitory parts; wherein,

                                          race, the whole, at one time, is never old, or middle
                                          aged, or young, but in a condition of unchangeable
                                          constancy, moves on through the varied tenour of perpetual

                                          of inheritance we have given our frame of polity the image

                                          (120)</quote> This is a confusing passage precisely
                                    because the image of &#8220;a relation in blood&#8221; does not
                                    sit well with &#8220;the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall,
                                    renovation and progression&#8221;. Burke wants the constitution
                                    to be both an &#8220;incorporation of the human race&#8221; and
                                    something which shelters the polity of Britain. This strange
                                    hybridization of blood and oak, human and tree, through its very
                                    overdetermination, performs a rhetorical intensification which
                                    separates him from his predecessors. By collapsing the
                                    distinction between humans and plants, Burke has opened the door
                                    for a racial interpretation of the constitution: &#8220;we have
                                    given our frame of polity the image of a relation in
                                    blood&#8221;. And this racialization of governance lays claim to
                                    historical constancy by aligning itself with the durability at
                                    the heart of the oak figure. The tension between the symbolics
                                    of blood nascent in Burke&#8217;s analogy between family and
                                    constitution on the one hand, and the more subtle invocation of
                                    the tree on the other, not only signals the struggle to
                                    re-define the oak figure for a new imperial era, but also opens
                                    the door for—and perhaps even demands—a re-evaluation of the
                                    relationship between extension and duration in the notion of
                                    British liberty.<note n="29" place="foot" resp="editors">I am

                              <p>As with my analysis of Hodges, we need to go back to the global war
                                    of the early 1780s in order to move forward. In early December
                                    of 1781, less than two months after Cornwallis&#8217;s surrender
                                    at Yorktown, William Cowper sent an imaginary &#8220;sociable
                                    conversation&#8221; to his friend Joseph Hill in which Cowper
                                    articulated his thoughts on the American War. After stating that
                                    he knew of no one up to the task of leading Britain out of the
                                    conflict, Cowper offered the following summary of the state of
                                    the empire: <quote>If we pursue the war, it is because we are
                                          desperate; it is plunging and sinking year after year in
                                          still greater depths of calamity. If we relinquish it, the
                                          remedy is equally desperate, and would prove, I believe,
                                          in the end no remedy at all. Either way we are
                                          undone—perseverance will only enfeeble us more, we cannot
                                          recover the Colonies by arms. If we discontinue the
                                          attempt, in that case we fling away voluntarily, what in
                                          the other we strive ineffectually to regain, and whether
                                          we adopt the one measure or the other, are equally undone.
                                          For I consider the loss of America as the ruin of England;
                                          were we less encumbered than we are, at home, we could but
                                          ill afford it, but being crushed as we are under an
                                          enormous debt that the public credit can at no rate carry
                                          much longer, the consequence is sure. Thus it appears to
                                          me that we are squeezed to death between the two sides of
                                          that sort of alternative, which is commonly called a cleft
                                          stick, the most threat&#8217;ning and portentous condition
                                          in which the interests of any country can possibly be

                                    </quote> Of the myriad statements of imperial doom from this
                                    period, Cowper&#8217;s remark stands out because the metaphor of
                                    the cleft stick captures the predicament of imperial
                                    subjectivity at this moment so vividly. To be cleft is to be
                                    split or divided to a certain depth, but the expression &#8220;a
                                    cleft stick&#8221; uses the notion of bifurcation to figure the
                                    two horns of a dilemma: as the OED states, it indicates &#8220;a
                                    position in which advance and retreat are alike
                                    impossible&#8221;. For Cowper, the nation, and by extension the
                                    imperial subject, is entangled to the point of being unable to
                                    move. Disentangling the imperial subject from this painful,
                                    static, almost abject, position involves a phantasmatic
                                    re-configuration of the political beyond the limits of specific
                                    policies and actions. In short, the predicament seems to call
                                    forth a new kind of political and poetic utterance.</p>
                              <p>For Cowper and others, the reverses of the early 1780s, both in
                                    America and in other colonial locales, raised the simultaneous
                                    possibility that British culture may die and yet live on in a
                                    ghostly form elsewhere. The complex temporality of this ghosting
                                    procedure and the figural attempts to keep it under control are
                                    the primary focus of the reading which follows. In Hodges, I
                                    demonstrated one example of how past losses could be refigured
                                    as future domination. Cowper&#8217;s <title level="a">Yardley
                                          Oak</title> enacts a similar phantasmatic displacement of
                                    past losses. The crucial difference is that Cowper&#8217;s
                                    focuses far less on the compensatory fantasy of domination over
                                    colonial others, but rather on the renewed fantasy of national
                                    consolidation.</p>
                              <p>The political dilemma presented in Cowper&#8217;s letter
                                    presupposes a strong sense of the integration of colony and
                                    metropole. For Cowper, the loss of America implies the ruin of
                                    England; his thoughts on the non-distinction of England and
                                    America emerge frequently in his letters, but nowhere more
                                    explicitly than in the following missive to John Newton:
                                          <quote>I consider England and America as once one country.
                                          They were so in respect of interest, intercourse, and
                                          affinity. A great earthquake has made a partition, and now
                                          the Atlantic Ocean flows between them. He that can drain
                                          that Ocean, and shove the two shores together so as to
                                          make them aptly coincide and meet each other in every
                                          part, can unite them again; but this is the work for
                                          Omnipotence, and nothing less than Omnipotence can heal
                                          the breach between us. (1:569-70)</quote> What is strange
                                    about this account of the American war is that it forgets that
                                    the Atlantic Ocean has always separated the colonies from the
                                    British Isles. Cowper here imagines a pre-revolutionary state
                                    which negates the very material structure of the globe. In this
                                    fantasy it is contiguity that matters most: the shores must
                                    &#8220;aptly coincide&#8221;. It is a figure of an organic whole
                                    rent asunder, which in some ideal future state could be sutured
                                    together again by none other than God himself. God&#8217;s role
                                    here is important because elsewhere in both the poems and the
                                    letters from this period, Cowper emphasizes that this fatal
                                    wound—here it is naturalized as an earthquake—is inflicted by
                                    Providence because England is a &#8220;sinfull Nation&#8221;
                                    (2:104). Like many other commentators at this juncture, Cowper
                                    felt that England had been hollowed out from within and held
                                    aristocratic dissipation and political corruption to be the
                                    undoing of both the empire and the nation. But as in the
                                    cleft-stick passage, agency has been fully wrested from
                                    politicians and citizens and is transferred to a divine
                                    non-human process. Failed military and state policy not only are
                                    subsumed into a narrative of irrevocable decline and fall, but
                                    also are corrected in a field where men have little or no active
                                    role to play. </p>
                              <p>Roughly ten years after Cowper&#8217;s appraisal of the end of the
                                    American war, he found himself again contemplating the
                                    destruction of the nation, only this time he deploys a cultural
                                    rather than a natural trope for disintegration: <quote>I am
                                          entirely of your mind respecting this conflagration by
                                          which all Europe suffers at present, and is likely to
                                          suffer for a long time to come. The same mistake seems to
                                          have prevailed as in the American business. We then
                                          flattered ourselves that the colonies would prove an easy
                                          conquest, and when all the neighbour nations arm&#8217;d
                                          themselves against France, we imagined I believe that she
                                          too would be presently vanquish&#8217;d. But we begin
                                          already to be undeceived, and God only knows to what a
                                          degree we may find we have erred, at the conclusion. Such
                                          however is the state of things all around us, as reminds
                                          me continually of the Psalmist&#8217;s expression—<emph>He
                                                shall break them in pieces like a potter&#8217;s
                                                vessel</emph>, and I rather wish than hope in some
                                          of my melancholy moods that England herself may escape a
                                          fracture. (4.426) </quote> As a figure, the broken shards
                                    of the nation implied by his allusion to Psalm 2:9 is more
                                    coherent than his strange cancellation of the Atlantic in his
                                    1784 letter, but it still argues that God will break that which
                                    man has made, because Britain has set itself against God.</p>

                                          </lg></quote> Cowper&#8217;s address does two things.
                                    First it establishes a relation of intimacy between this last
                                    surviving oak and the aged speaker. This is achieved by
                                    constructing the effect of physical proximity between speaker
                                    and oak: the poem&#8217;s descriptive specificity is one of the
                                    poem&#8217;s most prominent rhetorical strategies. And this
                                    effect of intimacy is intensified almost immediately by the
                                    syntactical ambiguity introduced by the parenthetical phrase in
                                    line three. Cowper&#8217;s sudden specification of the
                                    speaker&#8217;s age suspends the syntax at the end of line four
                                    and thus allows &#8220;A shatter&#8217;d vet&#8217;ran&#8221; in
                                    line 4 to figure not only for the oak, but also for the speaker.
                                    This figural ambiguity sets up the possibility for complex
                                    identifications between the speaker and the tree which will have
                                    important political ramifications as the poem unfolds. At this
                                    point it is enough to recognize that this establishes the
                                    potential for precisely the same collapse between the body of
                                    the subject and the arborial figure for governance that animated
                                    Burke&#8217;s overdetermined deployment of the oak in the <title
                                          level="m">Reflections</title>. As we will see, Cowper does
                                    not allow that collapse to occur.</p>
                              <p>But this isn&#8217;t all that is achieved here. The metaphorical
                                    comparison between the oak tree and &#8220;the shatter&#8217;d
                                    vet&#8217;ran&#8221; also activates the memory of past war—and
                                    not the triumphalism following the Seven Year&#8217;s War, but
                                    rather the sense of loss characteristic of Cowper&#8217;s
                                    remarks on the American war. I believe that this phrase evokes
                                    the wounded veteran of the American war and this oak is
                                    shattered like the potter&#8217;s vessel alluded to in
                                    Cowper&#8217;s 1793 letter. The full connotations of this
                                    metaphor are not activated until seventy lines later, but it is
                                    the central enigma of the poem. In what sense is the tree
                                    shattered and in what way is it a veteran?</p>
                              <p>These questions are temporarily supplanted by an explicit statement
                                    of the desire to venerate the tree, which concludes the first

                                    suggests that veneration of the oak is not only a form of pagan
                                    idolatry, but also akin to Adam&#8217;s attempt to hide from
                                    God&#8217;s view after consciously breaking God&#8217;s explicit
                                    proscription. The allusion to Book 9 of <title level="m"
                                          >Paradise Lost</title> is deeply significant because the

                                    by oak trees. Adam expresses the desire to be &#8220;Obscured

                                          </lg></quote> As Balachandra Rajan has argued, the
                                    evocation of the banyan tree from Milton speaks directly to the
                                    question of shelter (60-1). Adam chooses the tree because it
                                    provides shade, or in Cowper&#8217;s phrase &#8220;gloom&#8221;.
                                    To venerate the oak for its shelter is to misrecognize it as the
                                    banyan and the spiritual cost is, in Cowper&#8217;s eyes,
                                    catastrophic: it is further evidence of the nation&#8217;s
                                    alienation from God. In this context, the verb
                                    &#8220;might&#8221; in line 8 of <title level="a">Yardley
                                          Oak</title> becomes crucial, for it signifies temptation
                                    and the speaker&#8217;s resistance to it. The speaker might have
                                    worshiped the tree, except for his belief that to do so would be
                                    to be attempting to hide from one&#8217;s responsibility before
                                    God.</p>
                              <p>When we recognize that the capacity to provide shade is precisely
                                    the feature of the figure that is so appealing to Burke, then I
                                    think the full import of Cowper&#8217;s intervention becomes
                                    clear. For Cowper, the loss of the American colonies and the
                                    predicted failure of the war with France amount to symptomatic
                                    signs of God&#8217;s displeasure with the corruption of British
                                    liberty, both at a national and imperial level. What is
                                    remarkable here is that Cowper&#8217;s opening verse paragraph
                                    activates the entire historical predicament with such iconic
                                    specificity: the shattered oak, the banyan tree, the sense of a
                                    nation deformed and hollowed out from the inside. But most
                                    importantly their collocation suggests that all of these
                                    connotations are comparable to one another and to the speaker
                                    himself. This collocation lies beneath my decision to consider
                                    the banyan and the oak in the same essay, because it implies
                                    that these figures, like India and Britain, are bound up in a
                                    global historical dynamic.</p>
                              <p>As the poem unfolds, the two primary elements of the oak
                                    figure—extension and duration—are scrutinized historically; and
                                    by this I mean that their figural potential is tested against
                                    the historical moment of 1791. Cowper&#8217;s evaluation of this
                                    moment in Britain&#8217;s history is dire and the poem is
                                    suffused with a sense of past or passing glory. As one might
                                    expect, Cowper plays out the &#8220;mutability in all/That we
                                    account most durable below&#8221; (70-1), and traces &#8220;thy
                                    growth/From almost nullity into a state/Of matchless grandeur,
                                    and declension thence/Slow into such magnificent decay.&#8221;
                                    (87-90) The pun on &#8220;state&#8221; bolsters the direct
                                    assertion that Britain is in a condition of irrevocable, but
                                    nonetheless majesterial, decline. It is almost the same language
                                    used by Hodges to describe the obsolescence of the Mughal
                                    dynasty.</p>
                              <p>But Cowper&#8217;s description of the tree focuses our attention on
                                    the tree&#8217;s boughs and on the hollowing out of its trunk:<quote>

                                          <title level="a">Windsor Forest</title> here, especially
                                    since Cowper&#8217;s presentation of the oak&#8217;s potential
                                    use in the construction of warships and merchant vessels tallies
                                    so well with Pope&#8217;s double understanding—both military and
                                    commercial—of the rush of oaken timber around the globe. The
                                    oak addressed in this poem&#8217;s opening line is a &#8220;sole
                                    survivor&#8221; not because it has been the object of symbolic
                                    veneration, but rather because its &#8220;brethren&#8221; have
                                    become the material basis for imperial wars that Cowper clearly
                                    signals have more to do with the hubris of politicians than the
                                    benefit of the state. Again Cowper is reiterating his frequently
                                    stated reservations about the failure of corrupt politicians to
                                    recognize the true interests of the nation. As the passage
                                    unfolds, it becomes clear that man destroyed the forest for
                                    ill-advised war, and now it is only a matter for Time to finish
                                    the task by &#8220;disjoining&#8221; atom by atom this
                                    &#8220;shatter&#8217;d vet&#8217;ran&#8221; (103-8) .</p>
                              <p>But nestled within this fairly explicit critique is a very subtle
                                    gesture. Imperial war is evoked by the pun on &#8220;tortuous
                                    arms&#8221;, but by focussing the reader&#8217;s attention on a
                                    fairly arcane element of ship-building—knee timber—Cowper
                                    consigns the &#8220;arms&#8221; figure to the notes, only to
                                    activate it in a surprisingly brutal fashion in the next verse
                                    paragraph. At the most explicit comparison between the oak and
                                    the state, the speaker suddenly discloses that the tree affords
                                    no shelter because it has no limbs:<quote>

                                    limbs until this point is extremely shocking because it disjoins
                                    this particular tree from the usual political connotations of
                                    the emblematic oak figure. And yet the figure of the
                                    tree&#8217;s arms reveals itself to be exceedingly complex. If
                                    we understand arms to signify the martial capacity of Georgian
                                    England, particularly its naval strength, then the poem
                                    recognizes that the diffusion of liberty which was so integral
                                    to early theories of empire relies on the felling of oaks such
                                    as the one being addressed by the speaker. But the corruption of
                                    ministers, and the implicit sinfulness of the nation, have
                                    generated a situation where &#8220;Thine arms have left
                                    thee&#8221; in both senses of the word. After the loss of the
                                    American war, one can no longer simply assume that Britain can
                                    successfully protect its imperial holdings through force of
                                    arms, nor can one assume that the symbolic shelter afforded by
                                    the boughs of the constitution will protect the citizenry. The
                                    implication is that both the military, and what Burke described
                                    as the frame of the polity, have been &#8220;pulverized by
                                    venality&#8221;. So the reader is presented with a particularly
                                    dangerous situation where the diffusion of liberty through
                                    empire—here figured by the propagation of ships from oaks—has
                                    undercut one of its fundamental principles—the notion that the
                                    state through its laws will, like the oak, shelter the people.
                                    It is the same organic loop that allowed Cowper to understand
                                    the loss of America as equivalent to the loss of England. </p>
                              <p>With the loss of its arms, the tree&#8217;s capacity to figure
                                    forth shelter has been permanently compromised. From this
                                    figural dismemberment comes a different possibility for
                                    metaphor. This tree becomes notable not for its arms, but for
                                    its screaming mouth: <quote>

                                    polity shorn away, the tree becomes a remarkable figure for the

                                    that it can sustain the only thing worth sustaining—its roots.

                                          remarkable scene in which the uprooting of a myrtle tree
                                          yields &#8220;Black bloody drops distill'd upon the
                                          ground&#8221; (3.29). The tree eventually speaks and
                                          reveals that in death Polydore has been transformed into a
                                          myrtle tree. If we allow this allusion to play out then
                                          the speaker&#8217;s encounter with the Yardley Oak
                                          presages a restoration of empire. I would like to thank
                                          Theresa Kelley for directing me to these lines. </note> It
                                    is in this sense that the tree is a &#8220;shatter&#8217;d
                                    vet&#8217;ran&#8221; and why the syntactical ambiguity which
                                    allows the phrase to also refer to the speaker in the opening
                                    verse paragraph is so important. Cowper is laying the groundwork
                                    for a different kind of relationship between patriotic poet and
                                    national figure. There is an analogy between tree and speaker
                                    here, but it does not conform to Burke&#8217;s
                                    &#8220;philosophical analogy&#8221; between constitution and
                                    blood. The analogy does not rest on the capacity for
                                    auto-generation nascent in Burke&#8217;s naturalization of the
                                    constitution or in Hodges&#8217;s fantasy of the banyan tree as
                                    an auto-reproductive structure, but rather on the capacity for
                                    mediating between sky and soil that Cowper aligns not only with
                                    expressivity, but also with patriotic Christian humility. This
                                    mediating function in the face of physical, spiritual and
                                    national decline is the ultimate task of the poet in the time of
                                    national and imperial crisis, when the oak can no longer protect
                                    anyone due to ill usage.</p>
                              <p>It is in this light that the poem&#8217;s truncated ending—the poem
                                    remained incomplete—gains its resonance. At the very moment that
                                    the speaker declares that the tree is bereft of arms and
                                    un-memorialized, he also insists that the tree endures:<quote>

                                    decrepitude. What is the dismembered tree/nation/poet to do? The
                                    &#8220;yonder upstarts of the neighbour wood&#8221; are
                                    presented as signs of the future. The fact that the poem does
                                    not specify their species is, I think, important because
                                    &#8220;upstarts&#8221; may be referring to the revolutionaries
                                    of a neighbouring nation—especially at the time when this poem
                                    was composed.</p>
                              <p>But whether Cowper is referring to France or to new patriots in
                                    Britain is not crucial. What follows in both the cancelled and

                                    the beginning of line 141 is for me one of the differential
                                    marks through which we could define Romanticism, for it is here
                                    that an entire political narrative, an entire political
                                    symbolics, is suddenly transformed into an example of what not
                                    to do. History&#8217;s dismemberment of the oak has allowed the
                                    poet to suddenly and boldly speak to and for the figure in what
                                    is described as a theatrical space. But he does so while
                                    &#8220;seated here/On thy distorted root&#8221;. He does not
                                    become the tree, but rather contends with disfiguration. It is
                                    in this light that the poem&#8217;s obsession with the contorted
                                    structures of the ruined tree, its distorted roots and tortuous
                                    arms, is so important. The figure has been disfigured and that
                                    spectacle demands a performance where private desire and public
                                    discourse intersect in a profound engagement with the past. In
                                    retrospect, could we not simply state that Cowper&#8217;s sense
                                    of dismemberment, traceable to the global crisis which would
                                    reconfigure the Atlantic imperium and re-orient the entire
                                    project of empire, has called forth the performance of
                                    Romanticism? That the poem leaves off at this point is apt, not
                                    only because the September massacres would so radically call
                                    into question the hope expressed for the &#8220;Spring&#8221;,
                                    but also because Cowper had cleared the ground, or allowed
                                    future readers such as Wordsworth and Clare to see how the
                                    ground was cleared for their future utterances.</p>
