                     “Introduction”
                     </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>The essays in this volume insist that irresolvable frictions mark Romanticism in its
               time and in our critical present. They do so by lingering with dubieties that fissure
               Romantic writing about its own historical moment and by insisting on surprising and
               difficult alignments between Romantic historiography and contemporary theory and philosophy.
               In doing so, these essays convey what it means to think about Romanticism in our present
               time. Beginning with Ian Duncan’s reading of the problem of man and species in Scott’s
               later fiction and the waning of the Scottish Enlightenment, the collection moves from
               writing committed to a nuanced grasp of the difficulties embedded in the relay between
               difficult histories and texts to writing as complexly committed to philosophical readings
               of Romanticism. Across this array of critical dispositions, these essays describe
               aspects of Romantic writing that render it both difficult and difficult to leave behind.
               </p>
            <p>In her meditation on the proximity or distance with which Romantics write about the
               “field of war,” Mary Favret recognizes a parallel impulse in the way contemporary
               scholars and theorists remove scholarly concepts from particular events and especially
               suffering. Daniel O’Quinn argues for a critical triangulation between the British
               loss of America, its assorted defeats and victories in India and the formal, aesthetic
               contours of poems about trees that evoke, or are made to evoke, national interests.
               Matthew Rowlinson’s double interrogation of Walter Scott’s anonymity as both a matter
               of authorship and financial credit argues that a Lacanian allegory of Marx’s Capital
               inhabits the folds of credit and debt in Scott’s financial rise and fall. Colin Jager
               argues for a return to thinking about Romantic consciousness by way of recent cognitive
               theory concerning emergence, which supposes that the mind’s difference from and proximity
               to body and world can be postulated but not fully known. Reading contemporary philosophical
               writing about disaster and ruin beside Wordsworth’s poetry, Jacques Khalip argues
               that <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> lingers with disaster in ways that urge a non-apocalyptic poetic turn toward the
               ordinary, barely sheltered conditions of living and dying. Considered together, these
               six essays insist on textual remainders of the stubborn frictions that mark Romanticism
               then and now.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>They do so in significant measure by turning away from an earlier, still influential
                  critical supposition that thinking about historicism and thinking about theory are
                  mutually exclusive operations. In too many conferences and not a few essays, this
                  suspicion is sustained by looking past the frictions between things, events, cultures
                  and theories that constitute Romanticism’s problematic sense of itself, hoping instead
                  to see a Romanticism that does one thing or the other.

                           nuanced account of the divide in her “Introduction,” Romanticism, 1-4, 31-35. Thomas
                           Pfau argues for a philosophically oriented Romanticist criticism in “Reading beyond

                  </div> The essays in this volume instead convey how these two aspects of Romanticism are,
                  even in opposition, complexly bound to the problems and dubieties they inhabit.</p>
            </div>
            <p>It is the claim of this introduction and collection that Romanticism is anything but
               schematically divided into round and square, and much more like a field of forces
               bent on fissuring and proliferating itself. This impulse works against the desire
               for a system that neatly bifurcates itself so that historicists might sit at one table
               and theorists at another, preferably in different rooms. I allude here to the cultural
               habits of scholarly conferences, but also to a wider impulse that would understand
               the interrogation of history as traduced by its inner empiricism and those of theory
               as traduced by a love of philosophy and concept that sorts ill with thinking about
               historiography. Both dispositions slight the traffic between history and philosophy
               or theory within Romantic writing; for that reason, they also miss a compelling way
               forward for contemporary writing about Romanticism.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>That way is through, not around, frictions between and within these perspectives.
                  Precisely because it deals with material traits and efforts to manage distinctions,
                  Romantic biological classification suggests how the friction between specimens, species
                  traits and higher taxa kept distinctions in play even as nineteenth-century taxonomists
                  sought to order them into a fixed system. In the end, taxonomists could not settle
                  on one system to explain all possible relationships among natural kinds not so much
                  because the ongoing discovery of biological plentitude outpaced efforts to classify
                  them (taxonomists were and still are tireless), but because that plenitude could not
                  be mapped adequately by a single systematic. Charles Darwin’s definition of <em>species</em> as whatever his fellow biologists agreed was a species registers both the problem
                  of biological classification and his diplomatic non-solution, inasmuch as many of
                  his contemporaries could not agree on what the term <em>species</em> meant or even on whether it was a viable concept.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Darwin, Origin of Species, 38.</span></div>
                  </div> A century after Linnaeus, the effort to create a fixed system of stable species and
                  kingdoms of nature had met its other, a spirit of differentiation that could imagine,
                  like James Hutton’s theory of the earth, no prospect of an end.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As a principle of botanical investigation that goes back to Aristotle and Cesalpino,
               differentiation is the centrifugal engine working inside taxonomic inquiry. Nearly
               as soon as the Linnaean system was more or less accepted in the second half of the
               eighteenth century as standard practice for botanical taxonomy, taxonomists began
               to devise what Antoine de Jussieu and his successors called the “Natural System.”
               In all its incarnations prior to Darwin’s <em>Origin of Species</em>, the Natural System recognized multiple affinities among plant characters or traits
               such that there might be both a primary taxonomic home based on one structural similarity
               and many more affine relationships that might well cut across recognized species,
               families and even genera, as the ascending plant orders were then described.</p>
            <p>Although Jussieu and others believed that the Natural System would eventually, when
               complete, record a continuous series of creation, the work of differentiation produced
               more species, subspecies, varieties in one direction and more families and genera
               and orders, even multiple plant kingdoms, in another, and all within the domain of
               what we have called the Romantic view of nature, a phrase that says nothing about
               the complexity of that nature, taking comfort instead in a sentimentalizing category
               that asks little of us and less about how Romantics thought about what nature might
               include. A-P. de Candolle, the Swiss taxonomist who consolidated the Natural System,
               concluded that Nature is not a continuous series but rather that there are leaps or
               gaps in nature that taxonomy cannot bridge. De Candolle’s recognition makes taxonomic
               differentiation a grounding principle instead of an unwelcome outsider. In his study
               of the history of plant systematics in the nineteenth century, Peter Stevens includes
               some of the cognitive maps or schematics which taxonomists devised to represent, or
               try to represent, different and at times competing taxonomic relationships. None of
               them worked. If finding one that worked forever were really the only game in town,
               the history of systematics right up to present work in evolutionary and then cladistic
               analysis would seem pointless. In recent decades the kingdoms of nature have divided
               yet again, to accommodate plant-like groups that now appear to be something else and
               to belong somewhere else, in a kingdom of their own that is neither plant nor animal.
               </p>
            <p>What this history of biological systematics conveys is the logical and conceptual
               necessity for an ongoing friction, admittedly provisional and probably impermanent,
               between local, material evidence and competing schematics for their meaning. Whether
               or not any single systematic will suffice is less important than what each finds and
               tries to gather up into a conceptual frame that is adequate to the array of differences
               it tries to gather together. The work of finding and mapping, conceptualizing the
               relationships among singularities or differences always turns up something to be worked
               at, debated, and by such means kept on the table, not shunted off into a corner where
               it cannot cause trouble, where its difference becomes or is claimed to be monstrous.
               Indeed, the taxonomic inquiry that paid close attention to so-called botanical monsters
               did so because their very difference suggested a mechanism or operation otherwise
               hidden and thus in need of attention. </p>
            <p>The parable suggested by the cascading array of frictions among natural kinds and
               human systematic for thinking about Romanticism is perhaps obvious, but so much the
               better. Attention to the on-going work of differentiation leads to friction, constant
               friction, between objects of inquiry and the structures used to map those objects.
               Competing systematics are all the better because they fight for what should be counted
               or not. The ensuing friction is good for heat and perhaps some light. Even so for
               the friction between those who emphasize Romanticism’s cultural historiography and
               those who emphasize its philosophy, literature and aesthetics. In one sense, this
               divide splits Romantic writing in remarkably artificial ways, choosing to ignore the
               degree to that body of writing persistently worked across these terrains. But in another
               sense, this disciplinary divide unfolds and expands a deeper set of frictions within
               Romanticism, and within our critical understanding of what this term and era entail,
               between the historical and the local and the abstract or philosophical. What rightly
               emerges from these frictions is a sharp reminder that efforts to read Romanticism
               as a smoothly articulated, undifferentiated field or period have often and quite rightly
               found it difficult, even rough going. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For Jacques Derrida, Paul De Man and Jean Lyotard, <em>différance</em> gathers to itself the work of friction by preserving notice of the singularity of
                  persons and events that disrupts systematic, generalizing projects. For de Man, difference
                  is the work figures do to undo unitary reading and meaning. For Derrida, difference
                  prompts the philosophical demand to unsettle claims to absolute knowledge. The political
                  and institutional force of this project is, as Jean François Lyotard has argued, apparent
                  when one considers who or what might be said to be just.

               <p>Jean-Luc Nancy emphasizes the difficulty that haunts efforts to preserve singularity
                  as a concept. In <em>The Inoperable Community</em> he distinguishes, after Hegel and via Hegel after Goethe, the individual from singularity:
                  whereas the individual, like the annual plant that is the subject of Goethe’s <em>Metamorphoses of Plants</em>, dies, what is singular remains so in part because its identity is secured by its
                  antithetical yet also implicated relation to community, which Nancy characterizes
                  as the “socially exposed particularity” that Marx sought to preserve against the “socially
                  imploded generality” that Capitalism uses to put singularity in its place.

                  return to this topic in <em>The Sense of the World,</em> where singularity or “one” means necessarily “some ones <em>and</em> some others, or some ones with other ones.” To claim, as Nancy then does, that what
                  mediates between singularity and community is a “transcendent curiosity”

               many typically concludes by not concluding as critics speak for, against or somewhere
               in the middle of this question, its persistence is instructive. In separate assessments,
               Parker and Thomas Vogler note the stubborn resistance that the debate about what Romanticism
               is (or whether it exists) presents to fixed chronologies and conceptual boundaries.
               They also note the equally stubborn critical desire to recognize Romanticism as a
               viable category and event. From A. O. Lovejoy and René Wellek, who began this twentieth-century
               debate, to critics in the near present, Romanticism either names a category that is
               convenient, perhaps even valuable, or it registers the impossibility of such a category
               and period designation. </p>

                           he is wary of the primitive /civilized subplot of Lévi-Strauss’s phrase, in England
                           in 1819 James Chandler uses it to characterize Romantic writers’ sense of the quickened
                           pace of their era, 68-69. Reinhart Koselleck emphasized the broad European conviction
                           that the French Revolution introduced an “accelerated tempo which seemed to open up

                  and sustained a retrograde preference for slavery for some, even in the midst of imagining
                  freedom for all. That this was so Romantics were well aware. Centrifugal pressures

               <p>If Romanticism is marked by frictions among competing definitions all the way down,
                  as A. O. Lovejoy’s frustrated account of the discrimination of Romanticisms implied,
                  those frictions, along with those among readers and critics, need to be on the table.
                  Romantic writing and culture is shot through with local and material, literary and
                  cultural frictions that anticipate its modern critical identity, pungently declared
                  in Jacques Rancière’s study of what he calls “<em>mésentente</em>,” usually translated as “disagreement,” but closer in spirit to an idea of fundamental
                  discord, arising from different grounds and premises. Rancière argues that to think
                  about justice and the aesthetics of politics, we must first grant the irreconciliability
                  of certain arguments, no matter how much we may hope or image their congruence. Under
                  the sign of <em>mésentente</em>, Romanticism might be characterized as an historical moment when singularity, chance,
                  and contingency become the work of the day. This claim is not a staging ground for
                  an easy settling into commonality; it argues instead for recognizing that friction
                  is always about several, discordant possibilities. The cultural and political frictions
                  that Anna Tsing describes among inhabitants, national programs and global capitalism
                  in modern Indonesia takes another shape in the Romantic era, when revolution, war,
                  and imperial advance prompted occasions for thinking about as well as trying to ignore
                  fundamental disputes.

                  </div> Kept in play instead of pushed off to the side, friction and irresolvable disagreement

            <p>Viewed this way, Romanticism specifies competing refractions of time and event within
               or inside its pulsating chronology(ies). What counts as Romanticism is not who gets
               there first or last, or even who or what goes in reverse or forward, but the way that
               its differences jostle for attention. That said, the frictions that mark out the space
               of Romanticism suggest that its nature or definition has more flow than edge. This
               apparent weakness offers a surprising advantage: it transforms a persistent feature
               of Romanticism—its holding together of extremes like those Blake imagines as contraries,
               or extremes of scale in Romantic visual representation, or the polarities that separate
               Burke’s political assumptions from Paine’s—into tensile strength. Paradoxically, Romanticism
               becomes more flexible and commanding as a category to the degree that it does not
               expend itself in an effort to seal its borders. The essays in this volume insist on
               what this Romanticism looks like, in its time and in our critical moment. </p>
            <p>In the first essay Ian Duncan addresses the instabilities of Romantic and Enlightenment
               classifications of the species of man in a reading of Scott’s penultimate novel, <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>, as a work that thoroughly overturns Romanticism’s sense of its futurity as well
               as its past. Whereas <em>Waverley</em>, the first of the Waverley novels, could be read to argue for the shared national
               histories of Scotland and England, an outcome shadowed but not undone by its internal
               ironies, not the least of them concerning the heroic status of its reckless English
               hero, <em>Count Robert</em> raises many more questions than <em>Waverley</em> had put in abeyance, beginning with “man,” the biological category the later novel
               leaves in shreds, even as it undoes most of the traits that Scott is said to have
               established for the historical novel. Reaching back to a time and a place (Constantinople
               at the close of the eleventh century) that are at once too far off from Scotland and
               so Byzantine in style and manner that critics have suggested Scott was slipping even
               as he wrote the novel that he (mistakenly) believed would be his last, <em>Count Robert</em> replies, and puts an end to the great project of the Scottish Enlightenment, the
               science of man. A novel uncertain of its own genre or species, and rife with species
               that put the solidity and superiority of that of “man” in question, <em>Count Robert</em> looks backwards in ways that challenge Romantic hopes for the future. This eastern
               metropolis presents a hodgepodge of species and nations that make different claims
               on the idea of man, none more so that the Ourang-Utan Silvan, who speaks a dialect
               all its own and understands Anglo-Saxon. In the bloated world space and anarchically
               polygenetic array of peoples and species of Scott’s fictionalized Constantinople,
               Romantic hopes for historical progress stumble on the limitations of their own view
               of racial and species difference. As the logic of the historical novel shifts in Scott’s
               most phantasmagoric fiction, knights imagine retrograde motions that bizarrely undo
               the forward momentum of Crusade campaigns. Duncan’s account of the worlds Scott evokes
               in <em>Count Robert</em> insists on instabilities within the historiographic projections of the Scottish Enlightenment
               that turn essentially on problems with the category of man signaled by Lord Kames’s
               notice of the species of men and pursued by Lamarck.</p>
            <p>Mary Favret‘s essay takes up the phrases “field of history” and “field of battle”
               to consider the metaphoric slide from event and persons to concept and figure that
               each phrase imagines or seeks. Whereas Scottish Enlightenment historiography had supposed
               that writing about war required the distant perspective conveyed by understanding
               and describing battles as scenes on the field of history, the relative safety of such
               metaphors seemed by the end of the eighteenth century, a time of near constant warfare
               for England and its allies, as Favret puts it, little more than “wishful thinking”
               or worse, insofar as its call for dispassionate observation suggested that blood and
               suffering seen at close range were not the stuff of which history is made. Favret
               uses this friction between distance and metaphors that preserve that distance and
               what war looks like up close to query contemporary theory and criticism, beginning
               with Michel Foucault’s argument that history and historiography are war. For although
               Foucault insists that these terms should not become just figures, they nonetheless
               do as Foucault’s use of them slides toward intellection, away from the experience
               of war or, for that matter, of history. Recognizing the importance of Reinhardt Koselleck’s
               notice of the incompatibility between history at the micro level—that is all that
               happens in fine grain detail or however much of it we can capture—and the macro level—which
               tells grander, concept driven stories about fields of history—Favret argues that thinking
               about Romanticism historiographically frequently risks or assumes the status of a
               macrohistory by taking up the dispassionate and distant vantage point on “details”
               for which theory speaks. Anna L. Barbauld, Favret observes, reverses this tendency
               in “Dialogue in the Shades,” charging History with reckoning and limiting what happens
               to the mortal body. Barbauld’s refusal of dispassionate distance and the kind of history
               writing that occurs at a distance specifies an enduring friction within Romantic historiography
               and contemporary criticism between concept and event, human lives and grand designs.

               the colonies. O’Quinn argues that half a globe away from each other, America and Asia
               constitute a cultural and historical imaginary for the British, who use triumphs in
               one arena to forget defeats in the other. This curious triangulation moves in this
               essay by way of figure and specifically figures of trees, Cowper’s destroyed British
               oak versus the Indian Banyan tree which William Hodges reimagines in <em>Travels in India</em> not as the symbol of Indian monstrous proliferation, but as one protected by the
               British army, whose troops are sheltered there and shelter others. The difference
               between the way Hodges wishes to read the banyan and earlier readings that identified
               its proliferation of trunks with a suspect sexuality constitute, argues O’Quinn, a
               crisis in representation. For although Hodges’s banyan redirects this earlier iconography
               to claim the banyan as a proleptic figure for the spread of Company rule well before
               the East India Company had fully consolidated its power in the region, that argument
               also exposes the “wishful thinking” or self-delusion that C. A. Bayly has identified
               as a crucial element of British governance prior to and during the imposition of the
               Permanent Settlement. O’Quinn reads both Cowper’s Oak and Hodges’s Banyan as figures
               whose ironies register the give and take (one battle won here, another lost there)
               of British nationalist identity and imperial desire. This “global historic dynamic”
               requires reading across both the geographic and cultural terrains each figures. Romantic
               historiography by way of figure here makes visible and linked arguments that might
               otherwise appear to be isolated claims about America or India under British eyes.
               Whereas both Favret and O’Quinn are concerned with what figures do, O’Quinn contends
               that some figures reveal a larger cultural imaginary than one might otherwise glimpse.</p>
            <p>Matthew Rowlinson’s argument about Scott’s fiction, anonymity and capital takes up
               an intriguing middle ground in the collection. Rowlinson offers on an astute and detailed
               understanding of how Scott relied on Scots systems of credit and finance that required
               the anonymity of authorship that he famously insisted on and played with, like money
               in the bank. Rowlinson reads the uncertainty about what is and what is not money in
               Scott’s <em>Antiquary</em> as one instance of a problem of textual boundary that recurs in the Waverley novels,
               with their serial form, indistinguishable protagonists, and the extensive textual
               periphery of introductions, prefaces, notes and other apparatus. By such turns, Scott’s
               fictional voices create the simulacrum of capital in ways that anticipate the role
               of Capital in Marx’s analysis as a Lacanian marker for the real in a symbolic order.
               Yet the point of Rowlinson’s essay is not simply that Scott anticipates Marx, but
               rather that its riveting historiographic evidence discloses a deeply economic rationale
               for Scott’s mystic and permutable anonymity and, further, that this highly fictive
               circulation of identities conveys the allegorical character of Marx’s Capital and
               the author “Walter Scott” among his various fictive voices, frequently leaked identities.
               Moving between Scott’s publishing history, Scottish finance, Marx, Lacan, and back,
               Rowlinson tracks the work of allegory and credit such that the distinction between
               historiography and theory remains, but their conjoined work becomes more telling.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Colin Jager takes up the question of Romantic consciousness, an inquiry that recent
                  work on Romanticism has either put aside or taken up in ways that he contends are
                  less productive than they might be. Much of the essay considers developments in cognitive
                  theory that literary scholars of Romanticism have only partly begun to read. He identifies
                  two recent approaches to consciousness: neurological arguments which regard mind as
                  a synonym for the brain and emergence theory, which has a longer track record (stretching
                  back to the nineteenth century) but does not claim to answer the “hard question” of
                  cognition, how mind is related to world or more precisely how we can physically know
                  that the mind has consciousness. Using examples that recur in recent accounts of emergence
                  and cognition, Jager notes that although neither bees nor ants possess consciousness,
                  a bee-hive or an ant colony could be said to demonstrate the kinds of collective and
                  individual organization we might understand as necessary activities from which consciousness
                  would emerge. Lower-level self-organizing and self-modifying systems such as Goethe
                  found in plant development and many other Romantic writers found in different animals
                  and insects would constitute, then, physical evidence of activities from which consciousness
                  might emerge. What is arresting about this argument, Jager emphasizes, is its tentativeness,
                  its capacity to rest, as Keats urged, in doubt and uncertainty. This attitude, Jager
                  suggests, recalls too Wordsworth’s “natural piety,” a phrase Anne-Lise François uses
                  to imagine a Romantic environmentalist ethic poised to stand back and think about
                  what might emerge in us that is, however indistinctly or problematically, from nature.

            <p>Jacques Khalip’s concluding essay argues for a dwelling with ruin and disaster that
               begins by asking this question about the story of Margaret and Armytage as narrator
               in Wordsworth’s <em>Ruined Cottage</em>: how can poetry and reading dwell with the non-normative effects unleashed by disaster
               to discover forms of non-triumphal, wasted life? Khalip addresses this question via
               Martin Heidegger’s shadowed notion of being as persisting in ruin, Rem Koolhaas’s
               vision of the accumulated wreckage of modern life, Maurice Blanchot’s insistence that
               disaster cannot be forgotten but must be lived with, and the strange hospitality that
               Derrida urges for our relation to the nonhuman, the vegetable, and the dead. With
               these arguments engaged, Khalip returns to the “harassed unrest” of Wordsworth’s Margaret.
               Working from a very different point of departure, shadowed as much by the Holocaust
               as it is by Romantic wartime, Khalip finds very different ground to return readers,
               as do Favret and Duncan, to a Romantic poetics that cannot turn from suffering, the
               wasting of human life, the instability of bodies and species in the kingdoms of nature.
               Khalip insists on unsatisfied hermeneutic economy that theorizing at times seeks to
               offer: in exchange for this suffering, here is a theory of war or peace that will
               make up the difference. The elegy of the <em>Ruined Cottage</em>, as Khalip puts it, “disasters the payments ordinarily recouped by acts of mourning.”
               It is an open question, I think, and was for Wordsworth as well, whether elegy can
               do even this much without denying loss.</p>
            <p>Khalip’s unremitting theoretical exploration of what doesn’t tidy up, what doesn’t
               find an easy settlement in Romantic writing shares with other authors in this collection
               a reading of Romanticism that lingers with its instabilities and doubts. Each of these
               essays takes up its own position along a continuum in which historiographic and theoretical
               interests lie, unevenly distributed, with several opportunities for friction between
               critical practices. None is assimilable in argument or method to the others. All six
               essays nonetheless insist on reading Romanticism for its frictions.</p>

Cynthia Chase presents a brief, nuanced account of the divide in her “Introduction,”
               <em>Romanticism,</em> 1-4, 31-35. Thomas Pfau argues for a philosophically oriented Romanticist criticism
               in “Reading beyond Redemption: Historicism, Irony, and the Lessons of Romanticism,"<em>The Lessons of Romanticism</em>, 1-37 and and in occasional bouts with historicist critics in <em>Romantic Moods,</em> 337-39. Essays in <em>Repossessing the Romantic Past </em>present the new historicist side of the divide.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
