                  <p>What was Walter Scott thinking when he wrote <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>?
                  The last but one of the Waverley novels breaks the decorum of “the classical form
                  of the historical novel,” first of all, with its setting. Constantinople, the end
                  of the eleventh century: far outside the developmental continuum through which the
                  “classical form of the historical novel,” according to Lukács, should render its
                  “concrete prehistory of the present” (269). Scott’s readers would have understood
                  the Byzantine Empire as doubly cut off from the path to modernity—by the schism
                  between the Greek and Roman churches, which made Byzantium the decadent shadow of
                  a more vigorous western civilization, and then by the Ottoman Conquest of 1453.
                  The cast of characters conforms less to a set of historical types than to one of
                  those fantastic oriental taxonomies we read about in Borges. Its specimens include
                  Greeks, Turks, Normans, Varangians, Moors, Scythians, a homicidally irascible
                  warrior-princess, a philosopher nicknamed “the Elephant,” a real elephant, a
                  tiger, a mechanical lion, and a giant orangutan named Sylvan. Scott bedevils the
                  historical novel—his signature genre—with an alien history and alien races and
                  species. </p>
                  <p>Scott composed <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris </title>in fits and starts between
                  December 1830 and September 1831. He was harassed by ill health, including a
                  serious stroke, and by disagreements with his publisher, Robert Cadell, and his
                  executor and son-in-law, John Gibson Lockhart. Just over one year later he was
                  dead. Critics have not hesitated to diagnose the excesses and irregularities of
                     <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> as symptoms of encroaching apoplexy—the
                  cloudy effusion of Scott’s dotage, the decline and fall of the Author of
                     <title level="m">Waverley</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, e.g., Hobsbaum: “Everyone who has not
                     read <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> . . . knows it to be unreadable” (153).
                  </note> Much of the incoherence of the published novel is due to Cadell and
                  Lockhart, who cut and rewrote Scott’s manuscript as it went to press. J. H.
                  Alexander’s new restoration of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> for the
                  Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels allows us to read it, at last, in
                  something like the form the author intended.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Alexander;
                     Gamerschlag.</note> Among the passages published for the first time is an
                  epilogue in which the ailing Scott reflects on the experimental character of what
                  he thought might be “the last of my fictitious compositions” (<title level="m">Count Robert
                     of Paris</title> 362). The quest for “novelty at whatever rate” has driven him
                  outside the usual ground of historical fiction, “domestic nature,” to “lay his
                  scene in distant countries, among stranger nations, whose manners are imagined for
                  the purpose of the story—nay, whose powers are extended beyond those of human
                  nature” (362). Invention crosses a geographical and racial limit at which the
                  “manners” that are governed by human nature turn into “powers” that exceed it. As
                  examples of romances that go beyond human nature Scott cites Robert Paltock’s
                     <title level="m">The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins</title> (1751), a tale of a
                  sailor shipwrecked on an island of flying people, and “a late novel, also, by the
                  name of Frankenstein, which turns upon a daring invention, . . . the discovery of
                  a mode by which one human being is feigned to be capable of creating another”
                  (363). </p>
                  <p>Of the two prototypes, it is clearly <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> that grips Scott’s imagination. He had written one of the few appreciative reviews of
                     <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, for <title level="m">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> in
                  1818; the present reference may have been prompted by advertisements for the
                  forthcoming <title level="m">Bentley’s Standard Novels</title> edition, revised by Mary
                  Shelley, published one month after he completed <title level="m">Count Robert of
                  Paris</title>, in October 1831. On Scott’s own authority, it seems, we are to read
                     <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> not so much as a historical novel than as a
                  work of anthropological science fiction. Here at the foundation of both genres in
                  British Romanticism, with <title level="m">Waverley</title> and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, the
                  link between them is revealed to be genetic as well as analogical.</p>
                  <p> The name of that link, “man,” identifies the philosophical question posed in
                     <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>. It marks the work’s historical station not
                  just at the end of Scott’s career but at the end of the philosophical project of
                  Enlightenment, and specifically of the historical and anthropological turn that
                  project had taken in eighteenth-century Scotland. In 1739 David Hume had given the
                  project a name: “the science of MAN” (Hume 42). “There is no
                  question of importance, whose decision is not compriz’d in the science of man,”
                  Hume wrote: “In pretending to explain the principles of human nature, we in effect
                  propose a compleat system of the sciences built on a foundation almost entirely
                  new, and the only one upon which they can stand with any security” (43). The
                  science of man would also supply a foundation for that modern, post-metaphysical
                  upstart among literary genres, the novel. Hume’s contemporary Henry Fielding
                  justified the “new province of writing” with the claim that it could provide a
                  complete, authentic representation of “<title level="m">Human Nature</title>” (Fielding 30,
                  68). The philosophical prestige attached to human nature would outweigh such
                  defects as the novel’s lack of a classical genealogy, its identification with a
                  mass market and with women readers, and so on. Reinforced by developments in the
                  technology of fictional realism, human nature would remain the guarantee of an
                  otherwise suspect genre for at least a generation after Charles Darwin’s decisive
                  restructuring of a post-Enlightenment human science in <title level="m">The Descent of
                     Man</title> (1871). </p>
                  <p>By the last third of the eighteenth century, meanwhile, Scottish philosophers had
                  elected history as the discipline best equipped to realize the science of man, in
                  conjectural histories of society, of manners and institutions, and of the arts and
                  sciences, as well as of particular nations. It was the attempt to totalize these
                  inquiries, to write the history of man as a species, which laid bare a fault-line
                  in the category’s foundation. “The Human Species is in every view an interesting
                  subject,” affirmed Lord Kames, in the preface to his <title level="m">Sketches of the History
                     of Man</title>; however, “there is still wanting a history of the species, in
                  its progress from the savage state to its highest civilization and improvement”
                  (Home I: 1). “The subject of this volume is the <title level="m">History of Man</title>,”
                  wrote Lord Monboddo, introducing the fourth volume of <title level="m">Antient
                     Metaphysics</title>, “by which I mean, not what is commonly called History, that
                  is the History of Nations and Empires, but the History of the Species Man”
                  (Burnett 1795: 1). These best-known of Scottish essays in the history of man are
                  notorious for their disruption of the category they invoke: Kames for his
                  contention that mankind consists of different species, branded with physiological
                  as well as linguistic difference; Monboddo for his insistence that the mysterious
                  great ape, the Orang-Outang, is man in his natural state, lacking only the
                  artificial acquirement of speech. For these accounts, it seems, “man” signifies at
                  once too much and too little.</p>
                  <p> Kames’s and Monboddo’s cues are taken up with a vengeance in <title level="m">Count Robert
                     of Paris</title>. In Scott’s Constantinople—pullulating with different sects,
                  nations, races, species—the boundaries between race and species, and between human
                  and non-human species, melt and blur. The main figure for this boundary-flux is
                  Sylvan, the Orang-Outang, who (among other accomplishments) speaks his own
                  “unintelligible” language and understands Anglo-Saxon. Sylvan’s role has been well
                  noted by the few critics who have discussed <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>.
                  Graham McMaster reads the orangutan as an extreme declension of the noble savage,
                  in a symbolic antithesis between nature and art (214-15), while Clare Simmons
                  reads him as the “Romantic symbol of a loss of belief in human nature” (21). Their
                  accounts frame “nature” as primarily a moral rather than a biological category in
                  the novel. The newly restored text makes clear as never before, however, Scott’s
                  pervasive play with forms of biological difference, including sexual as well as
                  racial and species difference, in this most bizarre of all his works. Sylvan is
                  only the most conspicuous figure in a horde of prodigies and monsters which
                  overwhelms the traditional boundaries of “man.” Like <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>,
                     <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> opens to scrutiny the “specifically
                  anthropological discourse of man” which underwrote, according to Maureen McLane,
                  the newly-won autonomy of “literature” in British Romanticism as a distinctively
                  human praxis (10-13, 84-108).</p>
                  <p> Key to what McLane calls the “ideological biologization of species difference” in
                     <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (107), played out through a Malthusian discourse of
                  territory and population, is that novel’s speculative reach beyond a national
                  geography. Victor Frankenstein travels beyond the habitable limits of Europe, to
                  an alpine glacier and the Arctic Ocean, while the monster proposes the settlement
                  of his new race in the deserts of South America. This sublime planetary range
                  accommodates Shelley’s radical speculation on the potentiality for other races,
                  other species, to challenge human dominion and human uniqueness. The
                     <title level="m">mise-en-scène</title> of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>, while less
                  spectacularly that of an early nineteenth century world-horizon, marks an
                  analogous abandonment of the geography of national history as well as of that
                  history’s philosophical foundation, a unified human nature. Scott’s Constantinople
                  instantiates a new kind of setting for a new kind of historical romance: the
                  cosmopolis, or world-city, as conjectural arena for a post-Enlightenment world
                  history—the natural history of man.</p>

                  <p>Recent scholarship has focused on the national contexts of Scott’s work, in the
                  legacies of Scottish Enlightenment moral philosophy and historiography, in British
                  Romanticism, and in the early nineteenth-century rise of Scottish fiction.<note place="end" n="3">The direction was set by the most influential works in the

                  fortified a traditional preference for the novels that take their subject matter
                  from Scottish history, especially the great series of novels on the modernization
                  of Scotland, from <title level="m">Waverley</title> (1814) to the third series of <title level="m">Tales
                     of My Landlord</title> (1819; with the supplement of <title level="m">Redgauntlet</title>,
                  1824). The romances after <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title> (1820), with their miscellaneous
                  British, European and Asiatic settings, remain comparatively neglected. An
                  intermittent but decisive widening of scope across Scott’s career, from the
                  philosophical domain of national history to that of world history, remains largely
                  unexamined. Forecast as early as Scott’s second novel <title level="m">Guy Mannering</title>
                  (1816), with its Gypsies and off-stage Indian episodes, that shift of scope is
                  fully established in <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, in which dispossessed Saxons, Norman
                  warlords, Jews, returning Crusaders and their Moorish slaves contend in the
                  ancient forests of twelfth-century England; it is further developed in <title level="m">The
                     Talisman</title> (1825), a tale of the Crusaders in Palestine,<title level="m"/>and

                  eve of the second Mysore War. The critical attention recently paid to Scott’s
                  Oriental fictions has tended to frame them within the geopolitical horizon of
                  British Empire, whether in proleptic analogy (<title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, <title level="m">The
                     Talisman</title>) or historical actuality (<title level="m">Guy Mannering</title>, <title level="m">The

                  within this national and imperial field of historical-geographical reference is
                  harder to sustain. Far from being part of British imperial history, Constantinople
                  was “a seat of universal empire” (<title level="m">Count Robert</title> 4)—and a rival
                  universal empire, involving a rival conception of universal empire, at that. </p>
                  <p> The next section of this essay will consider the symbolic status of the world
                  city, a new and vexed topos in Great Britain by the 1820s. But before we inquire
                  what Scott meant by setting his novel in eleventh-century Constantinople, let us
                  ask: Why Paris? Why should he have highlighted Paris, not
                     Constantinople,<title level="m"/>in the title of a romance of the late Byzantine
                  Empire? Fifteen years after Waterloo, Paris might have ceded geopolitical primacy
                  to London: but it could still lay claim to being capital city of the ascendant
                  domain that Pascale Casanova has called the “world republic of letters.” From the
                  late seventeenth century onwards, according to Casanova, Paris established itself
                  as the western capital of “international literary space” in its first modern
                  formation, the Enlightenment republic of letters, with the French language as its
                  universal medium (11, 67-73). In its ideology as well as its practical diffusion
                  beyond France the republic of letters was universal, cosmopolitan, pre-nationalist
                  (87). It was in a reaction against the cosmopolitan dominance of French that a
                  second developmental stage of world literary space took shape at the end of the
                  eighteenth century: the proliferation of distinctively national literatures, which
                  Casanova calls “the Herder effect,” otherwise known as Romanticism (75-79). </p>
                  <p>Casanova perfunctorily acknowledges the eighteenth-century rise of a rival British
                  literary empire and pays next to no attention to Scotland. Nevertheless her
                  analysis frames Scotland as a highly interesting case, one which we may
                  extrapolate through Tom Nairn’s influential account of Scotland’s anomalous
                  relation to the historical pathways of modernization and nationalism in his book
                     <title level="m">The Break-up of Britain</title>. Scotland’s project of cultural
                  modernization, the Scottish Enlightenment, depended on the establishment of what
                  Murray Pittock has called a “separate public sphere” of letters and science in the
                  Lowland university towns (13). Distance from the seat of government (after the
                  1707 Act of Union) made possible Scotland’s modern entry into “world literary
                  space,” even as Anglo-British assimilation provided ideological cover. Rather than
                  exemplifying the binary antagonism between core and periphery analyzed in the
                  second part of Casanova’s study, Scottish literature made itself modern in a
                  triangulation with rival centers, London and Paris. While the Scottish literati
                  harnessed English as the linguistic vehicle of Enlightenment, they sought to
                  integrate their philosophical projects with the European republic of letters of
                  which Paris was the capital city. If the Scots invented British literature, as a
                  strong line of recent scholarship has argued,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Crawford 1992; Crawford 1998.</note> it was to annex
                  it to that Paris-based horizon of world literary space—over and against a London
                  that remained relatively provincial in literary and philosophical terms even as it
                  was achieving global geopolitical supremacy. </p>
                  <p> Scott’s fiction did not promote a separatist Scottish national destiny according
                  to the Herderian model. Rather than the Anglo-British absorption with which he has
                  often been charged, though, Scott extended the Enlightenment project of an
                  integration of Scottish literature within the larger domain of European
                  literature, the “world republic of letters”—although (to be sure) that domain was
                  very different in 1830 from what it had been before 1800, or from what it had
                  been, for that matter, in 1814 or 1819. This integration took place largely
                  through the medium of French translation, as recent scholarship on Scott’s
                  European reception has shown. French versions of the Waverley novels, by
                  Auguste-Jean-Baptiste Defauconpret, provided the texts for their diffusion into
                  other national literatures, and foreign authors who adapted Scott’s example, such
                  as Manzoni and Pushkin, read him in that language.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="6">See
                     Casanova 146; Barnaby; Maxwell, “Scott in France”.</note> The many operatic
                  versions of Scott, including Donizetti’s <title level="m">Lucia di Lammermoor</title>, were
                  based on French stage versions adapted from Defauconpret rather than on Scott’s
                  originals. Scott helped create the conditions for this massive French-mediated
                  reception across world literary space by actively engaging continental, especially
                  French, literary traditions in his novels; in his new book on the European
                  historical novel, Richard Maxwell makes a convincing case for the genre’s
                  articulation along a Franco-Scottish axis, from Mme de Lafayette and Prévost
                  through Scott to Hugo and Dumas. Scott, in short, belonged to French literature,
                  and thence to the world republic of letters, quite as much as he did to Scottish
                  and British traditions.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, late-Enlightenment Paris incubated the most extreme developments of
                  that general project of the republic of letters: the Science of Man. It was in
                  Paris, more definitively than in London or Edinburgh, that formulations of the
                  natural history of man exposed the deep trouble with man as a universal category,
                  as what had been the putatively unified project of Enlightenment (unified in its
                  theoretical articulations rather than in practice) splintered into competing
                  systems, disciplines and ideologies. By the time Scott began work on <title level="m">Count
                     Robert of Paris</title> in 1830, the trouble had blown up into scandal. The
                  eccentric conjectures of Kames and Monboddo had been overtaken by more
                  comprehensive and radical theories emanating from the world capital of
                  Enlightenment, where materialist declensions of the science of man accompanied the
                  revolutionary reframing of man as a universal political subject. Amid a rising
                  tide of morphological speculation on the origins of life and the transmutation of
                  species, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck cited the orangutan as a human prototype—not just a
                  type of natural man, but a figure for man’s animal genealogy.</p>
                  <p>Although it was not translated into English until the twentieth century, the
                  arguments of Lamarck’s <title level="m">Philosophie zoologique</title> (1809) were well known
                  in British scientific circles, above all in Edinburgh, which was the center for
                  advanced physiological thought in Britain until the founding of the University of
                  London (on Scottish principles) in the late 1820s. In the decade after Waterloo
                  (the era of the ascendancy of the Waverley novels) Scottish medical graduates
                  flocked to Paris, where they imbibed the controversial philosophical anatomy of
                  Lamarck, Xavier Bichat and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and brought the new science back
                  with them to Edinburgh. As James Secord has shown, “the earliest favorable
                  reaction to Lamarck in a British scientific periodical” appeared in an anonymous
                  article in the <title level="m">Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal</title> in 1826. This was
                  the period when the young Charles Darwin was studying at Edinburgh; both Darwin’s
                  mentor, Richard Edmond Grant, and Robert Jameson, the Regius Professor of Natural
                  History, have been identified as the author of the article.  Grant, a far more radical figure than Jameson, was appointed in 1828 to the
                  new chair of Natural History at London, where his Lamarckian enthusiasm stoked the
                  fires of French philosophical anatomy and democratic politics in the age of
                     Reform.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Darwin, Jameson and Grant, see Desmond
                     398-402; Browne 69-88.</note> However, Secord makes a persuasive case that
                  Jameson, not Grant, wrote the article. Jameson belonged to the moderate Tory
                  Edinburgh establishment (Scott knew him); his even-handed comments on Lamarck
                  elsewhere, and his journal’s attentiveness to the latest scientific developments
                  in France and Germany, indicate the presence of “a wider circle of Scottish
                  naturalists interested in evolution” (15-17). Secord suggests that it was the
                  tolerance for Lamarckian transformationism in respectable Edinburgh—rather than
                  its vogue in radical London—that provoked Charles Lyell’s high-profile refutation
                  in the second volume of <title level="m">Principles of Geology</title>, published just one
                  month after <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> in January 1832. Lyell ridicules
                  the “progressive scheme” promoted by Lamarck, whereby “the orang-outang . . . is
                  made slowly to attain the attributes and dignity of man” (193). <title level="m">Principles
                     of Geology</title> proposed an influential solution to the late-Enlightenment
                  crisis of world history as the history of man: that of a detour around the history
                  of man, that minefield of radical and infidel speculation, altogether. Translating
                  the discourse of history from the human sciences onto the world considered as a
                  physical system (as in James Hutton’s <title level="m">Theory of the Earth</title>), Lyell
                  proposed a history of the earth from which human origins were sedulously excluded
                  (a strategy that Darwin would imitate in the <title level="m">Origin of Species</title>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Rudwick 6, 158-60.</note>

                     <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> finds its imaginative opening in the
                  contemporary crisis of world history and the science of man, of which the
                  epicenter was Paris—the forum of a once progressive, now decadent Enlightenment.
                  Conservative British ideologues had cast France as the source of an absolutist and
                  then revolutionary cosmopolitanism against which local, organic forms of national
                  identification could be mobilized (e.g., in Spain).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See
                     Newman; Colley.</note> After 1815, according to Jon Klancher, a new conception
                  of the cosmopolis or “world city”—imperial, modern, the ganglion of
                  deterritorializing networks of capital as well as of corrosive new demographic and
                  ideological forces—had superseded the old-regime cosmopolitanism of the republic
                  of letters.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Klancher; see also Langan.</note> So Scott’s
                  title means what it says: the Constantinople of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>
                  situates a fantasia on the multinational, heterodox world city, the decadent
                  capital of the Enlightenment human sciences. Now, <title level="m">circa</title> 1830, that
                  discursive domain is falling apart, its relation to historical futurity cast in
                  doubt. If the progressive claims of Enlightenment had been discredited by the
                  terrorist meltdown of the French Revolution and its Napoleonic sequel, now a
                  second French Revolution threatens the restoration of the old regimes prescribed
                  at the Congress of Vienna. Revolution—with its claim on a political reinvention of
                  the human—has re-entered modernity to establish itself as a normal rather than a
                  singular event. Meanwhile Catholic Emancipation has legitimated a domestic
                  heterodoxy at home in Britain, and Reform, specter of a homegrown revolution,
                  lowers on the horizon. The world city accommodates not an “end of history” (see
                  Christensen) but its disintegration.</p>
                  <p>The opening paragraphs of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> reflect upon the
                  decadence of artificially restored empires. Scott compares Constantine’s New Rome
                  with “a new graft . . . taken from an old tree,” bound by an organic fatality to
                  resume an internal chronology of decline (<title level="m">Count Robert</title> 3-4). The
                  world-city is overflowing with heterogeneous creeds, nations, races, and species,
                  while alien hosts (Crusaders, Moors, Turks, Scythians) besiege it from without.
                  The mix of competing monotheisms overlays strange heresies (including, in a
                  canceled episode, Manicheans, 367-77) and Pagan survivals, such as the “brutal
                  worship of Apis and Cybele,” decayed from a state religion into popular
                  superstition (89). More than once, Scott compares Byzantine court ceremony with the
                  “court of Pekin” (7, 147), drawn into the geopolitical horizon of British
                  knowledge through the embassies of Lord Macartney (1792-94) and Lord Amherst
                     (1816).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Scott may have had an intimate informant in his
                     friend Basil Hall, who accompanied Amherst’s expedition and published a

                        1816</title> (1817), reprinted as the first title in <title level="m">Constable’s

                  <p> One effect of this monstrous distention of world space is a diffusion or
                  fragmentation of historical time, in which we lose any sense of a unitary
                  direction along which history might be unfolding. <title level="m">Count Robert of
                     Paris</title> thwarts readers’ expectations that the western Crusaders, for
                  instance, might represent a romantic futurity—associated with individualist
                  virtues of honour and courage—that will supersede the orientalized decadence of
                  the Byzantines, according to the “clash of civilizations” and “nature versus art”
                  schemata that some critics have detected in the novel (e.g. McMaster). Such an
                  historical destiny is not made apparent in <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>, in
                  which the Emperor Alexius successfully manages the Crusaders and diverts the
                  threat they represent. (Scott’s informed readers would have known, of course,
                  about the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade as well as the Ottoman
                  conquest, but the novel refrains from harping on these future catastrophes.) The
                  eponymous Count Robert and his warrior-bride Brenhilda, formidable and glamorous
                  on their first appearance, prove worse than useless in the novel’s plot.
                  Brenhilda’s valour culminates in a grotesque Amazonian duel with the historian
                  Anna Comnena, in which she succeeds only in endangering her own pregnancy. Count
                  Robert, despite an outburst of action-hero alacrity in the middle of the story,
                  accomplishes nothing towards the resolution of the various predicaments he crashes
                  into. He does not even keep his promise to rescue the noble captive Ursel; that
                  task is taken care of by the Emperor, in one of Scott’s virtuoso essays in
                  anticlimax. Byzantine policy triumphs over Crusader prowess, however much the
                  Western narrator might profess contempt for the former and admiration for the
                  latter. The Emperor’s disavowed virtuosity consists above all in rhetoric, a
                  crafty linguistic excess, aligned with the supervening practice of the Author of
                  <title level="m">Waverley</title>. The narrator’s mockery of the “fair historian” Anna Comnena, sealed with
                  a formal parody of her <title level="m">Alexiad</title> in the fourth chapter, frames the open
                  secret of their stylistic affinity. “Scott moves to become what he beholds,” notes
                  Jerome McGann; since “[his] own style has over the years grown increasingly
                  elaborate and formulaic[,] [t]o pastiche Comnena’s prose . . . is to fashion a
                  critical measure of his own” (124)—ornate, murky, “Byzantine” indeed.</p>
                  <p> Any sense of a governing historical progress or developmental direction is
                  exploded into a multitude of competing paths. The world-city opens up for the
                  imagination alternative modes and directions besides the progressive model of
                  Enlightenment conjectural history, supposed to structure particular national
                  destinies. Scott’s opening rendition of the <title level="m">translatio imperii</title>, as a
                  civilizational grafting that reiterates an inexorable process of decay instead of
                  a renovation, has already been mentioned. Later, we learn how the Anglo-Saxon
                  rebels who sought refuge in the greenwood after the Norman Conquest “made a step
                  backwards in civilisation, and became more like their remote ancestors of German
                  descent, than they were to their more immediate and civilized predecessors. . . . Old
                  superstitions had begun to revive among them,” drained however “of the sincere
                  belief which was entertained by their heathen ancestors” (<title level="m">Count
                     Robert</title> 209). Scott reimagines Robin Hood and his band—mythic figures
                  from his own <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>—as inauthentic and degenerate. At the same time
                  these “Foresters,” natural Malthusians, regulate their population by chaste
                  practices of “moderation and self-denial” (210). It appears that those who regress
                  from civilization to the woods, as a consequence of world-historical defeat, are
                  better able to constitute a virtuous organic community than those who have not yet
                  left the woods.</p>
                  <p>Volume Two of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> closes with a striking instance
                  of what the narrator calls “retrograde evolution” (255). The Crusaders have
                  crossed the Bosphorus to the Asian shore on their way to Jerusalem, after swearing
                  an oath “never to turn back upon the sacred journey.” When they learn that Count
                  Robert and his bride are in trouble back in Constantinople, they must figure out a
                  way to rescue them without breaking their oath. “Are we such bad horsemen, or are
                  our steeds so awkward, that we cannot rein them back from this to the
                  landing-place at Scutari?” one of them suggests: “We can get them on shipboard in
                  the same retrograde manner, and when we arrive in Europe, where our vow binds us
                  no longer, the Count and Countess of Paris are rescued” (253). The inhabitants of
                  Scutari are duly treated to the spectacle of a column of knights riding their
                  horses backwards onto the transport barges.</p>

                  <head>IV</head>
                  <p>The Crusaders’ “retrograde evolution” is a grotesquely literal acting-out of a
                  developmental dynamic or potential that pulls at the various histories, destinies
                  and identities entangled in <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>. History is not
                  bound to move forward—whatever forward might mean; it might fall backwards, or
                  slide sideways, or go off in some other, unheard-of direction. It is not only
                  progress that is at stake, more than ever discredited by its Lamarckian
                  application to an evolutionary account of natural history. Scott’s Constantinople
                  accommodates an imaginary breakup of the monogenetic developmentalism that (this
                  novel lets us see) has underpinned the national history addressed in the great
                  sequence of his Scottish Waverley novels. “Monogenesis” designates the orthodox
                  anthropological principle that all humans are descended from a common origin and
                  thus comprise a single race or species. The principle governs the ideology of
                  unified development, or a shared single history, which a particular people or
                  nation, such as Scotland, must join on the path to modernity.</p>
                  <p>In those key reflections on his art, the prefatory chapter to<title level="m">
                     Waverley</title> and the dedicatory epistle to <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, Scott cites
                  a universal human nature, constant across all differences of time and place, as
                  the philosophical basis for the kind of novel he is writing: 
                  <quote>Considering
                     the disadvantages inseparable from this part of my subject, I must be
                     understood to have resolved to avoid them as much as possible, by throwing the
                     force of my narrative upon the characters and passions of the actors;—those
                     passions common to men in all stages of society, and which have alike agitated
                     the human heart, whether it throbbed under the steel corslet of the fifteenth
                     century, the brocaded coat of the eighteenth, or the blue frock and white
                     dimity waistcoat of the present day. . . . It is from the great book of Nature,
                     the same through a thousand editions, whether of black letter or wire-wove and
                     hot-pressed, that I have venturously essayed to read a chapter to the public.

                  In observing the sameness of “the
                  passions . . . in all stages of society,” the historical novel advertises itself
                  as a faithful edition of “the great book of Nature.” The gap between past and
                  present in <title level="m">Waverley</title>—“sixty years since”—becomes a gulf of six
                  centuries, rather more difficult to navigate, in <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>: <lb/>
                     <quote>What
                     I have applied to language, is still more justly applicable to sentiments and
                     manners. The passions, the sources from which these must spring in all their
                     modifications, are generally the same in all ranks and conditions, all
                     countries and ages; and it follows, as a matter of course, that the opinions,
                     habits of thinking, and actions, however influenced by the peculiar state of
                     society, must still, upon the whole, bear a strong resemblance to each other.
                     Our ancestors were not more distinct from us, surely, than Jews are from
                     Christians[.] (<title level="m">Ivanhoe</title> 19-20)</quote> 
                  
                  The story that follows turns
                  the proposition into a profoundly uncomfortable question: How distinct are Jews
                  from Christians? In drawing an equivalence between the diachronic difference
                  between ourselves and our ancestors and the synchronic difference between Jews and
                  Christians, Scott alludes to the scriptural resolution of that equivalence,
                  whereby an archaic Jewish dispensation is redeemed into an enlightened Christian
                  one. Ethically speaking, however—that is, viewed with an enlightened disregard for
                  dogma—Rebecca the Jewess turns out to be more chivalrous and a better Christian
                  than any of the Christian knights in <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>. She speaks more
                  eloquently than anyone for a humane futurity. She is more human than “our
                  ancestors.” All the same she is exiled from the proto-national community, the
                  English destiny, evoked at the novel’s close. </p>
                  <p>The sublime widening of historical distance in <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, and that
                  novel’s disintegration of “England” into a welter of alien ethnicities and castes,
                  look forward to the more radical experiment of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>,
                  which opens up a “polygenetic” potentiality of evolutionary trajectories and
                  forms, enabled by its setting of a world-city severed both from western religious
                  orthodoxy and from the developmental path to modernity. Polygenesis, the heterodox
                  doctrine that humankind consists of different races or species with separate
                  origins, had been broached in Scotland by Kames in his <title level="m">Sketches of the
                     History of Man</title>. Addressing the question “whether there are different
                  races of men, or whether all men are of one race without any difference but what
                  proceeds from climate or other external cause,” Kames concluded that “there are
                  different species of men as well as of dogs” (Home I: 3, 20). Species
                  differentiation occurred, along with linguistic differentiation, as “an immediate
                  change of bodily constitution” after the fall of the Tower of Babel (I: 76).
                  Polygenetic speculation was becoming increasingly current in advanced scientific
                  thought by the late 1820s and 1830s, undermining what had been a monogenetic
                  orthodoxy, until it informed an ascendant racial science in mid-nineteenth century
                  Britain and the USA. (The most notorious polygenetic thesis, <title level="m">The Races of
                     Men: A Fragment</title> (1850), would issue from a Scottish pen—that of Robert
                  Knox, the radical anatomist tainted by the Burke and Hare scandal in 1828-29,
                  classmate of Robert E. Grant and one of Scott’s <title level="m">bêtes noires</title>. The
                  actual terms, monogenesis and polygenesis, would not be formulated until the
                     1860s.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Stepan; on Knox see Desmond 77-80, 388-89;
                     Kitson (who argues that Knox’s polygenetic views were not characteristic of
                     Romantic-period thinking about race). </note>)</p>
                  <p> The weight of polygenetic conjecture is felt throughout <title level="m">Count Robert of
                     Paris</title>. By the logic of “retrograde evolution,” cultural difference seems
                  always to be on the point of falling into racial difference, and racial difference
                  falling into species difference—since, as Buffon, Monboddo and others
                  acknowledged, the terms race and species have no clear definition in the
                     period.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Burnett 1774: I: 313-17. </note> “Race” is
                  a problem everywhere in the novel, its status and boundaries the objects of
                  constant interrogation. Count Robert, Hereward the Varangian, and Anna Comnena
                  dispute whether or not the Normans and Franks are the same people (<title level="m">Count

                  dissolute Asiatic; the courage which avenged them was that of the Greek Empire”
                  (195). The character of his own Greek Empire, more dissolute and Asiatic than

                  <p> Most striking is the novel’s set of limit cases of human racial difference. The
                  first of these is instantiated (predictably) by Africans, reduced to slavery and
                  subject to a not-always-specified physical deformation. (Mutes and eunuchs seem to
                  share the same kind of disability.) The philosopher Agelastes holds forth
                  hypocritically on the separate status of “the race of Ham” as justification for
                  their enslavement (128). His slave Diogenes rebukes as “childish” Hereward’s
                  suspicion that he might be the devil, and ironizes the signs of his own
                  difference: <quote>“Thou objectest sorely to my complexion,” said the negro; “how
                     knowest thou that it is, in fact, a thing to be counted and acted upon as a
                     matter of reality? Thy eyes daily apprise thee, that the colour of the sky
                     nightly changes from bright to black, yet thou knowest that this is by no means
                     owing to any habitual colour of the heavens themselves . . . How canst thou
                     tell, but what the difference of my colour from thine own may be owing to some
                     circumstance of a similar nature—not real of itself, but only creating an
                     apparent reality?” (90) </quote> Well might he ask, in a city where the
                  doctrinal difference between eastern and western Christianity has acquired a
                  biological, embodied cast, so that heterodoxy is expressed as a physical
                  deformity: the Orthodox Patriarch complains that, whereas the Greek cross exhibits
                  “limbs of the same length,” in the Latin cross an “irregular and most damnable
                  error prolongs the nether limb of that most holy emblem” (84).</p>
                  <p>Disproportion of the limbs characterizes the most spectacular of the novel’s limit
                  cases, both of which involve a monstrous distortion of the human. The narrator
                  comments that in Constantinople “the race of the Greeks was no longer to be seen,
                  even in its native country, unmixed, or in absolute purity; on the contrary, there
                  were features which argued a different descent” (125). The reflection takes a
                  nightmarish turn: <quote>A party of heathen Scythians, presented the deformed
                     features of the daemons whom they were said to worship—that is, having flat
                     noses with expanded nostrils, which seemed to admit the sight to their very
                     brain; faces which extended rather in breadth than length, with strange
                     unintellectual eyes placed in the extremity; figures short and dwarfish, yet
                     garnished with legs and arms of astonishing sinewy strength, disproportioned to
                     their body. (125)</quote> Scott alludes to a legend cited in Gibbon’s

                  is Sylvan the Orang-Outang: a creature that wears “the form
                  of a human being” yet stands eight feel tall, like Frankenstein’s monster, with
                  “limbs . . . much larger than humanity” (<title level="m">Count Robert</title> 169-70). Sylvan
                  represents a more up-to-date challenge to the monogenetic ground-plan of
                  philosophical history than fables of miscegenation with devils. In admitting
                  Orang-Outangs to fully human status as “a barbarous nation, which has not yet
                  learned the use of speech,” Monboddo contradicted his principal source, Buffon,
                  who insisted that the creature was “nothing but a real brute, endowed with the
                  external mark of humanity, but deprived of thought, and of every faculty which
                  properly constitutes the human species” (Burnett I: 270-312 (270); Buffon X: 37).
                  Buffon acknowledges however that this verdict relies on faith in a “divine spirit”
                  which has endowed humanity with reason and language—since physical evidence alone
                  would compel us to regard the orangutan “as a variety of the human species” (X:
                     27).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Buffon was following the lead of Linnaeus amid a

                     clearly defined species nor a substance; it is, rather, a machine or device for
                     producing the recognition of the human” (26).</note> Evicting the divine
                  spirit, Lamarck claimed the Orang-Outang as not just a human relative but a human
                  ancestor. This liminal being enjoyed a vogue in Romantic fiction, with versions by
                  Peacock, Hogg, and Poe, as well as Scott himself; more thoroughly than its
                  precursors, <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title> exploits the categorical confusion
                  and instability marked by the Orang-Outang in early nineteenth-century natural
                  philosophy, rather than endorsing any particular scientific theory (McMaster 212;
                  Simmons 25). Where various characters mistake Sylvan for the devil or a knight
                  transformed by witchcraft, the narrator is carefully equivocal. “The creature . . . it
                  would have been rash to have termed it a man,” he calls it (<title level="m">Count
                     Robert</title> 170): “the tremendous creature, so like, yet so very unlike to
                  the human form . . . the creature in question, whose appearance seemed to the
                  Count of Paris so very problematical, was a specimen of that gigantic species of
                  ape—if it is not indeed some animal more nearly allied to ourselves—to which, I
                  believe, naturalists have given the name of Ourang Outang” (171). A dozen years
                  earlier, Scott had alluded to the enigmatic status of the orangutan in his
                  depiction of pre-modern human communities in <title level="m">Rob Roy</title>—not to suggest
                  that the Highlanders are literally a sort of Caledonian apeman, or even a separate
                  race, but rather to conjure the possibility of a separate developmental path that
                  the novel begins to imagine (if only optatively) for them, in a departure from the
                  monogenetic British history invoked in <title level="m">Waverley</title>. Moderns and
                  primitives coexist within an imperial world order which sustains itself upon the
                  perpetuation of radical forms of difference.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Duncan
                     111-14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Those forms of difference attain monstrous extremes in the “seat of universal
                  empire.” McMaster contends that the Orang-Outang belongs to a
                  conjectural-historical chain of versions of “natural man” in the novel, along with
                  Hereward the Forester (whose physical beauty, extolled in the opening episode, has
                  something grotesque about it) and Count Robert himself (McMaster 214-15). On the
                  other side of the species barrier, Simmons shows how the Emperor’s menagerie of
                  non-human beings—elephant, giraffe, tiger, clockwork lion—involves the orangutan
                  in a satirical “confusion between beasts, man-beasts, and man-made beasts”
                  (Simmons 27). To these we should add the human monsters in the novel that are
                  marked by another sort of biological difference, namely sexual difference. The
                  Countess Brenhilda is persistently characterized as “[s]omething between man and
                  woman” (<title level="m">Count Robert</title> 180), thanks to the “fantastic appearance of her
                  half-masculine garb” (133). It turns out that the warrior-woman is pregnant, even
                  as she takes up arms in the novel’s bizarre climax. Biology trumps habit:
                  Brenhilda faints before she can engage battle. The duel confirms the status of her
                  opponent, Anna Comnena, as a complementary freak, the bluestocking. Early on we
                  are told that intellectual activity has unsexed Anna: “she had somewhat lost the
                  charms of her person as she became enriched in her mind” (37). “A woman who is
                  pitiless, is a worse monster than one who is unsexed,” the Empress Irene (herself
                  something of a monster) upbraids her daughter (284).</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the appearance of the Scythians foreshadows uncanny crossings between
                  the human and demonic after all. In the course of a diatribe against Christian
                  “superstition,” Agelastes is surprised by the sudden intrusion of a figure
                  resembling “the Satan of Christian mythology, or a satyr of the heathen age”
                  (270). This turns out to be Sylvan, the Orang-Outang. Monboddo had accepted
                  satyrs, along with mermaids, men with tails, dog-headed men, and men with eyes in
                  their breasts, as legitimate varieties of humankind alongside the orangutan,
                  although Scott is alluding to a more modest conjecture that ancient accounts of
                  satyrs might have been based on travellers’ tales of great apes (Burnett 1784:
                  III: 254-64).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The identification of great apes as “the
                     satyrs of the ancients” goes back to Tyson; see Nash 16-41.</note> Sylvan’s
                  role as satyr will be confirmed at his last appearance in the novel, as closing
                  act to the tragi-comical sequence of combats. More consequential is his role here
                  (not for the first time) as the devil. Agelastes has just been scoffing at “the
                  Christian Satan,” whose “goatish figure and limbs, with grotesque features,” in
                  violation of the scriptural principle of monogenesis, represent a bad theology as
                  well as bad aesthetics and bad biology (<title level="m">Count Robert</title> 270). Sylvan
                  proceeds to throttle Agelastes, an event interpreted by the onlookers as “the
                  judgment of Heaven.” Certainly this is a startlingly abrupt explosion of poetic
                  justice. Agelastes is the worst of the book’s villains, a seditious freethinker,
                  just the sort of rogue who would be promoting evolutionary, polygenetic and other
                  materialist speculations for subversive political ends in Scott’s day. Yet Sylvan,
                  conjured up by Agelastes’ denunciation of the Christian Satan, realizes a
                  euhemeristic demystification of that improbable demon, in keeping with the
                  demystification of the heathen satyr: he is himself the grotesque hybrid that
                  Agelastes ridicules. Scott reinscribes the heterodoxy that is ostensibly being
                  punished, in the form of a complicated joke. The orangutan may not be the
                  devil—all the same, the devil may be nothing more than an orangutan.</p>

                     <p>Whenever he shows up in <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>, Sylvan provokes
                     strange textual disturbances. His intervention in the tale sets off figural
                     mutations and slippages which trace a lateral or retrograde motion—an
                     associative logic not of science, of an empirically verifiable scheme of cause
                     and effect, but of something like dreamwork, of metaphor and metamorphosis: a
                     logic of romance. Consider the Orang-Outang’s second irruption into the novel,
                     which leads to the recasting of Hereward, a soldier in the imperial guard, as a
                     “Forester,” a virtuous version of the “man of the woods.” A beautiful young
                     lady rushes onto the scene with the Orang-Outang in pursuit. After chasing him
                     away Hereward recognizes his long-lost love, Bertha, who recognizes Hereward in
                     turn by the scar of a boar’s tusk on his brow. We find ourselves rapt into a
                     suddenly intensified zone or atmosphere of romance, charged with allusions not
                     just to the <title level="m">Odyssey</title> but (as Simmons points out) to <title level="m">The
                        Faerie Queene</title>, in which the chivalrous forester Sir Satyrane defends
                     virgins from giants and wild men. “Have I but dreamed of that monstrous ogre?”
                     Bertha asks. Hereward’s reassurance, “That hideous thing exists,” gives the cue
                     for the recognition scene and—true to the Odyssean analogue—a retrograde
                     narrative plunge to his youthful encounter with another “hideous animal” or
                     “monster,” the wild boar (208). The recognition scene generates, in turn, the
                     back-story of the Foresters, the Saxon insurgents who “made a step backwards in
                     civilization” and returned to the woods.</p>
                     <p> The regressive, oneiric, metamorphic logic of romance is sustained most
                     powerfully in the <title level="m">outré</title> sequence, midway through the novel, in
                     which Sylvan makes his first appearance. On this occasion the orangutan closes
                     rather than initiates the series of figural mutations. Invited to dinner at the
                     imperial palace, Count Robert is startled by the ramping of the Emperor’s
                     mechanical lion. He smashes its skull with a blow of his fist—clockwork cogs
                     and springs litter the floor. After the banquet, Robert wakes up (he has been
                     drugged) to find himself in an underground dungeon, where he is menaced by a
                     tiger—a real tiger, this time, not a mechanical one. Once again he reacts by
                     smashing its skull. Scott’s description renders the tiger, despite its reality,
                     more like an effect in a magic-lantern show—“two balls of red light”—than a
                     flesh-and-blood animal: “he gazed eagerly around, but could discern nothing,
                     except two balls of red light which shone from the darkness with a self-emitted
                     brilliancy, like the eyes of a wild animal while it glares upon its prey”
                     (161). This apparition generates the voice of a fellow prisoner, invisible in
                     the darkness, who informs Robert that <title level="m">his</title> eyeballs have been put
                     out with red-hot irons. The mutilation of eyes or tongues (or, less explicitly,
                     genitals), in a metonymic chain of disfigurements that recurs across the novel,
                     marks the victim’s removal from fully human status. Deprived of the organs of
                     speech or vision, he is reduced to a mere body, to “bare life,” the condition
                     of a beast or slave. (The prisoner’s name, “Ursel,” also recalls “bear,” the
                     anthropomorphic beast of the woods that historically precedes the theriomorphic
                     man of the woods, the Enlightenment orangutan.) So at last the grotesque
                     semi-human captive, Sylvan, makes his appearance, babbling strange sounds
                     that—in the absence of his tribe—may or may not constitute a language.</p>
                     <p> What logic moves this strange narrative sequence, with its delirious
                     transitions and transformations, its cryptic series of antitheses? Mechanical
                     animal versus living animal; animal eyes without body versus a human body
                     without eyes; the man bereft of the endowment of humanity (vision) versus the
                     animal that possesses it (language). These symbolic oppositions recapitulate
                     the historical set of conjectures about the essential distinction between
                     humans and animals which informed the Enlightenment project of the “science of
                     man”: from the Cartesian account of the animal as machine, through the
                     empiricist abstraction of a vision-based cognition, to the Romantic investment
                     in language as the uniquely human property.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Thomas

                     <p>The set of conjectures resurfaces, recombined, near the end of the novel. The
                     captive Ursel turns out not to have been blinded after all. Released from
                     prison, high on a terrace overlooking the city, he experiences a return of
                     vision that is scarcely less traumatic than an actual blinding: <quote>His
                        eyeballs had been long untrained by that daily exercise, which teaches us

                        actual knowledge of the truth as it exists in nature. His idea of distance
                        was so confused, that it seemed as if all the spires, turrets and minarets
                        which he beheld, were crowded forward upon his eyeballs, and almost touching
                        them. With a shriek of horror, Ursel turned himself to the further side[.]
                        (295)</quote> This particular instance of “retrograde evolution”—from
                     blindness to a sight that bears the violent effect of blindness—does not so
                     much look forward (for example, to the urban agoraphobia of the view from
                     Todgers’s in Dickens’s <title level="m">Martin Chuzzlewit</title>) as back: to the Platonic
                     allegory of enlightenment as emergence from a cave. Scott’s formulation however
                     is radically empiricist rather than platonic; it recalls the conjecture on the
                     reality of pigment with which the slave Diogenes taunts his interlocutors,
                     quoted earlier. If the operation of the senses is plastic rather than fixed,
                     subject to conditioning, neither is it the case that “our actual knowledge of
                     the truth as it exists in nature” precedes any sensory input. Cognition and
                     physical organization, rather, shape one another in a process of experimental
                     “correction.”</p>
                     <p>Shortly afterwards the narrator recurs to this moment, in the reaction of the
                     conspirator Nicephorus Briennius to the reversal of his plans: <quote>The
                        pardoned Caesar . . . found it as difficult to reconcile himself to the
                        reality of his situation as Ursel to the face of nature, after having been
                        long deprived of enjoying it; so much do the dizziness and confusion of
                        ideas, occasioned by moral and physical causes of surprise and terror,
                        resemble each other in their effects on the understanding. (322)</quote>
                     Nicephorus suffers what is more explicitly a narrative vertigo, as he discovers
                     himself to be a character in a plot when he had imagined himself to be the
                     author of it. His “dizziness and confusion” mirror the dizziness and confusion
                     that perturb readers of <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>. Only, as readers of
                     a novel, we are apt to experience that perturbation—the regression from a
                     conditioned blindness to a vision that is itself blinding—as sublime effects of
                     an aesthetic enjoyment, rather than as sensory distress.</p>
                     <p> Scott’s late romance does not attempt to pacify the turmoil afflicting the
                     “science of man” <emph>circa</emph> 1830 into any fixed knowledge. We are not
                     to look in these pages for a determination, even an allegorical one, of the
                     taxonomic status of man as a race or species. “In our culture,” writes Giorgio
                     Agamben, “man has always been thought of as the articulation and conjunction of
                     a body and soul, of a living thing and a <title level="m">logos</title>, of a natural (or
                     animal) element and a supernatural or social or divine element. We must learn
                     instead,” he adds, “to think of man as what results from the incongruity of
                     these two elements, and investigate not the metaphysical mystery of
                     conjunction, but rather the practical and political mystery of separation”
                     (16). Scott’s novel, through the techniques peculiar to fiction, begins that
                     work of disarticulation. The uncanny underground apparition of “two balls of
                     red light,” at once juxtaposed with and detached from the prisoner who believes
                     he has been blinded, constitutes the reflective core of <title level="m">Count Robert of
                        Paris </title>—the figure for vision, metonymically dislodged, as mark of the
                     reader’s gaze. Here, disoriented from a daylight logic of cause and effect,
                     flung deepest into a delirium of romantic adventure, we catch a glimpse of
                     ourselves: neither as human countenances nor organic bodies but as dislocated
                     perceptual fragments embedded in a meaning-generating apparatus, the literary
                     work. What we are seeing is the reflection of our own vision, bloodshot with
                     passionate amazement and with the sheer effort to see—reading in the dark.<note place="foot" resp="editors">An early version of this essay was presented at the 2007

               <div type="section">
                  <p>My essay takes its title, “Field of History, Field of Battle,” not to assert that
                  the field of history is somehow embattled, but rather to question the reflex that
                  brings forward the metaphor of field, writes one field next to the other, so that
                  when given a field, we imagine a battle,—or when presented with history, we
                  conjure warfare. It happens often and in complicated ways. The reflex includes two
                  motions: the first locates history spatially as a field, a terrain to be observed
                  and surveyed; the second converts that terrain into battleground, to be won or
                  lost through violent contestation. The motions seem hardly inevitable: surely many
                  fields—magnetic fields, fields of dreams, strawberry fields—do not
                  lead to warfare. But I will argue that especially in wartime (and indeed in a
                  historiography that dates itself as “wartime” or even “post-war”) history-as-field
                  inclines fatally to the battlefield. The metaphorics involved slide along a scale
                  from far to near, at one end detached and analogical, at the other end nearly
                  reaching identification. The double motion involved in recourse to this
                  metaphor—terrain to be surveyed, site of contestation—itself
                  complicates matters of distance and proximity. Here for instance is Thomas Babington Macauley, writing in
                  1828, defining the duty of a historian: it is “[t]o make the past present, to
                  bring the distant near, to place us in the society of a great man on an eminence.”
                  Up to this point Macauley’s
                  prescription sounds familiar enough as it makes nearness its goal. Yet he
                  continues: “to place us in the society of a great man on an eminence <emph>who
                     overlooks the field of a mighty battle</emph>” (Macauley I: 310).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Macauley’s
                     other examples climb down from this height, until we are “seated at the table”
                     with “our ancestors” and “rummag[ing] through their old-fashioned wardrobes”
                     (I: 308). Warfare thus posed a sticking point, an obstacle, to the practice of
                     sympathetic insight (<emph>Verstehen</emph>) which, as Mark Salber Phillips argues, “came to be
                     understood as the central feature of historical understanding” (Phillips 347). </note>
                  Macauley’s image of proximity keeps its
                  distance from the ugliness of battle per se, the metaphor of field securing more
                  elevated and unifying impressions. </p>
                  <p>So my title finds these two terms, field of history, field of battle, close to
                  each other with a shared metaphor yet without a mediating conjunction, in order to
                  open up the question: what relationship, if any, governs these two terms? The
                  essay will press this metaphor and the accompanying questions of distance and
                  proximity by situating their use first in the aftermath of war, in post-war
                  writing, and then within wartime. In seeing the persistent war that governs much
                  historical thinking, it brings together influential concepts of history from the
                  late eighteenth and early nineteenth century—a period of far-flung wars of
                  European imperialism and expansion—with those of the late twentieth century.
                  Precisely as “post-war” suggests a certain vantage upon and distance from a finite
                  scene of war (a discernible field of study), “wartime” is where present history
                  and the history of the present find it difficult to pull away from or “overlook”
                  the inchoate scene of war. Indeed, my concluding example, a wartime consideration
                  of historiography, will move down from Macauley’s eminence and measure history no longer by the metaphor of
                  field but by the fallen human body, found in extreme proximity to the field of
                  battle. </p>
                  <p>In locating the field of history in relationship to the time of war, I take
                  instruction from Macauley’s
                  predecessors, British writers of the Romantic period. For them a governing
                  question was how to tell of war given the mode of historiography they had
                  inherited: one that aspired to write the gradual improvement of society and
                  civilization, the progress of morals and mind—the historical mode inherited,
                  in other words, from the Scottish Enlightenment. In a paradigmatic statement about
                  recent “improvements” in the art of History, Hugh
                     Blair in his well-known <title level="m">Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles
                     Lettres</title> (published 1783; delivered in 1759-60), asserts, <quote>It is
                     now understood that it is the business of an able Historian to exhibit manners,
                     as well as facts and events; and assuredly, whatever displays the state and
                     life of mankind, in different periods, and illustrates the progress of the
                     human mind, is more useful and interesting than the detail of sieges and
                     battles (288; qtd. in Phillips 44). </quote> For Blair, an influential professor at the University of Edinburgh and
                  avowed admirer of David Hume’s innovative <title level="m">History of
                     England</title>, history kept its distance from battle. Hume, for instance,
                  claimed a dispassionate distance, and to have “neglected present power, interest
                  and authority, and the cry of popular prejudices” in depicting the wars and
                  factionalism that had led to the formation of the current United Kingdom. He had
                  examined the Protestant Succession, for instance, “as coolly and impartially as if
                  I were removed a thousand Years from the present Period” (qtd. in Phillips 35, 36n.). Such a deliberately postwar
                  historiographical style aimed, among other things, to free its readers from the
                  claims of that earlier violence. The thought was, as Mark Salber Phillips points out, that through
                  such a history <quote>the conflicts of the previous century could finally be left
                     behind, because they [could be shown to have] resulted in a new order of
                     government as well as, more comprehensively, in accompanying changes in manners
                     and opinions. The new order [would be written not as] . . . the work of any
                     single party, but . . . as an indirect consequence of the irregular . . .
                     politics of [past] times (Phillips 36).</quote> In writing an account that
                  transcended factional feeling, the Enlightenment historian could help produce a
                  history of a nation itself transcending the violence of faction. The England (or
                  Britain) of this new order and changed manners would be free to contemplate what
                  Robert Henry, another Scottish historian of the period, dubbed “the more permanent
                  and peaceful scenes of social life” (qtd. in Phillips 4). This form of cultural
                  history deliberately situated itself apart from warfare and factional strife, in
                  more convivial environs.</p>
                  <p> By the end of the eighteenth century, however, faced with the incontrovertible
                  fact of world-wide war and the repetitive and increasing impact of war throughout
                  the century of Enlightenment, such an improved history began to look like wishful
                  thinking. Even while responding to the sociable and even anti-military
                  conceptualizations of history offered by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers such as
                     Blair, Hume and Adam Smith, Romantic authors had to ponder in wartime
                  the field of history. Writers such as Walter Scott
                  and Anna Barbauld were crucial in
                  formulating still-current protocols of cultural history and historicism in
                  particular. Both suggest that it is primarily not approximation—not
                  “bringing the distant near”—but rather distance in space and time that
                  enables the field of history to take itself as a field of battle. Brought too
                  close to the fighting, the field of history, especially the field of cultural
                  history, threatens to lose definition and disappear. The focus on culture as a
                  “field” which organizes and situates history as a comprehensive practice is, as we
                  will see, a product of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century; yet its
                  use discloses something which, at the very moment of its emergence, displays its
                     vulnerability.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the emergence of the

                  <p>To give this Romantic metaphor of field its proper scope and currency, it helps to
                  look both before and after the nineteenth century, and I will do this by turning
                  to two twentieth-century postwar theorists of history, Michel Foucault and Reinhart
                     Koselleck, each writing a generation after world war about the modern
                  field of history, and each locating that field in the eighteenth century, also in
                  the aftermath of war. The problematic of distance from or nearness to the field of
                  war reveals itself in these crucial thinkers as the problematic underlying our own
                  contemporary understanding of history. </p>
                  <p>In his lectures of 1975-78, Foucault turns for
                  inspiration to Karl von Clausewitz, the great military theorist of the Napoleonic
                  period, in order to propose warfare as the model through which to understand the
                  infinitesimal workings of power in daily life. In perhaps his most provocative
                  extension of this idea, Foucault argues that
                  history itself is and ought to be engaged in war. In his lecture of February 26,
                  1976, history not only “decipher[s] the war and the struggle that is going on
                  within the institutions of right and peace”; history also participates in that war
                     (Foucault 171). 
                     Foucault attributes this formulation of history (he will go on to call
                  it historicism) to the French nobility of the eighteenth-century. Defeated by an
                  absolutist monarchy and its armies, these early historicists direct the energies
                  of that defeat into a historiography devoted to undermining and de-legitimating
                  the powers that be. From this unlikely source Foucault takes up historicism in a late twentieth-century call to arms:
                     <quote>This. . . is our first task. We must try to be historicists, or in other
                     words, try to analyze the perpetual and unavoidable relationship between the
                     war that is recounted by history, and the history that is traversed by the war
                     it is recounting (173-4). </quote> The war, in other words, is not over or
                  past; it “traverses” the very field of historiography. It is hard to overestimate
                  the influence of this imperative, where war becomes the transcendent term
                  (perpetual and unavoidable) arching over but also grounding the work of
                  historicism. For Foucault in the 70’s, war is
                  the general idea of history: “No matter how far back it goes, historical knowledge
                  never finds nature, truth, order or peace. However far back it goes, historical
                  knowledge discovers only an unending war” (172). By implication, however far
                  forward it goes into the future, historical knowledge will only discover—and
                  promote—unending war. </p>
                  <p> The temptation here is to take Foucault’s
                  language as figural. This war is merely metaphorical: no lives are lost in its
                  prosecution, no states rise or fall. Foucault
                  nevertheless wants to push his martial metaphors as close as he can to the
                  literal, to insist we allow for the possibility that the writing of history may
                  cost lives, and that states do win or lose legitimacy on the basis of this
                  writing. He famously inverts Clausewitz’s dictum: “Politics,” Foucault insists, “is the continuation of war by
                  other means”; and by “politics” he designates a full array of the discourses of
                  power (165). Rather than suggest an analogy (what war does in one way, politics
                  does in another) it announces that the work of war proceeds into, infiltrates, the
                  work of politics—and therefore, for Foucault, infiltrates the work of history. The eighteenth-century
                  French historian Boulainvilliers, whom Foucault
                  takes as exemplary, <quote>makes the relationship of war part of every social
                     relationship, subdivided into a thousand different channels, and reveals war to
                     be a sort of permanent state that exists between groups, fronts and tactical
                     units as they in some sense civilize one another, come into conflict with one
                     another, or . . . form alliances. There are no more multiple and stable great
                     masses, but there is a multiple war. . . . It is obviously not a war of every
                     man against every man in the abstract and—I think—unreal sense in
                     which Hobbes spoke. . . . With Boulainvilliers, by contrast, we have a
                     generalized war that permeates the entire social body and the entire history of
                     the social body. . . . one in which groups fight groups. (162)</quote>
                  Foucault brings war as close as he can to
                  history; he wants it to permeate history so that we understand history as the
                  continuation of warfare in one more field, transferred but not essentially
                  altered. </p>
                  <p>And yet, even as the passage moves toward full equation—not “abstract,” not
                  “unreal,” but real war—it falters: war is “sort of” a permanent state; the
                  “tactical units” of this state “in some sense” engage in the activities of war.
                  War becomes, as Foucault says repeatedly,
                  “generalized”: “in some sense” everywhere. In fact, war itself must be transformed
                  into an analytic category, an intellection, if it is to pervade history in the way
                     Foucault’s historicism demands. War becomes
                  the “grid of intelligibility” we have inherited; “war is basically [again a slight
                  hitch in the equation] historical discourse’s truth-matrix” (164, 165). As grid or
                  matrix, it helps map out a field, History, but a field one finds difficult to
                  imagine being trampled or blood-stained or strewn with bodies. The only visible
                  body on this field turns out to be the generalizable “social body.”</p>
                  <p>How quiet by contrast the account of “the concept of history” offered by the
                  German Koselleck, also writing in the
                  mid-1970s. Like Foucault, Koselleck is interested in situating modernity,
                  and what distinguishes our modernity is its “concept of history,” emergent
                  “sometime between 1750 and 1850” when “European society began to think and act as
                  if it existed in history,” identifying itself with and by its “historicity”(White x). Historicism in this case attends to “a
                  social mode of being in the world marked by a particular experience of
                  temporality”; that is, of social reality undergoing structural change (White xi). The historicism that takes such
                  multi-layered change as its “great theme,” according to Koselleck, is “the history of the vanquished,”
                  its great methodological and theoretical innovations introduced, as we have
                  already seen, by the historians of the Scottish Enlightenment in the wake of
                  Scotland’s defeat and absorption into Great Britain (Koselleck 80). Whereas for Foucault
                  the losers bequeath to modern history an extension of warfare, an on-going battle
                  focused on usurpations, invasions and bloodshed, in Koselleck’s account the vanquished appear to turn away from military
                  contest altogether. Not war but larger and more abstract forces determine history.
                  So, instead of armies and generals, “the social and economic <hi>situation</hi>
                  decides whether someone is left behind or thrust forward” (80; emphasis added). We
                  may need to be reminded that he is talking about Scotland in the eighteenth not
                  Germany in the twentieth century, but the larger point is clear: historicism in
                  this instance understands itself moving beyond and past the failed operations of
                  warfare to a more detached perspective, to, for instance, the “social and
                  economic.” Yet—and here is Koselleck’s great
                  insight—in moving past the battlefield to this higher level of abstraction,
                  historicism also moves away from experience per se. </p>
                  <p>Precisely because they have lost, because they have suffered history as an
                  “unintended experience,” the vanquished are adept in developing historiographical
                  methods that, in the case of the Scottish Enlightenment, enable the move to a
                  detached view of “structural, long-term change” (80). Method, as Koselleck elaborates his account, serves as an
                  alternative to experience, especially an experience of suffering, because methods
                  “can be abstracted from the unique event; they can be applied elsewhere” (83).
                  Historicist methods allow the transposition of loss into a form of knowledge where
                  it remains, or at least this is the hope, “accessible beyond all change of
                  experience”—unassailable (83). For Koselleck, historicism substitutes method and knowledge for the
                  experience—often quite intimate—of war and its aftermath. In this way
                  he understands Foucault’s “grid” or “historical
                  discourse’s truth-matrix” not as another version of war but as a means of stepping
                  outside of the suffering exacted by war. An unassailable method, the historicism
                  developed by Scottish historians “might offer some comfort, perhaps a gain,” he
                  suggests. But he ends more ruefully: “In practice, it would mean saving us from
                  the victors. Yet every experience speaks against it” (83).</p>
                  <p> Does the history of the vanquished, with its method and “production of theory
                  that became an imperative of method” offer a viable alternative to war (81)? You
                  have to read to the very end of Koselleck’s
                  rigorous forty-page essay on “Transformations of Experience and Methodological
                  Change” to arrive at the pathos of his project. Tonally his considerations could
                  not be more different from Foucault’s and yet
                  both tell us perhaps what a self-consciously post-war generation must: war is
                  either history’s matrix or the experience that history wants to transcend; it is
                  history’s internal or external limit. “History cannot get away from war,” writes
                     Foucault, “quite simply because war itself
                  supports this knowledge, runs through this knowledge and determines this
                  knowledge” (173). Koselleck might sigh and
                  say, “History has to try to get away from war, get off the battlefield to produce
                  some other possibility for knowledge,” even as he admits that all “experience
                  speaks against it.”</p>
                  <p> The postwar thoughts of Foucault and Koselleck form a sort of resonating chamber for
                  our contemporary thinking about historicism. Here war, history, knowledge and
                  experience jostle and reverberate. As we carry such thinking into our contemporary
                  wartime, we must wonder what it means to dwell within such a chamber, or indeed if
                  the walls of the chamber will hold.</p>

                  <head>In the Field</head>
                  <p> Another version of historicism has been given more recently by James Chandler, whose 1998 book, <title level="m">England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic
                     Historicism</title> also locates the origins of historicism and cultural
                  history in the writings of the Scottish Enlightenment. Chandler’s characterization of historicism seems to side-step the
                  question of war to focus instead on the development of systems of dating and
                  periodization. But 1819 is markedly a postwar year, and barely so; its proximity
                  to fields of battle threatens to disrupt these very procedures of dating and
                  periodization, and open up its own echo chamber. We will return to that
                  side-stepping and those echoes in a moment. </p>
                  <p>Chandler meditates at length on the value of
                  the “dating system” for the study of culture, even as he provides a powerful
                  history and critique of the historicism emerging in Britain in the early
                  nineteenth century. “What the dating system adds,” he suggests, “is a second order
                  code, a method of <hi>translation</hi> from one textually constituted
                  culture/character into another (Chandler 151,
                  emphasis added). This second order code, developed as a characteristic of
                  Romantic-era writing, derived in part from Scottish Enlightenment historiography.
                  As a method of translation between different “states,” it makes possible both
                  ethnography and historicism; it serves as a method for marking—and therefore
                  comparing, coordinating and unifying—differences across the borders of time
                  and geography (95). </p>
                  <p>Thus for Walter Scott, the most obvious literary
                  practitioner of historicism, “calendrical chronology functions as the medium in
                  which different time-in-temporalities can be merged into a yet-higher-order
                  calculus: a historian’s code” (132). The uneven rates of development between, say,
                  Scottish and English culture, or between Saxon and Norman culture, can be
                  specified and made visible. The idea of culture as an object of study requires
                  such a code and with it the assumption that “operations of changing times and
                  changing places are mutually defined” (132-3; see also 161). By locating his early
                  novels at the borders of Scottish and English cultures, Scott could thus delineate such operations. In this way movement across
                  a geographical border could send you into a different temporal state, to a culture
                  “behind” or “advanced” according to some universal chronological measure. </p>
                  <p>Like the writers he studies, Chandler lays
                  particular emphasis on the term “state,” not allowing us to forget the resonance
                  between cultural states and geopolitical entities with cultures to be defined but
                  also defended, promulgated or potentially exterminated. The historian’s code then,
                  as it coordinates heterogeneous temporalities into a system of calendrical dating,
                  as it “translates” between “states,” claims for itself a <hi>diplomatic</hi>
                  function, smoothing over inter-state differences or tensions so that, as Chandler says, their “operations . . . are
                  mutually defined.” </p>
                  <p>Scott himself, in the 1819 Dedicatory Epistle to
                     <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title> which lays out his methods, defines the area
                  of cultural translation as an “extensive neutral ground”—and his terminology
                  implies that in the absence of this neutral ground, past and present, there and
                  here would confront each other on contested ground, the ground of battle (Scott 9).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The
                     words in fact belong to the character Lawrence Templeton, an English antiquary
                     and Scott’s persona as compiler of this novel as
                     well as his apologist for the practice of historical fiction. Chandler, in his analysis of Templeton’s
                     epistle in <title level="m">England in 1819</title>, adds, “This metaphor of
                     the neutral ground between the ancient and the modern presides over the rest of
                        Scott’s analysis” (141). </note> Translation
                  on neutral ground thus involves a search for what Scott calls, in an echo of Hugh Blair,
                  “manners and sentiments” held in common, “principles of our common nature,” in
                  order to offset “indifference,” incomprehension, or (and he leaves this
                  possibility unstated) hostility (9). Edging Scott’s
                  own meditations on historiography and the study of cultures, and leaking into
                     Chandler’s as well, are reminders of states
                  not easily accommodated by diplomatic translation, and of cultures under
                     threat.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Scott’s re-mapping of violence in Scotland, past and present, see
                        Makdisi. </note> From these reminders we can
                  begin to see how wartime and the state of war vex the work of historicism at its
                  very roots.</p>
                  <p>The focus on culture as a “field” which organizes and situates historical (and
                  ethnographic) practice, and which Chandler,
                  following Raymond Williams, understands as a
                  product of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century, has this darker and
                  more destructive aspect: the field of battle. The problem surfaces primarily in
                  the metaphors of “ground” and “field” which Chandler borrows from Scott and which
                  serve as the spatial correlatives of historical “periods” or “ages.” Though these
                  are metaphors common enough in the study of culture, in the self-reflexive
                  practices of Romantic historiography, in terms like “neutral ground,” they betray
                  an awareness of forces otherwise poised to overthrow “states” and the cultures
                  they support. The Dedicatory Epistle itself seems to question the ideal of neutral
                  or common ground. Scott’s metaphor for
                  historical-cultural translation recalls—maybe to repair—an earlier,
                  unsettling moment in the Dedicatory Epistle which situates itself on the
                  battlefield. There Lawrence Templeton, the English antiquarian serving as the
                  fictional author of the Epistle, is straining to justify the work of the
                  historical novelist, and he turns first not to neutral ground but to the
                  gore-stained ground of war. <quote>The Scottish magician, you say, was like Lucan’s witch, at liberty to walk over the recent field
                     of battle, and to select for the subject of resuscitation by his sorceries, a

                     just uttered the last note of agony. Such a subject even the powerful Erictho

                  Chandler devotes a good deal of space to <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>’s Dedicatory Epistle, and to this passage in
                  particular, rightly understanding it as a crucial “moment of reflexive
                  theorization” in Scott’s novel (Chandler 136)—one of those moments of
                  theorizing that reveal what Koselleck terms
                  “the imperative of method” (Koselleck
                     81).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Chandler’s larger discussion of the Dedicatory Epistle runs pp.
                     133-177. For Scott, the larger state of the
                     world is suggested by his praise for the <title level="m">Arabian Nights
                        Tales</title>, a remarkable feat of cultural translation between “West
                     and”East” (Scott iv). </note> To seek the power
                  of utterance in a corpse, moreover, sounds like a close approximation of the
                  desideratum of new historicism, famously voiced by Stephen Greenblatt when he wrote, “I wanted to speak with the dead” and
                  likened himself to a “conjuror” (Greenblatt
                  1). </p>
                  <p>Certainly the primary purpose of this passage is to differentiate the “time” of
                  the Scottish historical novelist—witch or warlock—from that of the
                  English antiquarian, not only by placing the Scots closer to the scene of violence
                  (the visceral as opposed to the dusty “field” of historical research) but also by
                  assigning them to different cultural systems: that of Lucan’s <title level="m">On Civil War</title>, a verse history of the
                  wars between Pompey and Caesar in the first century BCE; as opposed to the even
                  more distant Book of Joel from the ancient Hebrew scriptures. The comparison of
                  fields adds philosophical complexity as well to Chandler’s larger point about historicist dating procedures.
                  “Templeton’s point, though couched in the macabre details of military carnage,
                  might be said to depend on a familiar Rousseauistic paradox about civil society:
                  that we must be forced to be free.” By this reckoning the Scottish novelist
                  working on the recent past is like the witch “free to be forced” to choose her
                  subject, while the English writer, trying to locate a similar “state” is “free to
                  be unconstrained in his selection” (Chandler
                  169). The emphasis on social contract theory, though, does not sit easily with the
                  macabre details of military carnage: Lucan is not
                  depicting the operations of civil society but its breakdown in civil war. Warfare
                  complicates (though the verb seems feeble) the field or ground of “translation”
                  (from one state to another) that supports Templeton’s dating system; it
                  complicates as well the issues of “force” and “freedom” involved. </p>
                  <p>Templeton does not show the historian revivifying just any old dead; he finds his
                  dead on the contested ground of war.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In a
                     footnote, Chandler remarks that Templeton’s
                     musings about these two ancient battlefields suggests a “displacement” of the
                     Battle of Culloden, the decisive event of Scott’s first novel, <title level="m">Waverley</title>. “It is
                     difficult. . . not to hear” in Templeton’s comparisons, “echoes of the Scottish
                     reactions to the Clansmen who were slaughtered and denied burial by the Duke of
                     Cumberland’s orders on Culloden Moor in 1746” (168, fn. 27). </note> The past
                  here is not what a generation of Scots historians (the historians Koselleck takes as his model) had assumed it
                  ought to be: manners and morals, representative characters and social and economic
                  movements are lost in the impersonal remains of the carnage. By grounding Scott’s previous novels in this bloody terrain,
                  moreover, Templeton reminds his audience, if inadvertently, of the fragility of
                  any construction of the “state.” The passage he glosses from Lucan, where Pompey’s son asks the Thessalonian witch Erichtho to work
                  her magic in the near aftermath of battle, culminates a series of scenes in Book
                  VI of <title level="m">On Civil War</title>, which are keenly attuned to the
                  problem of ground in time of war. In one early passage Lucan describes extensive fortifications erected by Caesar to encircle
                  his enemy, then questions why "[s]uch an army of busy hands” could not have been
                  set to work building bridges or canals, work analogous to Scott’s cultural translation on “extensive neutral ground.” Why not, he
                  asks, build viaducts that would change “for the better some other region of
                  earth?” Instead, Lucan laments, by the work of these
                  hands <quote>[t]he field of war was now contracted <emph>[</emph>
                        <emph>Coit area belli]</emph>; here is preserved the blood that will flow
                     hereafter over every land; here the victims of Thessaly and the victims of
                     Africa [two future battles] are penned up; the madness of civil war seethes
                     within narrow lists." (VI: lines 54-63, p. 309)</quote> For Lucan, war contracts time and space into a tight, seething circle, a
                  vortex of tenses (“was now,” “is preserved,” “will . . . hereafter”) and locations
                  (western Italy, Thessalonia, Libya). The blood of future dead in far-flung places
                  is held in the grasp of this one far-from-neutral field; not translation but
                  drastic reduction is at work. Repeatedly Lucan reminds
                  his reader that the whole world, “every land” is present, forced onto this one
                  particular field. <note place="foot" resp="editors">So Duff translates Lucan’s word <emph>parasti</emph> (322). For similar
                     images of a world at war, see Lucan, VI: 305-13, 327;
                     481-82, 339; and 819-20, 365. .Especially notable is the dead prophet’s comment
                     that the “furious civil war’ in Rome has spilled over into the netherworld (VI:
                     780-81, 361), </note> The freedom to be forced, upon which civil society bases
                  itself, narrows drastically in time of war; freedom itself contracts along with
                  time and space. In <title level="m">On Civil War</title>, the field of battle
                  collapses the possibility of other, different places or times as they are all
                  forced into this tight, bloody spot which is also “the whole world.” In Lucan, that is, the totalizing power of war re-defines the
                  ground or field, scrambling the historian’s code. </p>
                  <p>It is perhaps then not remarkable that Templeton neglects one detail built into
                  the story of Lucan’s witch. When she asks the newly-dead
                  corpse to “give events their names, their places; and provide a voice,” Erictho is
                     <hi>not</hi> asking, as a historian might, in order to establish the ground of
                  past events. She wants to know the future spawned by this slaughter (VI: ll.
                  774-775, p. 361). The utterance emerging from the field of battle, this unsettled
                  ground, tells of the coming fall of the Roman republic. Fittingly, as if the fall
                  of that state takes with it the historian’s code, the prophetic utterance of the
                  fallen warrior (which closes Book VI) further erases distinctions between
                  different places and times in what might be called a trans-historical instability.
                  In the end, the dead man announces, “the battle of the rivals [will] settle
                  nothing but their place of burial” (VI: lines 811-12, p. 365). Prophecy intrudes
                  upon history and finds that the only “state” is the unsettled state of the
                  battlefield; its only settled ground a burial ground. </p>
                  <p>The question of settlement—the settlement that became Julius Caesar’s
                  imperium, the settlement wrought by Culloden or Waterloo—haunts Scott’s Dedicatory Epistle, no less in the field of
                  Jehoshophat than the field of civil war. Again, Templeton appears to alter the
                  significance of the field, in this case the valley of Jehoshophat, taken from the
                  book of the prophet Joel. He makes it the site of a remote past. In scripture,
                  however, Jehosophat represents the site of the future: it is the “valley of
                  decision” yet-to-be—not the dusty cemetery of battles past. In Joel’s
                  account, here God will “gather all nations” and proclaim to them the famous words:
                     <quote>prepare warre, wake up the mightie men, let all the men of warre drawe
                     neere, let them come up. Beat your plowe shares into swords, and your pruning
                     hookes into speares. (<title level="m">King James Bible</title>, 1611; Joel 3:
                     14, 2, 9-10) </quote> In the valley of Jehoshaphat, God promises to assemble
                  and sit in judgment upon “the gentiles,” “the heathens,” the nations that have
                  injured his people. “[A]nd the heavens and the earth shall shake,” the prophet
                  tells us (Joel 3: 16). Jumpin’ Jehosaphat, in other words, is the ground of some
                  final, apocalyptic overturning, after which “Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom
                  will be a desolate wilderness. . . . But Judah shall be for ever, and Jerusalem
                  from generation to generation” (Joel 3: 19-20). On the Day of Decision, in the
                  valley of Jehoshaphat, only one state survives: this field reduces “all nations”
                  to one. </p>
                  <p>Even as he marks out the “extensive neutral ground” of cultural translation, even
                  as he theorizes a “higher-order calculus” that will allow for comparative analyses
                  of different states, settling them in their moment in chronological time, Scott’s Templeton ventures onto terrain that will not
                  remain past or settled. Despite his insistence that the historical novelist charts
                     “<emph>la vie privee </emph>of our forefathers<emph>” </emph>Templeton–like
                     Scott—begins his research on the ground of
                  what we would now call state-sponsored violence where, as Hannah Arendt has explained, an “all-pervading uncertainty,” an
                  insurmountable “arbitrariness” holds sway (Arendt
                  4-5). In war and through war, chronology is subject to upsetting forces, blasting
                  open its orderly sequencing and synchronies. The Northern Warlock plies his trade
                  on the battlefield of Pharsalia, in Thessaly; the southern, English antiquarian in
                  Jehoshaphat, the borderland between Israel and Judea: some fields merge even as
                  others are eliminated. In the process, the British state leans dangerously close
                  to identification with the up-coming fall of the Roman republic, the historian
                  picks about the bones of the yet-to-be dead in the earth-shaking valley of
                  judgment in the Mid-east. Civil war and the apocalypse of totalizing empire form
                  the horizon of Templeton’s world picture. </p>
                  <p>Though Templeton does not admit it, Scott knows
                  that the ground had shifted (again), the battlefield had recently come to England.
                  In August of 1819, while he was writing <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, British
                  citizens peaceably assembling to press for Parliamentary reform were massacred by
                  government troops at St. Peter’s Field, an event christened Peterloo. The very
                  name, echoing Waterloo, suggests a dislocation in time and space, as if the recent
                  wars with Napoleon had to end again and in a new, less distant place; as if
                  history had not moved on from that earlier settlement, but would repeat itself and
                  move closer.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Though he does not directly
                     address the Peterloo massacre, Philip Shaw does
                     helpfully analyze the psychic wound of Waterloo in <title level="m">Waterloo
                        and the Romantic Imagination</title>. </note> “The battle of the rivals
                  settles nothing but their place of burial,” Lucan
                  explains. There are always more burials, more fields consecrated and constricted
                  by war. </p>
                  <p>On the contested ground of the battlefield, neither the “expanse of the national
                  past” nor the gathering of scattered remains can be taken for granted anymore than
                  the survival of the state which these activities underwrite. Perhaps this threat
                  explains why corpses on the battlefield are not asked to speak for what has
                  passed, but for the possibility of a future (state): whether or not there will
                  remain any fields outside the battlefield. In wartime, the “field” of cultural
                  history may look like prophecy. </p>
                  <p>Romantic wartime emerges from this problematic relationship between historicism
                  and the battlefield. It considers, on the one hand, historicism’s need to keep the
                  violence of war at a distance—the object of geographical and chronological
                  mapping—in order to delineate that “extensive neutral ground” which becomes
                  the field of cultural history. On the other hand, Romantic wartime attends to the
                  totalizing impulse of warfare, acknowledged even as early as Lucan’s <title level="m">De Bello Civile</title>, which refuses to
                  honor historical and geographical distinctions, so that this war or that war are
                  subsumed under something called War; remote causes satisfy present hatreds; and
                  all the world is condensed into one field of battle.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I pursue this issue more extensively in chapters 1 and 2

                  [—and the cultural historian’s—] ‘subject’ lies?” Chandler asks, with characteristic acuity (Chandler 169). He wants to answer that question by
                  examining the contradictory modes of interpretation sponsored by the metaphor, and
                  calling attention to difficulties of historical representation.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Is the field an “expanse of the national past” from which

                     that past for which we hope to piece together a representation (Chandler 169)? Is the field to be understood
                     diachronically or synchronically? Scott
                     complicates the matter further by offering two examples of what it means to
                     “speak for.” In one example, the fallen body (a body, we might add, with lungs
                     and other body parts intact) “hails you, as it were, asking to be the
                     representative”; in the other “the body has to be composed, or recomposed” out
                     of scattered, neglected bones (170). Dominick
                        LaCapra repeats a similar conundrum about historical representation,
                     when he describes the historian’s “conversational” exchange with the dead as
                     fundamentally uncanny, given that the exchange takes place via a dialogue
                     pieced together “through their [the dead’s] textualized remainders” (LaCapra 36).</note> I do not want to minimize
                  the importance of Chandler’s question or his
                  answers. Rather I would like to ask how we ought to understand this crucial
                  metaphor of the (cultural) field <hi>in wartime</hi>, when it contracts into the
                  battlefield. So I will alter Chandler’s
                  question: “How ought we to understand the metaphor of the ‘field’ on which the
                  historical novelist’s [—and the cultural historian’s—] ‘subject’
                  dies?” </p>

                  <p>Anna Letitia Barbauld’s unfinished
                  “Dialogue in the Shades” written in 1813 offers a singular answer to this
                  question. Faced with the slaughter bench of on-going war, Barbauld puts aside the historian’s code
                  of dating, searching for history’s scale and tempo instead in the fragile,
                  impermanent form of the individual human body. Even more explicitly than Scott’s, Barbauld’s work situates this body and the wars it suffers within the
                  emergent “field” of modern historicism, where historical practice finds it
                  difficult to differentiate its field from the battlefield.</p>
                  <p>Barbauld wrote her prose “Dialogue in
                  the Shades” in the shadow of war and the aftermath of the critical firestorm that
                  erupted around her anti-war poem, “Eighteen Hundred and Eleven.” As the title of
                  that poem indicates, Barbauld was
                  concerned there with locating the state of England in the higher-order calculus of
                  dated, universal history and this meant removing it from the mortality of the
                  human body (the poem ends with an ethereal “Genius” or “Spirit” traversing the
                  globe). This process allows the sort of cultural translation advocated by Scott’s Templeton, and advocated as well in Barbauld’s essay, “On the Uses of
                  History,” a text which, along with “Eighteen-Hundred and Eleven,” serve as
                  touchstones in Chandler’s account (Chandler 115-19).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Barbauld’s “On the Uses of
                     History,” is an essay in four parts, addressed to a young woman, Lydia, who has
                     asked for advice on her education. </note> Like the poem, “On the Uses of
                  History” understands the mutual implication of geography and chronology in the
                  study of History (they are “the two eyes of History”). In the way these linked
                  texts theorize history, the turn to universal or what Barbauld calls “general” as opposed to
                  “relative” history aims for a point of view outside and above the human body. By
                  contrast the relative or “natural” mode of telling time derives from an
                  individual’s present position and from memory: “in more familiar life [we resort]
                  to this natural kind of chronology—The year before I was married,—when
                  Harry, who is now five years old, was born,—the winter of the hard frost”
                     (Barbauld 151). But this way of
                  telling history (and for Barbauld it looks gendered and belongs, as her examples
                  suggest, “to the annals of domestic life”) cannot survive “personal recollection”
                  because it lives within a mortal creature. Even were such accounts recorded in
                  writing, in a temporally coherent narrative, one would still want to know when the
                  “natural” historian lived and died (151). To separate History from this mortal,
                  embodied perspective, there must be some impersonal, “common measure” or “medium”
                  for ordering events: one must “place them with respect to the history of other
                  times and nations.” “General”—as opposed to “natural”—chronology,
                     Barbauld maintains, “fixes every
                  event to its precise point in the chart of universal time” (152). In other words,
                  general chronology, as practiced in “Eighteen Hundred and Eleven” and explained in
                  “On the Uses of History,” can perform translations between nations and times
                  because, like Hegel’s “general
                  idea,” it does not suffer death.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <quote> It is not the general idea that is implicated in opposition and combat,
                        and that is exposed to danger. It remains in the background, untouched,
                        uninjured. This may be called <emph>the cunning of reason</emph>—that
                        it sets the passions to work for itself, while that which develops it
                        existence through such impulsion pays the penalty, and suffers loss. . . .
                        the particular is for the most part of too trifling value as compared to the
                        general: individuals are sacrificed and abandoned. (Hegel 33) </quote>

                  <p>The prose “Dialogue in the Shades” follows “On the Uses of History” and reverses
                  its tack, bringing us back to the field of battle: it recognizes the demands
                  placed by the mortal body upon History, even as History aims to transcend it.
                  (This seems the place to mention that “Dialogue” was not published until 1825,
                  well after the settlement of the Treaty of Versailles, and after Barbauld’s death). In it Clio, the
                  classical embodiment of History, but embodied in immortal form, complains to
                  Mercury, the messenger of the gods, that she cannot possibly keep up with the
                  accelerated flow of bodies pouring into the afterlife. <quote>“I have had more
                     business for these last twenty years than I have often had for two centuries;
                     and if I had, as old Homer says, ‘a throat of brass and adamantine lungs,’ I
                     could never get through it. . . . my roll is so full, and I have so many
                     applications which cannot in decency be refused, that I see no other way than
                     striking off some hundreds of names to make room . . .” (Barbauld, “Dialogue” 464) </quote>
                  Clio’s surprisingly bureaucratic sense of the change in History’s tempo (so much
                  business, so many applications!) generates its own version of uneven development.
                  Global war here functions as History’s accelerator, but also its principle of
                  economy. Although elsewhere Barbauld
                  adopts universal history as a means of measuring and coordinating different rates
                  of development, here it poses as a system of limits, a restricted ground, within
                  which something has to give. In the dialogue that follows, the muse of History
                  searches for ways to “make room” for new names and new stories, threatening in the
                  process to blot out the record of warriors and heroes from the ancient past. The
                  ancients, she insists, “have been remembered long enough” (468). Modern war
                  demands History’s revision.</p>
                  <p>In some ways Barbauld’s “Dialogue”
                  may appear a simple rehearsal of a long-familiar narrative of supercession, the
                  old giving way to the new. Yet while characterizing the impressive features of the
                  modern moment, Barbauld does not
                  quite offer a vision of progress (a departure from her goal in “Eighteen-Hundred
                  and Eleven”). Indeed, she suggests a homology between the work of modern history
                  and the destructiveness of modern war, both feeding off the “taking of lives.” The
                  increased scale and speed of the modern era (“[N]ow I am required to be in a
                  hundred places at once” . . . “in all parts of the globe at once,” moans Clio)
                  have indeed necessitated Clio’s streamlining of her art (470). But the stronger
                  factor is modernity’s lethal power. Thanks to the enormity of deaths in the
                  Napoleonic wars, History has had to take up a grim science of accounting:
                     <quote>“Here am I expected to calculate how may hundred thousands of rational
                     beings cut one another’s throats at Austerlitz, and to take the tale of two
                     hundred and thirteen thousand human bodies and ninety-five thousand horses,
                     that lie stiff, frozen and unburied on the banks of the Berecina—. . .
                     Nay, the human race will be exterminated if this work of destruction goes on
                     much longer.” (471-2)</quote>
                  Barbauld suggests the Malthusian
                  pressures that the on-going wars place not simply upon the future, but also upon
                  the past and the future of the past. Mercury in fact invokes Malthus, “a great
                  philosopher,” in order to placate Clio. For if “twenty or forty thousand men could
                  not be persuaded every now and then to stand and be shot at,” then, by Malthusian
                  “calculation,” “we should all be forced to eat each other” (473). Like Malthus,
                  Clio has her eyes trained on universal scarcity and the vulnerability of the human
                  body, but where he looks forward she looks back; where he fears the force of
                  procreation, she reveals the destructiveness of the battlefield. Modern
                  technologies of warfare take “the human frame, of curious texture,” to “wound. . .
                  lacerate . . . and mutilate [it] with most perverted ingenuity” (472). By this
                  reckoning, History, like futurity, is forced to play a zero-sum game.</p>
                  <p>Not surprisingly, the muse of History must reconfigure her sense of time in the
                  grip of this modern war. In the figure of History’s scroll, “long enough to
                  stretch from earth to heaven” but grown “quite cumbrous,” Barbauld finds a handy way to give space
                  and weight to the past. Yet in the age of print, History must economize: what had
                  been written “all in capitals” and illuminated in gold must be squeezed into
                     “<emph>small pica</emph>” type (470). In this newly economic, measured version
                  of the past, History’s—and war’s—expansion into “all parts of the
                  world” requires conversely a reduction, even miniaturization in print. Immortal
                  Clio insists therefore on regarding humanity’s past according to the temporality
                  of the mortal body: History—at least this modern history confronting
                  her—unfolds in the span of a lifetime. “It takes a life, as mortals reckon
                  lives, to unroll it [her scroll]” (464). History in 1813, in the opening of a new
                  front in North America, in the wake of Napoleon’s costly campaign in Russia,
                  unfailingly “takes a life.” To a certain degree, Clio restates Templeton’s
                  comparison of recent and historically distant fields of battle: the ancient
                  “shades” who talk to her are told they must make room on her rolls for fresher
                  corpses. Rather than offering comparisons and translations, though, the “Dialogue”
                  perversely mirrors a field of battle where there is not room enough for both the
                  warlock’s and the antiquarian’s dead; one army or the other must give way. </p>
                  <p>In her neoclassical “Dialogue” on modern history, Barbauld twists and transforms the
                  emergent concept of a history measured by numbers—the numbers of
                  chronological time, the years and dates so crucial to historicist understanding.
                  For the mythical Clio, the more pressing numbers to be reckoned are statistics
                  taken from the battlefield, the integers of destruction. Though forced to
                  distinguish between the ancient and the modern, to expunge one to make way for the
                  other, Clio nevertheless reminds Mercury—the god of news and
                  wealth—that in the end she measures history not by the abstract markers of
                  moments or periods, nor by conceptual fields, but by the force exerted to curtail
                  the life of one human body. For her, modern global wartime demands this
                  recognition of fatal economies. </p>
                  <p>In Barbauld’s “Dialogue in the
                  Shades” and Scott’s “Dedicatory Epistle” the
                  practice of historicism in wartime is subject to uncanny, untimely forces. The
                  clear lines that would plot the past in a determinable sequence are subject to
                  vectors that pull in several different directions. When the “expansive neutral
                  ground” that organizes Scott’s project of
                  translating between different states finds itself too close to the battlefield, it
                  simultaneously expands into the whole world and all of history <emph>and</emph>
                  contracts into one disastrous moment. By turning to Lucan
                  and Joel, Scott’s Templeton wants to situate
                  various historical practices and hence various cultures in their proper moment,
                  but his efforts are undermined both by the totalizing violence of the battlefield
                  and by its affiliation with prophecy, rather than history. Barbauld, for her part, steps outside of
                  human time to “place” the work of modern history. She, like Lucan, feels war contracting the scope of history, even as it expands
                  the number of the dead: human mortality now governs the work of History. If
                  History is a field, then Barbauld
                  understands it as a field of blood-stained scarcity, measured in the final
                  instance by countless dead bodies. </p>
                  <p> But of course I have strayed onto these fields during our own time of war and
                  have solicited my examples accordingly. Or have they solicited me? I have lost, I
                  fear, the proper mediating distance.</p>

               <p> The essays in this volume insist that irresolvable frictions mark Romanticism in its
               time and in our critical present. They do so by lingering with dubieties that fissure
               Romantic writing about its own historical moment and by insisting on surprising and
               difficult alignments between Romantic historiography and contemporary theory and
               philosophy. In doing so, these essays convey what it means to think about Romanticism
               in our present time. Beginning with Ian Duncan’s reading
               of the problem of man and species in Scott’s later
               fiction and the waning of the Scottish Enlightenment, the collection moves from
               writing committed to a nuanced grasp of the difficulties embedded in the relay
               between difficult histories and texts to writing as complexly committed to
               philosophical readings of Romanticism. Across this array of critical dispositions,
               these essays describe aspects of Romantic writing that render it both difficult and
               difficult to leave behind. </p>
               <p>In her meditation on the proximity or distance with which Romantics write about the
               “field of war,” Mary Favret recognizes a parallel
               impulse in the way contemporary scholars and theorists remove scholarly concepts from
               particular events and especially suffering. Daniel
                  O’Quinn argues for a critical triangulation between the British loss of
               America, its assorted defeats and victories in India and the formal, aesthetic
               contours of poems about trees that evoke, or are made to evoke, national interests.
                  Matthew Rowlinson’s double interrogation of
                  Walter Scott’s anonymity as both a matter of
               authorship and financial credit argues that a Lacanian allegory of Marx’s Capital inhabits the folds of credit and debt in
                  Scott’s financial rise and fall. Colin Jager argues for a return to thinking about Romantic
               consciousness by way of recent cognitive theory concerning emergence, which supposes
               that the mind’s difference from and proximity to body and world can be postulated but
               not fully known. Reading contemporary philosophical writing about disaster and ruin
               beside Wordsworth’s poetry, Jacques Khalip argues that <title level="m">The Ruined
                  Cottage</title> lingers with disaster in ways that urge a non-apocalyptic poetic
               turn toward the ordinary, barely sheltered conditions of living and dying. Considered
               together, these six essays insist on textual remainders of the stubborn frictions
               that mark Romanticism then and now. </p>
               <p> They do so in significant measure by turning away from an earlier, still influential
               critical supposition that thinking about historicism and thinking about theory are
               mutually exclusive operations. In too many conferences and not a few essays, this
               suspicion is sustained by looking past the frictions between things, events, cultures
               and theories that constitute Romanticism’s problematic sense of itself, hoping
               instead to see a Romanticism that does one thing or the other. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                  Leon Chai recapitulates the history of this critical
                  divide in <emph>Romantic Theory: Forms of Reflexivity in the Revolutionary
                     Era,</emph> 264-270. Cynthia Chase presents a
                  brief, nuanced account of the divide in her “Introduction,”
                     <emph>Romanticism,</emph> 1-4, 31-35. Thomas Pfau
                  argues for a philosophically oriented Romanticist criticism in “Reading beyond
                  Redemption: Historicism, Irony, and the Lessons of Romanticism,"<emph>The Lessons
                     of Romanticism</emph>, 1-37 and and in occasional bouts with historicist
                  critics in <emph>Romantic Moods,</emph> 337-39. Essays in <emph>Repossessing the
                     Romantic Past </emph>present the new historicist side of the divide. </note>
               The essays in this volume instead convey how these two aspects of Romanticism are,
               even in opposition, complexly bound to the problems and dubieties they inhabit. </p>
               <p>It is the claim of this introduction and collection that Romanticism is anything but
               schematically divided into round and square, and much more like a field of forces
               bent on fissuring and proliferating itself. This impulse works against the desire for
               a system that neatly bifurcates itself so that historicists might sit at one table
               and theorists at another, preferably in different rooms. I allude here to the
               cultural habits of scholarly conferences, but also to a wider impulse that would
               understand the interrogation of history as traduced by its inner empiricism and those
               of theory as traduced by a love of philosophy and concept that sorts ill with
               thinking about historiography. Both dispositions slight the traffic between history
               and philosophy or theory within Romantic writing; for that reason, they also miss a
               compelling way forward for contemporary writing about Romanticism.</p>
               <p>That way is through, not around, frictions between and within these perspectives.
               Precisely because it deals with material traits and efforts to manage distinctions,
               Romantic biological classification suggests how the friction between specimens,
               species traits and higher taxa kept distinctions in play even as nineteenth-century
               taxonomists sought to order them into a fixed system. In the end, taxonomists could
               not settle on one system to explain all possible relationships among natural kinds
               not so much because the ongoing discovery of biological plentitude outpaced efforts
               to classify them (taxonomists were and still are tireless), but because that
               plenitude could not be mapped adequately by a single systematic. Charles Darwin’s definition of <emph>species</emph> as
               whatever his fellow biologists agreed was a species registers both the problem of
               biological classification and his diplomatic non-solution, inasmuch as many of his
               contemporaries could not agree on what the term <emph>species</emph> meant or even on
               whether it was a viable concept.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

               </note> A century after Linnaeus, the effort to create a fixed system of stable
               species and kingdoms of nature had met its other, a spirit of differentiation that
               could imagine, like James Hutton’s theory of the earth, no prospect of an end. </p>
               <p>As a principle of botanical investigation that goes back to Aristotle and Cesalpino,
               differentiation is the centrifugal engine working inside taxonomic inquiry. Nearly as
               soon as the Linnaean system was more or less accepted in the second half of the
               eighteenth century as standard practice for botanical taxonomy, taxonomists began to
               devise what Antoine de Jussieu and his successors called the “Natural System.” In all
               its incarnations prior to Darwin’s <title level="m">Origin of Species</title>, the Natural System recognized multiple affinities
               among plant characters or traits such that there might be both a primary taxonomic
               home based on one structural similarity and many more affine relationships that might
               well cut across recognized species, families and even genera, as the ascending plant
               orders were then described. </p>
               <p>Although Jussieu and others believed that the Natural System would eventually, when
               complete, record a continuous series of creation, the work of differentiation
               produced more species, subspecies, varieties in one direction and more families and
               genera and orders, even multiple plant kingdoms, in another, and all within the
               domain of what we have called the Romantic view of nature, a phrase that says nothing
               about the complexity of that nature, taking comfort instead in a sentimentalizing
               category that asks little of us and less about how Romantics thought about what
               nature might include. A-P. de Candolle, the Swiss taxonomist who consolidated the
               Natural System, concluded that Nature is not a continuous series but rather that
               there are leaps or gaps in nature that taxonomy cannot bridge. De Candolle’s
               recognition makes taxonomic differentiation a grounding principle instead of an
               unwelcome outsider. In his study of the history of plant systematics in the
               nineteenth century, Peter Stevens includes some of the cognitive maps or schematics
               which taxonomists devised to represent, or try to represent, different and at times
               competing taxonomic relationships. None of them worked. If finding one that worked
               forever were really the only game in town, the history of systematics right up to
               present work in evolutionary and then cladistic analysis would seem pointless. In
               recent decades the kingdoms of nature have divided yet again, to accommodate
               plant-like groups that now appear to be something else and to belong somewhere else,
               in a kingdom of their own that is neither plant nor animal. </p>
               <p> What this history of biological systematics conveys is the logical and conceptual
               necessity for an ongoing friction, admittedly provisional and probably impermanent,
               between local, material evidence and competing schematics for their meaning. Whether
               or not any single systematic will suffice is less important than what each finds and
               tries to gather up into a conceptual frame that is adequate to the array of
               differences it tries to gather together. The work of finding and mapping,
               conceptualizing the relationships among singularities or differences always turns up
               something to be worked at, debated, and by such means kept on the table, not shunted
               off into a corner where it cannot cause trouble, where its difference becomes or is
               claimed to be monstrous. Indeed, the taxonomic inquiry that paid close attention to
               so-called botanical monsters did so because their very difference suggested a
               mechanism or operation otherwise hidden and thus in need of attention. </p>
               <p> The parable suggested by the cascading array of frictions among natural kinds and
               human systematic for thinking about Romanticism is perhaps obvious, but so much the
               better. Attention to the on-going work of differentiation leads to friction, constant
               friction, between objects of inquiry and the structures used to map those objects.
               Competing systematics are all the better because they fight for what should be
               counted or not. The ensuing friction is good for heat and perhaps some light. Even so
               for the friction between those who emphasize Romanticism’s cultural historiography
               and those who emphasize its philosophy, literature and aesthetics. In one sense, this
               divide splits Romantic writing in remarkably artificial ways, choosing to ignore the
               degree to that body of writing persistently worked across these terrains. But in
               another sense, this disciplinary divide unfolds and expands a deeper set of frictions
               within Romanticism, and within our critical understanding of what this term and era
               entail, between the historical and the local and the abstract or philosophical. What
               rightly emerges from these frictions is a sharp reminder that efforts to read
               Romanticism as a smoothly articulated, undifferentiated field or period have often
               and quite rightly found it difficult, even rough going. </p>
               <p> For Jacques Derrida, Paul De
                  Man and Jean Lyotard,
                  <emph>différance</emph> gathers to itself the work of friction by preserving
               notice of the singularity of persons and events that disrupts systematic,
               generalizing projects. For de Man, difference is the work figures do to undo unitary
               reading and meaning. For Derrida, difference
               prompts the philosophical demand to unsettle claims to absolute knowledge. The
               political and institutional force of this project is, as Jean François Lyotard has argued, apparent when

                  Goethe, the individual from

                  Goethe’s <title level="m">Metamorphoses
                  of Plants</title>, dies, what is singular remains so in part because its identity
               is secured by its antithetical yet also implicated relation to community, which Nancy characterizes as the “socially exposed
               particularity” that Marx sought to preserve against the
               “socially imploded generality” that Capitalism uses to put singularity in its place.

               singularity or “one” means necessarily “some ones <emph>and</emph> some others, or
               some ones with other ones.” To claim, as Nancy then
               does, that what mediates between singularity and community is a “transcendent
               curiosity” <note place="foot" resp="editors">Nancy, <title level="m">The Sense of the World</title>, 71 and

               is also a philosophical move that consolidates and categorizes what is singular. </p>
               <p>The task of thinking about Romanticism as an historical moment urges resistance to
               this move. In foregrounding the “irreducible inequality” of difference in the
               sensible world, Gilles Deleuze indicates how the
               resistant logic of historical or cultural difference might derive from the
               phenomenal, event-ridden domain of Romantic history. His remark that “everything
               bathes in its difference” <note place="foot" resp="editors">Deleuze, <title level="m">Difference and
                     Repetition</title>, 222 and 243.</note> conveys what Romantics experienced, a
               world in which friction, not unity or closure, was the work at hand. The rub of
               difference is at work in the global theater of race and variety; in the politics and
               economics of scarcity during a time of war <note place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Favret, “War in the Air,” <title level="j">MLQ,</title> 531-59. </note> ; in debates about whose religion or gender or

               eradicate such differences. </p>

               works against the grain of a Burkean system of inheritance that imagines itself
               governing history and its remains. From this perspective, to provide one example, it
               becomes easier to notice how Walter Scott’s <title level="m">Waverley</title> retrospectively tracks fissures in the 1707 Union of

               formal difficulties specify the enabling rhythm of Romantic writing, a rhythm
               articulated in the midst of a jostling of events and an inclination toward dissent
               that no writer or philosopher of the age could quell. The view of Romanticism
               entailed by framing its event and discourse horizons as marked by difference
               evidently responds to a long-standing debate about what Romanticism is or was.
               Looking back on that debate in the early 1990’s, Mark
                  Parker remarked, “perhaps we have come to a place where an ironic
               counterhistory of Romanticism, one less intent on closure, one more alive to the
               accidents and contingencies of descent, as at once possible and necessary.”<hi rend="sup">

               <p> Although the debate about whether Romanticism exists or whether it is not one but
               many typically concludes by not concluding as critics speak for, against or somewhere
               in the middle of this question, its persistence is instructive. In separate
               assessments, Parker and Thomas Vogler note the stubborn
               resistance that the debate about what Romanticism is (or whether it exists) presents
               to fixed chronologies and conceptual boundaries. They also note the equally stubborn
               critical desire to recognize Romanticism as a viable category and event. From A. O.
               Lovejoy and René Wellek, who began this twentieth-century debate, to critics in the
               near present, Romanticism either names a category that is convenient, perhaps even
               valuable, or it registers the impossibility of such a category and period
               designation. </p>
               <p> As the disputed middle of this long debate, Romanticism names a conceptual and
               historical manifold that repays critical attention less for its sureties that for its
               inner resistance to coherence. As a period or event horizon, it is not defined by a
               single leading indicator like the French Revolution (although this event evidently
               does matter, in manifold directions), <note place="foot" resp="editors">Marshall Brown, “Romanticism and Enlightenment,”

                  requires a longer and broader trajectory. See, for instance, the editors’

               temporalities, different levels of momentum, and different moments of intensity. In
               one direction, which its writers certainly promoted, Romanticism enters a new era,
               one characterized for a time by the prospect of freedom as the projected ground of
               poetic imagination and Romantic prophecy. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Ian Balfour, <title level="m">The Rhetoric of
                     Romantic Prophecy</title>.</note> Reading this era as a “hot chronology”—Claude Lévi-Strauss’s term for those cultures that
               appear at certain moments to develop more quickly than others—James Chandler evokes both to the Romantic sense that
               time and events had speeded up and to the modern critical desire to read Romanticism
               as hurrying toward the future it imagined. <note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">The Savage Mind </title>Lévi-Strauss argues that there exists an “uneven development” among
                  societies such that some exhibit “hot chronologies” while others do not, 259.
                  Although he is wary of the primitive /civilized subplot of Lévi-Strauss’s phrase, in <title level="m">England in 1819 </title>James Chandler uses
                  it to characterize Romantic writers’ sense of the quickened pace of their era,
                  68-69. Reinhart Koselleck emphasized the
                  broad European conviction that the French Revolution introduced an “accelerated
                  tempo which seemed to open up a new and different age” in <title level="m">Futures
                     Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time</title>, 59. </note> Yet Lévi-Strauss’s phrase invokes more than a hint of
               a progressive, evolutionary bias in which a neo-Hegelian march of world and spirit moves
               forward, away from the “cold” chronology of primitive cultures and “the savage mind.”
               Such a view ignores too easily the extent to which Romanticism’s global interests
               permeated other cultures and sustained a retrograde preference for slavery for some,
               even in the midst of imagining freedom for all. That this was so Romantics were well
               aware. Centrifugal pressures that challenged the myth of a consolidated Britain
               during the era reveal how fragile and how fractured the era also looked to those who
               lived it. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Tom

               <p> As a category, a moment, and a matrix of ideas and contentions, Romanticism suggests
               how we might think about periodization without putting aside the need to historicize
               in precisely the differential manner conveyed by the echo of Fredric Jameson’s dictum “always historicize.”<hi rend="sup">

                  </hi> As a culture and discourse that stretch across these extremes, Romanticism may
               well be what it looks like—an era under construction and inhabited by transient
               figures who cannot locate themselves at home or even in those putatively houseless
               woods near Tintern Abbey. In this Romanticism, singularity and contingency belong to
               the concept they animate and yet, as Hegel and Derrida differently
               acknowledged, <note place="foot" resp="editors">Rodolphe Gasché, <title level="m">Inventions of Difference,</title>
                  171-98.</note> these traits also make the concept, here Romanticism, tremble from
               within. This, rather than a posited conceptual stability, is the event horizon of
               Romantic history and philosophy. Even Hegel, who argued for a Romantic moment and spirit that could resolve
               earlier historical and philosophical shortcomings, found himself confronting a time
               whose “instability, …tearing, [and] passage,” as Jean-Luc
                  Nancy puts it, is the strange fundament of history. <note place="end" n="19">Nancy, <title level="m">Hegel</title>, 27. </note>

               <p> If Romanticism is marked by frictions among competing definitions all the way down,
               as A. O. Lovejoy’s frustrated account of the
               discrimination of Romanticisms implied, those frictions, along with those among
               readers and critics, need to be on the table. Romantic writing and culture is shot
               through with local and material, literary and cultural frictions that anticipate its
               modern critical identity, pungently declared in Jacques
                  Rancière’s study of what he calls “<emph>mésentente</emph>,” usually
               translated as “disagreement,” but closer in spirit to an idea of fundamental discord,
               arising from different grounds and premises. Rancière argues that to think about justice and the aesthetics of
               politics, we must first grant the irreconciliability of certain arguments, no matter
               how much we may hope or image their congruence. Under the sign of
                  <emph>mésentente</emph>, Romanticism might be characterized as an historical
               moment when singularity, chance, and contingency become the work of the day. This
               claim is not a staging ground for an easy settling into commonality; it argues
               instead for recognizing that friction is always about several, discordant
               possibilities. The cultural and political frictions that Anna
                  Tsing describes among inhabitants, national programs and global capitalism
               in modern Indonesia takes another shape in the Romantic era, when revolution, war,
               and imperial advance prompted occasions for thinking about as well as trying to
               ignore fundamental disputes. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Jacques Rancière, <title level="m">La Mésentente:

                  </note> Kept in play instead of pushed off to the side, friction and irresolvable
               disagreement remind us that relationships among singularities or differences always
               turn up something to be worked at, debated, and by such means kept on the table, not
               shunted off into a corner where it cannot cause trouble, or dismissed as something
               monstrous and thus categorically inadmissable. </p>
               <p>Viewed this way, Romanticism specifies competing refractions of time and event within
               or inside its pulsating chronology(ies). What counts as Romanticism is not who gets
               there first or last, or even who or what goes in reverse or forward, but the way that
               its differences jostle for attention. That said, the frictions that mark out the
               space of Romanticism suggest that its nature or definition has more flow than edge.
               This apparent weakness offers a surprising advantage: it transforms a persistent
               feature of Romanticism—its holding together of extremes like those Blake imagines as contraries, or extremes of scale in
               Romantic visual representation, or the polarities that separate Burke’s political assumptions from Paine’s—into tensile strength. Paradoxically,
               Romanticism becomes more flexible and commanding as a category to the degree that it
               does not expend itself in an effort to seal its borders. The essays in this volume
               insist on what this Romanticism looks like, in its time and in our critical moment. </p>
               <p> In the first essay Ian Duncan addresses the
               instabilities of Romantic and Enlightenment classifications of the species of man in
               a reading of Scott’s penultimate novel, <title level="m">Count Robert of Paris</title>, as a work that thoroughly overturns
               Romanticism’s sense of its futurity as well as its past. Whereas <title level="m">Waverley</title>, the first of the Waverley novels, could be read to argue for
               the shared national histories of Scotland and England, an outcome shadowed but not
               undone by its internal ironies, not the least of them concerning the heroic status of
               its reckless English hero, <title level="m">Count Robert</title> raises many more
               questions than <title level="m">Waverley</title> had put in abeyance, beginning with
               “man,” the biological category the later novel leaves in shreds, even as it undoes
               most of the traits that Scott is said to have
               established for the historical novel. Reaching back to a time and a place
               (Constantinople at the close of the eleventh century) that are at once too far off
               from Scotland and so Byzantine in style and manner that critics have suggested Scott was slipping even as he wrote the novel that he
               (mistakenly) believed would be his last, <title level="m">Count Robert</title>
               replies, and puts an end to the great project of the Scottish Enlightenment, the
               science of man. A novel uncertain of its own genre or species, and rife with species
               that put the solidity and superiority of that of “man” in question, <title level="m">Count Robert</title> looks backwards in ways that challenge Romantic hopes for
               the future. This eastern metropolis presents a hodgepodge of species and nations
               that make different claims on the idea of man, none more so that the Ourang-Utan
               Silvan, who speaks a dialect all its own and understands Anglo-Saxon. In the bloated
               world space and anarchically polygenetic array of peoples and species of Scott’s fictionalized Constantinople, Romantic hopes for
               historical progress stumble on the limitations of their own view of racial and
               species difference. As the logic of the historical novel shifts in Scott’s most phantasmagoric fiction, knights imagine
               retrograde motions that bizarrely undo the forward momentum of Crusade campaigns.
                  Duncan’s account of the worlds Scott evokes in <title level="m">Count Robert</title>
               insists on instabilities within the historiographic projections of the Scottish
               Enlightenment that turn essentially on problems with the category of man signaled by
               Lord Kames’s notice of the species of men and pursued by Lamarck. </p>
               <p>
               Mary Favret‘s essay takes up the phrases “field of
               history” and “field of battle” to consider the metaphoric slide from event and
               persons to concept and figure that each phrase imagines or seeks. Whereas Scottish
               Enlightenment historiography had supposed that writing about war required the distant
               perspective conveyed by understanding and describing battles as scenes on the field
               of history, the relative safety of such metaphors seemed by the end of the eighteenth
               century, a time of near constant warfare for England and its allies, as Favret puts it, little more than “wishful thinking” or
               worse, insofar as its call for dispassionate observation suggested that blood and
               suffering seen at close range were not the stuff of which history is made. Favret uses this friction between distance and metaphors
               that preserve that distance and what war looks like up close to query contemporary
               theory and criticism, beginning with Michel Foucault’s argument that history and
               historiography are war. For although Foucault insists that these terms should not
               become just figures, they nonetheless do as Foucault’s use of them slides toward
               intellection, away from the experience of war or, for that matter, of history.
               Recognizing the importance of Reinhardt
                  Koselleck’s notice of the incompatibility between history at the micro
               level—that is all that happens in fine grain detail or however much of it we can
               capture—and the macro level—which tells grander, concept driven stories about fields
               of history—Favret argues that thinking about
               Romanticism historiographically frequently risks or assumes the status of a
               macrohistory by taking up the dispassionate and distant vantage point on “details”
               for which theory speaks. Anna L. Barbauld,
                  Favret observes, reverses this tendency in “Dialogue
               in the Shades,” charging History with reckoning and limiting what happens to the
               mortal body. Barbauld’s refusal of dispassionate distance and the kind of history
               writing that occurs at a distance specifies an enduring friction within Romantic
               historiography and contemporary criticism between concept and event, human lives and
               grand designs. </p>

               Daniel O’Quinn assesses the figural connection
               between distinct but uncomfortably intertwined British war zones: the Mysore state of
               India in the decades when the East India Company’s military forces repeatedly battled
               Tipu Sultan for control of lower India and North America, where British military
               forces spectacularly failed to manage the colonies. O’Quinn argues that half a globe away from each other, America and Asia
               constitute a cultural and historical imaginary for the British, who use triumphs in
               one arena to forget defeats in the other. This curious triangulation moves in this
               essay by way of figure and specifically figures of trees, Cowper’s destroyed British
               oak versus the Indian Banyan tree which William Hodges reimagines in <title level="m">Travels in India</title> not as the symbol of Indian monstrous proliferation, but
               as one protected by the British army, whose troops are sheltered there and shelter
               others. The difference between the way Hodges wishes to read the banyan and earlier
               readings that identified its proliferation of trunks with a suspect sexuality
               constitute, argues O’Quinn, a crisis in
               representation. For although Hodges’s banyan redirects this earlier iconography to
               claim the banyan as a proleptic figure for the spread of Company rule well before the
               East India Company had fully consolidated its power in the region, that argument also
               exposes the “wishful thinking” or self-delusion that C. A. Bayly has identified as a
               crucial element of British governance prior to and during the imposition of the
               Permanent Settlement. O’Quinn reads both Cowper’s
               Oak and Hodges’s Banyan as figures whose ironies register the give and take (one
               battle won here, another lost there) of British nationalist identity and imperial
               desire. This “global historic dynamic” requires reading across both the
               geographic and cultural terrains each figures. Romantic historiography by way of
               figure here makes visible and linked arguments that might otherwise appear to be
               isolated claims about America or India under British eyes. Whereas both Favret and O’Quinn are
               concerned with what figures do, O’Quinn contends
               that some figures reveal a larger cultural imaginary than one might otherwise
               glimpse. </p>
               <p>Matthew Rowlinson’s argument about Scott’s fiction, anonymity and capital takes up an
               intriguing middle ground in the collection. Rowlinson offers on an astute and detailed understanding of how Scott relied on Scots systems of credit and finance that
               required the anonymity of authorship that he famously insisted on and played with,
               like money in the bank. Rowlinson reads the
               uncertainty about what is and what is not money in Scott’s <title level="m">Antiquary</title> as one instance of a problem of
               textual boundary that recurs in the Waverley novels, with their serial form,
               indistinguishable protagonists, and the extensive textual periphery of introductions,
               prefaces, notes and other apparatus. By such turns, Scott’s fictional voices create the simulacrum of capital in ways that
               anticipate the role of Capital in Marx’s analysis as a
               Lacanian marker for the real in a symbolic order. Yet the point of Rowlinson’s essay is not simply that Scott anticipates Marx, but
               rather that its riveting historiographic evidence discloses a deeply economic
               rationale for Scott’s mystic and permutable anonymity
               and, further, that this highly fictive circulation of identities conveys the
               allegorical character of Marx’s Capital and the author
               “Walter Scott” among his various fictive voices, frequently leaked identities. Moving
               between Scott’s publishing history, Scottish finance,
                  Marx, Lacan, and back, Rowlinson tracks the work of allegory and credit such that the distinction
               between historiography and theory remains, but their conjoined work becomes more
               telling.</p>

               Colin Jager takes up the question of Romantic
               consciousness, an inquiry that recent work on Romanticism has either put aside or
               taken up in ways that he contends are less productive than they might be. Much of the
               essay considers developments in cognitive theory that literary scholars of
               Romanticism have only partly begun to read. He identifies two recent approaches to
               consciousness: neurological arguments which regard mind as a synonym for the brain
               and emergence theory, which has a longer track record (stretching back to the
               nineteenth century) but does not claim to answer the “hard question” of cognition,
               how mind is related to world or more precisely how we can physically know that the
               mind has consciousness. Using examples that recur in recent accounts of emergence and
               cognition, Jager notes that although neither bees nor
               ants possess consciousness, a bee-hive or an ant colony could be said to demonstrate
               the kinds of collective and individual organization we might understand as necessary
               activities from which consciousness would emerge. Lower-level self-organizing and
               self-modifying systems such as Goethe
               found in plant development and many other Romantic writers found in different animals
               and insects would constitute, then, physical evidence of activities from which
               consciousness might emerge. What is arresting about this argument, Jager emphasizes, is its tentativeness, its capacity to
               rest, as Keats urged, in doubt and uncertainty. This attitude, Jager suggests, recalls too Wordsworth’s
               “natural piety,” a phrase Anne-Lise François uses to imagine a Romantic environmentalist ethic
               poised to stand back and think about what might emerge in us that is, however
               indistinctly or problematically, from nature.<note place="foot" resp="editors">François, "’O Happy Living Things’:
                  Frankenfoods and the Bounds of Wordsworthian
                  Natural Piety,” 42-70.</note>
               Jager argues via emergence theory for a more tentative
               theoretical disposition that is less commanding than the habits of mind Favret questions.</p>
               <p>
               Jacques Khalip’s concluding essay argues for a
               dwelling with ruin and disaster that begins by asking this question about the story
               of Margaret and Armytage as narrator in Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Ruined Cottage</title>: how can poetry and
               reading dwell with the non-normative effects unleashed by disaster to discover forms
               of non-triumphal, wasted life? Khalip addresses this
               question via Martin Heidegger’s shadowed notion of being as persisting in ruin, Rem
               Koolhaas’s vision of the accumulated wreckage of modern life, Maurice Blanchot’s
               insistence that disaster cannot be forgotten but must be lived with, and the strange
               hospitality that Derrida urges for our relation to
               the nonhuman, the vegetable, and the dead. With these arguments engaged, Khalip returns to the “harassed unrest” of Wordsworth’s Margaret. Working from a very
               different point of departure, shadowed as much by the Holocaust as it is by Romantic
               wartime, Khalip finds very different ground to
               return readers, as do Favret and Duncan, to a Romantic poetics that cannot turn from suffering, the wasting
               of human life, the instability of bodies and species in the kingdoms of nature. Khalip insists on unsatisfied hermeneutic economy that
               theorizing at times seeks to offer: in exchange for this suffering, here is a theory
               of war or peace that will make up the difference. The elegy of the <title level="m">Ruined Cottage</title>, as Khalip puts it,
               “disasters the payments ordinarily recouped by acts of mourning.” It is an open
               question, I think, and was for Wordsworth as
               well, whether elegy can do even this much without denying loss. </p>
               <p>
               Khalip’s unremitting theoretical exploration of what
               doesn’t tidy up, what doesn’t find an easy settlement in Romantic writing shares with
               other authors in this collection a reading of Romanticism that lingers with its
               instabilities and doubts. Each of these essays takes up its own position along a
               continuum in which historiographic and theoretical interests lie, unevenly
               distributed, with several opportunities for friction between critical practices. None
               is assimilable in argument or method to the others. All six essays nonetheless insist
               on reading Romanticism for its frictions.</p>

                  knowing, without appropriating any knowledge. Or again, is it the advent of what
                  does not happen, of what would come without arriving, outside being, and as though

               </epigraph>
               <p>At first glance, my remarks in this essay improvise on Adorno and Horkheimer’s
               pronouncement at the beginning of <title level="m">Dialectic of the
                  Enlightenment</title> that “Enlightenment, in the widest sense of progressive
               thought, has always aimed at liberating men from fear and installing them as masters.
               Yet the fully enlightened earth radiates disaster triumphant” (3). Their narrative of
               the perilous debris of secularized knowledge—the “disenchantment of the
               world”—negatively offers up the glimmer of waste for critical speculation. Indeed,
               the <title level="m">Dialectic</title>’s critique of progressivism shores up remnants
               of various projects that lie in the wake of thought’s destruction and division,
               leaving readers in the headlights of the very forms of political, social, and
               cultural subjugation they were meant to overcome: “the Enlightenment has extinguished
               any trace of its own self-consciousness. The only kind of thinking that is
               sufficiently hard to shatter myths is ultimately self-destructive” (4). </p>
               <p> In what follows, however, I do not propose a therapeutic Romantic response to the
                     <title level="m">Dialectic</title>’s claims; rather, I invert Adorno and
                  Horkheimer in order to explore how the aesthetic, cognitive, and ethical
                  vocabularies of ruination and disaster (what Adorno will himself refer to as
                  “damaged life”) provide ways for <emph>dwelling with </emph>the non-normative and
                  transformative effects unleashed <emph>by</emph> disaster—that is to say, how
                  palpable strains of apocalypticism in certain Romantic texts are denatured or
                  flattened out to the point where “disaster triumphant” isn’t merely synonymous wth
                  the denigration of thought, but rather suggests new conditions of intelligibility
                  and complex forms of non-triumphal, wasted life. “I see around me here/Things
                  which you cannot see: we die, my Friend,/Nor we alone, but that which each man
                  loved/And prized in his peculiar nook of earth/Dies with him, or is changed.”
                     (<title level="m">Ruined</title> 67-71).
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">All references to the poem are to this
                        edition and to the MS.D version, unless otherwise noted. </note>
                   In <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title>, Armytage hews an imaginary
                  path through disaster: he perceives the intangible things of his littered
                  environment as figures of reasoning that do not cease to generate unnatural
                  visualizations and understandings. Here, ruins are less triumphalist memorials
                  than wasted terrains that deviate from the normative circulations of sentimental
                  value which the poem has traditionally been thought to sustain at a premium. In an
                  article to which I will return, the architectural theorist Rem Koolhaas has
                  imagined such scorched scenes as “Junkspace”—aesthetically residual stuff, the
                  “apotheosis, or meltdown” of modernization’s enlightened programs of construction:
                  “If space-junk is the human debris that litters the universe, Junk-Space is the
                  residue mankind leaves on the planet” (175). This postmodern proliferation of
                  immanent spaces, which Koolhaas diagnoses as one of the designs of late
                  capitalism, homogenizes and conglomerates things that are readily discarded or
                  treated as underway to being remaindered: “Continuity is the essence of Junkspace;
                  it exploits any invention that enables expansion, deploys the infrastructure of
                  seamlessness: escalator, air-conditioning, sprinkler, fire shutter, hot-air
                  curtain. . .” (175). Risking anachronism, this architectural “stuff” leaks out of
                     <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title>’s own continuities of accumulation
                  and regress, progress and memorialization, which are treated as leftover and
                  exposed to exploitation. The poem begs its ruins to be read differently
                     <emph>as</emph> junk, as “oblivious” spaces of conditioned freedom and
                  “collision” where to look upon disaster is to see and meditate on the deviant
                  mutability of persons and things. Part of the value of identifying such inhumanism
                  and understanding why it countermands the nostalgia, melancholy, and frustration
                  ordinarily associated with modernity’s angst depends on how we perceive the
                  disaster that the poem proposes; after all, these things are not simply ghostly
                  revenants but half-material entities on their way to death. Like Margaret, like
                  the broken objects around the cottage, and finally, like Armytage and the
                  narrator, all things break down in the poem and are rehydrated by its muted lines
                  of sympathy. And yet, if Romanticism has often been read as synonymous with
                  discourses of humanism, personhood, and community, how should we read Wordsworth’s
                  insistence that we must attend to the waste, to things in their various states of
                  destruction? And what would it mean to think of persons as things themselves? The
                  trancelike inhumanism of the spear-grass vision that concludes the poem evokes a
                  disastrous reticence that suffuses Wordsworth’s thought, and in this essay, I want
                  to work toward a ruined cottage as the place where Wordsworth explores the
                  hospitality of dwelling in the rubble of disaster—in other words, disaster
                     <emph>not</emph> as the pessimistic obliteration of enlightenment promise, but
                  rather as a bleak and elegant reimagination of sociality without a future. </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Harassed Unrest</head>
                  <p>In “Building Dwelling Thinking,” Heidegger states that: ‘“Mortals dwell in that
                  they receive the sky as sky. They leave to the sun and the moon their journey, to
                  the stars their courses, to the seasons their blessing and their inclemency; they
                  do not turn night into day nor day into a harassed unrest” (150). What
                     <emph>is</emph> harassed unrest? Is it a state lacking in peace, an imposed
                  disruption of everyday life, or the place of disaster? When Wordsworth exclaims in
                     <title level="m">Home at Grasmere</title> that “yon ethereal vault/And this
                  deep Vale” will give us the sense of finding ourselves as “The Inmates not
                  unworthy of their home/The Dwellers of their Dwelling” (<title level="m">Poems</title> 642-648), is he referring to a way of dwelling in
                     <emph>un</emph>harassed rest? (We might also recall, for example, Wordsworth’s
                  wish in “Tintern Abbey” that Dorothy’s mind “shall be a mansion for all lovely
                  forms,/Thy memory be as a dwelling-place/For all sweet sounds and
                     harmonies”[<title level="m">Poems</title> 140-142]). For the author of <title level="m">Home at Grasmere</title>, how to live or, more importantly, how to
                  dwell essentially conveys the insight of pastoral <emph>otium</emph>: that “being”
                  is about how one occupies or remains, stops or tarries as a figure in a space that
                  neither precedes nor emerges out of one’s control. “Dwelling” sounds like a
                  parrying move of sorts against the “multitude of causes unknown” blunting everyday
                  life—England’s military-industrial proliferation, war, famine, poverty, amongst
                  other elemental matters of late eighteenth-century European life (Wordsworth,
                     <title level="m">Literary</title> 21). In <title level="m">Home at
                     Grasmere</title>, Wordsworthian dwelling emerges as a defensive habitat—the
                  ruling figure of contained, domesticated housing or sheltering where to live is to
                  coincide (to prove “not unworthy”) with place and purpose. Finding a home marks a
                  singular attempt on the poet’s part to avoid disasters that would demolish
                  dwelling entirely. </p>
                  <p>Heidegger etymologically traces <emph>dwelling</emph> to mean “to stay in a
                  place…to be at peace, to be brought to peace, to remain at peace…preserved from
                  harm and danger, preserved from something, safeguarded. To free really means to
                  spare” (149), and his gloss captures the wistful ambivalence within Wordsworth’s
                  thought which shuttles between containment and anxious openness at all costs: to
                  dwell means to reprieve the imagination from the very stimulations that seek to
                  exploit it—to grant or relinquish a spot to its state of rest, ostensibly without
                  any design of its own. Dwelling, then, is less about home than it is (as Heidegger
                  states) about a thinking and building, a securing of ontological place by allowing
                  it to remain unoccupied or unused. </p>

                  <p>In this passage from <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, the imagination does
                  indeed “make abode” as it exchanges its power over and against reason, but it is
                  less concerned with housing authorial power than with deflecting an infinitude
                  which lies “only there” in the most minimal sense of being a space out of reach,
                  rather than an inaccessibility that gestures to a transcendental beyond. The
                  ambiguities in Heidegger’s thoughts, like Wordsworth’s, turn on the question of
                  how and why dwelling must be “brought to peace”: that is to say, is peace an
                  original condition of place—the <emph>placing</emph> of place—that must be
                  reestablished through a violence that is inextricable from its accomplishment? Or
                  is it a horizon-event left to be discovered through “building” which spares and
                  preserves a spot of rest? Insofar as “securing” is also a “building” for
                  Heidegger, dwelling is a motile gathering of place, a recycling act in view of
                  what he calls the fourfold (earth, sky, gods, mortals). All four of these
                  reciprocally coalesce in dwelling, and nothing is misplaced. “Dwelling preserves
                  the fourfold by bringing the presencing of the fourfold into things. But things
                  themselves secure the fourfold <emph>only when</emph> they themselves
                     <emph>as</emph> things are let be in their presencing” (151). Fretful dwelling
                  is thus <emph>undwelling</emph>—it means a crisis with presencing the fourfold,
                  with its arrangement—an incapacity to let things be. For Heidegger, the “real
                  plight of dwelling lies in this, that mortals search anew for the nature of
                  dwelling, that they <emph>must ever learn to dwell.</emph> What if man’s
                  homelessness consisted in this, that man still does not even think of the
                     <emph>real</emph> plight of dwelling as <emph>the</emph> plight?” (161)
                  Heidegger’s post-war reflections on dwelling and world-homelessness might be
                  thought of as reparative attempts at living: they generate or <emph>build</emph>
                  forms of life that might dwell without coercion and harassment, not by changing
                  what the world is, but by experiencing its openness as a condition of thinking
                  about it otherwise. The difference for Wordsworth, however, in a poem like <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> and <emph>not</emph>
                     <title level="m">Home at Grasmere</title>, is that in the former text he
                  specifically dwells in the disastering of the fourfold. Wordsworth thinks about
                  how dwelling in the ruins of unrest brings changes in sociality that are rendered
                  unreal in a landscape dominated by scarcity.</p>
                  <p>How to dwell then in disaster? The absence of a precise definition (whether
                  scientific, medical, social, aesthetic) imposes limits and demands a recalibration
                  of its meanings. According to the <emph>Center for Research on the Epidemiology of
                     Disaster </emph>(<emph>CRED</emph>), disaster “is a situation or event which
                  overwhelms local capacity, necessitating a request to a national or international
                  level for external assistance.” The <title level="m">OED</title>’s
                  definition—“Anything that befalls of ruinous or distressing nature; a sudden or
                  great misfortune, mishap, or misadventure; a calamity”—reflects the World Health
                  Organization’s emphasis on “extraordinary response from outside.” Disaster thus differs from other variants like crisis, emergency, or
                  catastrophe by virtue of a system of scale and disproportionate intensity: the
                  DEEP Center, for example, emphasizes an “imbalance between the demands of the
                  disaster event and the capacities of the affected community to respond.” Disaster is a relational description of an excess of
                  potentiality and the vulnerabilities produced by and within an environment
                  rendered non-holistic. It forces bodies and objects to collide; rather than evoke
                  a verticalizing sense of obligation and suspension by that which is “evermore
                  about to be,” it intimates that any marked awareness of an alteration of events is
                  at base perspectival—a change in position that outdoes the capacity to properly
                  define and respond to it. As Marie-Hélène Huet reminds us of the etymology of the
                  word, <emph>désastre</emph> (from the stars) or <emph>disastro</emph> also signals
                  a particular displacement or dislocation vis-à-vis the sky—a betrayal or
                  disownment by the cosmos: “However, the word ‘disaster’ has not always designated
                  a catastrophic event. Initially it was not a noun by a past participle. In other
                  words, there was no disaster per se, ony the experience of disaster—one was
                  ‘disastered’…In disaster, the very space humans occupy in relation to the stars is
                  destabilized; they are uprooted from their place in the cosmos and cast adrift”
                  (18, 19). As a spatial coincidence of hazard <emph>with</emph> vulnerability,
                  disaster provokes reflections on the possibilities of living under and
                     <emph>through</emph> conditions undesirable—a reshifting of the hierarchization
                  of knowledge in view of a change in placement. It is, in other words, a radical
                  change in perspectives on dwelling. Trauma theory, for example, treats disaster as
                  a kind of specialized knowledge of the modern habitus—something that is understood
                  by its unknownness, or the mind’s hospitality to formations it cannot anticipate
                  in advance.

                   And new historicist criticism of a certain traumatic variety has taught us
                  to uncover these disasters, whether real or imagined, as in some way doubly dismal
                  and displaced: they are hidden by forms of literary obscuration that blunt the
                  “historical” underscorings of place. What these approaches share, however, is an
                  attentiveness to the uncovering of referentiality as a material revelation of the
                  states of life, and they equally treat disaster’s critical magnitude as the payoff
                  for an enrichment of knowing in the face of loss: in other words, what resonates
                  in some of these accounts is the recovery of unwanted knowledge as generative and
                  non-privative. If we accept this, we might risk precluding narratives of
                  non-development that disaster evokes in non-differential terms. For Maurice
                  Blanchot, for example, disaster brings forms of perceptual awareness that cannot
                  be easily shared or drawn into acceptable use because they shortcircuit desires to
                  dwell with <emph>oneself</emph>: <quote>The question concerning the disaster is a
                     part of the disaster: it is not an interrogation, but a prayer, an entreaty, a
                     call for help. The disaster appeals to the disaster that the idea of salvation,
                     of redemption might not yet be affirmed, and might, drifting debris, sustain
                     fear. The disaster: inopportune. (13) </quote> The question of the disaster is
                  implicitly about dwelling—as a non-reciprocal appeal, it reflects on how to live
                  with unrest while refusing to consent to outside response. For Blanchot, the
                  ability to think is synonymous with a capacity to <emph>not</emph> exclude
                  difficulty—to forestall the expectation of what is “evermore about to be,” or what
                  is cognitively expected of the unknown when it is construed as inevitable. On the
                  one hand, disaster appears to read like a structure of desire (like love, risk,
                  mourning), but even more for Blanchot, the disaster figures for the
                  non-affirmation of hope, a plea that can never be attested to nor secured. It is a
                  state of displacement, of non-affective dwelling that fails to imitate a
                  relational stance toward salvation or redemption because neither can be properly
                  anticipated. To believe in them is to erroneously seize upon each as structures of
                  promised opportunity. <quote>The disaster ruins everything, all the while leaving
                     everything intact. It does not touch anyone in particular; ‘I’ am not
                     threatened by it, but spared, left aside. It is in this way that I am
                     threatened; it is in this way that the disaster threatens in me that which is
                     exterior to me—an other than I who passively become other. There is no reaching
                     the disaster…To think the disaster (if this is possible, and it is not possible
                     inasmuch as we suspect that the disaster is thought) is to have no longer any
                     future in which to think it. (1)</quote> A number of thoughts emerge in this
                  tightly-knit fragment: how does disaster “ruin everything” while changing nothing
                  at the same time? And how can one speak of the disaster if it touches no one “in
                  particular”? Blanchot’s fragmentary descriptions undo the privileging aspects of
                  reference: to consider disaster as both preserving and destroying (to echo
                  Shelley’s west wind) is to denature any demonstrative sense of its meaning. It
                  intimates that progressive transformation is evanescent or slight or, moreover,
                  that disaster is an inertia, something passively imponderable. Disaster is
                  posthumous: it “neither is, nor is it not”

                   an event over which a <emph>present</emph> judgment can be rendered because
                  the temporality of its occurrence is always belated. Since one cannot know “what
                  comes to pass,” disaster attenuates revelation to the point of translating
                  knowledge of <emph>an </emph>experience into knowledge of the
                     <emph>afterlife</emph> of that experience. The difference between stasis and
                  change, human and non-human, is thus neutralized by an ethics of reading that
                  erases the experience of thinking of such difference as something felt to be
                  discovered <emph>within</emph> the self, something made recognizable by the
                  temporalization of a narrative that distributes events and their perception as
                  seemingly successive and accountable. To be left untouched or to dwell
                     <emph>as</emph> untouched means to go without registering the slightest kind of
                  acknowledgment, the unaffective or non-traumatic impression that occurs by virtue
                  of the fact that there is <emph>no one there to be touched by it in the first
                     place</emph>. A “bond/Of brotherhood is broken” when a “human hand” does not
                  touch the stillness it had earlier sought to disturb. The British geographer Nigel
                  Clark has argued that the very desire to define disaster as “an event that makes a
                  difference” is to reduce it to historical or social determinants, and thus do
                  conceptual damage to the virtual materializations it unleashes: “Is it really
                  ‘difference’ if we conceive of the disaster as a making manifest of
                  vulnerabilities that could and should have been visible prior to the event; if the
                  disaster serves primarily to reveal, re-inscribe and retrench pre-existing
                  hierarchies and structures? And for whom is it a disaster, if in the very event of
                  disrupting and unravelling a spatial or geographic order, it turns out to
                  authorise the discourse that speaks of disruption and unravelling of spatial and
                  geographic orders?” (1132-1133.) Difference can mark too easily an emerging
                  pattern of articulation, of revelation and necessary sequence—it compels a
                  relentless sameness, a rewinding of time to maintain repetition and inertia. By
                  contrast, disaster is an unwilled, unseeable, and <emph>indifferent</emph>
                  eventfulness, a “dwelling-with” so deeply ruined that its non-apparency marks a
                  resistance to its claims. Although Blanchot’s cryptic descriptions mystify the
                  term to the point of rendering it uninterpretable, it is important to recall how
                  the question <emph>of</emph> disaster is always an entreaty to speak well of it.
                  “Everything is the disaster” is an injunction to dwell with and not look away from
                  oneself, and others, in ruin.</p>
                  <p>When Wordsworth speaks of the “fretful dwellings of mankind” at the beginning of
                  the <title level="m">Two-Part Prelude</title>, he does so by way of what Timothy
                  Morton has called an “ambient poetics”: a surrounding, reverberating environment
                  of co-existence, rather than a marker or mere spot of time (Morton 22). Both the
                  1805 and 1850 <title level="m">Prelude</title> repeat this passage with a
                  teleological inflection that marks out the eventual home of Wordsworth’s poetic
                  ambition. But instead of further amplifying these gladdening descriptions, I want
                  to suggest a counter-Wordsworthian reading that turns especially on the withdrawal
                  of personal will in favor of passive acceptance and receipt of unassumed
                  itineraries: <quote>

                     </quote> In this passage, which was not reproduced in the subsequent 1805
                  and 1850 versions of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, Wordsworth speaks of
                  “distresses and disasters” as causal breaks, events that are neither anticipated
                  by nor fulfill the experiences that precede them. Wordsworth’s disaster is closer
                  to Deleuze’s theory of the event, for whom the event is not anything in particular
                  but rather a virtualization of material possibilities that are always occurring:
                  “The event is not the state of affairs. It is actualized in a state of affairs, in
                  a body, in a lived, but it has a shadowy and secret part that is continually
                  subtracted from or added to its actualization: in contrast with the state of
                  affairs, it neither begins nor ends but has gained or kept the infinite movement
                  to which it gives consistency” (<title level="m">What is Philosophy</title> 156).
                  The Deleuzian event is a disastrous irruption that is not to be confused with the
                  actual occurrence precipitated by the event itself. It is always belatedly
                  captured by the literary which doesn’t represent it but rather
                     <emph>expresses</emph> it, not symptomatically but almost metabolically
                  “counter-effectuating” the event (159). In this sense, Wordsworth’s distresses and
                  disasters effect a non-pathological counter-effectuation: they permit a moment of
                  freedom, an allusion to a virtuality of experience that won’t reduce the meaning
                  of the disaster to the facticity of life. The “images to which in following
                  years/Far other feelings were attached” certainly conjure a Humean reading of the
                  image as a mechanism between sense and mind to which feeling incrementally
                  attaches and in turn embellishes thought. But what Wordsworth also seems to
                  suggest is that the images of “Distresses and disasters, tragic facts/Of rural
                  history” which merge into “independent life” subsequently outlive, metaphorically,
                  the real casualties out of which they come, not as naturalized copies or
                     <emph>eidolons</emph> that rival reality, but which exist apart as simulacra
                  requiring a violent dissemination in order to be reborn again. Rather than see
                  such images as redemptive breakaways from disaster, Wordsworth points here to the
                  mind <emph>not</emph> working to therapeutically overcome disaster (recuperating
                  itself outside of these disasters and metastisizing out of it); rather, it is
                  passively fascinated by the images’ endurance, “like archetypes,” in spite of the
                  mind’s own individuation. If the disaster does signal a difference in the speaker,
                  it is one which emerges with insignificant detail: “that what we feel of sorrow
                  and despair/From ruin and from change, and all the grief/The passing shews of
                  being leave behind,/Appeared an ideal dream that could not live/Where meditation
                  was” (520-524); But at the same time, disaster also brings to awareness a life
                  that somehow dwells under conditions that leave it to compose or decompose itself
                  anew. If dwelling, for Heidegger, is an overcoming of “harassed unrest” that opens
                  one up to and gathers the fourfold, Wordsworth’s “disasters” point to a kind of
                  life whose unrest <emph>is</emph> unharassed, non-coercive, and non-apocalyptic.
                  It scatters the fourfold. </p>

                  <p>What if we were to conceive of the disasters of the past as pulverizing our
                  standard forms of attachment? Because disasters are silently happening all around
                  us, what would it mean to insist that our response should not be one of sudden
                  regrouping, but of welcoming the unwanted changes that a form of disastrous
                  hospitality commits on our moral exchanges, undoing our models of personhood, and
                  transforming us into debris, waste, and ruin? Derrida writes after Kant that
                  hospitality is a right or duty rather than an affective form of philanthropy
                  because it is an obligation that challenges the seeming “naturalness” of our
                  sentimental attachments: “it already broaches an important question, that of the
                  anthropological dimension of hospitality or the right to hospitality: what can be
                  said of, indeed can one speak of, hospitality toward the non-human, the divine,
                  for example, or the animal or vegetable; does one owe hospitality, and is that the
                  right word when it is a question of welcoming-–or being made welcome by-–the other
                  or the stranger as god, animal or plant?” (4) Hospitality in fact concerns the
                  question of unrestful dwelling because it won’t let the sky or the earth simply
                  be—it marks the torquing between identities, the queering of our relation to the
                  non-human, of the person to the vegetable. As inmates of dwellings, we should
                  begin to read Wordsworth’s poetry as reflecting on the forms of dwelling afforded
                  in the face of conditions that are, to say the least, intolerable and
                  inhospitable. </p>
                  <p> When Armytage points to the scene of disaster at the beginning of <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title>, he gestures to the “cheerless spot” where
                  the fourfold is at once gathered <emph>and</emph> disseminated, where disaster is
                  kept open as a question over the ruins of a poem that has often been read as an
                  act of reparative memorialization.

                   In keeping with Clark’s definition, I want to suggest that the ruins
                  Wordsworth attends to closely resemble an “event of disrupting and unravelling,”
                  and are linked to his antirepresentational preoccupation with disaster’s ruination
                  of the gains of pastoral elegy. <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> thus
                  doesn’t simply rehumanize our relationship with things in the world; instead, it
                  marks an unworking or <emph>désoeuvrement</emph> of things, and troubles the kinds
                  of economies that shuttle persons and things between durability and transience,
                  gain and loss, wealth and waste. The elegy, in other words, <emph>does not
                     give</emph>, and similarly does not owe (after Derrida): it disasters the
                  payments ordinarily recouped by acts of mourning that assure normative dwelling
                     “evermore.”

                   On the one hand, of course, <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> does
                  seek to sublimate grief into what Joel Faflak calls a “desire for moral
                  management” (“Was it”), creating pathetic fallacies which substantialize and
                  organize emotions already resistant to duration (“The Poets in their elegies and
                  songs/Lamenting the departed call the groves,/They call upon the hills and streams
                  to mourn,/And senseless rocks, nor idly; for they speak/In these their invocations
                  with a voice/Obedient to the strong creative power/Of human passions” [73-79]).
                  But there are always “Sympathies…//More tranquil” (79-80) in the sense of being
                  non-reciprocal, that do not instrumentalize streams and rocks in order to make
                  them weep: while the poem’s opening rehearsal of the history of elegiac address
                  seeks to re-cite (and re-assert) its precedence over a world of things, it also
                  exhumes the “senselessness” of a triadic encounter laid waste in a leftover world.
                  As Paul J. Alpers has noted, the intertextual echoes of Vergilian eclogue in the
                  poem work less to develop a dark antipastoralism than to script a new mode of
                  pastoral poetry that literally digs up the “bare Common” of its initial setting,
                  and reconfigures it in new encounters and experiences where “the question of
                  whether and how the earth is a fit habitation for human beings” (267) persists
                  throughout the Romantic junkspace, where disaster makes the difference between
                  change and death imperceptible. Indeed, as we are soon brought to a “ruined house,
                  four naked walls/That stared upon each other,” the poem implies that any kind of
                  ethical response to this spot will be measured in terms of how well we look upon
                  (rather than away from) the ruins—a different kind of pedagogical approach,
                  moreover, that risks changing everything and nothing, eliding being with
                  non-being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> in fact begins with a scene of
                  lugubrious oversaturation in the world, a wasting away of time that defines the
                  narrator’s own way of being which, from the outset, is beset by “no rest” (23).
                  This unrest of dwelling is characterized by intellectual distraction and barely
                  recorded somatic movements: “careless limbs beside the root/Of some huge oak whose
                  aged branches make/A twilight of their own” (11-13), or just after, the speaker
                  toiling “With languid feet which by the slipp’ry ground/Were baffled still” (20).
                  Unlively feet here are baffled into stillness and continue, as Wordsworth
                  suggests, to be baffled by a groundlessness the poem asks us to accept as its
                  state of unrest—the unraveling of our own being into a baffled stillness of
                  matter. Armytage, as numerous critics have noted, is signaled as ruined or
                  thing-like himself: “his hat/Bedewed with water-drops, as if the brim/Had newly
                  scooped a running stream. He rose/And pointing to a sunflower, bade me climb/The [
                  ] wall where that same gaudy flower/Looked upon the road” (49-54). The MS. B
                  version of the poem seems to overhaul this reification by inserting the as-yet
                  unnamed pedlar’s self-narrative early on in the poem as an exemplary biography: as
                  a “chosen son” (MS. B 76), the pedlar is described as entirely of a piece with the
                  natural landscape, giving “moral life” to “every natural form, rock, fruit, and
                  flower,/Even the loose stones that cover the highway” (80-82). The pedlar is
                  individualized in the very act of his own self-discerning capacities to overcome
                  the psychoanalytic frustration of Margaret’s abjection through philosophical
                  narrative and moral therapy, or what Faflak elsewhere describes as the “conflict
                  between a desire for a system that will discipline the aberrant empirical
                  phenomena of psychic life and his fascination with those phenomena” (“Analysis”): <quote>

                     </quote> Aesthetic contemplation here mingles with a relentless moral
                  uncovering of difference: the eye’s vigilance over the environment repetitively
                  binds or “chains” it to assent to things that do not rest. These surfaces
                  differentiate themselves as phenomena that coherently assemble the world’s
                  facticity. But the pedlar’s look is not quite so self-absorbed and
                  self-discerning: the biographical insert in MS.B literally “frame[s]” (104)
                  Armytage so as to suggest that even in solitude, he is never detached from the
                  “perpetual logic” that enchains him to all things. Indeed, the perpetuity of his
                  thought serializes him into a landscape where he is dispersed into the scenic
                  abstractions of “surface” and “shades.” Ocular power is scattered through a kind
                  of ever-metamorphosing formalism. When Armytage exclaims in the MS.D version of
                  the poem that at the “hour of deepest noon…/This hour when all things which are
                  not at rest/Are chearful…Why should a tear be in an old man’s eye?” (187-192), his
                  apparently stalled response over “feeding on disquiet” divests thought from
                  thinker and contagiously passes it onto the poet who, on looking on the pedlar’s
                  face, feels “that simple tale/[Pass] from my mind like a forgotten sound,”
                  (203-204). The moment of forgetfulness is less one of sympathetic resemblance than
                  a strange example of sfumato, or a literal <emph>inhumanizing</emph> of the face
                  to the point where what is perceived is several disfigurations away from the
                  object or person beheld. “[L]ooking round/Upon that tranquil ruin” (217-218), the
                  poem reverses the compulsion to gaze upon things as if they were subject to
                  coerced judgment. A different kind of unanticipated perception develops, a
                  low-grade suspended attentiveness or distracted “looking away” that recalls what
                  Rei Terada has studied as phenomenophilia—a love for “emigrating” or fleeting
                  things. Such a love runs counter to the usual normativity of appearances foisted
                  upon us by the social world (<title level="m">Looking</title>).</p>
                  <p>Alan Bewell has noted that “Wordsworth’s ‘ruined cottage’…should be read not only
                  in terms of the discourse of the picturesque, but also as part of that ‘alien’
                  landscape of death that first emerged in his poetry with <title level="m">Salisbury Plain</title>,” and the poem moves further into an astonishingly
                  bleak poetic vision that reduces the picturesque almost to the level of still life
                  (124-5). As Harold Bloom wrote years ago (37-52), Wordsworth’s cinematic
                  Romanticism consists of a preternatural zooming in on the world: the poem unfurls
                  a series of time-lapse vignettes that contrast the barest inklings of movement
                  with interminable motionlessness, effecting a degradation of the narrative’s
                  kinetic pull to the point where the hypersensations afforded by the elegy are
                  shown to be utterly external to the form itself. In other words, the poem
                  demonstrates how perception is negotiated <emph>through</emph> a poetic
                  materiality that in turn abstracts sensation and leaves behind virtual, corroded
                  images of things “at peace,” or things that “presence” the world and dwell insofar
                  as they cannot be normatively reinhabited: <quote>

                  bowl lies on the “foot-stone” in the same way as the worm is “on” Margaret’s
                  cheek. In these instances, one gesture appears to set off the energy of another in
                  a Rube Goldberg-like process. Material figure hits against material figure with
                  the slimmest sense of tangible action, and the effects of this lyric movement are
                  in turn abstracted into the arc of disuse that degrades the image into a rubble of
                  representation. What kind of durability does Wordsworth lend a character like
                  Margaret, who is at once utterly obsolete, subject to decay, while also movingly
                  thing-like? As Adam Potkay has noted, Romantic writers frequently point to the
                  “thing” as a term that is not always reducible to sociological and materialist
                  readings: neither commodity, fetish, nor concrete object, the “things we cannot
                  see” disturb the gap between person and thing, self and other, and offer a
                  challenging ecological ethics.

                   Such things, in their utter disposability, are images of what remains
                  uncontaminated by time and hence resistant to any restorative, differential
                  desire. The lingering waste of the poem doesn’t ripen, but rather remains
                  unyielding to any future prospects—it is literally the “no future,” the
                  superfluity of stuff that glimmers in a history of disaster that divests the poem
                  of any redeemable conditions.

                  <p>In this way, the elegy, while lamenting the substitution of non-human for human
                  life, is a form that is as powerfully <emph>retro</emph> as it is retrospective,
                  memorializing and reanimating the poem’s Wordsworthian kitsch in order to bring to
                  light what Benjamin calls the “revolutionary energies that appear in the
                  ‘outmoded’ ” (210). Elegy’s sweep here detotalizes the scene of recovery: rather
                  than rescue memory and figure, elegiac deviance plows and erodes sentimentalism to
                  the point of producing veritable kitsch or detritus. Put another way, the poem
                  returns objects from misuse by “gathering” them up <emph>as</emph> things subject
                  to no one at all: <quote>

                     </quote> This disastrous overturning of the dwelling-with of objects,
                  persons, and spaces in Wordsworth’s poem predictably recalls a fallen Eden, but it
                  is more to the point that Armytage’s words turn the materiality of the environment
                  into a text of disastrous interconnectivity. The rose suffocates under the violent
                  pressures of the bindweed; combined, the two effect a <emph>junkimage</emph>, a
                  residual poetic perception. Rose and bindweed serve as topological points of
                  mediation which “gather” just as well as they disaster the various intimacies the
                  passage seeks to render adjacent. Much like the passage where the narrator stoops
                  to drink the water, here agency is several times relocated from honeysuckle to
                  stone-crop, weed, bindweed, rose, chamomile, thyme—none of which are isolated
                  things unto themselves, but “objects” that only mean insofar as they are brought
                  into a web of proximation by the pedlar’s visualized narration. In just this way,
                  pastoral ruination veers away from psychologizing lament, and produces a different
                  kind of figural traffic. </p>
                  <p> As Armytage, the poem’s bewildered documentarian, casts his eye on the <title level="m">Grey Gardens</title>-like world of Margaret’s desuetude, he creates
                  and <emph>transforms</emph> the cottage’s past and present. The infinitesimal
                  alternation between stoppage and motion unleashed by the scene of disaster is of a
                  piece with the unworking of images which moulder in their own inoperative pathetic
                  fallacies, and the strangely atemporal, stop-motion description of things that
                     <emph>do not move,</emph> much like the “insidious half-life” of Koolhaas’s
                  Junkspace: “Aging in Junkspace is nonexistent or catastrophic; sometimes an entire
                  Junkspace—a department store, a nightclub, a bachelor pad—turns into a slum
                  overnight without warning: wattage diminishes imperceptibly, letters drop out of
                  signs, air-conditioning units start dripping, cracks appear as if from otherwise
                  unregistered earthquakes; sections rot, are no longer viable, but remain joined to
                  the ﬂesh of the main body via gangrenous passages” (180). The “catastrophic”
                  upsets of junkspace plot time to be at once stopped <emph>and</emph> contracted to
                  the point where change is instantaneous with presence. Junkspace thus spatializes
                  the destructivity of endless movement and the excessive remains it jettisons:
                  while space changes, junk accumulates but is relocated to different foci or lines
                  of sight that turn habitation into an ethics of reading, or reading
                     <emph>as</emph> a dwelling in states of disrepair between being and non-being
                  where things cannot be appropriated. </p>
                  <p> Raimonda Modiano has identified this de-instrumentalization of things as a
                  feature of eighteenth-century picturesque, where human figures, like their
                  non-human opposites, are ambiguously caught between prospect and property, and in
                  turn are frequently depicted as <emph>found</emph> objects: “It is an object which
                  has no known owner or if the owner is known, he or she is either unlocatable or
                  out of reach. Because this object is not given by someone, a relationship with it
                  incurs no obligation and fosters no dependency, as in gift exchange. On the
                  contrary, this object guarantees the discoverer’s independence for it asks nothing
                  and invites no attachments” (212-213).
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">Also see Mitchell and Collins.</note>
                   Thus the picturesque economizes a non-reciprocal form of gift-giving that
                  assumes the found object as the ungiven gift. The strangeness of <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> lies precisely in this emphasis on the foundness of
                  things <emph>as if there were no prior authorship nor ownership</emph>: things are
                  seemingly returned as unrepaired and not to be used, or as gifts never put into
                  circulations of exchange or obligation. While their affective kitschiness
                  nostalgically recalls the commodified literary history out of which they have
                  emerged—as Karen Swann has taught us, they are almost certainly Gothic ephemera
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Swann. </note>
                  —the elegy just as convincingly organizes the broken bowl, Margaret, her
                  child, the spear-grass, and the cottage itself as things found <emph>in</emph> a
                  limbic state between being for another and being for themselves. Like Van Gogh’s
                  peasant shoes, what we see are the traces of <emph>inhuman</emph> objects rid of
                  their wearers or dwellers, poetic fallacies that occur without the error of human
                  intention. These things are specifically <emph>irreparable</emph> in Giorgio
                  Agamben’s sense of the word: they “are consigned without remedy to their
                  being-thus, that they are precisely and only their <emph>thus</emph>…[for these
                  things] there is literally no shelter possible, that in their being-thus they are
                  absolutely exposed, absolutely abandoned” (39). For Agamben,
                  this irreparability is a quality of what he calls its “being that is always
                  already given in modality, that <emph>is</emph> its modalities. It is not
                     <emph>thus</emph>, but rather it is <emph>its</emph> thus” (92). The
                  “being-thus” of the irreparable imagines being not in terms of essence, state, or
                  condition, but in an “abandoned” excessiveness, a mode of “ecstatic dwelling,” as
                  Kate Rigby calls it (“Ecstatic”). Like disaster, Agamben’s sense of the
                  “irreparable” throws into high relief a form of sociality that is borne out of a
                  decommodified and desacralized world—in other words, inoperative communities freed
                  from universal judgment (“if the sensible world was ordered to fit the dignity and
                  the habtation of imperfect humans, then what sense can that world have when those
                  humans arrive at their supernatural destination?” [39]). Persons and things will
                  “thus” not be expropriated; they are the stuff of an ontological desuetude that is
                  intensely careless and negatively “<emph>capable of not not-being</emph>”
                  (40).</p>
                  <p> It is customary to note how the poem’s narration of Margaret’s wartime
                  destruction is tempered by both the speaker and by Armytage, but what is less
                  remarked on is how the moral helplessness of tending for her—of letting the
                  disaster literally shift things before our eyes—is less a form of resignation than
                  a thingifying counter-effect of Armytage’s trances: to cede to the “passing shews
                  of being” is to be desubjectified, to enter the space from “ruin and from change”
                  where the elegy’s pathic distractions express the degree to which the speakers
                  themselves have become utterly irreparable: “ ‘I turned away/And walked along my
                  road in happiness’ ” (524-525), says Armytage, his joy as impotent as the grief
                  that “traced” (502) the “secret spirit of humanity” surviving “’mid the calm
                  oblivious tendencies/Of nature, ‘mid her plants, her weeds, and flowers”
                  (503-505). While criticism has often focused on this image of “humanity” as an
                  ideological purification of the humanness of Margaret, what often goes unsaid is
                  how the poet’s blessing of Margaret’s thingification in fact marks the point where
                  the rubble is asserted as having a spooky perspective all by itself: as an object
                  of care and not appropriation, the rubble is hospitably turned away from because
                  in this refusal of identification, a refusal of the viral nature of sympathetic
                  co-existence, a different kind of non-recognitional “ministering” is formed. Such
                  distractions signify a life that is neither subjective nor objective, between
                  being and non-being; it is a life that is rendered superfluous, or irreducible to
                  its biopoliticized specificity—a dwelling in a disastrous or ruined mode that
                  hears a gothic ecology of warbling linnets, singing thrushes “and other melodies”
                  (533) that are as mechanized as the friendship between pedlar and poet. The
                  elegy’s final musicality, moreover, recalls the thick silence of Keats’s “To
                  Autumn,” but even more, the emphasis on the “evening resting-place” literally
                     <emph>evens out</emph> the dwelling of poet and Armytage to the point where by
                  now, we watch them mutate to the point of failing, <emph>as figures</emph>, to
                  bear witness anymore to the human. Armytage falls into just this inhumanizing
                  trance when he speaks of how “so familiarly/Do I perceive her manner and her
                  look/And presence, and so deeply do I feel/Her goodness, that not seldom in my
                  walks/A momentary trance comes over me/And to myself I seem to muse on one/By
                  sorrow laid asleep or borne away,/A human being destined to awake/To human life,
                  or something very near/To human life, when he shall come again/For whom she
                  suffered” (365-375). The Christianizing redemption of these last lines
                  notwithstanding, Armytage’s trance also compels him (and us) to attend to the way
                  in which Margaret’s life becomes superfluous in the sense of becoming disposable,
                  not knowing whether she sleeps or is borne away, or to which “life,” human or not,
                  she is to awake. The interpassivity of her actions—suffering for Christ—suggests
                  that her own waiting is less expectation than a process of strange erosion
                  compelled by the elegy itself, one undertaken not in order simply to better
                  translate Margaret into the ground or virtualize her into the “secret spirit of
                  humanity” amid plants, weeds, and flowers, but rather to have us attend to her
                  indistinction, to a life that is not quite human—a “passing shew” that has yet to
                  awaken into <emph>a</emph> human life because she never experienced humanity in
                  the world at all. </p>
                  <p> Affixed to this site, Armytage compulsively “clings” to Margaret’s ghostly
                  materiality as if she were a machine that spun him out into existence. In this
                  “tale of silent suffering, hardly clothed/In bodily form, and to the grosser
                  sense/But ill adapted, scaracely palpable/To him who does not think” (233-236),
                  narrative propulsion does seem to become, as Davd Simpson has powerfully argued, a
                  spectralized commodity itself that produces virtual figures and environments
                  hovering between tangibility and phantom-like invisibility—states of “bare life”
                  that testify to the buying and selling of mortality (<title level="m">Wordsworth</title>). But at the same time, Margaret’s thingification occurs
                  while she “wastes [her] time” (352), thus congealing her in debris and preventing
                  any investment in what Alan Liu has called the poem’s “capitalization upon
                  inhumanity” (325). Indeed, it isn’t clear if the commodification of labor has even
                  begun: Margaret’s “pac[ing] through many a day/Of the warm summer, from a belt of
                  flax/That girt her waist spinning the long-drawn thread” (459-462), which
                  foreshadows her eventual demise into a spirit of humanity, seems like a mode of
                  profligate dalliance. Deleuze would call this aspect of Wordsworth’s poem its
                     <emph>éspace</emph>
                     <emph>quelconque</emph>, or “whatever space”—a space denuded of human
                  participation, that endures not simply as the remnant of human life, but of life
                  itself in its state of desertion (<title level="m">Cinema</title>). After all,
                  garbage is precisely that which is prohibited, that which we ought not look at.
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Yaeger: “the binary trash/culture
                        has become more ethically charged and aesthetically interesting than the
                        binary nature/culture. In a world where nature is dominated, polluted,
                        pocketed, eco-touristed, warming, melting, bleaching, dissipating, and
                        fleeing toward the poles—detritus is both its curse and its alternative.
                        Trash is the becoming natural of culture, what culture, eating nature, tries
                        to cast away. In the midst of simulacra, it is also a substance in which we
                        can encounter decay and mortality” (339).</note>
                   And because we <emph>do</emph> look at it here, Wordsworth points to the
                  poem’s mise–en–scène, to the unrestful dwelling in rubbish that is brought into
                  the poem’s foreground as the environment that sticks around and cannot be
                  redeveloped. Although biblical images like the broken bowl imply a certain
                  predestined fulfillment of catastrophic prophecy, Wordsworth’s writing
                  concentrates on such images <emph>as</emph> rubbishy, irreparable
                     <emph>ready-unmades</emph> that block any kind of recuperating
                  interpretation—what Alphonso Lingis, in another context, calls “the empty
                  endurance of the void” (21). What Wordsworth points to, in my view, is
                  uncomfortably compelling: a reading of disaster in terms of a grief without grief,
                  a hope without hope, and a style of extraindividual, catastrophic aestheticization
                  that dwells beyond elegy. If <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> evokes a
                  singular inhumanism in its lines of sympathetic attachment, it just as well
                  concentrates on the less palatable moments of unrest where the vulnerability of
                  persons catalyzes a kind of disastrous thought—one which turns women into things
                  and men into ruins. Persons are readily thingified, and the desire to treat
                  persons as things becomes a necessary component of Romantic modernity—to
                  recirculate persons in an aesthetic economy that cannot bear to possess or dwell
                  with anything, that treats persons as <emph>res nullius</emph>, and would have us
                  literally waste life.</p>

                  <p>What difference does a critical awareness of imperial history make for the study of British Romanticism? Material that was formerly
                                    the domain of anthropologists, art historians, archaeologists,
                                    military historians and historians of empire has become an
                                    important archive both for re-thinking canonical texts and
                                    for re-imagining the social and cultural dynamics of Georgian
                                    society. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See for example
                                          Teltscher.</note> Important critical studies have laid the
                                    groundwork for expanding scholars’ sense of the ways in
                                    which Romantic discourse was thoroughly permeated by global
                                    geopolitical concerns. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Baucom, Makdisi, Franklin, Coleman, Leask, Barrell,
                                          and Richardson and Hofkosh, for a sense of the range of
                                          work in this area.</note> We can read the editorial
                                    consensus among recent anthologies of British Romanticism, all
                                    of which contain subsections on anti-slavery and orientalism, as
                                    a symptomatic recognition of the importance of these materials.
                                    That said, there are also few surprises here. Earlier scholars
                                    such as David Erdman established beyond question the importance
                                    of imperial problematics to Blake’s work, and there are
                                    many other similar examples. What remains constant is a
                                    recognition that the period conventionally associated with
                                    Romantic discourse saw crucial transformations in imperial
                                    governance and colonial discourse. And yet there has been a
                                    remarkable containment of this recognition by relegating this
                                    scholarship into sub-fields. Scholars who work on British India
                                    are well aware of this predicament, for in spite of widespread
                                    recognition of the importance of developments on the Indian
                                    subcontinent to British society in the late eighteenth and early
                                    nineteenth centuries, important work on Romantic
                                    interculturalism, on the emergence of proto-anthropological
                                    disciplines, on models of racialization, on global economics and
                                    other topics remains either the domain of a few scholars
                                    bridging the divide between literary studies and history or it
                                    remains largely unexplored. A similar problem exists for
                                    scholars of trans-Atlantic Romanticism whose work has the
                                    potential to undermine the recalcitrant division of literary
                                    studies into the study of national literatures.</p>
                  <p>My concern here is not simply one of disciplinary
                                    exclusion—although that is an important issue—or of
                                    expanding the field of enquiry yet again. The question with
                                    which I opened this essay does not pertain simply to questions
                                    of “context” or of “canon”. The issue I
                                    want to address here is how increasing awareness of the global
                                    flow of people, commodities, and cultural products impinges on
                                    how we analyze Romantic culture. Obviously, I cannot provide an
                                    exhaustive answer to such a question in an essay. What I will do
                                    instead is offer a set of linked examples of the kind of analysis
                                    that might begin to give a sense of the potential afforded by
                                    allowing knowledge of imperial history to permeate close reading
                                    and vice versa. I use the word permeation advisedly, because
                                    beyond demonstrating how historical context enables cultural
                                    analysis, I also show how close reading itself does historical
                                    work, and thus cannot be separated from some world beyond the
                                    text.</p>
                  <p>In the process, I am going to make at least two grand claims,
                                    hardly new, but which inform everything which follows. The first
                                    concerns the unabated prosecution of war throughout the late
                                    eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As Mary Favret has
                                    persuasively argued, Romantic literature is a wartime
                                    literature, and from the Seven Years War onward Britain’s
                                    wars were global affairs. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Favret <title level="m">War at a
                                                Distance</title> (2010) and <title level="a">War in
                                                the Air</title> (2004).</note> The second follows
                                    from the first and has to do with chronology. The more that one
                                    reads the imperial archive, the more it becomes clear that
                                    consideration of the emergence and practice of what we call
                                    Romanticism needs to start with the loss of the American
                                    colonies. In my opinion, the preponderance of scholarship on the
                                    French Revolution is one of the decisive critical obstacles to a
                                    genealogical analysis of the relationship between Romanticism
                                    and empire because it so frequently re-inscribes the nation as
                                    the primary political entity. This is not to say that this
                                    scholarship is invalid or wrong-headed, but rather that it
                                    radically limits the historical purview of cultural analysis. </p>
                  <p>Historians as differently motivated as J.G.A. Pocock and Dror
                                    Wahrman have argued that something fundamental happens to
                                    British culture and society during the American crisis. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Wahrman, 218-264 and

                                    political crisis in the Atlantic traces the problem of imperial
                                    governance back to two key problems: the lack of any coherent
                                    theory of confederation in British political thought and the
                                    troubling duality of the term “imperium”. As he
                                    states, 
                              <quote>the primary meaning in English of “empire” or
                                          <foreign>imperium</foreign> had been “national
                                    sovereignty”: the “empire” of England over
                                    itself, of the crown over England in the church as well as
                                    state, the independence of the English church-state from all
                                    other modes of sovereignty.(257)</quote>
                              Empire in this sense denoted sovereignty of the British realm over
                                    itself. This primary meaning came crashing into another meaning
                                    of empire following “the momentous if transitory
                                    establishment of an English-speaking universal empire in the
                                    North Atlantic and Alleghanian America” following the
                                    Seven Years War. Instabilities in the governance of this
                                    extensive empire undermined triumphalist rhetoric from an early
                                    stage and thus analysis of the colonial challenge to imperial
                                    rule looked back to earlier moments of instability in the realm.
                                    The recent experience of the historical trauma of civil war and
                                    the hard won sense of stability following the Glorious
                                    Revolution and the quelling of the Jacobite rebellion inflected
                                    all of the responses to the American crisis. “Englishmen
                                    could see that the American programme entailed the separation of
                                    crown from parliament, threatening the unity of
                                    ‘empire’ which was the only guarantee against civil
                                    war and dissolution of government, those deep and still bleeding
                                    wounds in their historical memory”. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Pocock, 284 and 275.</note>
                                    This history proved to be decisive for Britain, because it meant
                                    that “the heart of the American problem for Britain was
                                    less the maintenance of imperial control than the preservation
                                    of essentially English institutions which the claims of empire
                                    were calling into question”. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Pocock, 278.</note> As Pocock demonstrates,
                                    American secession allowed for the maintenance of
                                    “colony” as a constitutive outside for British
                                    sovereignty because America acceded to the condition of a state.
                                    Thus one of the crucial adjustments in the era following the
                                    American war was a redefinition of coloniality itself such that
                                    colonial governance was carried out not by legislatures, but
                                    rather by governors, “often military men, [who] directly
                                    exercised their sovereign’s authority, representing him in
                                    his personal, imperial and parliamentary character” (Pocock 301). This
                                    new imperial regime stabilized both the notion of
                                    King-in-Parliament, and the global economic networks which it
                                    governed.</p>
                  <p>Losses in America in the early 1780s are inextricably bound up with
                                    reverses in India during the same period. As Linda Colley has
                                    reminded us, news of Haider Ali’s victory over the British
                                    at Pollilur in 1780 arrived in London in 1781 and provoked
                                    ‘universal consternation’ in part because the news
                                    coincided with reports of the fall of Yorktown.(270) To
                                    commentators in the American colonies, in Britain and in India
                                    at this time, the East India Company’s hold over territory
                                    in India empire seemed in equal jeopardy. Like the first war
                                    with Mysore in 1767-9, the Second Mysore War ended
                                    inconclusively in 1784, and it cost the East India Company a
                                    great deal both in resources and confidence. According to a

                              The close affiliation between Tipu Sultan and French forces not
                                    only raised the question of renewed French intervention in
                                    India, but also replicated the trajectory of the American
                                    campaign, in which the French played a decisive role from 1778
                                    onward. Metropolitan anxiety about these defeats was at its
                                    height throughout the 1780s, and when the Third Mysore War
                                    commenced in 1790 both the newspapers and the print satirists
                                    predicted further humiliation of the British forces. Cornwallis
                                    defeated Tipu in the Third Mysore War and the elaborate
                                    settlement which ensued from his victory at Seringapatam played
                                    a crucial part in the shift from anxiety to triumphalism in the
                                    1790s.</p>
                  <p>In contrast to Stephen Conway’s influential argument that the
                                    experience of the American conflict did not alter British
                                    attitudes to war and empire (315), this essay contends that the
                                    transit from the early 1780s to the early 1790s involved
                                    extremely complex shifts in British subjectification—i.e.
                                    the processes through which subjects make themselves accountable
                                    to normative discourses which in turn recognise and make them
                                    visible—and that these shifts are perceptible in the
                                    cultural field. <note place="foot" resp="editors">The

                                    unconnected texts—William Hodges’s <title level="m">Travels in India During the Years 1780, 1781, 1782 and
                                          1783</title> (1793) and William Cowper’s <title level="a">Yardley Oak</title> (ca. 1791)—to explore
                                    not only how changes in imperial governance can be traced in the
                                    formal and aesthetic elements being analyzed, but also how close
                                    reading of these formal elements can elucidate the historical
                                    dynamics of global empire. In both cases, I argue that the works
                                    themselves act as conduits from the early 1780s to the early
                                    1790s, from one revolutionary situation to another, and thus
                                    need to be considered in light of this transit through
                                    historical time. Specifically, I will be looking at the
                                    emblematic representation of trees as metaphors for governance
                                    in order to show how each reconfigures the relationship between
                                    men and things in a way that cancels the memory of past imperial
                                    reverses. Lurking in the centre of the essay is brief reading of
                                    another notable tree, Burke’s famous oak from the <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title>,
                                    in order to show how the figural exchange between empire and
                                    nation can productively engage with extant scholarship on the
                                    1790s. In my readings of Hodges, Burke and Cowper, these
                                    botanical figures become surrogative in Joseph Roach’s
                                    sense of the term in that they overwrite a historical wound in
                                    order to allow an enabling supplemental fantasy to gain traction
                                    in a time of national and imperial crisis (2). As prosthetic
                                    devices to overcome the loss of the American colonies,
                                    Hodges’s deployment of the Banyan tree, and Cowper’s
                                    re-orientation of the oak metaphor allow us to see what kind of
                                    cultural work was needed to reconfigure imperial subjectivity at
                                    this transitional juncture.</p>

                                    a text literally structured by war. Hodges’s journey and
                                    his narrative are repeatedly interrupted by armed conflict
                                    between the forces of the East India Company and resistant
                                    native powers across the subcontinent. The first chapter records
                                    the humiliating loss at Pollilur in the Second Mysore War which
                                    not only raised questions regarding Warren Hastings’s
                                    bellicosity, but also haunted representations of British rule in
                                    India until the final defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1799. Later
                                    chapters are closely intertwined with the East India

                                    Hodges’s explicit argument that British governance in the
                                    region is not only benevolent, but also reminiscent of prior
                                    examples of enlightened Moslem rule. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Eaton, 35-42. See de Almeida and Gilpin,

                                    rhetorical battle within Hodges’s narrative has
                                    significant implications for analyses of British governance and
                                    of British representation of India at this juncture. The
                                    text’s strategies of exemplification, negation and
                                    obfuscation intervene not only in the rhetorical assault on
                                    Warren Hastings, but also in the attemp to justify British rule
                                    during the Cornwallis era. What I wish to demonstrate, through
                                    the close reading of compositional adjacency and metonymic
                                    contiguity in one image and one fragment of text, is how
                                    Hodges’s rendering of the banyan tree coalesces with
                                    larger historical and political developments which transformed
                                    not only British rule in the Asian subcontinent, but also the
                                    very notion of empire itself.</p>
                  <p>How are we to understand the inaugural gesture of the first chapter,
                                    which opens with a detailed account not of the Company’s
                                    victory over Chait Singh’s insurgency, but of the
                                    Company’s humiliating defeat at Pollilur? It is important
                                    to recognize the chain of associations invoked by this material.
                                    The loss at Pollilur resulted in the captivity and enslavement
                                    of numerous British soldiers. As Kate Teltscher and Linda Colley
                                    have demonstrated, accounts of their forced conversion and
                                    circumcision were widely circulated throughout the 1780s, and
                                    they generated significant anxiety regarding the blurring of
                                    lines between Mysorean and British identities. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Teltscher 233-5 and Colley
                                          285-90.</note> These anxieties were exacerbated by reports
                                    of British atrocities at Anantpaur, of the overall mismanagement
                                    of the second Mysore war and of the indecisive treaty of
                                    Mangalore. In short, war with Mysore in the 1780s is traversed
                                    by fantasies of castration, loss and failure that are largely
                                    responsible for the construction of Tipu Sultan as the
                                    arch-enemy of British imperial activity in India.</p>
                  <p>This entire assemblage of associations establishes a frame of
                                    imperial anxiety and, like Giles Tillotson, I believe that the
                                    war with Mysore casts a long shadow in the <title level="m">Travels</title>. <note place="foot" resp="editors">G.H.R. Tillotson, 62-3 and 89-91.</note> Describing his
                                    time in Madras, Hodges presents the conflict with Hyder Ali as
                                    an interruption in artistic and commercial production:
                              <quote>I prepared eagerly for a tour through the country; but my route was
                                    scarcely fixed, when I was interrupted by the great scourge of
                                    human nature, the great enemy of the arts, war, which, with
                                    horrors perhaps unknown to the civilized regions of Europe,
                                    descended like a torrent over the whole face of the country,
                                    driving the peaceful husbandman from his plow, and the
                                    manufacturer from his loom. (5)</quote>
                              This image of the manufacturer separated from his loom is extremely
                                    important not only because there is an implicit comparison
                                    between his inactivity and the inactivity of the artist, but
                                    also because this trope becomes a lynch-pin in Hodges’s
                                    later account of the banyan tree. At this point in the text, the
                                    populace is starving and the reader is starved for images. This
                                    passage is followed by an extended and detailed account of the
                                    British reversals and by the introduction of the volume’s
                                    first plate—a view of the great pagoda at Tanjore, which Hodges
                                    emphasizes was worked up from “an accurate drawing from
                                    Mr. Topping.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See

                                    assertion of Hodges’s aesthetic commitment to plein air
                                    landscape painting but rather with its repudiation by historical
                                    events. Chapter 1 therefore is about military and aesthetic
                                    failure. And it is about surrogation: here is something else in
                                    lieu of what I could not give you. This is important because
                                    Chapter 2 opens with a turning away from this problematic:
                                    Hodges removes to Bengal, comes more directly under the
                                    patronage of Hastings and undertakes the journey towards Benares
                                    and Agra which became the basis of much of his representation of
                                    India. </p>
                  <p>From the period immediately prior to the passing of the Regulating
                                    Act to the East India Company Charter Act, the governance of the
                                    East India Company generated significant controversy regarding
                                    the appropriate form and quality of colonial rule. Michel
                                    Foucault, in his essay <title level="a">Governmentality,</title>
                                    defined “Government as the right disposition of
                                    things,” and his notion of disposition is useful here,
                                    because it draws attention to how power is distributed by the
                                    very selection and arrangement of populations, commodities and
                                    flows. Hodges’s text engages with this problematic by
                                    presenting figures of the right disposition of men and things.
                                    The absence of women in this phrase is intended because it lies
                                    at the core not only of Hodges image of the banyan tree, but
                                    also in key developments in colonial discourse in the early
                                    1790s. Harriet Guest’s recent reading of the deployment of
                                    femininity in Hodges’s narrative argues that the
                                    “great distinction” between Indian and European
                                    society is negotiated by the ascription of femininity to Indian
                                    peoples, places and things (2007, 28-32). Within the chain of
                                    images engraved for the <title level="m">Travels</title>, the
                                    banyan tree image is caught in the tangle of gendered fantasies
                                    which inflected much of the European and specifically British
                                    account of imperial rule. It is preceded by a Mughal painting of
                                    a Zenanah (24) and followed by a highly sentimental image of
                                          <title level="a">Mahommedan Women attending the Tombs of
                                          their Parents, Relatives, or Friends at Night</title> (28).
                                    Two of the next three images focus specifically on Hindu women:
                                    first, an image of mother and child (30) and then the famous
                                    stele-like image of the <title level="a">Procession of a Hindoo
                                          woman to sacrifice on the funeral pile</title> (84). At
                                    the risk of simplifying this chain of images, I would suggest
                                    that the banyan tree is ensconced in a series of
                                    proto-ethnographic images which focus almost exclusively on the
                                    lives of women. The subjects here are not incidental for they
                                    are connected to precisely the social and religious practices
                                    most frequently remarked upon by European travelers—the
                                    sequestration of women, marital constancy and suttee—as signs
                                    either of Moslem despotism or Hindu fanaticism/superstition. And
                                    each in their own way argues against prior visualizations of
                                    these elements of Indian sociability. The Zenanah image hands
                                    over representational agency to an unnamed Mughal artist, thereby
                                    squelching any imputation of voyeurism. The mourning image
                                    figures it as a scene of exemplary sensibility; and the suttee
                                    scene is rendered as a scene of horrified yet erotically charged
                                    observation. <note place="foot" resp="editors">For an

                  <p>  In this image the viewer is placed beneath the canopy
                                    of the tree as a witness to what Picart and Tavernier before him
                                    refer to as idolatrous practices. The key issue here is one of
                                    metonymic adjacency: the tree takes on monstrous qualities
                                    because it is adjacent to the superstitious practices of the
                                    fakirs. That metonymic relation is the ground on which a much
                                    more complex metaphorical relationship is built. The
                                    tree’s excessive extension and the confusion between
                                    parent and child trees are equated with the excessive practices
                                    of the fakirs. That excess has specifically non-normative sexual
                                    connotations because in the groups of figures we have women
                                    consorting with naked fakirs.</p>
                  <p>That monstrous excess is figured forth by the face on the
                                    tree’s trunk, which occupies the centre of the
                                    composition, and which is framed by the central temple.
                                    Picart’s adjoining text identifies that face: <quote>You
                                          may see, says he [Tavernier], about the Borders of Surat,
                                          under a spacious Tree where the Banians resort, several
                                          Pagods, consecrated to their Idols. The Pagod that leans
                                          against the Body of the Tree is dedicated to
                                                <foreign>Mamaniva</foreign>, whose formidable Head
                                          may be discerned in the Middle of the hollow Trunk. Hither
                                          resort several Votaries, who prostrate themselves before
                                          this monstrous Idol, and a Bramin collects at the same
                                          time their Free-will offerings, which consist of Rice,
                                          Millet, &amp;c. Whoever comes to offer up their
                                          Supplications before this Pagod of
                                                <foreign>Mamaniva</foreign>, are marked on the
                                          Forehead with Vermillion, with which they beautify and
                                          adorn their Idol. Honoured with this Mark, their Votaries
                                          imagine no evil Spirit can have the least prevailing Power
                                          over them. (7-8)</quote> Mamaniva is a corruption of
                                    Mahadevi the great mother goddess of Hinduism, therefore both
                                    the metonymical and metaphorical correlations of the image
                                    conspire to represent Hindu religion, and by extension, its
                                    practitioners, as a monstrous mother which reproduces either
                                    autonomously or with its own children. In this light, the
                                    framing function of the central pagod gains a certain eloquence
                                    because it effectively envaginates the face. The
                                    hyper-maternalization of the scene effectively evacuates the
                                    father from this visual and textual assemblage.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This envagination is also

                  <p>Hodges’s rendering of the banyan tree effectively interrupts
                                    the entire network of associations mobilized by Picart and
                                    performs a complex series of displacements. Again the key lies
                                    in compositional adjacency, in the disposition of the
                                    image’s component elements. A metonymic relation is built
                                    between the two shaded figures and the tree. In contrast to the
                                    Picart image, the two figures are unloading the boat on the
                                    extreme left so the tree is adjacent, not to fanaticism, but to
                                    idealized labour and prosperity. This specifically contrasts
                                    with the Bramin from Picart’s text who ostensibly profits
                                    from the “superstition” of the votaries. This
                                    substitution of one kind of accumulation for another is crucial
                                    to Hodges’s textual description of the banyan tree:
                                          <quote>I proceeded from Sultungunge to Bauglepoor, where
                                          my pursuits were promoted with a degree of liberality that
                                          peculiarly marked the mind of the gentleman [Augustus
                                          Cleveland] who then governed this district; and of whom,
                                          in common gratitude, I must ever speak with veneration and
                                          esteem. At the entrance of the town of Bauglepoor, I made
                                          a drawing of a banyan tree, of which a plate is annexed.
                                          This is one of those curious productions of nature which
                                          cannot fail to excite the attention of the traveller. The
                                          branches of this tree having shoots depending from them,
                                          and taking root, again produce, and become the parents of
                                          others. These trees, in many instances, cover such an
                                          extent of ground, that hundreds of people may take shelter
                                          under one of them from the scorching rays of the sun. The
                                          care that was taken in the government, and the minute
                                          attention to the happiness of the people, rendered this
                                          district, at this time, (1781) a perfect paradise. It was
                                          not uncommon to see the manufacturer at his loom, in the
                                          cool shade, attended by his friend softening his labour by
                                          the tender strains of music. There are to be met with in
                                          India many old pictures representing similar subjects, in
                                          the happy times of the Mogul government. (27)</quote> In
                                    the text, the tree offers shade and sustenance to all who come
                                    under its canopy and it is figuratively linked to Augustus
                                    Cleveland’s, and by extension Hastings’s, management
                                    of the region. Its vitality and, above all, its naturalness
                                    accrue to the governmentality of the East India Company, and
                                    thus it ostensibly stands as a figure of prosperity, hope and
                                    stability in a time of war and economic uncertainty.</p>
                  <p>The text achieves this rhetorical sleight of hand through the
                                    careful management of adjacent sentences and figures. The first
                                    sentence indicates that it is Cleveland who not only governs the
                                    district, but also fosters Hodges’s artistic production.
                                    This has a kind of inaugural effect because Hodges ostensibly
                                    made no art in Madras during the campaign against Mysore. This
                                    frames the next four sentences which specifically address the
                                    banyan tree. The final three sentences of the paragraph then
                                    suddenly cut back to the framing issue by speaking directly
                                    about good governance. If we break the paragraph into these
                                    three, the gap between the internal description of the tree and
                                    the framing remarks on governmentality become immediately
                                    conspicuous. It is literally the paratactic adjacency of the
                                    frame to the internal description that allows the tree to figure
                                    for good government. And each of the sentences of this internal
                                    unit is notable for how it re-writes prior descriptions of the
                                    banyan tree. By describing the tree as a natural curiosity which
                                    “cannot fail to excite the attention of the
                                    traveller”, Hodges invokes the long line of travel
                                    narratives and quasi-scientific accounts of Asia, which includes
                                    Tavernier, Picart and Fenning. However, the subsequent sentence
                                    performs a key divagation from these prior discourses when it
                                    refuses to refer to the tree as a mother and when it rigorously
                                    separates the child-like dependent shoots from the newly rooted
                                    “parents of others”. This effectively counters not
                                    only the feminization of the tree, and hence its connection to
                                    Mamaniva in Picart, but also replaces non-normative sexuality
                                    with a carefully managed sphere of reproduction where parents
                                    and children are never confused.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This also diverges from Milton’s

                                          gives some sense of the closure effected in Hodges’s
                                          representation of the banyan tree. As we will see later in
                                          this essay, Milton’s deployment of the banyan tree
                                          is important to Cowper’s rendering of the oak
                                          tree.</note> So much for the threat of monstrous maternal
                                    Hinduism nascent in Picart. The next sentence picks up on the
                                    tree’s ability to shade “hundreds of people”,
                                    but does not refer to this group as a regiment as in Fenning.
                                    This erases the military in favour of a subject people and thus
                                    erases both native insurgency and British military activity in
                                    one rhetorical stroke.</p>
                  <p>The final three sentences of the paragraph play out the
                                    implications of Hodges’s re-writing of prior discourses on
                                    the banyan tree with an uncompromising logic. When we jump the
                                    gap from the fifth to the six sentence, Cleveland’s good
                                    governance has generated a paradise on earth. In light of the
                                    prior evacuation of the tree’s metonymic and metaphorical
                                    connections to Mahadevi, this declaration seems to imply that
                                    Cleveland, and by extension, the East India Company, operate as
                                    a benevolent God who, rather than inculcating fanaticism and
                                    non-productivity, fosters both commercial and artistic
                                    production. This helps explain why the religious elements of
                                    Picart’s image are invoked but visually contained in both
                                    the church-like building in the background and the walking
                                    figure in the foreground.</p>
                  <p>The face of Mamaniva is doubly displaced, and I would argue that
                                    this doubling poses a series of complex problems. The
                                    architectural element in the background still occupies the
                                    precise centre of the composition, but it no longer frames the
                                    trunk and if anything its tiny church-like spire replaces the
                                    envaginated female face in Picart with a certain quiet
                                    phallicism. Could we not argue that the monstrous mother of
                                    Hinduism has been replaced by a pagod whose undecidable
                                    construction suspiciously resonates with the Christian discourse
                                    used to legitimate Cleveland’s governance? The
                                    compositional displacement and the undecidable architectural
                                    element figures forth a form of Hindu culture dissociated from
                                    fanaticism at precisely the moment when the question of
                                    Chrisitianizing the Asian subcontinent is very much in the air.

                                    population—when arguments for both options were being weighed
                                    and counter-weighed.</p>
                  <p>In this context the tree itself becomes iconically phallic or
                                    indeed hyper-phallicized. As a huge penis with myriad dependent
                                    penises, this figure for the governmentality of the East India
                                    Company not only puts thousands of years of Hindu religious and
                                    social practices into abeyance, but also equates the Company
                                    with the autonomous production of both food and art. This is
                                    bolstered by the final sentence of the paragraph which links
                                    this new period of productivity to earlier periods of Mughal
                                    stability, presumably under the Akbar’s rule, wherein good
                                    governance fostered art and happiness. This linkage between
                                    Akbar and Hastings not only legitimates Company rule as a
                                    repetition of past models of good government, but also firmly
                                    locates any competent form of Moslem rule in the historical
                                    past. As Tobin, Eaton and others have argued, <note place="foot" resp="editors">Tobin, 12-43; Eaton,

                                          shining full on this building, composed of such varied
                                          materials, produces a glare of splendour almost beyond the
                                          imagination of an inhabitant of these northern climates to
                                          conceive; and the present solitude that reigns over the

                  </p>
                  <p>Hodges' sense of “pensive melancholy” has multiple
                                    valences in 1793—its year of publication—and it is hard not to
                                    hear, in the phrase “civil dissentions”, a certain
                                    cautionary admonition regarding not only imperial, but also
                                    national affairs. In light of the melancholy prompted by this
                                    icon of the mutability of dynastic power is thus entirely
                                    appropriate that phallic British governance be figured forth not
                                    architecturally but rather as a living organism whose extension
                                    constitutes a fantasy of paternal self-replication. </p>
                  <p>The style of paternal masculinity which Hodges associates with both
                                    Akbar and Hastings resonates with the emergence of a crucial
                                    trope—both visual and textual—from Britain’s ongoing
                                    struggles with Mysore. In his careful management of the famous
                                    hostage transaction which ended the third Mysore War in 1793,
                                    Cornwallis, and those representing the event, did everything
                                    possible to suggest that Tipu Sultan’s sons would receive
                                    a form of paternal care previously unknown to them in their
                                    father’s household. This declaration of paternal
                                    benevolence was explicitly mobilized to contrast with the
                                    treatment of British captives by Hyder Ali following Pollilur.

                                    of a proto-ethnographic “explanation” for why Indian
                                    populations were incapable of governing themselves that linked
                                    subject populations to non-normative sexualities. In this
                                    rhetoric, the native population of India was divided along
                                    religious and ethnic lines and polarized by gendered fantasies

                                    normative masculinity. Hodges’s complex deployment of
                                    gender and sexuality in the description of the banyan tree
                                    speaks to the ongoing spectre of loss in Mysore set into motion
                                    in the first chapter of the <title level="m">Travels</title>, but it does so in a way
                                    that both forecloses and opens the problematic of
                                    governmentality. In Hodges’s text, the former rule of
                                    Akbar and the present example of the East India Company exist
                                    uneasily in this realm of normativity because the distinction
                                    between past and present is the only thing preventing the
                                    collapse between Moslem and Christian rule. </p>
                  <p>If we take one last look at the banyan tree image we can discern
                                    three layers of displacement. In the background, the ancient
                                    pagod which framed Mahadewi in Picart’s picture has given
                                    way to an image from the future: a small parsonage superimposed
                                    on a now obsolete Hindu temple. In the middle ground,
                                    Mahadewi’s envaginated face has been erased and the tree
                                    itself emerges as a fantasy of phallic British rule. And the
                                    ancient religious practices of the faqirs have been replaced by
                                    present commerce. And in the foreground, something new emerges.
                                    The aged Hindu man looking out at the viewer is not only
                                    detached from the past of Picart’s image, but he seems to
                                    hail the viewer, or perhaps even Hodges, into a new temporal
                                    relationship beyond the conventional aesthetic objectives of the
                                    picturesque. It is as though the old man’s gaze
                                    establishes precisely what Hodges and by extension his audience
                                    desired all along: a relationship which figures forth the
                                    artist/observer as a phallic ruler over the subject of the

                                    can revel in the power of domination. Isn’t that what is
                                    coded into the penitential pose of the figure in the foreground,
                                    for this is not an intersubjective glance, but a gaze of
                                    subjection. And the viewer accedes to the scene of paternal
                                    forgiveness perhaps needed to overcome the psychic, governmental
                                    and historical impasse occasioned in 1781. In this re-figuring
                                    of the past Hodges has sketched the future for himself and for
                                    those to whom he wishes to sell the <title level="m">Travels</title>—a future that brings

                                    surprising. As Quilley and Bonehill indicate, “the picture
                                    gives a panoramic view across the park and countryside with the
                                    focal point of the castle in the centre distance, in an
                                    evocation of an ordered, harmonious landscape that is to be
                                    understood as at once natural and political” (194). The
                                    pair of oaks on the right frames both the stags in the
                                    foreground and the castle in the background, and thus perform
                                    precisely the sheltering function that oaks had performed in
                                    numerous contexts from at least the time of Locke. Pope’s
                                          <title level="a">Windsor Forest</title> comes to mind no
                                    less than patriotic evocations of oak trees by William Whitehead

                  <p>But something is amiss. In both Pope and Whitehead, British oaks
                                    have a global reach either through their transformation into
                                    warships in the case of Windsor Forest, or through a certain

                  <p>This figure of the spreading branches of the British oak—here
                                    extending across the Atlantic itself—is simply not possible in
                                    the 1780s. The loss of the American colonies has lead to a
                                    certain restraint in this emblematic figure. But this spatial
                                    restraint is supplemented by a renewed investment in the
                                    oak’s capacity to figure forth historical continuity:
                                    spatial extension gives way to temporal reach.</p>
                  <p>I think we can see something of this in Hodges' picture, for its
                                    rendering of power is remarkably contained and in many ways
                                    looped in on itself. The oak frames the stags which rest before
                                    the seat of the King. All three pictorial elements are the
                                    literal possessions of the Crown and each one figures for the
                                    Crown. In this sense, they are doubled versions of each other
                                    and thus the concentration of power is in a sense
                                    overdetermined. That overdetermination suggests that the entire
                                    composition is attempting to shore up something that may not be
                                    as solid as it first appears. This is only exacerbated by the
                                    format of the print itself. Modelled on his iconic pictures of
                                    the ruins of former Mughal stability, Hodges’s view of
                                    Windsor has the potential to be read not only as the
                                    consolidation of dynastic power, but also as a further example
                                    of the mutability of empire. In other words, the allegorical
                                    relation set up between Windsor and the Tomb of Akbar
                                    establishes the British crown as both the substitute for Mughal
                                    power and its double. This reaffirms Britain’s claim to
                                    governance in the present, but uses the Mughal past to
                                    interrogate the future of British rule not only in the colonies,
                                    but also at the very centre of the empire. The question posed by
                                    the comparison is what will prevent the British state from
                                    receding into obsolescence in roughly the same manner as
                                    Akbar’s regime?</p>
                  <p>Hodges’s picture allows us to recognize a similar combination
                                    of restraint and overdetermination in what is perhaps the most
                                    significant mobilization of the oak figure in the late
                                    eighteenth century. I am referring of course to Burke’s
                                    use of the oak to figure forth the British constitution in

                                          are many in number; or that, after all, they are other
                                          than the little shrivelled, meagre, hopping, though loud
                                          and troublesome insects of the hour. (180)</quote> As a
                                    figure for the nation/constitution the important feature of this
                                    oak is its capacity of its branches to give shade, but the
                                    animalization of British subjects—whether they be revolutionary
                                    grasshoppers or loyal cattle—not only privileges the silence of
                                    the cows, but also renders the entire political arrangement
                                    quite compact. As in Hodges’s picture, the oak’s
                                    protection is nativist; there is none of the extensibility which
                                    played such a key role in Pope or Whitehead. This marks a
                                    significant curtailment of the diffusion of British liberty
                                    beyond the shores of the British Isles. And we need to recognize
                                    that this constitutes a re-calibration of imperial governance as
                                    much as it does a rejection of Whig suggestions at the time that
                                    Burke was writing the <title level="m">Reflections</title> that the revolution in France
                                    had the potential to diffuse English models of liberty into the
                                    heart of Europe. Burke’s supplementation of the oak figure
                                    with that of the cattle is aimed at ensuring that the oak does
                                    not become confused with a younger liberty tree.</p>
                  <p>It is for this reason that Burke’s figure sacrifices
                                    extensibility to duration by intertwining the life cycle of the

                                          of inheritance we have given our frame of polity the image
                                          of a relation in blood; binding up the constitution of our
                                          country with our dearest domestic affections....
                                          (120)</quote> This is a confusing passage precisely
                                    because the image of “a relation in blood” does not
                                    sit well with “the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall,
                                    renovation and progression”. Burke wants the constitution
                                    to be both an “incorporation of the human race” and
                                    something which shelters the polity of Britain. This strange
                                    hybridization of blood and oak, human and tree, through its very
                                    overdetermination, performs a rhetorical intensification which
                                    separates him from his predecessors. By collapsing the
                                    distinction between humans and plants, Burke has opened the door
                                    for a racial interpretation of the constitution: “we have
                                    given our frame of polity the image of a relation in
                                    blood”. And this racialization of governance lays claim to
                                    historical constancy by aligning itself with the durability at
                                    the heart of the oak figure. The tension between the symbolics
                                    of blood nascent in Burke’s analogy between family and
                                    constitution on the one hand, and the more subtle invocation of
                                    the tree on the other, not only signals the struggle to
                                    re-define the oak figure for a new imperial era, but also opens
                                    the door for—and perhaps even demands—a re-evaluation of the
                                    relationship between extension and duration in the notion of
                                    British liberty.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I am

                  <p>As with my analysis of Hodges, we need to go back to the global war
                                    of the early 1780s in order to move forward. In early December
                                    of 1781, less than two months after Cornwallis’s surrender
                                    at Yorktown, William Cowper sent an imaginary “sociable
                                    conversation” to his friend Joseph Hill in which Cowper
                                    articulated his thoughts on the American War. After stating that
                                    he knew of no one up to the task of leading Britain out of the
                                    conflict, Cowper offered the following summary of the state of
                                    the empire: <quote>If we pursue the war, it is because we are
                                          desperate; it is plunging and sinking year after year in
                                          still greater depths of calamity. If we relinquish it, the
                                          remedy is equally desperate, and would prove, I believe,
                                          in the end no remedy at all. Either way we are
                                          undone—perseverance will only enfeeble us more, we cannot
                                          recover the Colonies by arms. If we discontinue the
                                          attempt, in that case we fling away voluntarily, what in
                                          the other we strive ineffectually to regain, and whether
                                          we adopt the one measure or the other, are equally undone.
                                          For I consider the loss of America as the ruin of England;
                                          were we less encumbered than we are, at home, we could but
                                          ill afford it, but being crushed as we are under an
                                          enormous debt that the public credit can at no rate carry
                                          much longer, the consequence is sure. Thus it appears to
                                          me that we are squeezed to death between the two sides of
                                          that sort of alternative, which is commonly called a cleft
                                          stick, the most threat’ning and portentous condition
                                          in which the interests of any country can possibly be
                                          found. <note place="foot" resp="editors">William

                     </quote> Of the myriad statements of imperial doom from this
                                    period, Cowper’s remark stands out because the metaphor of
                                    the cleft stick captures the predicament of imperial
                                    subjectivity at this moment so vividly. To be cleft is to be
                                    split or divided to a certain depth, but the expression “a
                                    cleft stick” uses the notion of bifurcation to figure the
                                    two horns of a dilemma: as the OED states, it indicates “a
                                    position in which advance and retreat are alike
                                    impossible”. For Cowper, the nation, and by extension the
                                    imperial subject, is entangled to the point of being unable to
                                    move. Disentangling the imperial subject from this painful,
                                    static, almost abject, position involves a phantasmatic
                                    re-configuration of the political beyond the limits of specific
                                    policies and actions. In short, the predicament seems to call
                                    forth a new kind of political and poetic utterance.</p>
                  <p>For Cowper and others, the reverses of the early 1780s, both in
                                    America and in other colonial locales, raised the simultaneous
                                    possibility that British culture may die and yet live on in a
                                    ghostly form elsewhere. The complex temporality of this ghosting
                                    procedure and the figural attempts to keep it under control are
                                    the primary focus of the reading which follows. In Hodges, I
                                    demonstrated one example of how past losses could be refigured
                                    as future domination. Cowper’s <title level="a">Yardley
                                          Oak</title> enacts a similar phantasmatic displacement of
                                    past losses. The crucial difference is that Cowper’s
                                    focuses far less on the compensatory fantasy of domination over
                                    colonial others, but rather on the renewed fantasy of national
                                    consolidation.</p>
                  <p>The political dilemma presented in Cowper’s letter
                                    presupposes a strong sense of the integration of colony and
                                    metropole. For Cowper, the loss of America implies the ruin of
                                    England; his thoughts on the non-distinction of England and
                                    America emerge frequently in his letters, but nowhere more
                                    explicitly than in the following missive to John Newton:
                                          <quote>I consider England and America as once one country.
                                          They were so in respect of interest, intercourse, and
                                          affinity. A great earthquake has made a partition, and now
                                          the Atlantic Ocean flows between them. He that can drain
                                          that Ocean, and shove the two shores together so as to
                                          make them aptly coincide and meet each other in every
                                          part, can unite them again; but this is the work for
                                          Omnipotence, and nothing less than Omnipotence can heal
                                          the breach between us. (1:569-70)</quote> What is strange
                                    about this account of the American war is that it forgets that
                                    the Atlantic Ocean has always separated the colonies from the
                                    British Isles. Cowper here imagines a pre-revolutionary state
                                    which negates the very material structure of the globe. In this
                                    fantasy it is contiguity that matters most: the shores must
                                    “aptly coincide”. It is a figure of an organic whole
                                    rent asunder, which in some ideal future state could be sutured
                                    together again by none other than God himself. God’s role
                                    here is important because elsewhere in both the poems and the
                                    letters from this period, Cowper emphasizes that this fatal
                                    wound—here it is naturalized as an earthquake—is inflicted by
                                    Providence because England is a “sinfull Nation”
                                    (2:104). Like many other commentators at this juncture, Cowper
                                    felt that England had been hollowed out from within and held
                                    aristocratic dissipation and political corruption to be the
                                    undoing of both the empire and the nation. But as in the
                                    cleft-stick passage, agency has been fully wrested from
                                    politicians and citizens and is transferred to a divine
                                    non-human process. Failed military and state policy not only are
                                    subsumed into a narrative of irrevocable decline and fall, but
                                    also are corrected in a field where men have little or no active
                                    role to play. </p>
                  <p>Roughly ten years after Cowper’s appraisal of the end of the
                                    American war, he found himself again contemplating the
                                    destruction of the nation, only this time he deploys a cultural
                                    rather than a natural trope for disintegration: <quote>I am
                                          entirely of your mind respecting this conflagration by
                                          which all Europe suffers at present, and is likely to
                                          suffer for a long time to come. The same mistake seems to
                                          have prevailed as in the American business. We then
                                          flattered ourselves that the colonies would prove an easy
                                          conquest, and when all the neighbour nations arm’d
                                          themselves against France, we imagined I believe that she
                                          too would be presently vanquish’d. But we begin
                                          already to be undeceived, and God only knows to what a
                                          degree we may find we have erred, at the conclusion. Such
                                          however is the state of things all around us, as reminds
                                          me continually of the Psalmist’s expression—<emph>He
                                                shall break them in pieces like a potter’s
                                                vessel</emph>, and I rather wish than hope in some
                                          of my melancholy moods that England herself may escape a
                                          fracture. (4.426) </quote> As a figure, the broken shards

                     </quote> Cowper’s address does two things.
                                    First it establishes a relation of intimacy between this last
                                    surviving oak and the aged speaker. This is achieved by
                                    constructing the effect of physical proximity between speaker
                                    and oak: the poem’s descriptive specificity is one of the
                                    poem’s most prominent rhetorical strategies. And this
                                    effect of intimacy is intensified almost immediately by the
                                    syntactical ambiguity introduced by the parenthetical phrase in
                                    line three. Cowper’s sudden specification of the
                                    speaker’s age suspends the syntax at the end of line four
                                    and thus allows “A shatter’d vet’ran” in
                                    line 4 to figure not only for the oak, but also for the speaker.
                                    This figural ambiguity sets up the possibility for complex
                                    identifications between the speaker and the tree which will have
                                    important political ramifications as the poem unfolds. At this
                                    point it is enough to recognize that this establishes the
                                    potential for precisely the same collapse between the body of
                                    the subject and the arborial figure for governance that animated
                                    Burke’s overdetermined deployment of the oak in the <title level="m">Reflections</title>. As we will see, Cowper does
                                    not allow that collapse to occur.</p>
                  <p>But this isn’t all that is achieved here. The metaphorical
                                    comparison between the oak tree and “the shatter’d
                                    vet’ran” also activates the memory of past war—and
                                    not the triumphalism following the Seven Year’s War, but
                                    rather the sense of loss characteristic of Cowper’s
                                    remarks on the American war. I believe that this phrase evokes
                                    the wounded veteran of the American war and this oak is
                                    shattered like the potter’s vessel alluded to in
                                    Cowper’s 1793 letter. The full connotations of this
                                    metaphor are not activated until seventy lines later, but it is
                                    the central enigma of the poem. In what sense is the tree
                                    shattered and in what way is it a veteran?</p>
                  <p>These questions are temporarily supplanted by an explicit statement
                                    of the desire to venerate the tree, which concludes the first

                     </quote> This is a rather startling turn because it
                                    suggests that veneration of the oak is not only a form of pagan
                                    idolatry, but also akin to Adam’s attempt to hide from
                                    God’s view after consciously breaking God’s explicit
                                    proscription. The allusion to Book 9 of <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> is deeply significant because the
                                    “thickest shades” referred to here are not offered
                                    by oak trees. Adam expresses the desire to be “Obscured
                                    where highest woods impenetrable/To star or sunlight spread
                                    their umbrage broad” (1086-7) and ultimately chooses the

                     </quote> As Balachandra Rajan has argued, the
                                    evocation of the banyan tree from Milton speaks directly to the
                                    question of shelter (60-1). Adam chooses the tree because it
                                    provides shade, or in Cowper’s phrase “gloom”.
                                    To venerate the oak for its shelter is to misrecognize it as the
                                    banyan and the spiritual cost is, in Cowper’s eyes,
                                    catastrophic: it is further evidence of the nation’s
                                    alienation from God. In this context, the verb
                                    “might” in line 8 of <title level="a">Yardley
                                          Oak</title> becomes crucial, for it signifies temptation
                                    and the speaker’s resistance to it. The speaker might have
                                    worshiped the tree, except for his belief that to do so would be
                                    to be attempting to hide from one’s responsibility before
                                    God.</p>
                  <p>When we recognize that the capacity to provide shade is precisely
                                    the feature of the figure that is so appealing to Burke, then I
                                    think the full import of Cowper’s intervention becomes
                                    clear. For Cowper, the loss of the American colonies and the
                                    predicted failure of the war with France amount to symptomatic
                                    signs of God’s displeasure with the corruption of British
                                    liberty, both at a national and imperial level. What is
                                    remarkable here is that Cowper’s opening verse paragraph
                                    activates the entire historical predicament with such iconic
                                    specificity: the shattered oak, the banyan tree, the sense of a
                                    nation deformed and hollowed out from the inside. But most
                                    importantly their collocation suggests that all of these
                                    connotations are comparable to one another and to the speaker
                                    himself. This collocation lies beneath my decision to consider
                                    the banyan and the oak in the same essay, because it implies
                                    that these figures, like India and Britain, are bound up in a
                                    global historical dynamic.</p>
                  <p>As the poem unfolds, the two primary elements of the oak
                                    figure—extension and duration—are scrutinized historically; and
                                    by this I mean that their figural potential is tested against
                                    the historical moment of 1791. Cowper’s evaluation of this
                                    moment in Britain’s history is dire and the poem is
                                    suffused with a sense of past or passing glory. As one might
                                    expect, Cowper plays out the “mutability in all/That we
                                    account most durable below” (70-1), and traces “thy
                                    growth/From almost nullity into a state/Of matchless grandeur,
                                    and declension thence/Slow into such magnificent decay.”
                                    (87-90) The pun on “state” bolsters the direct
                                    assertion that Britain is in a condition of irrevocable, but
                                    nonetheless majesterial, decline. It is almost the same language
                                    used by Hodges to describe the obsolescence of the Mughal
                                    dynasty.</p>

                     </quote> It is hard not to think of Pope’s
                                          <title level="a">Windsor Forest</title> here, especially
                                    since Cowper’s presentation of the oak’s potential
                                    use in the construction of warships and merchant vessels tallies
                                    so well with Pope’s double understanding—both military and
                                    commercial—of the rush of oaken timber around the globe. The
                                    oak addressed in this poem’s opening line is a “sole
                                    survivor” not because it has been the object of symbolic
                                    veneration, but rather because its “brethren” have
                                    become the material basis for imperial wars that Cowper clearly
                                    signals have more to do with the hubris of politicians than the
                                    benefit of the state. Again Cowper is reiterating his frequently
                                    stated reservations about the failure of corrupt politicians to
                                    recognize the true interests of the nation. As the passage
                                    unfolds, it becomes clear that man destroyed the forest for
                                    ill-advised war, and now it is only a matter for Time to finish
                                    the task by “disjoining” atom by atom this
                                    “shatter’d vet’ran” (103-8) .</p>
                  <p>But nestled within this fairly explicit critique is a very subtle
                                    gesture. Imperial war is evoked by the pun on “tortuous
                                    arms”, but by focussing the reader’s attention on a
                                    fairly arcane element of ship-building—knee timber—Cowper
                                    consigns the “arms” figure to the notes, only to
                                    activate it in a surprisingly brutal fashion in the next verse
                                    paragraph. At the most explicit comparison between the oak and
                                    the state, the speaker suddenly discloses that the tree affords
                                    no shelter because it has no limbs:<quote>

                     </quote> The suspension of the tree’s lack of
                                    limbs until this point is extremely shocking because it disjoins
                                    this particular tree from the usual political connotations of
                                    the emblematic oak figure. And yet the figure of the
                                    tree’s arms reveals itself to be exceedingly complex. If
                                    we understand arms to signify the martial capacity of Georgian
                                    England, particularly its naval strength, then the poem
                                    recognizes that the diffusion of liberty which was so integral
                                    to early theories of empire relies on the felling of oaks such
                                    as the one being addressed by the speaker. But the corruption of
                                    ministers, and the implicit sinfulness of the nation, have
                                    generated a situation where “Thine arms have left
                                    thee” in both senses of the word. After the loss of the
                                    American war, one can no longer simply assume that Britain can
                                    successfully protect its imperial holdings through force of
                                    arms, nor can one assume that the symbolic shelter afforded by
                                    the boughs of the constitution will protect the citizenry. The
                                    implication is that both the military, and what Burke described
                                    as the frame of the polity, have been “pulverized by
                                    venality”. So the reader is presented with a particularly
                                    dangerous situation where the diffusion of liberty through
                                    empire—here figured by the propagation of ships from oaks—has
                                    undercut one of its fundamental principles—the notion that the
                                    state through its laws will, like the oak, shelter the people.
                                    It is the same organic loop that allowed Cowper to understand
                                    the loss of America as equivalent to the loss of England. </p>
                  <p>With the loss of its arms, the tree’s capacity to figure
                                    forth shelter has been permanently compromised. From this
                                    figural dismemberment comes a different possibility for
                                    metaphor. This tree becomes notable not for its arms, but for
                                    its screaming mouth: <quote>

                                    the capacity to subdue enemies and to provide shelter for the
                                    polity shorn away, the tree becomes a remarkable figure for the
                                    poet. It becomes a mouth calling for sustenance from the sky so
                                    that it can sustain the only thing worth sustaining—its roots.

                        </quote> The speaker goes on to narrate a
                                          remarkable scene in which the uprooting of a myrtle tree
                                          yields “Black bloody drops distill'd upon the
                                          ground” (3.29). The tree eventually speaks and
                                          reveals that in death Polydore has been transformed into a
                                          myrtle tree. If we allow this allusion to play out then
                                          the speaker’s encounter with the Yardley Oak
                                          presages a restoration of empire. I would like to thank
                                          Theresa Kelley for directing me to these lines. </note> It
                                    is in this sense that the tree is a “shatter’d
                                    vet’ran” and why the syntactical ambiguity which
                                    allows the phrase to also refer to the speaker in the opening
                                    verse paragraph is so important. Cowper is laying the groundwork
                                    for a different kind of relationship between patriotic poet and
                                    national figure. There is an analogy between tree and speaker
                                    here, but it does not conform to Burke’s
                                    “philosophical analogy” between constitution and
                                    blood. The analogy does not rest on the capacity for
                                    auto-generation nascent in Burke’s naturalization of the
                                    constitution or in Hodges’s fantasy of the banyan tree as
                                    an auto-reproductive structure, but rather on the capacity for
                                    mediating between sky and soil that Cowper aligns not only with
                                    expressivity, but also with patriotic Christian humility. This
                                    mediating function in the face of physical, spiritual and
                                    national decline is the ultimate task of the poet in the time of
                                    national and imperial crisis, when the oak can no longer protect
                                    anyone due to ill usage.</p>
                  <p>It is in this light that the poem’s truncated ending—the poem
                                    remained incomplete—gains its resonance. At the very moment that
                                    the speaker declares that the tree is bereft of arms and
                                    un-memorialized, he also insists that the tree endures:<quote>

                     </quote> The question which remains is what is to be
                                    done with this “sweet force” in the face of
                                    decrepitude. What is the dismembered tree/nation/poet to do? The
                                    “yonder upstarts of the neighbour wood” are
                                    presented as signs of the future. The fact that the poem does
                                    not specify their species is, I think, important because
                                    “upstarts” may be referring to the revolutionaries
                                    of a neighbouring nation—especially at the time when this poem
                                    was composed.</p>
                  <p>But whether Cowper is referring to France or to new patriots in
                                    Britain is not crucial. What follows in both the cancelled and
                                    the retained versions of the poem is an explicit adoption of a
                                    pedagogical stance. Since the “shatter’d
                                    vet’ran” can no longer speak, its double, the
                                    oracular poet, must perform:<quote>

                     </quote> The way “Myself” is stranded at
                                    the beginning of line 141 is for me one of the differential
                                    marks through which we could define Romanticism, for it is here
                                    that an entire political narrative, an entire political
                                    symbolics, is suddenly transformed into an example of what not
                                    to do. History’s dismemberment of the oak has allowed the
                                    poet to suddenly and boldly speak to and for the figure in what
                                    is described as a theatrical space. But he does so while
                                    “seated here/On thy distorted root”. He does not
                                    become the tree, but rather contends with disfiguration. It is
                                    in this light that the poem’s obsession with the contorted
                                    structures of the ruined tree, its distorted roots and tortuous
                                    arms, is so important. The figure has been disfigured and that
                                    spectacle demands a performance where private desire and public
                                    discourse intersect in a profound engagement with the past. In
                                    retrospect, could we not simply state that Cowper’s sense
                                    of dismemberment, traceable to the global crisis which would
                                    reconfigure the Atlantic imperium and re-orient the entire
                                    project of empire, has called forth the performance of
                                    Romanticism? That the poem leaves off at this point is apt, not
                                    only because the September massacres would so radically call
                                    into question the hope expressed for the “Spring”,
                                    but also because Cowper had cleared the ground, or allowed
                                    future readers such as Wordsworth and Clare to see how the
                                    ground was cleared for their future utterances.</p>

                  <p>The third of Sir Walter Scott’s Waverley novels, <title level="m">The
                     Antiquary</title> was published in 1816 and set in 1794. It was Scott’s
                  favorite among his novels and of them all displays the most playful consciousness
                  of itself as a fiction. Historic struggles elsewhere in the series are fought to a
                  close by characters who, according to Lukács, engage in them as types of
                  whole contending classes. Here some of the same conflicts appear in a belated and
                  oddly inconsequential staging—Marx might say, as farce—with characters whose
                  enactments of political struggle the novel tends to expose as fantasy. “In
                     <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>,” as Ian Duncan writes,
                  “Scott undertakes what might be called the Shandyfication of historical
                  romance, glossing his earlier fiction and its cultural themes in a self-reflexive
                  and metafictional novel in which ‘nothing happens’” (<title level="m">Scott’s Shadow</title> 139).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For much of the twentieth century criticism of the Waverley
                     novels had their place in the history of realism as its dominant topic; the
                     facetiousness of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>’s representation
                     of history made it for this criticism a marginal title in the series.
                     Duncan’s treatment of the work results from his stated aim of taking
                     seriously the fictional character of Scott’s novels. The novel’s
                     stress on the unreliability of antiquarian narratives has led other critics to
                     adopt it as a key text in readings of Scott as a novelist whose realism is
                     strongly qualified by skepticism and a belief in the contingency of
                     representations of the past; see Elam and McCracken-Flesher. The novel has also
                     attracted interest as one of several among the Waverley novels in which the
                     claim of historical realism coexists more or less uneasily with an adoption of
                     the conventions of gothic; see Robertson.</note> The conflict of the Stewart
                  and Hanoverian monarchies thus dwindles into the after-dinner quarrels of Jonathan
                  Oldbuck, the antiquary of the title, and his neighbor, Sir Arthur Wardour.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a bravura return to Lukàcs as an
                     interpreter of Scott in an essay that, unlike Lukàcs himself, deals at
                     length with <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>, see Maxwell. Regarding the
                     “emptiness” of history in the Waverley novels, of which the
                     non-events of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> provide the essay’s
                     paradigm, see Maxwell 444 and 455.</note> Their respective descents, from a
                  German Protestant printer and refugee and from a Norman knight, establish their
                  figural relation to the rival parties of 1688, 1715, and 1745. In spite of Wardour
                  and Oldbuck’s quarrels, the novel’s topic is historical closure; it
                  argues that the struggles these characters seem to represent are actually
                  concluded, and that both are in practice loyal subjects of a united Britain, who
                  share a single class position as members of the landed gentry. The differences
                  between them are mere remainders and are appropriately staged by their
                  disagreements about the value of old coins, curiosities, and other relics. These
                  disagreements arise, in their most elementary form, from the absence of single
                  standard of <emph>price</emph>, which thus functions in the novel as the belated
                  afterimage of a century-long absence in Scotland of a single accepted
                     monarch.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the argument that
                     antiquarianism’s “family resemblance to commerce” makes it
                     the “negation” of traditionalism in Lee 78-79.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since Lukács first read Scott in this way, much of the best criticism of his
                  fiction has adopted his conception of its characters as types, even when putting
                  it in service of political and historiographic arguments that differ widely from
                     his.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Welsh treats
                     Scott’s protagonists as types of a particular historical formation of
                     masculinity in relation to landed property in his <title level="m">The Hero of the Waverley Novels</title>. 
                        More recently, Ian Duncan has read the characters of the Waverley novels as types of contrasting
                     narrative genres and discursive modes, whose dialectical engagement the novel
                     stages through their interaction—see Duncan <title level="m">Modern
                        Romance and Transformations of the Novel</title>. Among critical works on
                     Scott for which character is not a crucial analytic category, I should note
                     readings of the Waverley novels’ construction of authorship in Ferris and
                     Wilt. As I shall do in this essay, Wilt argues that there is a homology between
                     the quest romance structure of the Waverley novels and their production of
                     authorship as self-concealment.</note> In the first section of this essay,
                  however, we will discuss problems of identifying and representing money that do
                  not operate in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> only at the level of
                  character. Individual characters disagree about what counts as money, or show
                  irrational preferences for one representative of money over another. The novel
                  itself embraces difference and mediation in the money form; money proper—in
                  the form of silver, which in 1794 still provided the legal standard for British
                  money—appears in it only as an alien and unintelligible intruder. Standard money,
                  moreover, proves alien not only to the historical setting the novel represents,
                  but also to its own diegetic conventions. Its appearance produces a crux, not only
                  in the novel’s historical representation, but also in its text.</p>
                  <p>When in chapter 22 Wardour presents Oldbuck “as a gift of friendship”
                  with a collection of antique coins and medals, begging him to choose those that
                  will improve his collection, he initiates a sequence of misunderstandings. Wardour
                  owes Oldbuck money—and is in fact offering the gift as propitiation before
                  requesting a further loan—so Oldbuck proposes to take the pieces at their
                  catalogue valuation as partial payment of the debt. Wardour objects both to the
                  confusion of a gift with payment, and more centrally to the catalogue itself, with
                  its implication that the curiosity’s value derives from the auction room
                  rather than from the mere facts of age and association with the crown. Oldbuck
                  himself shows a different kind of scepticism about market prices when he finally
                  values the gold and silver pieces at twenty guineas in bullion and as much more
                  only “to such fools as ourselves, who are willing to pay for
                  curiosity” (<title level="m">The Antiquary</title> ch. 22; Scott <title level="m">The Waverley Novels</title> 3: 217). The market, in this final view,
                  would be a confederation of fools who collectively drive the curiosity’s
                  price over what Oldbuck ironically pretends to believe is its only real value,
                  that of the bullion it contains.</p>
                  <p>The problem of valuing the curiosity involves both characters in contradiction.
                  Wardour owes Oldbuck a money debt, but offers him coins on which he does not want
                  to set a money value. Oldbuck proposes first to cite their value <emph>in</emph>
                  money, then to value them <emph>as</emph> money. For each of them the curiosity
                  flashes into existence, either as a gift or as a commodity in its own right, only
                  as the negation of money. The recurring difficulty of valuing old and curious
                  artifacts that Yoon Sun Lee has noted in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> is
                  especially acute in this episode because in the case of old coins the
                  indeterminate value of the curiosity is the mirror-image of the indeterminacy of
                  circulating coin, a trait of late eighteenth-century Scotland that forms one of
                  the novel’s minor recurring themes.</p>
                  <p>Jonathan Oldbuck’s collecting mania is an object of mild satire throughout
                  the novel; the major vehicle for this satire is the beggar Edie Ochiltree.
                  Ochiltree is the novel’s principal truth-teller, repository of secrets, and
                  returner of persons and things to their proper places. One of his running jokes at
                  Oldbuck’s expense concerns the antiquary’s exchange of
                  “siller” with a packman for an artifact he believed to be an old coin.
                  Twice in the novel Ochiltree reminds him of this transaction, tormenting him with
                  the fact that the supposed “auld coin” had actually proved only to be
                  a “bodle” (<title level="m">Antiquary</title> chs. 4, 44; <title level="m">WN</title> 2: 42, 400). This joke is odder than it at first seems,
                  since the bodle was a copper two penny piece of the old Scots coinage, which had
                  nominally been superseded at the Act of Union in 1707.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ochiltree’s Scots vernacular refers to money as either
                     “siller” or “gowd.” He distinguishes regularly between
                     the two, refusing gifts of gold as excessive, and begging only for silver. In
                     this respect, as in others, the novel is meticulous in its registration of the
                     heterogeneity of the circulating currency in late eighteenth-century
                     Scotland.</note> The bodle itself was last minted in 1697 (Stewart 117); since
                  the old Scots currency was converted into Sterling at the rate of twelve to one,
                  it might after the Union be said to have the value of one sixth of a
                  penny—though legally it had no monetary value at all. In 1794 a bodle would
                  thus have to be at least 97 years old; it would also have been a relic of
                  Scotland’s former status as an independent state with its own mint. Why does
                  Edie Ochiltree, apparently with the novel’s endorsement, take it for granted
                  that a bodle is not an “auld coin”?</p>
                  <p>The episode demonstrates both the indeterminacy of the category
                  ‘money’ and the curiosity’s status as money’s negative
                  image. The reason the bodle doesn’t count as an old coin in 1794 appears to
                  be that even a century after the last example was minted it still counts as money.
                  At the union the gold and silver Scots coinage was reminted to the English
                  standard; not so the copper. Nor was there anywhere in Britain enough copper
                  minted during the eighteenth century to supply the need for change. The result was
                  a dilapidated and heterogeneous copper circulation throughout the country, the
                  more so the further one got from the Mint in London. In the latter part of the
                  eighteenth century some merchants and manufacturers took to issuing their own
                  copper tokens to supply the needs of local trade. This practice, illegal though
                  tolerated, was especially common in Scotland (Stewart 124 and plate XX). Such
                  tokens continued to be issued into the nineteenth century; some were merely old
                  coins stamped with a new countermark: an 1811 example of such recycled coinage was
                  made from old bodles (Stewart 166), which suggests a terminal date for their
                  circulation as originally minted.</p>
                  <p>The problematic relation of the curiosity to current coin is not the only form in
                  which <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> represents money’s
                  inhomogeneity and the consequent difficulty of identifying it. More important to
                  the plot than Oldbuck’s purchase of ambiguous coins is the duping of his
                  neighbor by a German named Dousterswivel. Dousterswivel’s swindle is to take
                  Wardour’s money as a fee, offering in exchange to discover by occult arts,
                  first a lead mine, then hoards of silver and gold supposedly hidden on his
                  property in the ruined priory of St. Ruth’s. During the course of the novel
                  Wardour is bilked of his entire fortune, with the eventual result that his
                  property is seized by creditors and he narrowly avoids bankruptcy.</p>
                  <p>Like Oldbuck’s pursuit of the curiosity, his neighbor’s quixotic
                  pursuit of gold and silver takes the form of an irrational exchange of money for
                  money. While Oldbuck makes himself ridiculous by exchanging good silver for bad
                  copper, Dousterswivel appeals to his victims by promising not only to multiply
                  their money, but to change its kind: "If you join wid Sir Arthur, as he is put in
                  one hundred and fifty—see, here is one fifty in your dirty Fairport banknote—you
                  shall put in one other hundred and fifty in de dirty notes, and you shall have de
                  pure gold and silver, I cannot tell how much!" (<title level="m">Antiquary</title>
                  ch. 23; <title level="m">WN</title> 3: 218). Dousterswivel’s arts will
                  transmute money from mere dirt into something sublime.</p>
                  <p>In the Lacanian formula for the sublime, it is an object that has been raised to
                  the dignity of the Thing; that is to say, it is an object that can appear to fill
                  the gap or pay the debt on which the Symbolic order is founded (Lacan 126, 134).
                  In Scott, the promise of such an object always turns out to be a snare:
                  Wardour’s acceptance of the offer to produce pure gold and silver in
                  exchange for paper money leads him to spend his entire fortune and everything he
                  can borrow. His debts are paid in the end with bills of exchange supplied by the
                  novel’s pseudonymous hero Lovel in a resolution that restores the
                  circulation of symbolic as well as monetary debt, since Lovel’s gift is
                  ultimately repaid by his marriage to Wardour’s daughter.</p>
                  <p>In the interim, however, Doutserswivel’s diggings in fact prove to contain
                  silver ingots worth £1000. These have "neither inscription nor stamp upon
                  them, excepting one, which seemed to be Spanish" (<title level="m">The
                     Antiquary</title> ch. 23; <title level="m">WN</title> 3: 225). Their origin is
                  a mystery, especially to Dousterswivel, who is deluded by the discovery to believe
                  in his own spells, and ultimately led to become his own greatest dupe. Eventually,
                  the silver turns out to have been left as a gift for the almost-bankrupt Baronet
                  to find. Both the medium of the gift—unstamped silver—and the means of conveying
                  it have been chosen to conceal that its source is Lovel, his daughter’s
                  suitor.</p>
                  <p>Lovel’s courtship of Sir Arthur’s daughter Isabella is the
                  novel’s principal narrative thread; he believes himself to be illegitimate,
                  and the bar to his suit is a prejudice against illegitimacy that has been handed
                  down in the Wardour family ever since its founding. The blank surface of the
                  silver ingots he leaves for the baronet both conceals his identity and figures the
                  bastard’s lack of a proper name. But the romance-plot of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> is oriented towards the discovery at its close that the
                  hero is not illegitimate at all. He was raised as the illegitimate son of Geraldin
                  Neville, in Yorkshire, but discovers that Neville had in fact only adopted and not
                  fathered him. When his adoptive father refused to reveal his real paternity, the
                  son renounced his name and took the fictitious one of Lovel. He inherits the
                  mysterious silver from Neville, who dies in the course of the novel; it had come
                  to Neville as plate from the family of Glenallan, of which Lovel/Neville’s
                  real father is the head. The novel as Scott published it affirms that the blank
                  silver ingots which make it possible for the son to conceal his identity—as Lovel
                  or Neville—had originally been melted down to conceal <emph>from him</emph> the
                  identity he bears without knowing it as the heir of Glenallan, with whose arms the
                  silver plate would have been stamped.</p>
                  <p>The silver ingots at the center of this episode appear to resolve the problem we
                  began with, that of money’s indeterminate identity. Britain in the
                  eighteenth century was nominally on a silver standard; the silver coinage was in
                  such poor condition, however, that legislation of 1774 provided that silver would
                  be legal tender for debts of over £25 only by weight, not by tale
                  (Kindleberger 61). A box of silver ingots would in 1794 have been the most exact
                  possible representation of money as such. In this form, money is antithetical to
                  symbolic identity; the blank surface of the silver figures the effaced names of
                  those through whose hands it has passed and the illegibility of its own
                  history.</p>
                  <p>The effects of Scott’s representation of money as a materialized gap in the
                  Symbolic, however, are not confined within the frame of his novel. The
                  impossibility of accounting for the silver’s appearance in
                  Dousterswivel’s excavations is a problem that the novel shares with its own
                  characters. The sentences from chapter 45 (<title level="m">WN</title> 3: 408-09)
                  that provide the narrative summarized above are, like the novel’s
                  protagonist, of dubious legitimacy. They are uttered by “Lovel”
                  himself, and, as we have seen, they explain that the silver’s ultimate
                  source was his father the Earl of Glenallan. At this point in the novel, however,
                  “Lovel” does not yet <emph>know</emph> his true descent—that
                  discovery is reserved for the following paragraph. His explanation of the
                  silver’s source thus assumes information he does not yet possess. The
                  novel’s latest editor, David Hewitt, has discovered that this error in its
                  diegesis was introduced into the novel as an authorial revision. Scott originally
                  had “Lovel” explain that he bought the silver from a bank that had
                  recently imported it, and it is this version that Hewitt prints in his 1995
                  Edinburgh edition. Scott changed the story on the verso of his original manuscript
                  before the relevant passage had been set up in type, though, and it was the
                  revised version that appeared in print, both in the first edition and in each of
                  the two or three subsequent editions that he oversaw.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the rationale of this emendation to his first edition base
                     text, see Hewitt 390. See 370-80 for the evolution of the text through

                  </p>
                  <p>Scott’s plot required that the money-hoard uncovered by Dousterswivel should
                  have no legible history. It hence could not have been paper, or even coin. But the
                  Scottish monetary system in the second half of the eighteenth century afforded no
                  very plausible source of specie. Unlike England, where gold and silver were in
                  general circulation owing to a ban on banknotes of less than £5 (Kindleberger
                  78), in Scotland small denomination banknotes had driven most gold and silver out
                  of circulation. Much of what precious metal did make its way to Scotland was used
                  to pay debts in England, which enjoyed a trade surplus with Scotland throughout
                  the eighteenth century. The effect on Scottish money and banking was notorious: in
                  1776 Adam Smith estimated the whole Scottish circulation at £2 million, of
                  which no more than a quarter was in gold and silver (1: 316). Scott writes in 1826
                  of Scotland as a nation that had adopted paper money because it “is too poor
                  to retain a circulating medium of the precious metals” (<title level="m">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</title> 3: 350).</p>
                  <p>The unlikelihood of finding £1000 worth of silver at a rural Scottish bank in
                  1794 seems to have led Scott to revise his original account. Hewitt retains the
                  deleted reading in the name of narrative coherence, but at the cost of introducing
                  an historical and textual anomaly. Needing to represent an embodiment of money
                  whose history is as illegible as its protagonist’s, the novel succeeds too
                  well, and produces one of whose history its own text can provide only defective
                  accounts. The representation of money as such opens an irreducible textual
                  fault.</p>
                  <p>This fault does not arise from the divided political allegiance of
                  eighteenth-century Scots, but from divided allegiance among Scott’s modern
                  editors with respect to the authority of manuscript and print.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the appendix to this essay for a discussion of
                     the treatment of this and other textual problems in the Edinburgh Edition of
                     the Waverley Novels (EEWN).</note> The reason for this divided allegiance lies
                  in the social process by which Scott and others produced the historical phenomenon
                  that was the Waverley Novels. That <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> sets its
                  representation of money as such in this crux suggests that, rather than reading
                  its blank money and nameless hero as <emph>types</emph> of a crisis of political
                  authority in eighteenth-century Scotland, we should take all of these
                  representations out of the historical setting in which Scott placed them, and
                  consider them as <emph>allegorical</emph> presentations of a nineteenth-century
                  crisis in the process of literary production.</p>

                  <p>“Mr. Cadell, there is a certain thing called Capital. You should look to
                  that, for these times are bad, and your transactions very large” (Constable
                  3: 361). Thus the manager of an Edinburgh bank to Robert Cadell, Archibald
                  Constable’s junior partner, in the fall of 1815. Constable had already
                  published the first two Waverley novels and had the third, which was to be <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>, under contract; it was eventually published in
                  May of 1816. Publishing Scott was an expensive business as well as a lucrative
                  one, and, as this rebuff implies, Constable carried it on for the most part with
                  borrowed money. In refusing to extend further credit, Cadell’s interlocutor
                  tells him that the amount of his firm’s transactions with borrowed money is
                  already in disproportion to the small size of its own capital.</p>
                  <p>Cadell must have found it a heavy-handed irony to be addressed not as if his firm
                  had too little capital, but as if he had never heard of it. Like other rhetorical
                  figures that sometimes intrude on discussions of money (“Do you think
                  I’m made of money?” “Money doesn’t grow on trees”)
                  however, this one suggests a problem of reference for which its extravagance is a
                  kind of compensation. <emph>Is</emph> capital a thing? How sure can anyone, even a
                  banker, be of recognizing it when they see it? </p>
                  <p>Marx’s elementary formula for capital in Vol. 1 of <title level="m">Capital</title>, M-C-M, designates the exchange of money for a commodity that
                  is once more sold as money. For our purposes, the central point of this formula is
                  that it locates the identity of capital in the money form. Though capital may and
                  indeed must repeatedly assume the form of commodities, these commodities’
                  identity as capital depends upon their eventual retransformation into money. The
                  commodity is capital’s “disguised” mode of existence, while
                  money is its “general” one; capital’s “identity with
                  itself” can be affirmed only by its repeated re-embodiment of itself in
                  money (Marx 255).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For discussion of capital
                     as a subject in Marx, see Postone 75-81.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Marx money is both a commodity, the material product of social labor, and the
                  mediator of other commodities’ value. As capital, however, money is a
                  mediator that appears to mediate itself; at the center of <title level="m">Capital</title> is the critique of this appearance. For Marx the appearance of
                  capital’s self-identity belongs to metaphysics, and he satirizes the way it
                  “differentiates . . . itself from itself” while still remaining the
                  same by comparing it to the theology of the Incarnation, according to which
                  “God the Father differentiates himself as God the Son” (256).</p>
                  <p>The project of <title level="m">Capital</title> is to dissolve this appearance of
                  capital’s identity. In discussing Scott, we are concerned with an historical
                  moment at which that appearance has scarcely yet been constituted. If money is the
                  medium in which capital identifies itself, Scott wrote at a time and in a place
                  where the money supply was in practice extremely heterogeneous and monetary theory
                  was a hotly debated topic in political economy. As we have seen, in Scotland
                  throughout the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the circulating
                  currency mostly comprised notes of Scottish joint-stock banks and dilapidated
                  token coin. Legal tender coin minted in England was rarely found there. Between
                  1797 and 1817, moreover, all of Britain was in the anomalous position of having
                     <emph>no</emph> legal tender in circulation. Owing to the exigencies of
                  wartime, the government prohibited the Bank of England from paying out gold and
                  allowed issues of small-denomination bank notes to circulate in its place.<note place="foot" resp="editors">From 1797 to 1821 the Bank Restriction Act
                     forbade the Bank of England from redeeming its notes in gold. From 1817, the
                     Bank began to mint gold in the form of a new coin with a one-pound face value,
                     the sovereign. Owing to the overissue of notes that Restriction made possible,
                     however, most of the early sovereigns were immediately taken out of the country
                     rather than being used in Britain at a depreciated value. See Clapham 2:
                     63-64.</note> Gold and silver rapidly became scarce throughout Britain, but the
                  government decided that they would remain the only legal tender. During this
                  period, adjudicating the value of different representatives of money was an
                  everyday problem for Britons of all classes.</p>
                  <p>This history provides a backdrop to the specific conditions in which Scott sold
                  his labor in the Waverley novels during the first two decades of the nineteenth
                  century. In a cash-poor economy without capital markets or facilities for
                  long-term lending other than on mortgage, trade was financed by regional or
                  trade-specific networks of short-term credit. When Scott sold his labour he
                  encountered his publishers’ capital as a series of obligations dispersed in
                  networks of this kind.</p>
                  <p>The commodity forms in which Scott sold his labour were no more ready to assume a
                  determinate form than the money for which he exchanged them. Until the end of the
                  eighteenth century, authors’ agreements with publishers normally involved
                  the outright sale of copyright for a one-time payment or, in exceptional cases,
                  for other consideration such as an annuity. The transfer of copyright would be
                  embodied in the delivery of fair copy to the press, and, from the point of view of
                  the author, copyright as an abstraction would remain invisible. Scott’s
                  contracts were very different. For all of the Waverley novels, he retained the
                  copyright at the time of first publication and sold only the right to publish
                  editions of a specified size. The copyrights to the first nine of the series were
                  sold to Constable in a separate agreement in 1819; Scott retained his subsequent
                  copyrights until he became insolvent in 1826. Scott’s contracts are thus
                  documents in the historical development of commodity forms in which intellectual
                  labor circulates independently of any particular material embodiment. In his
                  practice, however, this apparent independence is invariably qualified. Scott did
                  not merely license his publishers to print editions of his work; he ensured that
                  the physical books making up the edition would be printed at his press. The mass
                  sale of his copyrights to Constable in 1819 was accompanied by a gift of all the
                  corresponding manuscripts—whose return Scott demanded when in 1826 he sued to
                  recover the copyrights on the grounds that they hadn’t been paid for. The
                  commodity forms involved in these transactions—and indeed the nature of the
                  transactions themselves—prove to be as indeterminate as the money that
                  mediates them.</p>
                  <p>It is my main theoretical claim in this essay that the indeterminate form in which
                  Scott sold the labor embodied in his novels is allegorized in traits of the novels
                  themselves. The most important of these for my purpose is their anonymity.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a rich treatment of Scott’s

                     <title level="m">Waverley</title>, the first novel of the series, was published
                  anonymously in 1814; upon its success, the next two were published as by
                  “the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>.” Subsequent novels
                  either appeared under this signature, or were presented by “editors”
                  under obviously fictitious names as works deriving from oral or manuscript
                  traditions. Very soon, this kind of elaborate disguise of the author’s
                  identity was recognized as itself a trait of what came to be known as the Waverley
                  novels. Though I am afraid that at this point the analogy will seem fanciful, the
                  identity of the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>, like that of capital
                  itself in Marx’s account, becomes an effect of serial self-reference and
                  self-disguise.</p>
                  <p>Scott himself seems to have half believed that there was an uncanny connection
                  between the anonymity of his work as a writer of fiction and the historically
                  unprecedented sums he made by it. In writing about his earnings, he tends to
                  describe them as if they had been gained by a deception, or else by magic.
                  Consider the following, published in a retrospect of his career written well after
                  insolvency had forced Scott to give up his incognito. Looking back at his the
                  period of his anonymity, he writes that “in the pen of this nameless
                  romancer, I seemed to possess something like the secret fountain of coined gold
                  and pearls vouchsafed to the traveller of the Eastern Tale " (<title level="m">Chronicles of the Canongate</title>, Introduction; <title level="m">WN</title>
                  19: 321). One striking point about this figure is that even as Scott in a signed
                  preface acknowledges his identity as author of the Waverley novels, he disavows
                  it, referring in the third person to “the nameless romancer” who held
                  the pen that composed them. Another is that the figure’s identification of
                  the pen and the fountain is founded as much on the fact that they are both secret
                  as on their apparently limitless flow. Taken as a whole, the figure aligns the
                  authorship of the Waverley novels with possession of the money for which they were
                  sold, both the money and the novels being tokens of an identity that is
                  constitutively secret and fated to vanish when revealed.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Scott’s money and his incognito really did vanish
                     together; as he faced insolvency in late 1825, he knew that one of the
                     consequences would be his exposure as the Author of Waverley. Hence his
                     complaint in his <title level="m">Journal</title>: “the wand of the
                     Unknown is shivered in his grasp. He must henceforth be termed the Too well
                     known” (Scott <title level="m">Journal</title> 40). Here too for Scott
                     the magic of authorship is the magic of money, and both of them disappear when
                     they are exposed to view.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The anonymity of the Waverley novels was not merely an extrinsic fact about them.
                  Rather, it reiterated on the title page formal and thematic preoccupations with
                  signature, anonymity, and disguise that also appear in the body of the texts. Each
                  of the first three of the series has a protagonist who is effectively separated
                  from his signature. The protagonists of <title level="m">Guy Mannering</title> and
                     <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> cannot sign because they do not know
                  their own names. Waverley knows his all too well; the romance of his life begins
                  when he is separated from it by the theft of his signet ring. Without his
                  knowledge the signet is used to enlist him as a supporter of the 1745 Jacobite
                  uprising—and in so doing, ironically, to constitute for him the true
                  symbolic identity he is destined to assume. In each of these novels, then, Scott
                  works a gambit in which the protagonist’s proper signature is hidden from
                  him and from other characters. In Scott’s subsequent fiction the deception
                  of characters about their own identity is less characteristic than the deception
                  of the reader; it becomes a favorite device of his to introduce a major character
                  under a disguise that is only gradually lifted. Often the character is the monarch
                  or a claimant of the throne, as in the cases of <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>,
                     <title level="m">Quentin Durward</title>, and <title level="m">Redgauntlet</title>. Even where the reader is in on the secret, Scott’s
                  monarchs are typically as fond of masquerade, concealment, and bluff as the Author
                  of <title level="m">Waverley</title> himself.</p>
                  <p>The Waverley novels often represent a narrative of the protagonist’s
                  self-discovery; in these narratives, the protagonist’s proper name and
                  symbolic identity are hidden in the world the novel represents, from which they
                  emerge to view before the close. They are often embodied in a material token, the
                  symbolon, such as Waverley’s signet or Elspeth Mucklebackit’s ring in
                     <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>. From a formal standpoint, such
                  narratives are a guarantee of closure; the novel sets no problems and presents no
                  appearances for which it does not contain the corresponding solution or reality.
                  The material token that the novel represents as guaranteeing the identity of its
                  protagonist thus also figures its identity with itself.</p>
                  <p>Precisely because it recurs from novel to novel, the protagonist’s narrative
                  of self-discovery is a central topic in criticism of Scott’s fiction;<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Alexander Welsh this narrative is a
                     “romance of property.” He argues that in the Waverley novels the
                     protagonist’s discovery of his destiny, both as an heir and as a lover,
                     involves accession to real estate. The identity-conferring power of this kind
                     of property is distinguished from the effect of conveyables, from too close an
                     association with which Scott “carefully protects” his heroes and
                     heroines at the novels’ endings (Welsh 79).</note> among the effects of
                  its recurrence is to undermine the closure that it also guarantees. At the opening
                  of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> the protagonist presents himself to the
                  novel’s title character under the name of Lovel. It emerges however that the
                  name is a disguise which he has been using to conceal the name under which he was
                  raised, that of Neville. Finally, at the novel’s close, the antiquary learns
                  that he himself possesses the information necessary to discover the truth about
                  his friend’s birth, and is able to inform him that his name is no more
                  Neville than it is Lovel, but is rather William Geraldin. In this last reversal
                  the dupe and the subject of knowledge change places with a symmetrical neatness
                  that provides the novel’s final cadence. The effect of closure is however
                  undermined by the traits that <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>’s
                  protagonist shares with those of other novels. These traits liken him for instance
                  to Waverley, to Harry Bertram, to Frank Osbaldistone, and to others from other
                  novels in the series.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a discussion of
                     fraternal similarities among the Waverley protagonists, see Welsh 27.</note>
                  The truth of the protagonist’s identity and filiation was only apparently
                  contained within a single text; as soon as this appearance is breached, so too are
                  the borders of the text itself.</p>
                  <p>In some of the paratexts with which Scott increasingly surrounded his novels as
                  the series developed, he dramatizes the permeability of their borders by putting
                  characters from different novels together in a single scene and even allowing them
                  encounters with the anonymous Author who invented them. The most elaborate such
                  paratext is the introduction to <title level="m">Tales of the Crusaders</title>,
                  published in 1825; it presents itself as the transcript of a meeting between the
                  still-anonymous Author of Waverley and a miscellaneous collection of characters
                  from the novels—or, where this would violate chronology, of their descendants.
                  Present therefore are Jonathan Oldbuck of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>,
                  Josiah Cargill of <title level="m">St. Ronan’s Well</title>, Lawrence
                  Templeton, the purported editor of <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, Captain
                  Clutterbuck of <title level="m">The Monastery</title> and <title level="m">The
                     Fortunes of Nigel</title>, the son of Dandie Dinmont of <title level="m">Guy
                     Mannering</title> and so forth. The introduction’s conceit is that the
                  characters, along with the Author, have produced the Waverley novels already in
                  print collectively, in accordance with “the doctrine so well laid down by
                  the immortal Adam Smith, concerning the division of labour” (<title level="m">Tales of the Crusaders</title>, Introduction; <title level="m">WN</title> 19: 11).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a treatment of
                     this introduction, of Scott’s relation to Adam Smith, and of his
                     understanding of his novels as a commercial enterprise, see Sutherland.</note>
                  They meet here as joint proprietors of what the Author of Waverley describes as
                  “the valuable property which has accumulated under our common labour”
                     (<title level="m">Tales of the Crusaders</title>, Introduction; <title level="m">WN</title> 19: 11). By the late twentieth century characters could be
                  a form of intellectual property, and a text representing in a single scene
                  characters from divers sources is thus in our own day not only an example of the
                  intertextual citation of character but also of the social circulation of
                     value.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Think of Warner Bros. cartoons
                     that represent a variety of characters from their “stable,” or of
                     the heterogeneous mass of personified intellectual properties that is Disney
                     World.</note> For Scott, the assembly of the characters is more ambiguous: they
                  appear as proprietors as well as property, and even the Author of Waverley
                  himself, when he becomes a character in a Waverley novel, becomes a part of the
                  property of which he is also the proprietor. The breaching of the novelistic
                  border effected by paratext here generates an incoherence or internal
                  differentiation in the notion of property as such.</p>
                  <p>To put the point otherwise, I am claiming that the difficulty in the Waverley
                  novels of identifying certain characters, like the difficulty of identifying the
                  author, allegorizes the difficulty of identifying the value form of the novel
                  itself. Like the King, the protagonist, or the author, the Waverley novel too
                  comes hedged about by disguises and proxies in the form of prefaces, frames, and
                  apparent narrative dead ends. Insofar as these formal traits are shared by novels
                  with different historical settings they are anachronisms; in <title level="m">The
                     Antiquary</title> we saw that the anachronism of disputing the monarch’s
                  legitimacy is an explicit theme, conveyed by staging the difference between the
                  Jacobite and Whig positions as a dispute between antiquaries and reducing it to a
                  series of disagreements over the authenticity and value of curiosities.</p>
                  <p>These disagreements, however, remain unresolved at the novel’s close.
                  Moreover, the botched or disputed purchase of the curiosity is one of the forms in
                  which it presents <foreign>en travesti</foreign> the exchange of money for money.
                  This exchange, which Marx was to identify as the elementary form of capital,
                  appears in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> only as a mistake or a
                  deception. The exchange M-&gt;M in Marx enables an identification; in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>, quite the contrary, it is structured by difference and
                  masquerade. The novel’s insistence on the problem of relating money to
                  money, indeed on the problem of identifying money, leads me to propose that in its
                  allegorical dimension, as is necessarily the case with allegory, it has more than
                  one point of historical reference. Though the topic of money’s indeterminacy
                  appears in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>’s representation of 1794
                  as an after-image of historic struggles that the novel regards as closed, it also
                  falls on it as a shadow of the future in which the novel itself will be written
                  and published.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  <p>For historical and geographical reasons, Scott had a particularly acute experience
                  of the impossibility of fully identifying a capital: of specifying what is and
                  what is not part of it at a given moment, and of symbolizing his own relation to
                  it. Scott’s relations with his publishers were so complex that it is
                  difficult to discover in them the underlying exchange of the product of his labor
                  for money. The formal anonymity under which the novels appeared to the public was
                  maintained, as a more or less transparent fiction, with their various publishers.
                  For the most part Scott communicated with his publishers through the brothers John
                  and James Ballantyne, who in functioning as his literary agents carried on
                  correspondence for him in which he is typically referred by periphrasis, usually
                  as the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>. In his communications with his
                  publishers themselves, then, Scott acts by proxy. As his hand is concealed in his
                  negotiations with the publishers, moreover, so it is in the production of the
                  novels themselves, of which the publishers were not shown the original
                  manuscripts. Sometimes they were allowed to read transcriptions by James
                  Ballantyne; more often they were only shown page proofs printed at
                  Ballantyne’s press.</p>
                  <p>James Ballantyne’s press was thus the medium in which the work of
                  Scott’s hand was transmuted into the anonymous Authorship of the Waverley
                  novels. It was not, however, only as a producer and seller of fiction that
                  Scott’s identity was hidden by the Ballantynes. Much more closely held than
                  the secret of his authorship was the further secret that Scott himself owned more
                  than half of Ballantyne’s printing office and was in fact the dominant
                     partner.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Scott had known James
                     Ballantyne since they were schoolboys together in Kelso. By 1800 Ballantyne was
                     the owner of a thriving print-shop and a newspaper there; at that date Scott
                     proposed to him that he should set up shop in Edinburgh. This he did in 1802,
                     with the assistance of a £500 loan from Scott, leaving the Kelso business
                     in the hands of his brother Sandy. In 1805 Scott increased his investment in
                     the firm to £2008, becoming half-owner (Johnson 233). The partnership
                     continued until the crash of 1826, with the exception of the years 1816-22,
                     during which Scott assumed sole ownership of the firm, while Ballantyne
                     continued to manage it at a salary of £400 a year (Johnson 516, 764).
                     Constable certainly knew that in dealing with the Ballantynes he was
                     effectively dealing with Scott. On the other hand, in 1826 Scott was obliged to
                     reveal his dealings to his own lawyer, who affirms that he had no idea that
                     Scott was involved in the printing firm (Gibson 4-5). See also the discussion
                     of this controversial aspect of Scott’s business dealings in Sutherland
                     97-98.</note> All Scott’s contracts for his novels stipulated that they
                  be printed at Ballantyne’s; he was moreover paid for them through
                  Ballantyne’s, in such a way that the distinction between the payment for the
                     <emph>right</emph> to print a specified number of copies of a work and the
                  payment for the <emph>printed copies themselves</emph> is far from explicit. Using
                  the Ballantynes as intermediaries, Scott confronts his publishers at once
                  and—on my reading of the contracts—indistinguishably as the seller of
                  a copyright and as the seller of printed volumes.</p>
                  <p>The mystification of Scott’s identity as an author is thus inseparable from
                  the mystification of the commodity form into which his written work was absorbed
                  when it was sold and became capital. This mystification is in part due to the
                  relatively recent appearance of copyright as a commodity form in its own
                     right.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Rose 67-112 for an account
                     of the eighteenth-century emergence of copyright as a form of abstract
                     intellectual property created by an author’s labor. Copyright in this
                     form replaced the earlier institution of copy; this was a license to print a
                     given work granted by the Stationers’ Guild and ultimately sustained by
                     state power. The history of intellectual property began with the first
                     copyright statute, passed in 1710; disputes over how the statute was to be
                     applied were however not resolved until the House of Lords’ verdict in
                     Donaldson v. Becket in 1774. It was in the legal and philosophical debates over
                     copyright during this period that the idea of the author as producer of an
                     abstract intellectual property distinct from any of its material embodiments
                     entered British jurisprudence and publishing practice. For another account of
                     Donaldson v. Becket as a decisive moment for the whole subsequent history of
                     intellectual property, see St. Clair 111-21. For a theory of the
                     “commodity-text” as the form of abstract intellectual property that
                     emerged in the period 1710-74 and an account of its difference from the
                     “commodity-book,” see Feltes 7-8.</note> But its fundamental
                  determinant in Scott’s case is as a reflection of the money-form in which
                  the value of Scott’s labor was realized. No more in Scotland in 1815 than at
                  other times and places could transactions on the scale of Scott’s and
                  Constable’s have conveniently been carried out in cash. David Hewitt
                  estimates Scott’s share of the profits from the first 5000 copies of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> at about £1682 (364), independent of his
                  share of the profits from the printing-office. In England during the period of the
                  Bank Restriction Act (1797-1821), and in Scotland at any time since the early
                  eighteenth century, the payment of such a sum in legal tender coin would have been
                  almost unthinkable. The actually circulating currency, as we have seen, comprised
                  a regionally variable combination of token silver used as change and of different
                  kinds of locally-issued paper instruments that served as money-substitutes. Legal
                  tender was at this period effectively unavailable throughout Britain, and
                  especially so in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>For the immediate discharge of debts, therefore, in 1815 Scots used the token
                  silver currency of the Royal Mint in London and banknotes issued by Scots banks.
                  For the purposes of trade, however, which was normally conducted on credit, the
                  usual instrument was the bill of exchange, as it had been throughout Britain for
                  more than a hundred years. A bill of exchange is draft by a creditor on a debtor,
                  made payable to a third party at a specified date and place. Bills of exchange
                  originated as a means of making payments at a distance, but in the eighteenth
                  century they came to be used as a way of extending credit in transactions among
                  producers, merchants, and tradespeople even within a single locality. Bills
                  continue nonetheless to articulate place: a bill on London, for instance, would in
                  Edinburgh carry a premium over one payable locally, owing to the trade imbalance
                  between Scotland and the South.</p>
                  <p>The bill extended credit by deferring payment: if a retailer bought commodities
                  from a producer, the latter would draw a bill on the former, payable at a date
                  when the commodities could be expected to have sold, enabling the retailer to pay
                  it with the proceeds. Normally, the drawer of the bill, wanting ready money, would
                  take it at once to a bank, which would give cash for it at a discounted rate,
                  taking interest for the time until it fell due. This was broadly the system by
                  which Scott received payment for his fiction. Thus, contracting for <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> in January of 1815 he drew bills dated at six,
                  twelve, and eighteen months on the publishers, Constable and Co. in Edinburgh and
                  Longmans in London. Acting through James Ballantyne, Scott would at once have
                  discounted the bills, thus obtaining—at the cost of some interest—his half of
                  the profits for the first 5000 copies before he even began to write the novel. As
                     <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> was slated for publication in early
                  June, the publishers expected it to be bringing in revenue before they had to pay
                  even the first set of bills—though in the event Scott was more than a year late
                  with it, causing some anxious correspondence between Longmans and Constable.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a general account of Scott’s

                  </p>
                  <p>When he sold his fiction, then, Scott encountered a capital whose
                  identity, like his own identity as an author, was mediated and hedged about with
                  substitutes. The capital into which his labor was incorporated could appear to him
                  only in the dispersed form of the bills of exchange that served as its
                  representatives. This form of appearance necessarily obscured from him its borders
                  and indeed its mode of existence as property. The example of <title level="m">The
                     Antiquary</title> has shown us how a publishing house—or any other
                  business—could operate without investing money in an undertaking at the outset.
                  In negotiating for an advance, then, Scott would consider not the actual assets of
                  his publishers, but the ease with which he would be able to discount their
                  bills—a question decided by the general state of their credit, and more
                  specifically by the number of their bills already outstanding and in the hands of
                  the banks. Scott insisted that Longmans be brought in as the London co-publisher
                  of his second novel, <title level="m">Guy Mannering</title>, and then of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>, precisely because fewer of their bills were in
                  the Edinburgh market than of Constable’s, and he wanted to give
                  Constable’s credit a rest.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Scott
                        <title level="m">Letters</title> 1: 473</note> The market value of a bill
                  thus depended on the state of an entire circulation of bills on which the
                  acceptor’s name appeared. For this reason, it represented a capital only
                  visible in dispersal, having been at no time in the immediate possession of any
                  single individual.</p>
                  <p>This effect of dispersal was exacerbated by the fact that bills circulated by
                  endorsement. As we have seen, a bill needed not be held until its due date; it
                  could be discounted at a bank, or it could be used by its drawer to make payments
                  in further transactions. In either case, the bill would change hands at a price
                  determined by the time left until it fell due. As it did so, each person through
                  whose hands it passed would endorse it, beginning with the original drawer. Each
                  endorser became liable to pay the bill if the acceptor and earlier endorsers
                  failed to do so. The value of a bill in circulation was thus supported not only by
                  the credit of its original acceptor but also by that of its drawer and very likely
                  by a series of other endorsers.</p>
                  <p>In taking payment for his fiction by means of bills, therefore, Scott legally made
                  himself liable to pay again the very payment he took. The reason why the hazards
                  of trade were so notorious throughout the eighteenth century, and why book-keeping
                  was so difficult, was that neither the acceptance of a payment nor the discharge
                  of a debt could be considered final until the bill involved had finally been paid
                  by its original acceptor—possibly years after many of the transactions in which
                  it had played a part.<note place="foot" resp="editors">". . . hence it
                     comes to be a proverbial Saying, <emph>That no man knows what a Tradesman is
                        till he is dead</emph>" (Defoe 2: 204).</note> In the crash of 1826, many of
                  the debts of Constable that Scott was required to pay were thus debts which had
                  originally been due to him in return for novels promised or actually written.</p>
                  <p>To be paid by bill was thus for Scott invariably to sign; and since after <title level="m">Waverley</title> itself he always had an advance on his share of the
                  profits, Scott <emph>wrote his novels to make sure that the bills he had signed
                     were retired</emph>. Scott wrote, in short, <emph>to withdraw his signature
                     from circulation</emph>. And we recall that in mentioning his signature, we are
                  in fact referring to a hand that was until 1826 concealed behind those of James
                  and John Ballantyne—far more so in entering into bill transactions than it was in
                  producing fiction. The major reason for Scott’s employment of a literary
                  agent and for his secret ownership of a printing works was not to conceal his
                  identity as the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>, but to conceal the
                  extent of his potential liability in the bill market and so extend his ability,
                  using his proxies, to discount new bills. Scott increased his liabilities by
                  personal expenditure, but the fundamental cause of his exposure in the bill market
                  and eventual insolvency was the historical necessity that dictated the mode of his
                  payment. The phenomenon of the Waverley novels could not have been financed by a
                  capital embodied in a retail bookselling establishment or in a printing shop, as
                  publishing ordinarily had been hitherto.<note place="foot" resp="editors">John Feather asserts that in the eighteenth century publishing was invariably
                     associated with the retail sale of books; the earlier model, in which
                     publishing is a branch of the printing trade, disappears in the seventeenth
                     century (101, 132).</note> Constable could not have paid Scott the
                  unprecedented sums he received, nor financed the publication of the novels in the
                  size and variety of editions that he did, without mobilizing bank capital through
                  loans secured by the signatures on his bills.</p>
                  <p>The means by which Scott was paid for his novels thus make it extraordinarily
                  difficult to say when the sale and purchase of a given novel have been completed.
                  When he is paid with a bill, Scott involves himself, and his proxies, in an
                  indeterminate series of future transactions and obligations; this fact is
                  reflected in the serial character of the novels themselves and the series of
                  mutually supporting signatures that they bear. To put the point otherwise, when
                  Scott accepted payment, he also assumed an obligation. The internal difference in
                  the money form in which he realized the value of his work was the specific form in
                  which he encountered the difference of capital from itself, and it is reflected in
                  the internal self-differentiation of his novels and of the Authorship they
                  embody.</p>

                  versions of the author-function is one of the Waverley novels’ cardinal
                  features, and it has determined my use of the text of Scott’s final edition
                  of the novels, which he termed his Magnum Opus, as the source for citations in
                  this essay.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For discussion of the Magnum

                  text, Scott appears as the no longer-anonymous author, as editor and annotator,
                  and also as a character and as proprietor. This multiple self-inscription is an
                  extension of the internally differentiated representations of authorship that
                  appeared in the novels and their paratexts from the very outset, which are my
                  topic here.</p>
                  <p>In one of these representations, the Introductory Epistle to <title level="m">The
                     Fortunes of Nigel</title>, the “eidolon” or image of the Author of
                     <title level="m">Waverley</title> appears—in the act of correcting proof
                  for the very volume in which he is described—at the back of Archibald
                  Constable’s Edinburgh bookshop (<title level="m">WN</title> 14: 8). The
                  author is thus an emanation of the premises where the writer’s product is
                  put into circulation and not of the scene of production itself. The social
                  processes by which Scott’s labor was commodified and circulated were indeed
                  integral to the shaping of the novels and the institution of their authorship.
                  This was as true for the first editions as for any others. Before they were shown
                  to his publishers, Scott’s novels were transcribed and usually set up in
                  print by John and James Ballantyne. During this process they underwent extensive
                  correction and revision. Scott anticipated and relied on this work, which was part
                  of the authoring of the novels.</p>
                  <p>By far and away the most fully documented and carefully edited version of
                  Scott’s fiction ever to appear is the recently completed Edinburgh Edition
                  of the Waverley Novels (EEWN). Though this edition will be invaluable to future
                  scholarship on Scott, as it has been to my own, the texts it establishes must be
                  used with some caution, as its editorial procedures do not take sufficient account
                  of the novels’ social origin. The general editor states that the EEWN aims
                  to produce an “ideal text” of the novels’ first editions (Hewitt
                     xv),<note place="foot" resp="editors">The general introduction including
                     this statement appears in every volume of the edition published before 1999,

                  that were the result of haste and pressure in the production process. As we have
                  seen, however, this process was irreducibly social. No more than any of their
                  successors were the first editions of the Waverley novels the sole product of the
                  historical Sir Walter Scott; yet the EEWN announces that integral to its project
                  is “a return to the authentic Scott ” (Hewitt xii), to be achieved by
                  stripping away from the first edition texts “mistakes” introduced
                  there by those whom the editors characterize as
                  “intermediaries”—James Ballantyne and other copyists,
                  compositors, and copyeditors.</p>
                  <p>The result is a series of texts that are fundamentally unhistorical. Neither a
                  version of the first editions, in whose production Scott’s collaboration
                  with the so-called intermediaries played an essential part, nor a presentation of
                  Scott’s manuscripts, the Edinburgh edition of the novels too often
                  corresponds to no historically specifiable state of the texts.</p>
                  <p>The anomalies introduced into the novels by this editorial practice are in several
                  cases substantial and thematically significant. I will give a summary account of
                  three examples:</p>
                  <p>1) Since Lockhart’s biography in 1838 it has been known that Scott was
                  persuaded by James Ballantyne to alter the last chapter of <title level="m">St.
                     Ronan’s Well</title> after the novel had been set up in type. At issue
                  was a revelation in the <foreign>dénouement</foreign> that the hero and the
                  heroine had been lovers before she was tricked into a feigned wedding with someone
                  else. Ballantyne objected to the supposed indecency; after protesting, Scott
                  acquiesced and altered the passage in which the revelation occurs. The censored
                  version was the one published in the first and every subsequent edition; Mark
                  Weinstein, the editor of the Edinburgh edition, however prints the text of the
                  original proof (363-64, 403-04). By so doing he may arguably recover a more
                  “authentic” Scott than the one who actually approved the other
                  version—but he produces a text that effaces an important effect of the
                  novel’s social production.</p>
                  <p>2) As in <title level="m">St. Ronan’s Well</title>, a textual crux in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> arises from Scott’s revision during the
                  production process of the first edition. In this case—which I have discussed
                  at more length above—there is no evidence of pressure from any of the
                  “intermediaries.” Rather, Scott altered the
                     <foreign>dénouement</foreign> of the novel he had originally written to
                  another that he apparently preferred. It was the revised text that appeared in
                  every edition of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> he published.
                  Unfortunately, in making the revision, Scott introduced an anomaly into the
                  sequence of events that he narrates, making an effect precede its cause. On the
                  grounds of narrative coherence, therefore, the novel’s editor, David Hewitt,
                  who is also the EEWN General Editor, has restored Scott’s first version from
                  the manuscript. There is no question here of restoring the work of an authentic
                  Scott that has been obscured by other hands; Hewitt’s decision aims rather
                  to correct what appears to him a mistake of Scott’s own—a mistake,
                  moreover, that exists only if the novel is judged by standards of narrative
                  coherence for which there is every evidence Scott cared very little.</p>
                  <p>3) Most egregious is the case of <title level="m">The Bride of Lammermoor</title>.
                  The dating of this novel’s action has long been a matter of dispute;<note place="foot" resp="editors">A full discussion of the topic appears in
                     Millgate <title level="m">Walter Scott: The Making of the Novelist</title>
                     171-73.</note> in every edition Scott published there are indications that
                  point to dates in the eighteenth century both before and after the crucial year of
                  1707, when the Act of Union ended Scotland’s existence as an independent
                  kingdom. The historical events on which Scott based his story, moreover, belong in
                  the seventeenth century, and traces of this setting also made their way into the
                  novel. The editor of <title level="m">The Bride</title> for EEWN, J. H. Alexander,
                  follows Jane Millgate in the view that the action of the novel in its first
                  edition can best be dated just before the Act, between 1702 and 1707. This dating
                  is perhaps more plausible than any other; nonetheless, it requires a distinctly
                  tendentious editorial note explaining away passages that seem to refer to a date
                  after the union (Alexander 333-35). Worse yet, to prevent the date from slipping
                  the other way, to before 1702 when Queen Anne ascended the English throne, it
                  requires the explaining away of several references to the reigning monarch as male
                  and in one passage the outright emendation of the word “King” to read
                  “Queen” instead (Alexander 209, 334 and 337n. 9). Alexander makes this
                  emendation <emph>without warrant from any prior printed or manuscript version of
                     the text</emph>.</p>
                  <p>In so doing, Alexander effaces the historical fact of a mistake or inconsistency
                  and deprives the text of its status as an historical artifact. The appeal to the
                  authority of the “authentic Scott” has here been stripped of any
                  historical content whatsoever and has become the pure means of imposing an
                  arbitrary formal coherence on his novel.</p>
                  <p>Recent interest in the cultures of collecting and antiquarianism has also brought
                  the novel new attention. Lee 90-101 gives a particularly full account of the
                  practices of antiquarianism in late eighteenth-century Britain and of their
                  embeddedness in the institutions of the marketplace and consequent conflict with
                  an organic or Burkean historicism. A contrasting argument that sees the novel as
                  countering charges of unmanliness leveled against Burke in the 1790’s
                  appears in Goode. Ferris discusses the contrast between the enlightened historian
                  and the antiquary in Romantic-era discourse, with special attention to Jonathan
                  Oldbuck in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>. See also Malley for a
                  discussion of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> in the context of
                  Scott’s own antiquarian collections and of the construction of the
                  “new/old” structure of Abbotsford.</p>

                  <p>Talk of consciousness has largely disappeared from Romantic studies and, indeed,
                  from literary scholarship more generally. As a symbol of this disappearance we
                  might look to Harold Bloom’s edited volume <title level="m">Romanticism and Consciousness</title> (1970). While the volume was
                  officially dedicated to the proposition that to talk about Romanticism simply
                     <emph>was</emph> to talk about consciousness, its inclusion of Paul de Man’s essay “The Intentional Structure of the
                  Romantic Image” (written in 1960) in fact marked the beginning of the end of the
                  association between Romanticism and consciousness. Some years later <name ref="deManPaul">de Man</name> could retrospectively mark his own deconstructive
                  turn as a swerve, however imperfect, from consciousness-talk. Writing in 1983,
                  looking back on his landmark 1969 essay “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” <name ref="deManPaul">de Man</name> remarked that the essay was “still uncomfortably
                  intertwined with the thematic vocabulary of consciousness … that was current at
                  the time, but it signals a turn that, at least for me, has proven to be
                     productive.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Paul de Man, <title level="m">Blindness and Insight: Essays in the
                        Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism</title>, rev. 2nd
                     ed., (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983), xii. De Man’s turn, of
                     course, was to substitute language—allegory, specifically—for the
                     subject-object dialectic that had dominated post-Kantian idealism; the
                     implication is that with this move consciousness is revealed as a rhetorical
                     effect. </note> One could note other similar “turns” at about this same time,
                  for example within the Yale School and its turn away from phenomenology (in the
                  careers of Geoffrey Hartman and J. Hillis Miller), and also in Philippe
                  Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy’s <title level="m">Literary Absolute</title>
                  (1978).</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, the historicism that has dominated Romantic studies for the
                  past-quarter century has likewise had little patience with consciousness talk.
                  Inspired by Marx and Engels’s <title level="m">German Ideology</title>, it has
                  tended to identify consciousness with “false consciousness.” There is a
                  complicated intellectual history here that would have to be traced in some detail.
                  Perhaps we can simply note, first, that some of the foundational texts for this
                  turn date, like de Man’s turn, to an approximately
                  10-year period from 1965-1975<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example,
                        Pierre Macherey, <title level="m">A Theory
                        of Literary Production</title> (Routledge, 1978), originally published in
                     1966; and Louis Althusser, “Ideology and
                     Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Toward an Investigation” in <title level="m">Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays</title>, trans. Ben Brewster
                     (New York and London: Monthly Review Press, 1971) pp. 127-88.</note>, and
                  second, that like <title level="m">The German Ideology</title> before them their
                  attack was aimed at speculative idealism, which was assumed to represent
                  philosophy of consciousness in general. </p>
                  <p>And yet, as sometimes happens in academic discourse, the preoccupations that
                  disappeared in one quarter have popped up in another. As consciousness-talk was
                  disappearing from literary study (especially from versions of literary study that
                  referenced Continental philosophy), it was re-emerging in neuroscience and
                  philosophy of mind. Under the influence of behaviorism, Anglo-American philosophy
                  had gone through its own skepticism about consciousness in the early years of the
                  twentieth century, but the demise of behaviorism after the middle of the century
                  and the rise of what we now know as cognitive science has resulted in a rich,
                  varied, and completely unresolved conversation about the mind’s relationship to
                  the brain and how that relationship might produce conscious experience. Thus Jerry Fodor, from a recent essay in the <title level="j">London Review of Books</title>: <quote>Consciousness is all the rage
                     just now. It boasts new journals of its very own, from which learned articles
                     overflow. Neuropsychologists snap its picture (in colour) with fMRI machines,
                     and probe with needles for its seat in the brain. At all seasons, and on many
                     continents, interdisciplinary conferences about consciousness draw together
                     bizarre motleys that include philosophers, psychologists, phenomenologists,
                     brain scientists, MDs, computer scientists, the Dalai Lama, novelists,
                     neurologists, graphic artists, priests, gurus and (always) people who used to
                     do physics. Institutes of consciousness studies are bountifully subsidised.
                     Meticulous distinctions are drawn between the merely conscious and the
                     consciously available; and between each of these and the preconscious, the
                     unconscious, the subconscious, the informationally encapsulated and the
                     introspectable. There is no end of consciousness gossip on Tuesdays in the
                     science section of the <title level="j">New York Times</title>. Periodically,
                     Nobel laureates pronounce on the connections between consciousness and
                     evolution, quantum mechanics, information theory, complexity theory, chaos
                     theory and the activity of neural nets. Everybody gives lectures about
                     consciousness to everybody else. But for all that, nothing has been ascertained
                     with respect to the problem that everybody worries about most: what
                     philosophers have come to call ‘the hard problem’. The hard problem is this: it
                     is widely supposed that the world is made entirely of mere matter, but how
                     could mere matter be conscious? How, in particular, could a couple of pounds of
                     grey tissue have experiences?<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  <p>It may seem that talking about consciousness will re-open the very Pandora’s Box
                  of dualism that literary scholars have spent the last 40 years trying to close.
                  One might posit, moreover, that the Romantic writers themselves were anti-dualist
                  (something not always appreciated by their later admirers) and thus that talking
                  about consciousness again would be like turning back the clock. And yet a
                  substantial number of cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind writing today
                  agree that consciousness-talk and physicalism are not, in principle, mutually
                  exclusive. Indeed, as Fodor’s comments suggest, this
                  is precisely the issue around which a good deal of the current conversation
                  circles: whether one can both be a physicalist <emph>and</emph> grant the
                  legitimacy of our phenomenal experiences. The fact is that we have conscious
                  experiences (C); the perplexing question is how those experiences relate to a
                  neural substrate (N). </p>
                  <p>As Fodor indicates, how we get from N to C has
                  become known in philosophy of mind as the “hard problem.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The term comes from David
                        Chalmers. See “Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness,” <title level="j">Journal of Consciousness Studies</title> 2, no. 3 (1995) 200-19,
                     and Chalmers, <title level="m">The Conscious
                        Mind: in Search of a Fundamental Theory</title> (Oxford: OUP, 1996). </note>
                  And although the hard problem has gotten a lot of attention lately, its roots go
                  back to the beginning of modern philosophy. Descartes worried about the causal
                  interaction between brain and mind and eventually settled on the pineal gland as
                  the place where they came together, though this didn’t convince some of his
                  contemporaries. With the famous analogy of the mill in his <title level="m">Monadology</title>, meanwhile, Leibniz suggested that materialism couldn’t
                  account for perception. By 1866 Thomas Huxley had
                  posed the hard problem in a recognizably modern form: “[H]ow it is that anything
                  so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating
                  nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when
                  Aladdin rubbed his lamp.” In 1985 Thomas Nagel
                  reiterated the point: “The strange truth seems to be that certain complex,
                  biologically generated physical systems, of which each of us is an example, have
                  rich nonphysical properties.” This happens, Nagel
                  continued, “in some way that we do not now understand.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Huxley, <title level="m">Lessons in Elementary Physiology</title>, (London: Macmillan and Co., 1866)

                  <p>We can group responders to the hard problem as follows: (<hi>a</hi>) those who
                  think that the hard problem is not really a hard problem; (<hi>b</hi>) those who
                  think that the hard problem is really hard but is solvable in principle;
                     (<hi>c</hi>) those who think that the hard problem is so hard that we can’t
                  solve it, not even in principle; (<hi>d</hi>) those who think that the hard
                  problem is solvable only through an appeal to some form of dualism. Mind-body
                  dualism is largely out of fashion now, and I won’t be talking about it here. After
                  some preliminary discussion of the distinction between consciousness and
                  self-consciousness, I’ll discuss position (<hi>a</hi>), particularly a version of
                  it that tends to appeal to neuroscientists, and position (<hi>b</hi>), which
                  admits of a variety of possible approaches and tends to occupy philosophers of
                  mind. Through an engagement with Alan
                  Richardson’s recent work on Romantic brain science I’ll explore the
                  Romantic-era analogues of (<hi>a</hi>) and (<hi>b</hi>). Then in the second half
                  of the essay I’ll discuss one variant of position (<hi>c</hi>), which is held by a
                  small minority of philosophers today but has an interesting historical track
                  record that also takes us back to the Romantic period. </p>

                  <head>1. Consciousness and Self-Consciousness</head>
                  <p>We need first to distinguish consciousness from self-consciousness. Literary
                  scholars tend to use the terms interchangeably; we might speak about a
                  character—Prufrock, for instance—as being overly conscious, by which we mean
                  excessively self-aware. This is essentially the same state that Coleridge calls
                  “Dejection,” and that Wordsworth analyzes in
                  the opening 200 lines of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>. A more accurate
                  title for Bloom’s volume would have been <title level="m">Romanticism and Self-Consciousness</title>. When philosophers and
                  cognitive scientists speak of consciousness, by contrast, they mean something more
                  basic. Here is John Searle’s definition: “those
                  states of sentience or feeling or awareness that begin when you wake up from a
                  dreamless sleep and continue on throughout the day until you fall asleep again, or
                  otherwise become unconscious. Dreams are also a form of consciousness.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">

                     53:17 (November 2, 2006). </note> Consciousness is the thing we lose when we go
                  under general anesthesia. </p>
                  <p>Consciousness in this strict sense is sometimes referred to as “phenomenal
                  consciousness” because it seems to have phenomenal qualities: there is a redness
                  to the red rose that I see in my garden; there is a painness to the pain I feel
                  when its thorn pricks my finger. There is <emph>something that it is like for
                     me</emph> to see or feel these things. In his classic 1974 article “What Is It
                  Like to Be a Bat?” Thomas Nagel helped to put this
                  subjective character of experience at the center of the reviving consciousness
                  conversation. According to Nagel, we can safely
                  assume that bats have experiences; but bats are neurologically different enough
                  from humans that we can also assume that their experiences are quite different. So
                  what is it like to be a bat, then? Nagel argues
                  that there is no way we could know, because the facts of experience are only
                  accessible from one point of view: in this case, the bat’s. If this is right, then
                  there is no way that an objective physical description—of the way that sonar
                  works, for example—could capture the subjective character of the experience that
                  sonar delivers. <note place="foot" resp="editors">

                     The phrase “what it is like” has become common in the literature. It is worth
                     noting that this phrase is not intended to name a metaphorical relationship but
                     rather to mark the specificity of a first-person phenomenal experience. A
                     reader might nonetheless wonder about the largely unexamined appeal to
                     “likeness” in the philosophical literature on consciousness. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it might be that the notion of consciousness in this sense isn’t very
                  interesting for literary studies; its focus on first-person phenomenal experience
                  would seem to require attention of the sort that disappeared from literary study
                  with the collapse of phenomenology. Thinking in terms of
                  <emph>self</emph>-consciousness and its deconstruction, by contrast, allows us to
                  bring culture and history and biography into the mix and this is where most of the
                  action has been for literary studies.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One
                     answer to this objection, not pursued here, is that literature in fact
                     frequently aspires to describe what it feels like to be conscious; think of a
                     Henry James novel, or the modernist experiments of Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, and
                     others. Arguably, this is true as well of earlier writers and techniques: free
                     indirect style, for example, or the movements of thought characteristic of the
                     Greater Romantic Lyric. We could surely go back further. </note> It is commonly
                  asserted, for example, that the Romantic period witnessed an unprecedented level
                  of historical self-consciousness. The gamble of this essay, however, is that
                  students of literature and culture have something to learn from the challenges
                  involved in grappling with the “hard problem” of consciousness rather than simply
                  overleaping it on the way to issue of self-consciousness. Having now distinguished
                  consciousness from self-consciousness a little more fully, I turn in sections two
                  and three to the position often described as “neural correlates of consciousness”
                  (NCC), a position that tends to avoid strictly philosophical considerations. I
                  will suggest that Alan Richardson’s recent work
                  on Romantic-era brain science overlaps with the NCC position. In section four I turn
                  to <emph>emergence theory</emph>, a variant of position (<hi>c</hi>) with
                  important Romantic-era roots; in section five I consider Alan
                     Liu’s recent writings about emergence. In sections six and seven I distinguish
                  my position from Liu’s by identifying “natural piety”
                  as the characteristic attitude of emergence theory, and I extrapolate natural
                  piety’s importance for thinking about the relationship between Romantic culture
                  and mind-body questions. At stake is a Romantic physicalism that can only be
                  recovered, I argue, when literary study turns its attention to the mind-body
                  problem and the question of phenomenal consciousness that makes that problem so
                  hard.</p>

                  <head>2. Neural correlates of consciousness</head>
                  <p>Many neuroscientists would fall into my category (<hi>a</hi>); they think that the
                  hard problem is not so hard and that neuroscientists (unlike philosophers) are
                  getting to work solving it. They are busy searching for what they call the “Neural
                  Correlates of Consciousness” (NCC). It should be noted that everybody thinking
                  about the mind-body problem takes it for granted that conscious states and
                  neuronal states correlate in some way. The question is whether an accurate
                  description of that correlation is all that is required to explain consciousness.
                  The NCC proponents are betting that the answer is “yes.” If we map the NCC, their
                  thinking goes, we will either get consciousness along the way (which will indicate
                  that the hard problem wasn’t such a hard problem after all) or we’ll discover that
                  we don’t really need a theory of consciousness at all (which will indicate that
                  the hard problem was a pseudo-problem). The late Francis
                     Crick and his colleague Christof Koch
                  have been among the most prominent exponents of this approach, arguing for example
                  that identifying neural correlates could make the hard problem “appear in an
                  entirely new light. It might even disappear.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Crick and Christof Koch, “Why Neuroscience May Be Able to Explain
                     Consciousness,” <title level="j">Scientific American</title> 273 no. 6
                     (December 1995) 85.</note> For an NCC program to succeed, all that would be
                  needed would be to locate exactly where and how a particular group of neurons
                  fires when I see red, or prick my finger with a needle, or smell my coffee in the
                  morning: “locating the neurons in the cerebral cortex that correlate best with
                  consciousness, and figuring out how they link to neurons elsewhere in the brain,”
                  as Crick and Koch
                  put it (84). We may not have the technology to map NCC so precisely right now, but
                  in principle it certainly seems possible. </p>
                  <p>Even if it were possible, however, this might not make the hard problem disappear.
                  Just because a particular group of neurons fires when I see a red tomato does not
                  explain why the tomato appears to me in the way that it does, and not in some
                  other way or in no way at all. In some respects this is a disciplinary issue;
                  neuroscientists tend to be more interested in finding NCC than in pausing over the
                  precise relationship between N and C; many philosophers, meanwhile, have insisted
                  that if we ignore the philosophical issue of how we get from N to C we ignore the
                  very thing that is interesting about consciousness, namely that it has about it a
                  first-person, “what it is like” quality. Here are two quick examples of the
                  philosophical issues that an NCC program tends to ignore. Crick and Koch hold to a theory they
                  call “explicit neuronal representation” in order to explain why subjective
                  experience is private. Mental representations, they think, can’t be adequately
                  communicated in language. But representationalism is a hotly debated topic within
                  philosophy of mind, and it entails other metaphysical and epistemological
                  positions (about the nature of the content of mental states, for example); Crick and Koch can’t
                  just have “representation” for free. In a similar manner, they propose that
                  “meaning” (our recognizing a certain face, say, as belonging to a loved one) is
                  the result of networks of association spread throughout the cortical system. But
                  association and meaning are also loaded terms; again, Crick and Koch can’t simply help
                  themselves to these concepts without discussing the philosophical positions they
                  entail.</p>
                  <p>From a certain perspective, then, the NCC program seems both philosophically
                  unsophisticated and methodologically uninterested in the first-person quality of
                  phenomenal experience. In his famous article “Epiphenomenal Qualia,” Frank Jackson formulates these objections with
                  somewhat greater precision by calling attention to the qualitative dimensions of
                  experience—what have become known in the literature as “qualia.” Jackson’s argument depends on a thought experiment.
                  He asks us to imagine Mary, a neuroscientist who knows everything there is to know
                  about the science of vision. In particular, Mary knows exactly what happens in the
                  visual cortex when it encounters the different wavelengths that produce the
                  experience of color. However, for perverse and unexplained reasons, Mary has spent
                  her entire life in a black-and-white room. So Mary knows everything there is to
                  know about color, but she has never <emph>seen</emph> color. Then, one day, Mary
                  leaves her black-and-white room and encounters color (for some reason it is almost
                  always red in these examples) for the first time. The question is how we describe
                  what has happened to Mary. Jackson argues that at
                  the moment she sees red Mary learns something that she didn’t know before: she
                  learns what red <emph>is like</emph>—she experiences its qualitative character.
                  But Mary already knew everything that there was to know about the physical facts
                  of color. So the physical facts must not be all the facts.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     Frank Jackson, “Epiphenomenal Qualia,” <title level="j">Philosophical Quarterly</title> 32 (1982) 127-136. The standard
                     objection to Jackson’s argument is that when
                     Mary leaves her room she doesn’t gain new knowledge but rather a new
                        <emph>ability</emph>. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The advantage of Jackson’s argument is that it
                  sharpens Nagel’s focus on the subjective character
                  of experience by zeroing in on qualia. Jackson is
                  not interested in what it is like to be Mary (the way that Nagel is interested in what it is like to be a bat). Probably most of
                  what it is like to be Mary <emph>can</emph> be described through reference to
                  neural correlates. But Jackson isn’t interested in
                  Mary’s internal life; he is interested in what it is like to see red. And what it
                  is like to see red, he thinks, cannot be captured by even a complete knowledge of
                  the physical facts. He thinks that qualia, uniquely, cannot be explained by
                  physics. </p>
                  <p>If, impressed by these or other arguments, we accept that the hard problem is just
                  that, we must then face up to just how we might get from N to C—from knowing
                  everything physical that there is to know about how we experience red to actually
                  experiencing red. This brings us to group (<hi>b</hi>), and the many and varied

                     epiphenomenalism and panpsychism as forms of dualism. </note> The various
                  technical aspects of these positions are very interesting in their own right, and
                  each has well-respected defenders and detractors. A terrific amount of ink has
                  been spilled on these issues in the past quarter-century; as Jerry Fodor notes, “consciousness is all the rage right
                  now.” The technical aspects of the debate need not concern us, though, because I
                  want to keep the focus on the broader point that ties all the positions in group
                     (<hi>b</hi>) together, which is simply that the NCC program misses both how
                  important and how hard the hard problem is. That is, the NCC program doesn’t
                  appreciate just what is involved, theoretically, in trying to link the physical to
                  the mental; and it doesn’t appreciate just what is involved, subjectively, in our
                  phenomenal experience, namely the fact that it is <emph>like something</emph> to
                  be in a particular mental state. Each of the contenders in group (<hi>b</hi>)
                  tries to account more adequately for both of these things.</p>
                  <p>Now I will turn to Alan Richardson’s important
                  work on Romantic-era brain science. I will suggest that Richardson shares some of the limitations of the NCC program. </p>

                  <head>3. Richardson and Romantic Brain
                  Science</head>
                  <p>Alan Richardson’s pathbreaking 2001 book <title level="m">British Romanticism and the Science of Mind </title>has done a great
                  deal to make neurological history important for Romantic studies. Through careful
                  archival work and impressive scholarship, Richardson reveals the importance of a number of brain scientists of
                  the period, including F. J. Gall, Charles Bell, Erasmus Darwin, and Sir William
                  Lawrence. In many ways, he argues, the early nineteenth century saw the birth of
                  what we now call cognitive science. Richardson
                  shows that Romantic-era writers were much more deeply read in this material than
                  has been previously assumed, and that many of them felt compelled to
                  respond—negatively, positively, ambivalently—to the development of new brain-based
                  psychologies. </p>
                  <p>Despite its unassuming stance, however, Richardson’s book aims to do more than simply recover a neglected
                  influence on Romantic-era culture. The polemical thrust of his book—understated
                  but nevertheless present—is that the entire “German swerve” of Romantic studies
                  has been misguided. Our traditional intellectual histories of the period
                  (encouraged by Coleridge, DeQuincey, and Carlyle) typically move from Hume to Kant
                  to post-Kantian German Romanticism and idealism; we read Romantic literary
                  production in light of these continental developments. Even scholarship that has
                  resisted this procedure—either through deconstructive criticism of the symbol or
                  materialist criticism of the German Ideology—has moved within the orbit of
                  post-Kantian Continental philosophy. Perhaps we now substitute non-identity for
                  the logic of identity postulated by an earlier generation of Romantic humanists,
                  but we continue to take our bearings from the questions and concerns that surfaced
                  in Kant’s wake. In consequence, the dualism of subject and object comes to
                  displace mind-body dualism as the chief philosophical problem, and it becomes
                  difficult to disentangle questions of consciousness from questions of
                     self-consciousness.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Again, there is a
                     complicated intellectual history that I must gloss over here, but Kant’s
                     discussion of “things as they are in themselves” in the <title level="m">Critique of Pure Reason</title> (1781) and Fichte’s distinction between
                     dogmatism and idealism in the first introduction to the <title level="m">Wissenschaftslehre</title> (1797) are the key moments in this transition
                     away from Cartesian questions. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Richardson’s procedure, by contrast, is to stay
                  closer to home by examining the (predominantly) British empirical tradition that
                  continued chugging along in Hume’s wake.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     As Richardson notes, there are Continental
                     connections as well: Herder, Diderot, Gall, and Spurzheim, among others.
                  </note> In his narration, the associationist paradigm derived from Locke
                  eventually ran aground with Hartley and Priestley, who conceived of the brain as
                  passive. But a new emphasis on the brain as an active participant in experience
                  developed in the post-associationist empirical tradition. Biologically rather than
                  mechanically inclined, Bell, Gall, Lawrence, and others emphasized the brain’s
                  plasticity rather than simply, like Hartley, treating it as a passive receptacle
                  for impressions.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Alan Richardson, <title level="m">British
                        Romanticism and the Science of Mind</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University
                     Press, 2001) 6.</note> Thus, Richardson
                  suggests that Coleridge’s extended diatribe against Hartley in the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> is a clever sleight-of-hand. By lumping
                  all empirical work on the brain under the banner of associationism, Coleridge is
                  able to dispense with the whole lot and then turn his attention to Schelling’s
                  idealism. But Richardson argues that this
                  ignores what is really going on in British brain science during the time that
                  Coleridge is writing, and in the process it transposes the mind-body problem into
                  a much more abstract and fuzzier subject-object problem. The apparatus of
                  self-consciousness, identity, and non-identity (and their eventual deconstruction)
                  follow in turn. </p>
                  <p>In asking us to resist this German swerve, Richardson’s work is bracing and—its professed modesty
                  notwithstanding—revolutionary. If he is right, we need to rethink Romanticism’s
                  privileged relationship with Continental philosophy and its various obsessions,
                  turns, and counter-turns. And even if Richardson
                  is not entirely right, the historical yield of his method is obvious. My question,
                  however, is a bit different: what is gained <emph>conceptually</emph> by relating
                  Romantic literary culture to the culture of Romantic-era brain science? To answer
                  this question we need to get a clear grasp of how Bell and Lawrence and the other
                  Romantic brain scientists relate phenomenal consciousness to its neural substrate.
                  And unfortunately this is far from clear.</p>
                  <p>I suspect that this is simply a limitation of the historical material Richardson is working with. All of the writers that
                  he treats were anti-dualist, were intensely interested in neurology, and with the
                  exception of Bell all were attacked as “materialists.” If they were alive today,
                  all of them would have held to NCC. But as I have been emphasizing, NCC does not
                  address the philosophical question of the relationship between phenomenal
                  consciousness and its neural substrate. Lawrence, Darwin, Bell, and the others
                  seem not to have posed the hard problem to themselves; apparently, they were
                  content with the extraordinary neurological discoveries they were making, and with
                  the physicalism (tempered in some cases with religious orthodoxy) that those
                  discoveries seemed to indicate. And, of course, who can blame them? </p>
                  <p>The difficult methodological issue for literary studies, however, is how we use
                  this material. How can we think through the relationship between a brain-based
                  psychology that accepts NCC and the Romantic literary production that arose
                  alongside it? Richardson, it seems to me,
                  largely avoids this question—or rather, he gives it an answer roughly analogous to
                  the empirical one that the NCC program itself pursues. Just as NCC either ignores
                  or dismisses the hard problem, so, lacking a conceptual account of how N relates
                  to C, Richardson treats his literary texts as
                  simple outgrowths or results of the contextual material he brings to bear upon
                  them. As a result his book must for the most part settle for tracing paths of
                  influence between various brain scientists and Romantic writers. Some of these
                  influences are tighter than others, and all are interesting. But the payoff is
                  limited; because the question of how phenomenal experience is possible <emph>at
                     all</emph> never comes up, Richardson is
                  unable to produce a “reading” of the literary artifacts he discusses and must
                  settle instead for contextualizing them. A revealing moment appears in the chapter
                  on Coleridge: “it seems appropriate to consider,” Richardson writes, <quote>whether Coleridge’s concerns with mind-body
                     interaction, unconscious cognition, and volition … seep into the text of “Kubla
                     Khan.” The result would be not another interpretation of the poem, but rather a
                     supplement to the work of contextualization… (57).</quote> One can of course
                  sympathize with the desire to avoid adding to the huge bibliography of “Kubla
                  Khan” commentary. And yet what this passage suggests is that any treatment of the
                  literary object’s novelty or uniqueness (however attenuated and hedged) will not
                  appear here. Indeed, Richardson names the site
                  of that novelty (“interpretation”) only to tell us that this is not his goal.</p>
                  <p>What Richardson’s book has helped me to
                  understand, then, is that the relationship of N to C that occupies the
                  consciousness literature is a tight analogue of the relationship of context to
                  text. That second relationship is of course the continuing and eternal <emph>bête
                     noir</emph> of literary studies—it is our own version of the hard problem. Like
                  partisans of NCC, Richardson (and many
                  historically-minded scholars of Romanticism writing today) favors context to the
                  virtual exclusion of text. Now I don’t pretend here to be making a point of which
                     Richardson is unaware. My point rather is
                  that in avoiding the philosophical issues at stake in brain-based psychologies,
                     Richardson’s book contributes perhaps
                  inadvertently to a continuing split between empirically-inclined historical
                  “contextualization” and theoretically-inclined textual “interpretation.” Despite
                  his resistance to Romanticism’s “German swerve,” then, the implication of Richardson’s book is that when it comes to literary
                  criticism, interpretive or philosophical questions only emerge within the context
                  of Continental theory, with its apparatus of self-consciousness and subject/object
                  dialectics. The work of historical contextualization, meanwhile, falls into the
                  (largely British) domain of the mind-body problem. I hope I have demonstrated that
                  this is incorrect; as the explosion in consciousness literature has demonstrated,
                  the mind-body problem remains a matter not solely of neurological explanation but
                  also of philosophical interpretation. </p>

                     <emph>Emergence theory</emph> is the example of (<hi>c1</hi>) that I will consider here. Emergentism flourished in
                  Britain between 1850 and 1925. John Stuart
                  Mill’s <title level="m">System of Logic</title> (1843) is generally cited
                  as its founding text; other famous emergentist works are George Henry Lewes’
                     <title level="m">Problems of Life and Mind</title> (1875), Samuel Alexander’s <title level="m">Space, Time,
                     and Deity</title> (1920) and C. D.
                     Broad’s <title level="m">The Mind and Its Place in Nature</title>
                  (1925). Many other intellectual giants of the period, including A. N. Whitehead,
                  William James, Arthur Lovejoy, and Henri Bergson espoused versions of emergentism.
                  In his thorough overview of the British Emergentists, Brian McLaughlin argues that the advent of
                  quantum mechanics in the late 1920s signaled the end of the emergentist tradition.
                  In particular, quantum mechanical explanations of chemical bonding in terms of
                  electro-magnetism made emergentist explanations of chemical laws irrelevant.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                     concerned exclusively with discussions of emergence in chemistry, which is
                     where emergence theory had the longest life. He doesn’t discuss consciousness
                     itself, except to write in a footnote that “Consciousness, it seems, is the
                     last refuge of an Emergentist” (91). </note> Until the advent of quantum
                  mechanics, however, emergence seemed like a highly plausible explanation for a
                  variety of phenomena. </p>
                  <p>According to emergence theory, some properties “emerge” from a physical substrate
                  in a way that cannot be explained from the perspective of that substrate (eg. from
                  the perspective of physics). Furthermore, these emergent properties cannot be
                  reduced to the properties of their physical substrate. In a familiar though
                  imprecise analogy, neither bees nor ants possess intelligence, and yet a bee-hive
                  or an ant colony could be said to possess intelligence; somehow intelligence
                  “emerges” from the way in which each individual ant or bee goes about its
                     task.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Such analogies proliferate in
                        Steven Johnson’s popular trade book <title level="m">Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and
                        Software</title> (New York: Scribner, 2001). </note> Consciousness,
                  accordingly, is sometimes said to be an emergent property in that it arises from a
                  physical substrate (the brain) and yet cannot be reduced to the brain, nor fully
                  predicted by the sciences of the brain. The issue of <emph>prediction</emph> is
                  important here: for a property to be emergent, no amount of knowledge about the
                  substrate will enable us to predict facts about the emergent property.
                  Consciousness (to stick with this example) emerges from lower-level systems, but
                  however much we might learn about those systems we will not be able to say what
                  consciousness looks like before it actually arrives on the scene. </p>
                  <p>In a slightly more technical idiom, emergence proposes that higher-level mental
                  properties are <emph>determined by</emph> and <emph>dependent upon</emph> lower
                  level properties—yet are not reducible to the lower-level properties. The delicate
                  balancing act required here is particularly tricky when it comes to the idea that
                  emergent properties must be not only unpredictable but <emph>novel</emph>. Of
                  course, objects can have properties that their parts do not have; a watch, for
                  example, tells time, while a random heap of springs and gears does not. The
                  novelty required for a property to be emergent must be of a different order than
                  this. At the same time, how can a property be truly novel and yet determined by
                  its physical substrate? This will require both that the arrangement of parts
                  brings something new into existence <emph>and</emph> that nothing new is actually
                  added to the mix from the outside. (Thus the soul is not emergent in classical
                  theological accounts because it is added to the body.) In this sense emergent
                  properties must supervene on their physical substrate—but it must be supervenience
                  such that C is determined by N but not identical to it.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This paragraph depends on Tim

                     Press 2001). </note> Given this description, it seems fair to say that
                  emergentism is an attempt to formulate a truly non-reductive physicalism. C.D. Broad, for example, referred to his

                  <p>“Non-reductive physicalism” might seem like an attempt to have one’s cake and eat
                  it too.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Alexander, for example, was a
                     vitalist about life, an identity theorist about mental processes, and an
                     emergentist regarding consciousness. </note> The conceptual coherence of
                  emergentism is not really my concern, however. What interests me, rather, is what
                  we can learn from the very existence of the emergentist option. Indeed, a number
                  of philosophers, including Tim Crane, Jaegwon Kim, and Brian
                     McLaughlin, have written about emergence in recent years not because
                  they are themselves emergentists but because they think that the problems and
                  difficulties faced by emergence tell us a good deal about what we need from an
                  adequate physicalist solution to the mind-body puzzle.</p>

                  <p>As an idea, “emergence” lends itself to analogical extrapolation. Though the
                  British Emergentists focused particularly on chemistry, Broad and Alexander at least were willing to extend their notion of fundamental
                  chemical laws in such a way as to make mentality an emergent property. More
                  recently, emergence theory has found new life in the cultural zone. In his essay
                  “A Forming Hand: Creativity and Destruction from Romanticism to Emergence Theory,”
                     Alan Liu notes the presence of emergentist thinking
                  in current models of information theory, management theory, ideas about artistic
                  autopoesis, complexity, and self-organization, and especially in notions of
                  “creative destruction” prominent in the business world. One of the goals of his
                  essay is to critique the one-size-fits-all picture of emergence that these various
                  cultural domains offer. Liu zeroes in particularly on
                  their relentless anti-historical bias: “[w]estern cognitive,
                  artificial-intelligence, new-media, business, and other theories of emergence,” he
                  writes, “celebrate their cause as a way to swear allegiance to democracy without
                  seeming also to swear to any old-fashioned individualism, nationalism, or
                  industrialism able to pull puppet strings in the background.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  current status as all-purpose explanation in the increasingly fragmented world of
                  late capitalism—is in this sense an ideology; like all ideologies it covers up
                  actual material and historical conditions (individualism, nationalism,
                  industrialism) and wows us precisely because it seems stripped of all the tiresome
                  conversations that such terms necessitate.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In this sense emergence can stand in for popular interest in the “cognitive”
                     in general—from mirror neurons to the “moral gene”—which seems to promise a
                     clean exit from social debates heretofore largely framed by the cultural Left
                     and its broad commitment to constructivist models of the self. In this context,
                        Liu’s staging of the dispute begins to look like
                     a stand-off between the humanities and the sciences. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet if emergence in this vein seems an appropriate object of critique, there is a
                  Romantic side to this story, as well, that is rather more complicated. Following
                  some of the recent work of Anne-Lise
                  François, Liu locates two distinct models of
                  creativity in Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Prelude</title>. One is the familiar model of “egotistical transgression” and
                  intensive lyric exceptionalism, as in the Spots of Time or Simplon Pass. The other
                  is found in those large sections of the <title level="m">Prelude</title> that we
                  typically skip over, the more discursive, everyday, <emph>extensive</emph>
                  give-and-take of life, imaged most powerfully by the Infant Babe and what Liu calls the “forming hand” passage of Book 2: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>A plastic power</l>

                           <l>Rebellious, acting in a devious mood,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Characterized by what Liu calls a
                  “distribution of inspiration along a whole chain of temporal transmission” (11),
                  this alternate mode of creativity is sprinkled liberally over broad patches of the
                     Wordsworth that we usually don’t read. For
                     Liu its “local spirit” becomes a Romantic
                  anticipation of emergence, a picture of lower-level agency that does its thing
                  without any inkling of a larger project: “There is agency, nothing but agency… but
                  no one at the control stick that would be identified as <emph>the</emph> agent.
                  Agency is a cascade of local agencies,” he writes (18). In this respect the
                  amorality of emergence does seem to capture something of our contemporary world
                  situation, in which things can go terribly wrong and there is no one around to
                  blame, just a cascade of local agencies going about their very limited
                     business.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Within emergence theory,
                        <emph>causation</emph> is the more technical version of Liu’s “agency.” Causal powers emerge as a matter of law, though that
                     law is not reducible to the laws governing the lower levels. Moreover, emergent
                     properties exhibit so-called downward causation, that is, they cause change
                     that cannot be predicted at the lower levels. So, for example, mental
                     properties, if they are emergent, would have causal powers that could not be
                     predicted according to the laws that govern the physical substrate of those
                     properties. This seems to violate what is known as “the causal closure of the
                     physical.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Liu is however also verging on a philosophical point,
                  which he makes somewhat casually a bit later in the essay. For emergence theory,
                  he writes, “[t]here is no transcendental manager of choices named ‘consciousness’
                  that sits above local choices” (30). Now this is true if we are dualists and think
                  of consciousness as some additional thing over and above its material substrate.
                  But it is <emph>not</emph> true if we think of consciousness itself as emergent
                  (or, for that matter, if one holds to at least some of the positions that I
                  gathered under category (<hi>b</hi>) above). Any non-reductive physicalism will
                  try hard to accommodate both the cascade of local choices that make up our
                  neurological reality and the first-person, phenomenal experience that makes up
                  what we call “consciousness.” Thus in Liu’s dismissal
                  of consciousness—as though any talk of consciousness is inevitably dualist—I find
                  a surprising similarity to Richardson’s approach
                  (surprising because they are quite different kinds of critics). Both give little
                  attention to the <emph>philosophical </emph>issues surrounding consciousness,
                  because both in their different ways are intent upon moving from neurological
                  wiring to cultural product. For Richardson that
                  means moving from Romantic theories of the mind/brain to the historical contexts
                  of Romantic literature; for Liu, it means moving from
                  emergent computer programs to contemporary management theory. Neither is terribly
                  interested in pausing along the way to consider the mind-body problem. Both seem
                  to assume that our only options are dualism or some version of position
                     (<hi>a</hi>); they ignore those responses I’ve gathered under headings
                     (<hi>b</hi>) and (<hi>c</hi>)—even though Liu is for
                  his part talking about emergence theory. </p>
                  <p>Liu’s description of emergence as amoral is important
                  for his larger project of identifying elective affinities between emergence theory
                  and the business culture of postmodernity, with its command to innovate
                  ceaselessly. But if we shift our attention to philosophical versions of emergence
                  a rather different picture appears. Alexander
                  and Broad, for instance, both
                  elaborated metaphysical systems in which the world was a basically meaning-full
                  place; emergence became a way to be a physicalist (“there is only one fundamental
                  kind of stuff,” writes Broad [77])
                  without committing oneself to a picture of the universe as fundamentally amoral
                  and directionless. And it is in the context of this elaboration that Alexander in 1920 has recourse to a resonant
                  phrase: <quote>The existence of emergent qualities thus described is something to
                     be noted, as some would say, under the compulsion of brute empirical fact, or,
                     as I should prefer to say in less harsh terms, to be accepted with the ‘natural
                     piety’ of the investigator. It admits no explanation.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  problem of consciousness—the very problem that, as I have tried to demonstrate,
                  tends to slip away from literary and cultural critics. </p>

                     </note> All three uses of the phrase are roughly equivalent, and each suggests an
                  affective disposition characterized by reverence and calm acceptance. Perhaps the
                  most intriguing possibility is that Alexander
                  got the phrase not from “My heart leaps up” itself but from the “Intimations” Ode.
                  In the 1815 edition of his <title level="m">Poems</title>
                  Wordsworth made the final three lines of “My
                  heart leaps up” the epigraph to the Ode.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     It is also tempting to speculate that the association of natural piety with
                     emergence comes from the George Eliot / G. H. Lewes relationship. Lewes in fact
                     coined the term “emergent.” </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say this is the “most intriguing” possibility because it allows us to push the
                  Romantic provenance of the natural piety/emergence relationship a bit further. The
                  figure who links Wordsworth to emergence
                  theory is John Stuart Mill. In Chapter 5 of his
                     <title level="m">Autobiography</title> (1873), Mill described an intellectual and spiritual crisis: “[M]y heart sank
                  within me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down. … I
                  seemed to have nothing left to live for.”

                   As is well known, in the autumn of 1828 Mill worked his way out of this crisis with the help of Wordsworth, specifically the 1815 <title level="m">Poems</title>, which “proved to be the precise thing for my mental
                  wants at that particular juncture” (151). Mill
                  then relates that by 1830 he had begun writing what would become the <title level="m">System of Logic</title>, eventually published in 1843. In his
                  description of that work, Mill revisits his
                  crisis in a more intellectual vein. In particular, he describes how he turned his
                  attention to what he called the “Composition of Forces”: <quote>On examining,
                     accordingly, what the mind does when it applies the principle of the
                     Composition of Forces, I found that it performs a simple act of addition. It
                     adds the separate effect of the one force to the separate effect of the other,
                     and puts down the sum of these separate effects as the joint effect. But is
                     this a legitimate process? In dynamics, and in all the mathematical branches of
                     physics, it is; but in some other cases, as in chemistry, it is not; and I then
                     recollected that something not unlike this was pointed out as one of the
                     distinctions between chemical and mechanical phenomena, in the introduction to
                     that favorite of my boyhood, Thomson's <title level="m">System of

                           <title level="m">Autobiography </title>167. Mill refers to Thomas Thomson’s <title level="m">System of

                           popularized John Dalton’s atomic theory. Thomson claimed (probably

                           nitrous oxide. Humphry Davy was of course the Romantic-era chemist most
                           associated with nitrous oxide; on Coleridge’s connection to Davy’s

                  that part of the <title level="m">System of Logic</title> that became central to
                  the emergentist tradition.

                        Mill postulates the existence of what he
                        calls “heteropathic laws”; George Henry Lewes would rename those same laws
                        “emergent laws.”<lb/>

                  <p>With Mill, in other words, we have an emotional
                  crisis solved in part by reading Wordsworth,
                  and, running parallel to that, an intellectual crisis solved in part by reading a
                  chemistry textbook. What the chemistry textbook gave Mill was the first intimation of emergence theory. Is it too much to
                  suppose that Wordsworth might have given him
                  a similar intimation? To be sure, chemistry and poetry seem tightly related in
                     Mill’s account. Inspired by Wordsworth’s own self-description in the
                  “Preface” to the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, Mill ascribes Wordsworth’s effectiveness as a spiritual guide to something almost
                  chemical in the writing itself: “What made Wordsworth's poems a medicine for my state of mind, was that they
                  expressed, not mere outward beauty, but states of feeling, and of thought coloured
                  by feeling, under the excitement of beauty” (151). If we want to picture this
                  familiar Wordsworthian effect, we could do
                  worse than imagine the invisible chemical bonds (“states of feeling”) by which
                  atoms (“mere outward beauty”) stick together. We might remember too that for the
                  emergentists these bonds were the result of fundamental chemical forces—proof that
                  chemistry was its own special science. </p>
                  <p>What makes the connection between chemistry and poetry more than simply an
                  interesting possibility, however, is that the poem that Mill singles out for treatment in this section of the <title level="m">Autobiography</title> is none other than the “Intimations Ode” in its 1815
                  edition—the edition, remember, with the epigraph from “My heart leaps up”:
                     <quote>At the conclusion of the Poems came the famous “Ode,” falsely called
                     Platonic, "Intimations of Immortality:" in which, along with more than his
                     usual sweetness of melody and rhythm, and along with the two passages of grand
                     imagery but bad philosophy so often quoted, I found that [Wordsworth] too had had similar experience to
                     mine; that he also had felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of
                     life was not lasting; but that he had sought for compensation, and found it, in
                     the way in which he was now teaching me to find it. (153)</quote> What Mill zeroes in on here is not the poem’s dualism
                  (dismissed as “bad philosophy”) but rather its description of the “compensation”
                  that comes after dualism has been abandoned. To see what that compensation is we
                  need look no further than the “chemical causes” that would become the foundation
                  of the emergentist tradition. </p>
                  <p>This is a reading of the “Ode,” then, that takes the epigraph seriously: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>The Child is father of the Man;</l>
                           <l>And I could wish my days to be</l>
                           <l>Bound each to each by natural piety</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Central to emergence theory is the idea that reality exists in
                  increasingly complex layers, each of which has its special science: physics, then
                  chemistry, then biology. Accordingly, to say that the man is father to the child
                  is to assert a biological relationship—and presumably to open the door to vitalist
                  or dualist speculations about the origins of life. To abandon the mysteries of the
                  paternal relationship altogether, however, is to commit oneself to mere mechanical
                  causation in a meaningless universe—and Mill had
                  already been through <emph>that</emph> spiritual crisis. By contrast, to say as
                  the poem does that the child is father to the man not only reverses the usual
                  claims about paternity but actually asserts a fundamental law such that manhood
                  emerges out of childhood in a way that has to be accepted with natural piety
                  because, as Alexander was to put it, it is not
                  susceptible to another explanation. Emergence allows Mill both enchantment and physicalism. In this reading of the “Ode” and
                  its epigraph, which I am suggesting was Mill’s
                  reading, natural piety is the appropriate attitude to take toward the fundamental
                  laws that are not susceptible to further explanation. The power of this
                  emergence/natural piety complex is demonstrated, in Mill’s account, by his discovery of emergent laws <emph>and</emph> by
                  his own personal spiritual recovery.</p>
                  <p>Brian McLaughlin argues that empirically we
                  don’t need emergence: there simply <emph>are</emph> no fundamental chemical forces
                  that have to be accepted with natural piety. But even setting aside such empirical
                  considerations, most philosophers are liable to be suspicious of natural
                  piety—just as cultural critics, for analogous reasons, are liable to be suspicious
                  of it. For natural piety seems to recommend that we just give up. Philosophers who
                  will continue to seek a metaphysical solution to the mind-body problem won’t like
                  this, nor will cultural critics who call us to ever more vigilant forms of
                  critique. Furthermore, the quasi-religious language of natural piety, especially
                  as it gets linked up to literature itself in Mill’s reaction to Wordsworth,
                  will elicit objections. If Alexander and Broad were elaborating the metaphysics of
                  Romanticism, then hasn’t that metaphysics already been subjected to stringent
                  critique in the debate between Romantic humanism and its deconstructive and
                  historicist interlocutors? </p>
                  <p>Here, though, I would insist upon the distinction I made near the beginning of
                  this essay between consciousness and self-consciousness. C. D. Broad, the last and probably
                  greatest exponent of the British Emergentist tradition, quoted Alexander’s invocation of natural piety
                  approvingly, but he titled his 1925 book <title level="m">The Mind and Its Place
                     in Nature</title>.
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors"> When Broad quoted Alexander, he added some sweetening of his own:
                     “there are certain differences which cannot be explained, even in part, but
                     must simply be swallowed whole with that philosophic jam which Professor Alexander calls ‘natural piety’.” See C. D. Broad, <title level="m">The Mind
                        and Its Place in Nature</title> (Paterson, NJ: Littlefield, Adams, and Co.,
                     1960), 55. </note> There is thus a crucial difference between Broad’s (Romantic) project and the
                  project of a Romantic humanist such as M. H.
                     Abrams, who writes for example in 1965 that “[t]he central enterprise
                  common to many post-Kantian German philosophers and poets, as well as to Coleridge
                  and Wordsworth, was to join together the
                  ‘subject’ and the ‘object’ that modern intellection had put asunder, and thus to
                  revivify a dead nature, restore its concreteness, significance, and human values,
                  and re-domiciliate man in a world which had become alien to him.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     M. H. Abrams, “Structure and Style
                     in the Greater Romantic Lyric,” <title level="m">Romanticism and Consciousness:
                        Essays in Criticism</title>, ed. Harold Bloom
                     (New York: Norton, 1970) 218. </note> Both Broad and Abrams are writing
                  about the relationship between the human subject and the material world. But the
                  crucial difference is that Broad is
                  interested in the mind-body problem and Abrams is interested in the subject-object problem, and the result of
                  that difference is that when Broad
                  considers the mind and its place in nature he can simply avoid the spiritual and
                  ideological weight that Abrams loads up
                  onto what he calls “Romantic philosophy.” Natural piety
                  understood through the lens of British emergentism is not an attempt to
                  “re-domiciliate man in a world that had become alien to him.” Rather, it is
                  consonant with a physicalist/naturalist solution to the mind-body problem. </p>
                  <p>Left intellectuals, trained by several generations of theorists suspicious of
                  “naturalization,” get nervous whenever anything is labeled “natural.” Upon
                  examination, though, such nervousness depends on an ambiguity in the notion of
                  nature itself. Keeping the focus on the mind-body problem rather than letting it
                  run off in various post-Kantian directions, my suggestion is that the British
                  Emergentist interest in natural piety might help us recover <emph>in a
                     theoretically interesting way</emph> the important strand of naturalism—that
                  is, physicalism—that runs through Wordsworthian Romanticism but that we lose sight of when we lose sight of
                  the mind-body problem.</p>

                  <p>Picking up on Wordsworth’s own language,
                     Harold Bloom many years ago called natural piety
                  a “binding agent,” and once again the chemical metaphor seems appropriate to the
                  history of emergetism. Bloom goes on, speaking of
                  the “Intimations Ode”: “Wordsworth’s poem is
                  concerned, not with a history of conceptualization, but with the flowing
                     <emph>given</emph> of our sensuous experience.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  natural piety serve to overwrite and simplify the political and emotional
                  complexities of the Ode: “the lyric reinstalls at the head of the text the
                  constant relation of man and nature, affirming at the outset the continuity that
                  the poem must labor to establish.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  Manning’s reading takes its place in a
                  well-established line of criticism that comes at Wordsworth via a critique of Burkean “second nature.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the classic example see James K. Chandler, <title level="m">Wordsworth’s Second Nature: A Study of the Poetry and
                        Politics</title> (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press,
                     1984).</note> What drives this line of thought—to reiterate my point—is a
                  notion of critique that takes the subject/object dialectic (Manning’s “relation of man and nature”) and its
                  deconstruction as its point of departure.</p>
                  <p>I want to side with Bloom in this debate. I think
                  he glimpses something that Manning does not, and
                  that it is the same thing that Liu glimpses when he
                  discusses the phenomenon of local agency in Book 2 of <title level="m">The
                     Prelude</title>. We can describe this thing as the “relation of man and
                  nature,” but this time in a way much closer to Broad’s mind-body physicalism (“the mind
                  and its place in nature”) than to Manning’s
                  invocation of subject-object dialectics. What Bloom
                  and Liu and Broad are all verging upon is the way that subjectivity emerges out of
                  the everyday and mundane material that nature offers up. These are descriptions,
                  in short, of the mind’s place in nature. </p>
                  <p>If this sort of naturalism or physicalism is not to simply fetishize nature,
                  though, we need to give it a little more theoretical heft. Recall that when he
                  first describes the attitude of natural piety, Alexander remarks that emergent laws could be “noted under the
                  compulsion of brute empirical fact, or, as I should prefer to say in less harsh
                  terms, to be accepted with the ‘natural piety’ of the investigator.” The
                  distinction between “brute empirical fact” and the “natural piety” of the
                  investigator catches one’s attention immediately, and it is tempting to read this
                  revision in ideological terms, such that “natural piety” becomes the way to soften
                  and ameliorate what is nevertheless a brute assertion. We might further note that
                  so understood, this revision nicely glosses one common reading of Romanticism
                  itself, as a conservative reaction to the modernity represented by a tradition of
                  scientific reasoning extending back to Bacon and Newton. </p>
                  <p>Once again, though, things look different if we come at natural piety from the
                  perspective of emergence. If the emergence of one set of properties from lower
                  level properties is the result of a basic law, and therefore doesn’t require
                  another law to explain it, it is certainly possible to put this idea in brute
                  terms. So understood, it would seem a long way from the fuzziness of natural
                  piety. Thus Colin McGinn: “It is implausible to
                  take these correlations [between neurons and conscious experience] as ultimate and
                  inexplicable facts, as simply brute. And we do not want to acknowledge radical
                  emergence of the conscious with respect to the cerebral; that is too much like
                  accepting miracles <emph>de re</emph>.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     McGinn, “Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?”
                     353. </note> Here McGinn dismisses natural piety
                  by linking it to belief in miracles, which seems about as far from brute empirical
                  reality as possible. Alexander, though, would
                  refuse to accept this distinction between the brute and the miraculous. The same
                  goes for Tim Crane, who argues that the natural piety
                  of the emergentists is worth attending to because “[t]he availability of the
                  emergentist position encourages us to look with suspicion on the idea that there
                     <emph>must</emph> nonetheless be a philosophical account” of the correlation
                  between body and mind. On this account, natural piety makes it possible to feel
                  that we don’t <emph>have</emph> to answer the mind-body problem. This, argues
                     Crane, is the epistemological attitude that
                  emergence recommends to naturalism.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                        Crane, “The Significance of Emergence,” 22. To
                     avoid confusion, I need to distinguish the attitude of natural piety from
                     position (<hi>a</hi>), for example the NCC program. Partisans of (<hi>a</hi>)
                     think we don’t have to solve the mind-body problem because it isn’t a problem;
                     partisans of natural piety think that the mind-body problem <emph>is a</emph>
                        <emph>problem</emph>; what they question is the drive to <emph>solve</emph> it.

                  </p>
                  <p>Working from a very different theoretical archive, Anne-Lise François reaches an analogous conclusion in her use of Wordsworthian natural piety to critique
                  biotechnology. If nature is conceptualized as simply brute, she notes, then it
                  begs for completion. Lately, of course, that completion has come in the form of
                  genetic tinkering: Bt corn, salmon that grow six times faster than normal,
                  silk-producing goats. One need not subscribe to some reified discourse of the
                  natural in order to want to resist this tinkering, which as François points out is done so often in the name
                  simply of undifferentiated “possibility,” the proliferation of “options” that
                  characterizes late capitalism, or even out of sheer boredom. Yet how does one
                  offer such resistance without fetishizing nature, falling back into a series of
                  oppositions (progressive/conservative, urban/rural, artificial/natural) that have
                  their own problematic histories? For an answer she also turns to natural piety,
                  which she nicely describes as “the precarious basis for an otherwise unjustifiable
                  choice in favor of already existing beings.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  recalls the complex relationship between brute and pious to which Alexander also gives voice: “on the one hand,”
                  writes François, the given is “a trope for
                  brute priority, for the intractable that precedes and escapes human decision; on
                  the other, [it is] the name for decision itself, the incalculable, unforeseeable
                  response that comes as if from nowhere and cannot be anticipated.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">François 46. See Jacques Derrida,
                     “Given Time: The Time of the King,” trans. Peggy Kamuf, <title level="j">Critical Inquiry</title> 18 (1992) 162-187.</note>
                  François is redacting Derrida here, and yet her way of putting it also returns us to Alexander. Thus, helped by François, I think at this point it becomes
                  possible to take Alexander at his word and view
                  brute priority and natural piety as really two descriptions of the same thing.
                  Moreover with the example of biotechnology in mind I believe we can accept his
                  implication that natural piety is to be “preferred” precisely because the bare
                  assertion of brute priority is generally not enough to get us to leave something
                  alone. Quite the contrary.</p>
                  <p>To say the least, this convergence of Derridean critique and analytic philosophy
                  of mind around a shared reading of natural piety is striking. In the context of a
                  technologically-driven imperative to outperform nature, a restless dissatisfaction
                  with the given and consequent desire to squeeze more out of it, natural piety
                  could take on a new life as a post-ideological ethic. “The challenge for the
                  critique of biotechnology,” François
                  concludes, “is to find ways of presenting incompletion as a mode of satisfied
                  knowledge, and indeterminateness as consummate temporal experience, not simply
                  deficient and as yet unachieved cognition” (68). Perhaps it has taken the biotech
                  revolution to reveal the thread of naturalism in Wordsworthian natural piety. I have been arguing, though, that this
                  thread was there all along, in the way in which the emergentist tradition took up
                     Wordsworthian natural piety as an approach
                  to the mind-body problem. “This [emergentist] way of treating the mind-body
                  problem,” writes Tim Crane, assumes “that we should
                  not say <emph>a priori</emph> when we should take the facts of nature to require
                  further explanation” (23). In my judgment, coming at this attitude of
                  epistemological modesty through the history of emergentism and the mind-body
                  problem insulates natural piety from charges of ideological bad faith more
                  securely than a Derridean approach can hope to do. As inspiring as I find François’ essay, it seems to me that she is
                  walking a very thin line, and that the naturalism she recommends could be rendered
                  more robustly through an engagement with the mind-body problem. </p>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>I don’t want to be taken as arguing that emergence/natural piety, “properly
                  understood,” is actually progressive. The point, rather, is to move away from the
                  language of progressive and conservative altogether. And rather than
                  mystificatory, I would argue that emergence/natural piety is the very opposite: it
                     <emph>deflates</emph> the language of progressive and conservative because it
                  deflates the oppositions (mind/nature, subject/object) in which that particular
                  political debate is embedded, and returns us to the more defined—if no less
                  mysterious—terrain of the mind-body problem. From this perspective, natural
                  piety’s commitments are broadly empirical and scientific, Anglo rather than
                  Germanic. Here is Broad: <quote>There
                     is nothing, so far as I can see, mysterious or unscientific about a
                     trans-ordinal law [his word for a potentially emergent law]….A trans-ordinal
                     law is as good a law as any other; and, once it has been discovered, it can be
                     used like any other to suggest experiments, to make predictions, and to give us
                     practical control over external objects (79). </quote> This is hardly the
                  language of anti-science. But then Broad goes on: <quote>The only peculiarity of it is that we must wait
                     till we meet with an actual instance of an object of the higher order before we
                     can discover such a law; and that we cannot possibly deduce it beforehand from
                     any combination of laws which we have discovered by observing aggregates of a
                     lower order. (79)</quote> “We must wait” seems, these days, about all we could
                  ask. It is after all with Broad’s
                  basically deflationary posture in mind that Tim Crane
                  remarks that “there is more to be said for the attitude of ‘natural piety’ than is
                  often recognized in recent philosophy of mind.” So to, I would propose, for recent
                  business “innovations,” for recent “advances” in genetic engineering, for recent
                  global military adventures—all of which, as Francois’ analysis helps us to see,
                  rush in deductively and are thus the very opposite of the epistemically-modest
                  empiricism of natural piety that Broad
                  recommends.</p>
                  <p>And so to, I am arguing, for recent literary study. One virtue of emergence theory
                  is that it forces us to concentrate on the murky and unclear relationship between
                  a novel property and its material determinants. Indeed, the emergentist attempt to
                  describe how C is determined by and dependent upon N, and yet is also something
                  over and above it, is a fascinating analogue of the ever-present discussion in
                  literary studies about the relationship between the literary object and the
                  various cultural forces that determine it. Like non-reductive physicalists, I
                  suspect, most of us want it both ways: we want to be able to dissolve the literary
                  object back into its social, cultural, and historical conditions, but we also
                  want, embarrassingly, to hold onto the novelty or uniqueness of the object
                     itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a related description of
                     this embarrassment, see Denise Gigante’s
                     suggestive remarks on vitalism in “Zeitgeist,” <title level="j">European
                        Romantic Review</title> 18.2 (2007) 265-72.</note> Its appearance on the
                  scene, we would like to think, was not <emph>entirely</emph> predictable. And we
                  would like to think that it has something to say to us.</p>
                  <p>My claim has been that philosophical discussions of consciousness have something
                  to teach literary studies about its own hard problem. And I have suggested that
                  emergence, as one approach to the hard problem of consciousness, has important
                  roots in the Romantic period itself. So understood, emergence and its recommended
                  posture of natural piety is a theory of non-intervention—“we must wait”—and,
                  because of this, an appreciation of the difficulty and importance of the mind-body
                  problem. </p>
