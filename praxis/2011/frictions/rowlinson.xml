               <p>The third of Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s Waverley novels, <title level="m">The
                     Antiquary</title> was published in 1816 and set in 1794. It was Scott&#8217;s
                  favorite among his novels and of them all displays the most playful consciousness
                  of itself as a fiction. Historic struggles elsewhere in the series are fought to a
                  close by characters who, according to Luk&#225;cs, engage in them as types of
                  whole contending classes. Here some of the same conflicts appear in a belated and
                  oddly inconsequential staging—Marx might say, as farce—with characters whose
                  enactments of political struggle the novel tends to expose as fantasy. &#8220;In
                     <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>,&#8221; as Ian Duncan writes,
                  &#8220;Scott undertakes what might be called the Shandyfication of historical
                  romance, glossing his earlier fiction and its cultural themes in a self-reflexive
                  and metafictional novel in which &#8216;nothing happens&#8217;&#8221; (<title
                     level="m">Scott&#8217;s Shadow</title> 139).<note n="2" place="foot"
                     resp="editors">For much of the twentieth century criticism of the Waverley
                     novels had their place in the history of realism as its dominant topic; the
                     facetiousness of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>&#8217;s representation
                     of history made it for this criticism a marginal title in the series.
                     Duncan&#8217;s treatment of the work results from his stated aim of taking
                     seriously the fictional character of Scott&#8217;s novels. The novel&#8217;s
                     stress on the unreliability of antiquarian narratives has led other critics to
                     adopt it as a key text in readings of Scott as a novelist whose realism is
                     strongly qualified by skepticism and a belief in the contingency of
                     representations of the past; see Elam and McCracken-Flesher. The novel has also
                     attracted interest as one of several among the Waverley novels in which the
                     claim of historical realism coexists more or less uneasily with an adoption of
                     the conventions of gothic; see Robertson.</note> The conflict of the Stewart
                  and Hanoverian monarchies thus dwindles into the after-dinner quarrels of Jonathan
                  Oldbuck, the antiquary of the title, and his neighbor, Sir Arthur Wardour.<note

                  and Oldbuck&#8217;s quarrels, the novel&#8217;s topic is historical closure; it
                  argues that the struggles these characters seem to represent are actually
                  concluded, and that both are in practice loyal subjects of a united Britain, who
                  share a single class position as members of the landed gentry. The differences
                  between them are mere remainders and are appropriately staged by their
                  disagreements about the value of old coins, curiosities, and other relics. These
                  disagreements arise, in their most elementary form, from the absence of single

                  it in service of political and historiographic arguments that differ widely from

                     Wilt. As I shall do in this essay, Wilt argues that there is a homology between

                     authorship as self-concealment.</note> In the first section of this essay,
                  however, we will discuss problems of identifying and representing money that do
                  not operate in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> only at the level of
                  character. Individual characters disagree about what counts as money, or show
                  irrational preferences for one representative of money over another. The novel
                  itself embraces difference and mediation in the money form; money proper&#8212;in
                  the form of silver, which in 1794 still provided the legal standard for British
                  money—appears in it only as an alien and unintelligible intruder. Standard money,
                  moreover, proves alien not only to the historical setting the novel represents,
                  but also to its own diegetic conventions. Its appearance produces a crux, not only
                  in the novel&#8217;s historical representation, but also in its text.</p>
               <p>When in chapter 22 Wardour presents Oldbuck &#8220;as a gift of friendship&#8221;
                  with a collection of antique coins and medals, begging him to choose those that
                  will improve his collection, he initiates a sequence of misunderstandings. Wardour
                  owes Oldbuck money&#8212;and is in fact offering the gift as propitiation before
                  requesting a further loan&#8212;so Oldbuck proposes to take the pieces at their
                  catalogue valuation as partial payment of the debt. Wardour objects both to the
                  confusion of a gift with payment, and more centrally to the catalogue itself, with
                  its implication that the curiosity&#8217;s value derives from the auction room
                  rather than from the mere facts of age and association with the crown. Oldbuck
                  himself shows a different kind of scepticism about market prices when he finally
                  values the gold and silver pieces at twenty guineas in bullion and as much more
                  only &#8220;to such fools as ourselves, who are willing to pay for
                  curiosity&#8221; (<title level="m">The Antiquary</title> ch. 22; Scott <title
                     level="m">The Waverley Novels</title> 3: 217). The market, in this final view,
                  would be a confederation of fools who collectively drive the curiosity&#8217;s
                  price over what Oldbuck ironically pretends to believe is its only real value,
                  that of the bullion it contains.</p>
               <p>The problem of valuing the curiosity involves both characters in contradiction.
                  Wardour owes Oldbuck a money debt, but offers him coins on which he does not want
                  to set a money value. Oldbuck proposes first to cite their value <emph>in</emph>
                  money, then to value them <emph>as</emph> money. For each of them the curiosity
                  flashes into existence, either as a gift or as a commodity in its own right, only
                  as the negation of money. The recurring difficulty of valuing old and curious
                  artifacts that Yoon Sun Lee has noted in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> is
                  especially acute in this episode because in the case of old coins the
                  indeterminate value of the curiosity is the mirror-image of the indeterminacy of
                  circulating coin, a trait of late eighteenth-century Scotland that forms one of
                  the novel&#8217;s minor recurring themes.</p>
               <p>Jonathan Oldbuck&#8217;s collecting mania is an object of mild satire throughout
                  the novel; the major vehicle for this satire is the beggar Edie Ochiltree.
                  Ochiltree is the novel&#8217;s principal truth-teller, repository of secrets, and
                  returner of persons and things to their proper places. One of his running jokes at
                  Oldbuck&#8217;s expense concerns the antiquary&#8217;s exchange of
                  &#8220;siller&#8221; with a packman for an artifact he believed to be an old coin.
                  Twice in the novel Ochiltree reminds him of this transaction, tormenting him with
                  the fact that the supposed &#8220;auld coin&#8221; had actually proved only to be
                  a &#8220;bodle&#8221; (<title level="m">Antiquary</title> chs. 4, 44; <title
                     level="m">WN</title> 2: 42, 400). This joke is odder than it at first seems,
                  since the bodle was a copper two penny piece of the old Scots coinage, which had
                  nominally been superseded at the Act of Union in 1707.<note n="6" place="foot"
                     resp="editors">Ochiltree&#8217;s Scots vernacular refers to money as either
                     &#8220;siller&#8221; or &#8220;gowd.&#8221; He distinguishes regularly between
                     the two, refusing gifts of gold as excessive, and begging only for silver. In
                     this respect, as in others, the novel is meticulous in its registration of the
                     heterogeneity of the circulating currency in late eighteenth-century
                     Scotland.</note> The bodle itself was last minted in 1697 (Stewart 117); since
                  the old Scots currency was converted into Sterling at the rate of twelve to one,
                  it might after the Union be said to have the value of one sixth of a
                  penny&#8212;though legally it had no monetary value at all. In 1794 a bodle would
                  thus have to be at least 97 years old; it would also have been a relic of
                  Scotland&#8217;s former status as an independent state with its own mint. Why does
                  Edie Ochiltree, apparently with the novel&#8217;s endorsement, take it for granted
                  that a bodle is not an &#8220;auld coin&#8221;?</p>
               <p>The episode demonstrates both the indeterminacy of the category
                  &#8216;money&#8217; and the curiosity&#8217;s status as money&#8217;s negative
                  image. The reason the bodle doesn&#8217;t count as an old coin in 1794 appears to
                  be that even a century after the last example was minted it still counts as money.
                  At the union the gold and silver Scots coinage was reminted to the English
                  standard; not so the copper. Nor was there anywhere in Britain enough copper
                  minted during the eighteenth century to supply the need for change. The result was
                  a dilapidated and heterogeneous copper circulation throughout the country, the
                  more so the further one got from the Mint in London. In the latter part of the
                  eighteenth century some merchants and manufacturers took to issuing their own
                  copper tokens to supply the needs of local trade. This practice, illegal though
                  tolerated, was especially common in Scotland (Stewart 124 and plate XX). Such
                  tokens continued to be issued into the nineteenth century; some were merely old
                  coins stamped with a new countermark: an 1811 example of such recycled coinage was
                  made from old bodles (Stewart 166), which suggests a terminal date for their
                  circulation as originally minted.</p>
               <p>The problematic relation of the curiosity to current coin is not the only form in
                  which <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> represents money&#8217;s
                  inhomogeneity and the consequent difficulty of identifying it. More important to
                  the plot than Oldbuck&#8217;s purchase of ambiguous coins is the duping of his
                  neighbor by a German named Dousterswivel. Dousterswivel&#8217;s swindle is to take
                  Wardour&#8217;s money as a fee, offering in exchange to discover by occult arts,
                  first a lead mine, then hoards of silver and gold supposedly hidden on his
                  property in the ruined priory of St. Ruth&#8217;s. During the course of the novel
                  Wardour is bilked of his entire fortune, with the eventual result that his
                  property is seized by creditors and he narrowly avoids bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Like Oldbuck&#8217;s pursuit of the curiosity, his neighbor&#8217;s quixotic
                  pursuit of gold and silver takes the form of an irrational exchange of money for
                  money. While Oldbuck makes himself ridiculous by exchanging good silver for bad
                  copper, Dousterswivel appeals to his victims by promising not only to multiply
                  their money, but to change its kind: "If you join wid Sir Arthur, as he is put in
                  one hundred and fifty—see, here is one fifty in your dirty Fairport banknote—you
                  shall put in one other hundred and fifty in de dirty notes, and you shall have de
                  pure gold and silver, I cannot tell how much!" (<title level="m">Antiquary</title>
                  ch. 23; <title level="m">WN</title> 3: 218). Dousterswivel&#8217;s arts will
                  transmute money from mere dirt into something sublime.</p>
               <p>In the Lacanian formula for the sublime, it is an object that has been raised to
                  the dignity of the Thing; that is to say, it is an object that can appear to fill
                  the gap or pay the debt on which the Symbolic order is founded (Lacan 126, 134).
                  In Scott, the promise of such an object always turns out to be a snare:
                  Wardour&#8217;s acceptance of the offer to produce pure gold and silver in
                  exchange for paper money leads him to spend his entire fortune and everything he
                  can borrow. His debts are paid in the end with bills of exchange supplied by the
                  novel&#8217;s pseudonymous hero Lovel in a resolution that restores the
                  circulation of symbolic as well as monetary debt, since Lovel&#8217;s gift is
                  ultimately repaid by his marriage to Wardour&#8217;s daughter.</p>
               <p>In the interim, however, Doutserswivel&#8217;s diggings in fact prove to contain
                  silver ingots worth &#163;1000. These have "neither inscription nor stamp upon
                  them, excepting one, which seemed to be Spanish" (<title level="m">The
                     Antiquary</title> ch. 23; <title level="m">WN</title> 3: 225). Their origin is
                  a mystery, especially to Dousterswivel, who is deluded by the discovery to believe
                  in his own spells, and ultimately led to become his own greatest dupe. Eventually,
                  the silver turns out to have been left as a gift for the almost-bankrupt Baronet
                  to find. Both the medium of the gift—unstamped silver—and the means of conveying
                  it have been chosen to conceal that its source is Lovel, his daughter&#8217;s
                  suitor.</p>
               <p>Lovel&#8217;s courtship of Sir Arthur&#8217;s daughter Isabella is the
                  novel&#8217;s principal narrative thread; he believes himself to be illegitimate,
                  and the bar to his suit is a prejudice against illegitimacy that has been handed
                  down in the Wardour family ever since its founding. The blank surface of the
                  silver ingots he leaves for the baronet both conceals his identity and figures the
                  bastard&#8217;s lack of a proper name. But the romance-plot of <title level="m"
                     >The Antiquary</title> is oriented towards the discovery at its close that the
                  hero is not illegitimate at all. He was raised as the illegitimate son of Geraldin
                  Neville, in Yorkshire, but discovers that Neville had in fact only adopted and not
                  fathered him. When his adoptive father refused to reveal his real paternity, the
                  son renounced his name and took the fictitious one of Lovel. He inherits the
                  mysterious silver from Neville, who dies in the course of the novel; it had come
                  to Neville as plate from the family of Glenallan, of which Lovel/Neville&#8217;s
                  real father is the head. The novel as Scott published it affirms that the blank
                  silver ingots which make it possible for the son to conceal his identity—as Lovel
                  or Neville—had originally been melted down to conceal <emph>from him</emph> the
                  identity he bears without knowing it as the heir of Glenallan, with whose arms the
                  silver plate would have been stamped.</p>
               <p>The silver ingots at the center of this episode appear to resolve the problem we
                  began with, that of money&#8217;s indeterminate identity. Britain in the
                  eighteenth century was nominally on a silver standard; the silver coinage was in
                  such poor condition, however, that legislation of 1774 provided that silver would
                  be legal tender for debts of over &#163;25 only by weight, not by tale
                  (Kindleberger 61). A box of silver ingots would in 1794 have been the most exact
                  possible representation of money as such. In this form, money is antithetical to
                  symbolic identity; the blank surface of the silver figures the effaced names of
                  those through whose hands it has passed and the illegibility of its own
                  history.</p>
               <p>The effects of Scott&#8217;s representation of money as a materialized gap in the
                  Symbolic, however, are not confined within the frame of his novel. The
                  impossibility of accounting for the silver&#8217;s appearance in
                  Dousterswivel&#8217;s excavations is a problem that the novel shares with its own
                  characters. The sentences from chapter 45 (<title level="m">WN</title> 3: 408-09)
                  that provide the narrative summarized above are, like the novel&#8217;s
                  protagonist, of dubious legitimacy. They are uttered by &#8220;Lovel&#8221;
                  himself, and, as we have seen, they explain that the silver&#8217;s ultimate
                  source was his father the Earl of Glenallan. At this point in the novel, however,
                  &#8220;Lovel&#8221; does not yet <emph>know</emph> his true descent&#8212;that
                  discovery is reserved for the following paragraph. His explanation of the
                  silver&#8217;s source thus assumes information he does not yet possess. The
                  novel&#8217;s latest editor, David Hewitt, has discovered that this error in its
                  diegesis was introduced into the novel as an authorial revision. Scott originally
                  had &#8220;Lovel&#8221; explain that he bought the silver from a bank that had
                  recently imported it, and it is this version that Hewitt prints in his 1995
                  Edinburgh edition. Scott changed the story on the verso of his original manuscript
                  before the relevant passage had been set up in type, though, and it was the
                  revised version that appeared in print, both in the first edition and in each of

               <p>Scott&#8217;s plot required that the money-hoard uncovered by Dousterswivel should
                  have no legible history. It hence could not have been paper, or even coin. But the
                  Scottish monetary system in the second half of the eighteenth century afforded no
                  very plausible source of specie. Unlike England, where gold and silver were in
                  general circulation owing to a ban on banknotes of less than &#163;5 (Kindleberger
                  78), in Scotland small denomination banknotes had driven most gold and silver out
                  of circulation. Much of what precious metal did make its way to Scotland was used
                  to pay debts in England, which enjoyed a trade surplus with Scotland throughout
                  the eighteenth century. The effect on Scottish money and banking was notorious: in
                  1776 Adam Smith estimated the whole Scottish circulation at &#163;2 million, of
                  which no more than a quarter was in gold and silver (1: 316). Scott writes in 1826
                  of Scotland as a nation that had adopted paper money because it &#8220;is too poor
                  to retain a circulating medium of the precious metals&#8221; (<title level="m"
                     >Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</title> 3: 350).</p>
               <p>The unlikelihood of finding &#163;1000 worth of silver at a rural Scottish bank in
                  1794 seems to have led Scott to revise his original account. Hewitt retains the
                  deleted reading in the name of narrative coherence, but at the cost of introducing
                  an historical and textual anomaly. Needing to represent an embodiment of money
                  whose history is as illegible as its protagonist&#8217;s, the novel succeeds too
                  well, and produces one of whose history its own text can provide only defective
                  accounts. The representation of money as such opens an irreducible textual
                  fault.</p>
               <p>This fault does not arise from the divided political allegiance of
                  eighteenth-century Scots, but from divided allegiance among Scott&#8217;s modern
                  editors with respect to the authority of manuscript and print.<note n="8"

                  in the social process by which Scott and others produced the historical phenomenon

               <p>&#8220;Mr. Cadell, there is a certain thing called Capital. You should look to
                  that, for these times are bad, and your transactions very large&#8221; (Constable
                  3: 361). Thus the manager of an Edinburgh bank to Robert Cadell, Archibald
                  Constable&#8217;s junior partner, in the fall of 1815. Constable had already
                  published the first two Waverley novels and had the third, which was to be <title
                     level="m">The Antiquary</title>, under contract; it was eventually published in
                  May of 1816. Publishing Scott was an expensive business as well as a lucrative
                  one, and, as this rebuff implies, Constable carried it on for the most part with
                  borrowed money. In refusing to extend further credit, Cadell&#8217;s interlocutor
                  tells him that the amount of his firm&#8217;s transactions with borrowed money is
                  already in disproportion to the small size of its own capital.</p>
               <p>Cadell must have found it a heavy-handed irony to be addressed not as if his firm
                  had too little capital, but as if he had never heard of it. Like other rhetorical
                  figures that sometimes intrude on discussions of money (&#8220;Do you think
                  I&#8217;m made of money?&#8221; &#8220;Money doesn&#8217;t grow on trees&#8221;)
                  however, this one suggests a problem of reference for which its extravagance is a
                  kind of compensation. <emph>Is</emph> capital a thing? How sure can anyone, even a
                  banker, be of recognizing it when they see it? </p>
               <p>Marx&#8217;s elementary formula for capital in Vol. 1 of <title level="m"
                     >Capital</title>, M-C-M, designates the exchange of money for a commodity that
                  is once more sold as money. For our purposes, the central point of this formula is
                  that it locates the identity of capital in the money form. Though capital may and
                  indeed must repeatedly assume the form of commodities, these commodities&#8217;
                  identity as capital depends upon their eventual retransformation into money. The
                  commodity is capital&#8217;s &#8220;disguised&#8221; mode of existence, while
                  money is its &#8220;general&#8221; one; capital&#8217;s &#8220;identity with
                  itself&#8221; can be affirmed only by its repeated re-embodiment of itself in
                  money (Marx 255).<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">For discussion of capital
                     as a subject in Marx, see Postone 75-81.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For Marx money is both a commodity, the material product of social labor, and the
                  mediator of other commodities&#8217; value. As capital, however, money is a
                  mediator that appears to mediate itself; at the center of <title level="m"
                     >Capital</title> is the critique of this appearance. For Marx the appearance of
                  capital&#8217;s self-identity belongs to metaphysics, and he satirizes the way it
                  &#8220;differentiates . . . itself from itself&#8221; while still remaining the
                  same by comparing it to the theology of the Incarnation, according to which
                  &#8220;God the Father differentiates himself as God the Son&#8221; (256).</p>
               <p>The project of <title level="m">Capital</title> is to dissolve this appearance of
                  capital&#8217;s identity. In discussing Scott, we are concerned with an historical
                  moment at which that appearance has scarcely yet been constituted. If money is the
                  medium in which capital identifies itself, Scott wrote at a time and in a place
                  where the money supply was in practice extremely heterogeneous and monetary theory
                  was a hotly debated topic in political economy. As we have seen, in Scotland
                  throughout the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the circulating
                  currency mostly comprised notes of Scottish joint-stock banks and dilapidated
                  token coin. Legal tender coin minted in England was rarely found there. Between
                  1797 and 1817, moreover, all of Britain was in the anomalous position of having
                     <emph>no</emph> legal tender in circulation. Owing to the exigencies of
                  wartime, the government prohibited the Bank of England from paying out gold and
                  allowed issues of small-denomination bank notes to circulate in its place.<note
                     n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">From 1797 to 1821 the Bank Restriction Act
                     forbade the Bank of England from redeeming its notes in gold. From 1817, the
                     Bank began to mint gold in the form of a new coin with a one-pound face value,
                     the sovereign. Owing to the overissue of notes that Restriction made possible,
                     however, most of the early sovereigns were immediately taken out of the country
                     rather than being used in Britain at a depreciated value. See Clapham 2:
                     63-64.</note> Gold and silver rapidly became scarce throughout Britain, but the
                  government decided that they would remain the only legal tender. During this
                  period, adjudicating the value of different representatives of money was an
                  everyday problem for Britons of all classes.</p>
               <p>This history provides a backdrop to the specific conditions in which Scott sold
                  his labor in the Waverley novels during the first two decades of the nineteenth
                  century. In a cash-poor economy without capital markets or facilities for
                  long-term lending other than on mortgage, trade was financed by regional or
                  trade-specific networks of short-term credit. When Scott sold his labour he
                  encountered his publishers&#8217; capital as a series of obligations dispersed in
                  networks of this kind.</p>
               <p>The commodity forms in which Scott sold his labour were no more ready to assume a
                  determinate form than the money for which he exchanged them. Until the end of the
                  eighteenth century, authors&#8217; agreements with publishers normally involved
                  the outright sale of copyright for a one-time payment or, in exceptional cases,
                  for other consideration such as an annuity. The transfer of copyright would be
                  embodied in the delivery of fair copy to the press, and, from the point of view of
                  the author, copyright as an abstraction would remain invisible. Scott&#8217;s
                  contracts were very different. For all of the Waverley novels, he retained the
                  copyright at the time of first publication and sold only the right to publish
                  editions of a specified size. The copyrights to the first nine of the series were
                  sold to Constable in a separate agreement in 1819; Scott retained his subsequent
                  copyrights until he became insolvent in 1826. Scott&#8217;s contracts are thus
                  documents in the historical development of commodity forms in which intellectual
                  labor circulates independently of any particular material embodiment. In his
                  practice, however, this apparent independence is invariably qualified. Scott did
                  not merely license his publishers to print editions of his work; he ensured that
                  the physical books making up the edition would be printed at his press. The mass
                  sale of his copyrights to Constable in 1819 was accompanied by a gift of all the
                  corresponding manuscripts—whose return Scott demanded when in 1826 he sued to
                  recover the copyrights on the grounds that they hadn&#8217;t been paid for. The
                  commodity forms involved in these transactions&#8212;and indeed the nature of the
                  transactions themselves&#8212;prove to be as indeterminate as the money that
                  mediates them.</p>
               <p>It is my main theoretical claim in this essay that the indeterminate form in which
                  Scott sold the labor embodied in his novels is allegorized in traits of the novels
                  themselves. The most important of these for my purpose is their anonymity.<note

                  <title level="m">Waverley</title>, the first novel of the series, was published
                  anonymously in 1814; upon its success, the next two were published as by
                  &#8220;the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>.&#8221; Subsequent novels
                  either appeared under this signature, or were presented by &#8220;editors&#8221;
                  under obviously fictitious names as works deriving from oral or manuscript
                  traditions. Very soon, this kind of elaborate disguise of the author&#8217;s
                  identity was recognized as itself a trait of what came to be known as the Waverley
                  novels. Though I am afraid that at this point the analogy will seem fanciful, the
                  identity of the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>, like that of capital
                  itself in Marx&#8217;s account, becomes an effect of serial self-reference and
                  self-disguise.</p>
               <p>Scott himself seems to have half believed that there was an uncanny connection
                  between the anonymity of his work as a writer of fiction and the historically
                  unprecedented sums he made by it. In writing about his earnings, he tends to
                  describe them as if they had been gained by a deception, or else by magic.
                  Consider the following, published in a retrospect of his career written well after
                  insolvency had forced Scott to give up his incognito. Looking back at his the
                  period of his anonymity, he writes that &#8220;in the pen of this nameless
                  romancer, I seemed to possess something like the secret fountain of coined gold
                  and pearls vouchsafed to the traveller of the Eastern Tale " (<title level="m"
                     >Chronicles of the Canongate</title>, Introduction; <title level="m">WN</title>
                  19: 321). One striking point about this figure is that even as Scott in a signed
                  preface acknowledges his identity as author of the Waverley novels, he disavows
                  it, referring in the third person to &#8220;the nameless romancer&#8221; who held
                  the pen that composed them. Another is that the figure&#8217;s identification of
                  the pen and the fountain is founded as much on the fact that they are both secret
                  as on their apparently limitless flow. Taken as a whole, the figure aligns the
                  authorship of the Waverley novels with possession of the money for which they were
                  sold, both the money and the novels being tokens of an identity that is
                  constitutively secret and fated to vanish when revealed.<note n="12" place="foot"
                     resp="editors">Scott&#8217;s money and his incognito really did vanish
                     together; as he faced insolvency in late 1825, he knew that one of the
                     consequences would be his exposure as the Author of Waverley. Hence his
                     complaint in his <title level="m">Journal</title>: &#8220;the wand of the
                     Unknown is shivered in his grasp. He must henceforth be termed the Too well
                     known&#8221; (Scott <title level="m">Journal</title> 40). Here too for Scott
                     the magic of authorship is the magic of money, and both of them disappear when
                     they are exposed to view.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The anonymity of the Waverley novels was not merely an extrinsic fact about them.
                  Rather, it reiterated on the title page formal and thematic preoccupations with
                  signature, anonymity, and disguise that also appear in the body of the texts. Each
                  of the first three of the series has a protagonist who is effectively separated
                  from his signature. The protagonists of <title level="m">Guy Mannering</title> and
                     <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> cannot sign because they do not know
                  their own names. Waverley knows his all too well; the romance of his life begins
                  when he is separated from it by the theft of his signet ring. Without his
                  knowledge the signet is used to enlist him as a supporter of the 1745 Jacobite
                  uprising&#8212;and in so doing, ironically, to constitute for him the true
                  symbolic identity he is destined to assume. In each of these novels, then, Scott
                  works a gambit in which the protagonist&#8217;s proper signature is hidden from
                  him and from other characters. In Scott&#8217;s subsequent fiction the deception
                  of characters about their own identity is less characteristic than the deception
                  of the reader; it becomes a favorite device of his to introduce a major character
                  under a disguise that is only gradually lifted. Often the character is the monarch
                  or a claimant of the throne, as in the cases of <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>,
                     <title level="m">Quentin Durward</title>, and <title level="m"
                     >Redgauntlet</title>. Even where the reader is in on the secret, Scott&#8217;s
                  monarchs are typically as fond of masquerade, concealment, and bluff as the Author
                  of <title level="m">Waverley</title> himself.</p>
               <p>The Waverley novels often represent a narrative of the protagonist&#8217;s
                  self-discovery; in these narratives, the protagonist&#8217;s proper name and
                  symbolic identity are hidden in the world the novel represents, from which they
                  emerge to view before the close. They are often embodied in a material token, the
                  symbolon, such as Waverley&#8217;s signet or Elspeth Mucklebackit&#8217;s ring in
                     <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>. From a formal standpoint, such
                  narratives are a guarantee of closure; the novel sets no problems and presents no
                  appearances for which it does not contain the corresponding solution or reality.
                  The material token that the novel represents as guaranteeing the identity of its
                  protagonist thus also figures its identity with itself.</p>
               <p>Precisely because it recurs from novel to novel, the protagonist&#8217;s narrative
                  of self-discovery is a central topic in criticism of Scott&#8217;s fiction;<note
                     n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">For Alexander Welsh this narrative is a

                     involves accession to real estate. The identity-conferring power of this kind
                     of property is distinguished from the effect of conveyables, from too close an
                     association with which Scott &#8220;carefully protects&#8221; his heroes and
                     heroines at the novels&#8217; endings (Welsh 79).</note> among the effects of
                  its recurrence is to undermine the closure that it also guarantees. At the opening

                  novel&#8217;s title character under the name of Lovel. It emerges however that the
                  name is a disguise which he has been using to conceal the name under which he was
                  raised, that of Neville. Finally, at the novel&#8217;s close, the antiquary learns
                  that he himself possesses the information necessary to discover the truth about
                  his friend&#8217;s birth, and is able to inform him that his name is no more
                  Neville than it is Lovel, but is rather William Geraldin. In this last reversal
                  the dupe and the subject of knowledge change places with a symmetrical neatness
                  that provides the novel&#8217;s final cadence. The effect of closure is however
                  undermined by the traits that <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>&#8217;s
                  protagonist shares with those of other novels. These traits liken him for instance
                  to Waverley, to Harry Bertram, to Frank Osbaldistone, and to others from other
                  novels in the series.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">For a discussion of
                     fraternal similarities among the Waverley protagonists, see Welsh 27.</note>
                  The truth of the protagonist&#8217;s identity and filiation was only apparently
                  contained within a single text; as soon as this appearance is breached, so too are
                  the borders of the text itself.</p>
               <p>In some of the paratexts with which Scott increasingly surrounded his novels as
                  the series developed, he dramatizes the permeability of their borders by putting
                  characters from different novels together in a single scene and even allowing them
                  encounters with the anonymous Author who invented them. The most elaborate such
                  paratext is the introduction to <title level="m">Tales of the Crusaders</title>,
                  published in 1825; it presents itself as the transcript of a meeting between the
                  still-anonymous Author of Waverley and a miscellaneous collection of characters
                  from the novels—or, where this would violate chronology, of their descendants.
                  Present therefore are Jonathan Oldbuck of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>,
                  Josiah Cargill of <title level="m">St. Ronan&#8217;s Well</title>, Lawrence
                  Templeton, the purported editor of <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, Captain
                  Clutterbuck of <title level="m">The Monastery</title> and <title level="m">The
                     Fortunes of Nigel</title>, the son of Dandie Dinmont of <title level="m">Guy
                     Mannering</title> and so forth. The introduction&#8217;s conceit is that the
                  characters, along with the Author, have produced the Waverley novels already in
                  print collectively, in accordance with &#8220;the doctrine so well laid down by
                  the immortal Adam Smith, concerning the division of labour&#8221; (<title

                  They meet here as joint proprietors of what the Author of Waverley describes as
                  &#8220;the valuable property which has accumulated under our common labour&#8221;

                     level="m">WN</title> 19: 11). By the late twentieth century characters could be
                  a form of intellectual property, and a text representing in a single scene
                  characters from divers sources is thus in our own day not only an example of the
                  intertextual citation of character but also of the social circulation of
                     value.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Think of Warner Bros. cartoons
                     that represent a variety of characters from their &#8220;stable,&#8221; or of
                     the heterogeneous mass of personified intellectual properties that is Disney
                     World.</note> For Scott, the assembly of the characters is more ambiguous: they
                  appear as proprietors as well as property, and even the Author of Waverley
                  himself, when he becomes a character in a Waverley novel, becomes a part of the
                  property of which he is also the proprietor. The breaching of the novelistic
                  border effected by paratext here generates an incoherence or internal
                  differentiation in the notion of property as such.</p>
               <p>To put the point otherwise, I am claiming that the difficulty in the Waverley
                  novels of identifying certain characters, like the difficulty of identifying the
                  author, allegorizes the difficulty of identifying the value form of the novel
                  itself. Like the King, the protagonist, or the author, the Waverley novel too
                  comes hedged about by disguises and proxies in the form of prefaces, frames, and
                  apparent narrative dead ends. Insofar as these formal traits are shared by novels
                  with different historical settings they are anachronisms; in <title level="m">The
                     Antiquary</title> we saw that the anachronism of disputing the monarch&#8217;s
                  legitimacy is an explicit theme, conveyed by staging the difference between the
                  Jacobite and Whig positions as a dispute between antiquaries and reducing it to a
                  series of disagreements over the authenticity and value of curiosities.</p>
               <p>These disagreements, however, remain unresolved at the novel&#8217;s close.
                  Moreover, the botched or disputed purchase of the curiosity is one of the forms in
                  which it presents <foreign>en travesti</foreign> the exchange of money for money.
                  This exchange, which Marx was to identify as the elementary form of capital,
                  appears in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> only as a mistake or a
                  deception. The exchange M->M in Marx enables an identification; in <title level="m"
                     >The Antiquary</title>, quite the contrary, it is structured by difference and
                  masquerade. The novel&#8217;s insistence on the problem of relating money to
                  money, indeed on the problem of identifying money, leads me to propose that in its
                  allegorical dimension, as is necessarily the case with allegory, it has more than
                  one point of historical reference. Though the topic of money&#8217;s indeterminacy
                  appears in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>&#8217;s representation of 1794
                  as an after-image of historic struggles that the novel regards as closed, it also
                  falls on it as a shadow of the future in which the novel itself will be written
                  and published.<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors"><emph>Untimeliness</emph>
                     is a crucial trait of the allegorical object in Walter Benjamin, whose

               <p>For historical and geographical reasons, Scott had a particularly acute experience
                  of the impossibility of fully identifying a capital: of specifying what is and
                  what is not part of it at a given moment, and of symbolizing his own relation to
                  it. Scott&#8217;s relations with his publishers were so complex that it is
                  difficult to discover in them the underlying exchange of the product of his labor
                  for money. The formal anonymity under which the novels appeared to the public was
                  maintained, as a more or less transparent fiction, with their various publishers.
                  For the most part Scott communicated with his publishers through the brothers John
                  and James Ballantyne, who in functioning as his literary agents carried on
                  correspondence for him in which he is typically referred by periphrasis, usually
                  as the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>. In his communications with his
                  publishers themselves, then, Scott acts by proxy. As his hand is concealed in his
                  negotiations with the publishers, moreover, so it is in the production of the
                  novels themselves, of which the publishers were not shown the original
                  manuscripts. Sometimes they were allowed to read transcriptions by James
                  Ballantyne; more often they were only shown page proofs printed at
                  Ballantyne&#8217;s press.</p>
               <p>James Ballantyne&#8217;s press was thus the medium in which the work of
                  Scott&#8217;s hand was transmuted into the anonymous Authorship of the Waverley
                  novels. It was not, however, only as a producer and seller of fiction that
                  Scott&#8217;s identity was hidden by the Ballantynes. Much more closely held than
                  the secret of his authorship was the further secret that Scott himself owned more
                  than half of Ballantyne&#8217;s printing office and was in fact the dominant
                     partner.<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">Scott had known James
                     Ballantyne since they were schoolboys together in Kelso. By 1800 Ballantyne was
                     the owner of a thriving print-shop and a newspaper there; at that date Scott
                     proposed to him that he should set up shop in Edinburgh. This he did in 1802,
                     with the assistance of a &#163;500 loan from Scott, leaving the Kelso business
                     in the hands of his brother Sandy. In 1805 Scott increased his investment in
                     the firm to &#163;2008, becoming half-owner (Johnson 233). The partnership
                     continued until the crash of 1826, with the exception of the years 1816-22,
                     during which Scott assumed sole ownership of the firm, while Ballantyne
                     continued to manage it at a salary of &#163;400 a year (Johnson 516, 764).
                     Constable certainly knew that in dealing with the Ballantynes he was
                     effectively dealing with Scott. On the other hand, in 1826 Scott was obliged to
                     reveal his dealings to his own lawyer, who affirms that he had no idea that
                     Scott was involved in the printing firm (Gibson 4-5). See also the discussion
                     of this controversial aspect of Scott&#8217;s business dealings in Sutherland
                     97-98.</note> All Scott&#8217;s contracts for his novels stipulated that they
                  be printed at Ballantyne&#8217;s; he was moreover paid for them through
                  Ballantyne&#8217;s, in such a way that the distinction between the payment for the
                     <emph>right</emph> to print a specified number of copies of a work and the
                  payment for the <emph>printed copies themselves</emph> is far from explicit. Using
                  the Ballantynes as intermediaries, Scott confronts his publishers at once
                  and&#8212;on my reading of the contracts&#8212;indistinguishably as the seller of
                  a copyright and as the seller of printed volumes.</p>
               <p>The mystification of Scott&#8217;s identity as an author is thus inseparable from
                  the mystification of the commodity form into which his written work was absorbed
                  when it was sold and became capital. This mystification is in part due to the
                  relatively recent appearance of copyright as a commodity form in its own
                     right.<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">See Rose 67-112 for an account
                     of the eighteenth-century emergence of copyright as a form of abstract
                     intellectual property created by an author&#8217;s labor. Copyright in this
                     form replaced the earlier institution of copy; this was a license to print a
                     given work granted by the Stationers&#8217; Guild and ultimately sustained by
                     state power. The history of intellectual property began with the first
                     copyright statute, passed in 1710; disputes over how the statute was to be
                     applied were however not resolved until the House of Lords&#8217; verdict in
                     Donaldson v. Becket in 1774. It was in the legal and philosophical debates over
                     copyright during this period that the idea of the author as producer of an
                     abstract intellectual property distinct from any of its material embodiments
                     entered British jurisprudence and publishing practice. For another account of
                     Donaldson v. Becket as a decisive moment for the whole subsequent history of
                     intellectual property, see St. Clair 111-21. For a theory of the
                     &#8220;commodity-text&#8221; as the form of abstract intellectual property that
                     emerged in the period 1710-74 and an account of its difference from the
                     &#8220;commodity-book,&#8221; see Feltes 7-8.</note> But its fundamental
                  determinant in Scott&#8217;s case is as a reflection of the money-form in which
                  the value of Scott&#8217;s labor was realized. No more in Scotland in 1815 than at
                  other times and places could transactions on the scale of Scott&#8217;s and
                  Constable&#8217;s have conveniently been carried out in cash. David Hewitt
                  estimates Scott&#8217;s share of the profits from the first 5000 copies of <title
                     level="m">The Antiquary</title> at about &#163;1682 (364), independent of his
                  share of the profits from the printing-office. In England during the period of the
                  Bank Restriction Act (1797-1821), and in Scotland at any time since the early
                  eighteenth century, the payment of such a sum in legal tender coin would have been
                  almost unthinkable. The actually circulating currency, as we have seen, comprised
                  a regionally variable combination of token silver used as change and of different
                  kinds of locally-issued paper instruments that served as money-substitutes. Legal
                  tender was at this period effectively unavailable throughout Britain, and
                  especially so in Scotland.</p>
               <p>For the immediate discharge of debts, therefore, in 1815 Scots used the token
                  silver currency of the Royal Mint in London and banknotes issued by Scots banks.
                  For the purposes of trade, however, which was normally conducted on credit, the
                  usual instrument was the bill of exchange, as it had been throughout Britain for
                  more than a hundred years. A bill of exchange is draft by a creditor on a debtor,
                  made payable to a third party at a specified date and place. Bills of exchange
                  originated as a means of making payments at a distance, but in the eighteenth
                  century they came to be used as a way of extending credit in transactions among
                  producers, merchants, and tradespeople even within a single locality. Bills
                  continue nonetheless to articulate place: a bill on London, for instance, would in
                  Edinburgh carry a premium over one payable locally, owing to the trade imbalance
                  between Scotland and the South.</p>
               <p>The bill extended credit by deferring payment: if a retailer bought commodities
                  from a producer, the latter would draw a bill on the former, payable at a date
                  when the commodities could be expected to have sold, enabling the retailer to pay
                  it with the proceeds. Normally, the drawer of the bill, wanting ready money, would
                  take it at once to a bank, which would give cash for it at a discounted rate,
                  taking interest for the time until it fell due. This was broadly the system by
                  which Scott received payment for his fiction. Thus, contracting for <title
                     level="m">The Antiquary</title> in January of 1815 he drew bills dated at six,
                  twelve, and eighteen months on the publishers, Constable and Co. in Edinburgh and
                  Longmans in London. Acting through James Ballantyne, Scott would at once have
                  discounted the bills, thus obtaining—at the cost of some interest—his half of
                  the profits for the first 5000 copies before he even began to write the novel. As
                     <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> was slated for publication in early
                  June, the publishers expected it to be bringing in revenue before they had to pay
                  even the first set of bills—though in the event Scott was more than a year late
                  with it, causing some anxious correspondence between Longmans and Constable.<note

               </p>
               <p>When he sold his fiction, then, Scott encountered a capital whose
                  identity, like his own identity as an author, was mediated and hedged about with
                  substitutes. The capital into which his labor was incorporated could appear to him
                  only in the dispersed form of the bills of exchange that served as its
                  representatives. This form of appearance necessarily obscured from him its borders
                  and indeed its mode of existence as property. The example of <title level="m">The
                     Antiquary</title> has shown us how a publishing house—or any other
                  business—could operate without investing money in an undertaking at the outset.
                  In negotiating for an advance, then, Scott would consider not the actual assets of
                  his publishers, but the ease with which he would be able to discount their
                  bills—a question decided by the general state of their credit, and more
                  specifically by the number of their bills already outstanding and in the hands of
                  the banks. Scott insisted that Longmans be brought in as the London co-publisher
                  of his second novel, <title level="m">Guy Mannering</title>, and then of <title
                     level="m">The Antiquary</title>, precisely because fewer of their bills were in
                  the Edinburgh market than of Constable&#8217;s, and he wanted to give
                  Constable&#8217;s credit a rest.<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">Scott
                        <title level="m">Letters</title> 1: 473</note> The market value of a bill
                  thus depended on the state of an entire circulation of bills on which the
                  acceptor&#8217;s name appeared. For this reason, it represented a capital only
                  visible in dispersal, having been at no time in the immediate possession of any
                  single individual.</p>
               <p>This effect of dispersal was exacerbated by the fact that bills circulated by
                  endorsement. As we have seen, a bill needed not be held until its due date; it
                  could be discounted at a bank, or it could be used by its drawer to make payments
                  in further transactions. In either case, the bill would change hands at a price
                  determined by the time left until it fell due. As it did so, each person through
                  whose hands it passed would endorse it, beginning with the original drawer. Each
                  endorser became liable to pay the bill if the acceptor and earlier endorsers
                  failed to do so. The value of a bill in circulation was thus supported not only by
                  the credit of its original acceptor but also by that of its drawer and very likely
                  by a series of other endorsers.</p>
               <p>In taking payment for his fiction by means of bills, therefore, Scott legally made
                  himself liable to pay again the very payment he took. The reason why the hazards
                  of trade were so notorious throughout the eighteenth century, and why book-keeping
                  was so difficult, was that neither the acceptance of a payment nor the discharge
                  of a debt could be considered final until the bill involved had finally been paid
                  by its original acceptor—possibly years after many of the transactions in which
                  it had played a part.<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">". . . hence it
                     comes to be a proverbial Saying, <emph>That no man knows what a Tradesman is
                        till he is dead</emph>" (Defoe 2: 204).</note> In the crash of 1826, many of
                  the debts of Constable that Scott was required to pay were thus debts which had
                  originally been due to him in return for novels promised or actually written.</p>
               <p>To be paid by bill was thus for Scott invariably to sign; and since after <title
                     level="m">Waverley</title> itself he always had an advance on his share of the
                  profits, Scott <emph>wrote his novels to make sure that the bills he had signed
                     were retired</emph>. Scott wrote, in short, <emph>to withdraw his signature
                     from circulation</emph>. And we recall that in mentioning his signature, we are
                  in fact referring to a hand that was until 1826 concealed behind those of James
                  and John Ballantyne—far more so in entering into bill transactions than it was in
                  producing fiction. The major reason for Scott&#8217;s employment of a literary
                  agent and for his secret ownership of a printing works was not to conceal his
                  identity as the Author of <title level="m">Waverley</title>, but to conceal the
                  extent of his potential liability in the bill market and so extend his ability,
                  using his proxies, to discount new bills. Scott increased his liabilities by
                  personal expenditure, but the fundamental cause of his exposure in the bill market
                  and eventual insolvency was the historical necessity that dictated the mode of his
                  payment. The phenomenon of the Waverley novels could not have been financed by a
                  capital embodied in a retail bookselling establishment or in a printing shop, as
                  publishing ordinarily had been hitherto.<note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors"
                     >John Feather asserts that in the eighteenth century publishing was invariably
                     associated with the retail sale of books; the earlier model, in which
                     publishing is a branch of the printing trade, disappears in the seventeenth
                     century (101, 132).</note> Constable could not have paid Scott the
                  unprecedented sums he received, nor financed the publication of the novels in the
                  size and variety of editions that he did, without mobilizing bank capital through
                  loans secured by the signatures on his bills.</p>
               <p>The means by which Scott was paid for his novels thus make it extraordinarily
                  difficult to say when the sale and purchase of a given novel have been completed.
                  When he is paid with a bill, Scott involves himself, and his proxies, in an
                  indeterminate series of future transactions and obligations; this fact is
                  reflected in the serial character of the novels themselves and the series of
                  mutually supporting signatures that they bear. To put the point otherwise, when
                  Scott accepted payment, he also assumed an obligation. The internal difference in
                  the money form in which he realized the value of his work was the specific form in
                  which he encountered the difference of capital from itself, and it is reflected in
                  the internal self-differentiation of his novels and of the Authorship they
                  embody.</p>

               <p>Their staging in what appears to be a single text of different and contradictory
                  versions of the author-function is one of the Waverley novels&#8217; cardinal
                  features, and it has determined my use of the text of Scott&#8217;s final edition
                  of the novels, which he termed his Magnum Opus, as the source for citations in
                  this essay.<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">For discussion of the Magnum
                     Opus edition and the circumstances under which it was produced, see Millgate
                        <title level="m">Scott&#8217;s Last Edition</title>.</note> In the Magnum
                  text, Scott appears as the no longer-anonymous author, as editor and annotator,
                  and also as a character and as proprietor. This multiple self-inscription is an
                  extension of the internally differentiated representations of authorship that
                  appeared in the novels and their paratexts from the very outset, which are my
                  topic here.</p>
               <p>In one of these representations, the Introductory Epistle to <title level="m">The
                     Fortunes of Nigel</title>, the &#8220;eidolon&#8221; or image of the Author of
                     <title level="m">Waverley</title> appears&#8212;in the act of correcting proof
                  for the very volume in which he is described&#8212;at the back of Archibald
                  Constable&#8217;s Edinburgh bookshop (<title level="m">WN</title> 14: 8). The
                  author is thus an emanation of the premises where the writer&#8217;s product is
                  put into circulation and not of the scene of production itself. The social
                  processes by which Scott&#8217;s labor was commodified and circulated were indeed
                  integral to the shaping of the novels and the institution of their authorship.
                  This was as true for the first editions as for any others. Before they were shown
                  to his publishers, Scott&#8217;s novels were transcribed and usually set up in
                  print by John and James Ballantyne. During this process they underwent extensive
                  correction and revision. Scott anticipated and relied on this work, which was part
                  of the authoring of the novels.</p>
               <p>By far and away the most fully documented and carefully edited version of
                  Scott&#8217;s fiction ever to appear is the recently completed Edinburgh Edition
                  of the Waverley Novels (EEWN). Though this edition will be invaluable to future
                  scholarship on Scott, as it has been to my own, the texts it establishes must be
                  used with some caution, as its editorial procedures do not take sufficient account
                  of the novels&#8217; social origin. The general editor states that the EEWN aims
                  to produce an &#8220;ideal text&#8221; of the novels&#8217; first editions (Hewitt
                     xv),<note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors">The general introduction including
                     this statement appears in every volume of the edition published before 1999,
                     and in an expanded and somewhat modified form after.</note> rectifying errors
                  that were the result of haste and pressure in the production process. As we have
                  seen, however, this process was irreducibly social. No more than any of their
                  successors were the first editions of the Waverley novels the sole product of the
                  historical Sir Walter Scott; yet the EEWN announces that integral to its project
                  is &#8220;a return to the authentic Scott &#8221; (Hewitt xii), to be achieved by
                  stripping away from the first edition texts &#8220;mistakes&#8221; introduced
                  there by those whom the editors characterize as
                  &#8220;intermediaries&#8221;&#8212;James Ballantyne and other copyists,
                  compositors, and copyeditors.</p>
               <p>The result is a series of texts that are fundamentally unhistorical. Neither a
                  version of the first editions, in whose production Scott&#8217;s collaboration
                  with the so-called intermediaries played an essential part, nor a presentation of
                  Scott&#8217;s manuscripts, the Edinburgh edition of the novels too often
                  corresponds to no historically specifiable state of the texts.</p>
               <p>The anomalies introduced into the novels by this editorial practice are in several
                  cases substantial and thematically significant. I will give a summary account of
                  three examples:</p>
               <p>1) Since Lockhart&#8217;s biography in 1838 it has been known that Scott was
                  persuaded by James Ballantyne to alter the last chapter of <title level="m">St.
                     Ronan&#8217;s Well</title> after the novel had been set up in type. At issue
                  was a revelation in the <foreign>d&#233;nouement</foreign> that the hero and the
                  heroine had been lovers before she was tricked into a feigned wedding with someone
                  else. Ballantyne objected to the supposed indecency; after protesting, Scott
                  acquiesced and altered the passage in which the revelation occurs. The censored
                  version was the one published in the first and every subsequent edition; Mark
                  Weinstein, the editor of the Edinburgh edition, however prints the text of the
                  original proof (363-64, 403-04). By so doing he may arguably recover a more
                  &#8220;authentic&#8221; Scott than the one who actually approved the other
                  version&#8212;but he produces a text that effaces an important effect of the
                  novel&#8217;s social production.</p>
               <p>2) As in <title level="m">St. Ronan&#8217;s Well</title>, a textual crux in <title
                     level="m">The Antiquary</title> arises from Scott&#8217;s revision during the
                  production process of the first edition. In this case&#8212;which I have discussed
                  at more length above&#8212;there is no evidence of pressure from any of the
                  &#8220;intermediaries.&#8221; Rather, Scott altered the
                     <foreign>d&#233;nouement</foreign> of the novel he had originally written to
                  another that he apparently preferred. It was the revised text that appeared in
                  every edition of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> he published.
                  Unfortunately, in making the revision, Scott introduced an anomaly into the
                  sequence of events that he narrates, making an effect precede its cause. On the
                  grounds of narrative coherence, therefore, the novel&#8217;s editor, David Hewitt,
                  who is also the EEWN General Editor, has restored Scott&#8217;s first version from
                  the manuscript. There is no question here of restoring the work of an authentic
                  Scott that has been obscured by other hands; Hewitt&#8217;s decision aims rather
                  to correct what appears to him a mistake of Scott&#8217;s own&#8212;a mistake,
                  moreover, that exists only if the novel is judged by standards of narrative
                  coherence for which there is every evidence Scott cared very little.</p>
               <p>3) Most egregious is the case of <title level="m">The Bride of Lammermoor</title>.
                  The dating of this novel&#8217;s action has long been a matter of dispute;<note
                     n="26" place="foot" resp="editors">A full discussion of the topic appears in
                     Millgate <title level="m">Walter Scott: The Making of the Novelist</title>
                     171-73.</note> in every edition Scott published there are indications that
                  point to dates in the eighteenth century both before and after the crucial year of
                  1707, when the Act of Union ended Scotland&#8217;s existence as an independent
                  kingdom. The historical events on which Scott based his story, moreover, belong in
                  the seventeenth century, and traces of this setting also made their way into the
                  novel. The editor of <title level="m">The Bride</title> for EEWN, J. H. Alexander,
                  follows Jane Millgate in the view that the action of the novel in its first
                  edition can best be dated just before the Act, between 1702 and 1707. This dating
                  is perhaps more plausible than any other; nonetheless, it requires a distinctly
                  tendentious editorial note explaining away passages that seem to refer to a date
                  after the union (Alexander 333-35). Worse yet, to prevent the date from slipping
                  the other way, to before 1702 when Queen Anne ascended the English throne, it
                  requires the explaining away of several references to the reigning monarch as male
                  and in one passage the outright emendation of the word &#8220;King&#8221; to read
                  &#8220;Queen&#8221; instead (Alexander 209, 334 and 337n. 9). Alexander makes this
                  emendation <emph>without warrant from any prior printed or manuscript version of
                     the text</emph>.</p>
               <p>In so doing, Alexander effaces the historical fact of a mistake or inconsistency
                  and deprives the text of its status as an historical artifact. The appeal to the
                  authority of the &#8220;authentic Scott&#8221; has here been stripped of any
                  historical content whatsoever and has become the pure means of imposing an
                  arbitrary formal coherence on his novel.</p>

               <p>Recent interest in the cultures of collecting and antiquarianism has also brought
                  the novel new attention. Lee 90-101 gives a particularly full account of the
                  practices of antiquarianism in late eighteenth-century Britain and of their
                  embeddedness in the institutions of the marketplace and consequent conflict with
                  an organic or Burkean historicism. A contrasting argument that sees the novel as
                  countering charges of unmanliness leveled against Burke in the 1790&#8217;s
                  appears in Goode. Ferris discusses the contrast between the enlightened historian
                  and the antiquary in Romantic-era discourse, with special attention to Jonathan
                  Oldbuck in <title level="m">The Antiquary</title>. See also Malley for a
                  discussion of <title level="m">The Antiquary</title> in the context of
                  Scott&#8217;s own antiquarian collections and of the construction of the
                  &#8220;new/old&#8221; structure of Abbotsford.</p>
