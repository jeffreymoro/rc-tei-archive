            <div type="section" n="Introduction">
               <p>My essay takes its title, “Field of History, Field of Battle,” not to assert that
                  the field of history is somehow embattled, but rather to question the reflex that
                  brings forward the metaphor of field, writes one field next to the other, so that
                  when given a field, we imagine a battle,&#8212;or when presented with history, we
                  conjure warfare. It happens often and in complicated ways. The reflex includes two
                  motions: the first locates history spatially as a field, a terrain to be observed
                  and surveyed; the second converts that terrain into battleground, to be won or
                  lost through violent contestation. The motions seem hardly inevitable: surely many
                  fields&#8212;magnetic fields, fields of dreams, strawberry fields&#8212;do not
                  lead to warfare. But I will argue that especially in wartime (and indeed in a
                  historiography that dates itself as “wartime” or even “post-war”) history-as-field
                  inclines fatally to the battlefield. The metaphorics involved slide along a scale
                  from far to near, at one end detached and analogical, at the other end nearly
                  reaching identification. The double motion involved in recourse to this
                  metaphor&#8212;terrain to be surveyed, site of contestation&#8212;itself
                  complicates matters of distance and proximity. Here for instance is <name
                     ref="MacauleyThomasBabington">Thomas Babington Macauley</name>, writing in
                  1828, defining the duty of a historian: it is “[t]o make the past present, to
                  bring the distant near, to place us in the society of a great man on an eminence.”
                  Up to this point <name ref="MacauleyThomasBabington">Macauley</name>’s
                  prescription sounds familiar enough as it makes nearness its goal. Yet he
                  continues: “to place us in the society of a great man on an eminence <emph>who
                     overlooks the field of a mighty battle</emph>” (<name
                     ref="MacauleyThomasBabington">Macauley</name> I: 310).<note place="foot"
                     resp="editors" n="1"><name ref="MacauleyThomasBabington">Macauley</name>’s
                     other examples climb down from this height, until we are “seated at the table”
                     with “our ancestors” and “rummag[ing] through their old-fashioned wardrobes”
                     (I: 308). Warfare thus posed a sticking point, an obstacle, to the practice of
                     sympathetic insight (<emph>Verstehen</emph>) which, as <name
                        ref="PhillipsMarkSalber">Mark Salber Phillips</name> argues, “came to be
                     understood as the central feature of historical understanding” (<name
                        ref="PhillipsMarkSalber">Phillips</name> 347). </note>
                  <name ref="MacauleyThomasBabington">Macauley</name>’s image of proximity keeps its
                  distance from the ugliness of battle per se, the metaphor of field securing more
                  elevated and unifying impressions. </p>

               <p>So my title finds these two terms, field of history, field of battle, close to
                  each other with a shared metaphor yet without a mediating conjunction, in order to
                  open up the question: what relationship, if any, governs these two terms? The
                  essay will press this metaphor and the accompanying questions of distance and
                  proximity by situating their use first in the aftermath of war, in post-war
                  writing, and then within wartime. In seeing the persistent war that governs much
                  historical thinking, it brings together influential concepts of history from the
                  late eighteenth and early nineteenth century&#8212;a period of far-flung wars of
                  European imperialism and expansion&#8212;with those of the late twentieth century.
                  Precisely as “post-war” suggests a certain vantage upon and distance from a finite
                  scene of war (a discernible field of study), “wartime” is where present history
                  and the history of the present find it difficult to pull away from or “overlook”
                  the inchoate scene of war. Indeed, my concluding example, a wartime consideration
                  of historiography, will move down from <name ref="MacauleyThomasBabington"
                     >Macauley</name>’s eminence and measure history no longer by the metaphor of
                  field but by the fallen human body, found in extreme proximity to the field of
                  battle. </p>
               <p>In locating the field of history in relationship to the time of war, I take
                  instruction from <name ref="MacauleyThomasBabington">Macauley</name>’s
                  predecessors, British writers of the Romantic period. For them a governing
                  question was how to tell of war given the mode of historiography they had
                  inherited: one that aspired to write the gradual improvement of society and
                  civilization, the progress of morals and mind&#8212;the historical mode inherited,
                  in other words, from the Scottish Enlightenment. In a paradigmatic statement about
                  recent “improvements” in the art of History, <name ref="BlairHugh">Hugh
                     Blair</name> in his well-known <title level="m">Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles
                     Lettres</title> (published 1783; delivered in 1759-60), asserts, <quote>It is
                     now understood that it is the business of an able Historian to exhibit manners,
                     as well as facts and events; and assuredly, whatever displays the state and
                     life of mankind, in different periods, and illustrates the progress of the
                     human mind, is more useful and interesting than the detail of sieges and
                     battles (288; qtd. in Phillips 44). </quote> For <name ref="BlairHugh"
                     >Blair</name>, an influential professor at the University of Edinburgh and
                  avowed admirer of David Hume’s innovative <title level="m">History of
                     England</title>, history kept its distance from battle. Hume, for instance,
                  claimed a dispassionate distance, and to have “neglected present power, interest
                  and authority, and the cry of popular prejudices” in depicting the wars and
                  factionalism that had led to the formation of the current United Kingdom. He had
                  examined the Protestant Succession, for instance, “as coolly and impartially as if
                  I were removed a thousand Years from the present Period” (qtd. in <name
                     ref="PhillipsMarkSalber">Phillips</name> 35, 36n.). Such a deliberately postwar
                  historiographical style aimed, among other things, to free its readers from the
                  claims of that earlier violence. The thought was, as <name
                     ref="PhillipsMarkSalber">Mark Salber Phillips</name> points out, that through
                  such a history <quote>the conflicts of the previous century could finally be left
                     behind, because they [could be shown to have] resulted in a new order of
                     government as well as, more comprehensively, in accompanying changes in manners
                     and opinions. The new order [would be written not as] . . . the work of any
                     single party, but . . . as an indirect consequence of the irregular . . .
                     politics of [past] times (Phillips 36).</quote> In writing an account that
                  transcended factional feeling, the Enlightenment historian could help produce a
                  history of a nation itself transcending the violence of faction. The England (or
                  Britain) of this new order and changed manners would be free to contemplate what
                  Robert Henry, another Scottish historian of the period, dubbed “the more permanent
                  and peaceful scenes of social life” (qtd. in Phillips 4). This form of cultural
                  history deliberately situated itself apart from warfare and factional strife, in
                  more convivial environs.</p>
               <p> By the end of the eighteenth century, however, faced with the incontrovertible
                  fact of world-wide war and the repetitive and increasing impact of war throughout
                  the century of Enlightenment, such an improved history began to look like wishful
                  thinking. Even while responding to the sociable and even anti-military
                  conceptualizations of history offered by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers such as
                     <name ref="BlairHugh">Blair</name>, <name ref="HumeDavid">Hume</name> and <name
                     ref="SmithAdam">Adam Smith</name>, Romantic authors had to ponder in wartime
                  the field of history. Writers such as <name ref="ScottWalter">Walter Scott</name>
                  and <name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Anna Barbauld</name> were crucial in
                  formulating still-current protocols of cultural history and historicism in
                  particular. Both suggest that it is primarily not approximation&#8212;not
                  “bringing the distant near”&#8212;but rather distance in space and time that
                  enables the field of history to take itself as a field of battle. Brought too
                  close to the fighting, the field of history, especially the field of cultural
                  history, threatens to lose definition and disappear. The focus on culture as a
                  “field” which organizes and situates history as a comprehensive practice is, as we
                  will see, a product of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century; yet its
                  use discloses something which, at the very moment of its emergence, displays its
                     vulnerability.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">On the emergence of the

               <p>To give this Romantic metaphor of field its proper scope and currency, it helps to
                  look both before and after the nineteenth century, and I will do this by turning
                  to two twentieth-century postwar theorists of history, <name ref="FoucaultMichel"
                     >Michel Foucault</name> and <name ref="KoselleckReinhart">Reinhart
                     Koselleck</name>, each writing a generation after world war about the modern
                  field of history, and each locating that field in the eighteenth century, also in
                  the aftermath of war. The problematic of distance from or nearness to the field of
                  war reveals itself in these crucial thinkers as the problematic underlying our own
                  contemporary understanding of history. </p>
               <p>In his lectures of 1975-78, <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name> turns for
                  inspiration to Karl von Clausewitz, the great military theorist of the Napoleonic
                  period, in order to propose warfare as the model through which to understand the
                  infinitesimal workings of power in daily life. In perhaps his most provocative
                  extension of this idea, <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name> argues that
                  history itself is and ought to be engaged in war. In his lecture of February 26,
                  1976, history not only “decipher[s] the war and the struggle that is going on
                  within the institutions of right and peace”; history also participates in that war
                     (<name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name> 171). <name ref="FoucaultMichel"
                     >Foucault</name> attributes this formulation of history (he will go on to call
                  it historicism) to the French nobility of the eighteenth-century. Defeated by an
                  absolutist monarchy and its armies, these early historicists direct the energies
                  of that defeat into a historiography devoted to undermining and de-legitimating
                  the powers that be. From this unlikely source <name ref="FoucaultMichel"
                     >Foucault</name> takes up historicism in a late twentieth-century call to arms:
                     <quote>This. . . is our first task. We must try to be historicists, or in other
                     words, try to analyze the perpetual and unavoidable relationship between the
                     war that is recounted by history, and the history that is traversed by the war
                     it is recounting (173-4). </quote> The war, in other words, is not over or
                  past; it “traverses” the very field of historiography. It is hard to overestimate
                  the influence of this imperative, where war becomes the transcendent term
                  (perpetual and unavoidable) arching over but also grounding the work of
                  historicism. For <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name> in the 70’s, war is
                  the general idea of history: “No matter how far back it goes, historical knowledge
                  never finds nature, truth, order or peace. However far back it goes, historical
                  knowledge discovers only an unending war” (172). By implication, however far
                  forward it goes into the future, historical knowledge will only discover&#8212;and
                  promote&#8212;unending war. </p>
               <p> The temptation here is to take <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>’s
                  language as figural. This war is merely metaphorical: no lives are lost in its
                  prosecution, no states rise or fall. <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>
                  nevertheless wants to push his martial metaphors as close as he can to the
                  literal, to insist we allow for the possibility that the writing of history may
                  cost lives, and that states do win or lose legitimacy on the basis of this
                  writing. He famously inverts Clausewitz’s dictum: “Politics,” <name
                     ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name> insists, “is the continuation of war by
                  other means”; and by “politics” he designates a full array of the discourses of
                  power (165). Rather than suggest an analogy (what war does in one way, politics
                  does in another) it announces that the work of war proceeds into, infiltrates, the
                  work of politics&#8212;and therefore, for <name ref="FoucaultMichel"
                     >Foucault</name>, infiltrates the work of history. The eighteenth-century
                  French historian Boulainvilliers, whom <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>
                  takes as exemplary, <quote>makes the relationship of war part of every social
                     relationship, subdivided into a thousand different channels, and reveals war to
                     be a sort of permanent state that exists between groups, fronts and tactical
                     units as they in some sense civilize one another, come into conflict with one
                     another, or . . . form alliances. There are no more multiple and stable great
                     masses, but there is a multiple war. . . . It is obviously not a war of every
                     man against every man in the abstract and&#8212;I think&#8212;unreal sense in
                     which Hobbes spoke. . . . With Boulainvilliers, by contrast, we have a
                     generalized war that permeates the entire social body and the entire history of
                     the social body. . . . one in which groups fight groups. (162)</quote>
                  <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name> brings war as close as he can to
                  history; he wants it to permeate history so that we understand history as the
                  continuation of warfare in one more field, transferred but not essentially
                  altered. </p>
               <p>And yet, even as the passage moves toward full equation&#8212;not “abstract,” not
                  “unreal,” but real war&#8212;it falters: war is “sort of” a permanent state; the
                  “tactical units” of this state “in some sense” engage in the activities of war.
                  War becomes, as <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name> says repeatedly,
                  “generalized”: “in some sense” everywhere. In fact, war itself must be transformed
                  into an analytic category, an intellection, if it is to pervade history in the way
                     <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>’s historicism demands. War becomes
                  the “grid of intelligibility” we have inherited; “war is basically [again a slight
                  hitch in the equation] historical discourse’s truth-matrix” (164, 165). As grid or
                  matrix, it helps map out a field, History, but a field one finds difficult to
                  imagine being trampled or blood-stained or strewn with bodies. The only visible
                  body on this field turns out to be the generalizable “social body.”</p>
               <p>How quiet by contrast the account of “the concept of history” offered by the
                  German <name ref="KoselleckReinhart">Koselleck</name>, also writing in the
                  mid-1970s. Like <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>, <name
                     ref="KoselleckReinhart">Koselleck</name> is interested in situating modernity,
                  and what distinguishes our modernity is its “concept of history,” emergent
                  “sometime between 1750 and 1850” when “European society began to think and act as
                  if it existed in history,” identifying itself with and by its “historicity”(<name
                     ref="WhiteHayden">White</name> x). Historicism in this case attends to “a
                  social mode of being in the world marked by a particular experience of
                  temporality”; that is, of social reality undergoing structural change (<name
                     ref="WhiteHayden">White</name> xi). The historicism that takes such
                  multi-layered change as its “great theme,” according to <name
                     ref="KoselleckReinhart">Koselleck</name>, is “the history of the vanquished,”
                  its great methodological and theoretical innovations introduced, as we have
                  already seen, by the historians of the Scottish Enlightenment in the wake of
                  Scotland’s defeat and absorption into Great Britain (<name ref="KoselleckReinhart"
                     >Koselleck</name> 80). Whereas for <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>
                  the losers bequeath to modern history an extension of warfare, an on-going battle
                  focused on usurpations, invasions and bloodshed, in <name ref="KoselleckReinhart"
                     >Koselleck</name>’s account the vanquished appear to turn away from military
                  contest altogether. Not war but larger and more abstract forces determine history.
                  So, instead of armies and generals, “the social and economic <hi>situation</hi>
                  decides whether someone is left behind or thrust forward” (80; emphasis added). We
                  may need to be reminded that he is talking about Scotland in the eighteenth not
                  Germany in the twentieth century, but the larger point is clear: historicism in
                  this instance understands itself moving beyond and past the failed operations of
                  warfare to a more detached perspective, to, for instance, the “social and
                  economic.” Yet—and here is <name ref="KoselleckReinhart">Koselleck</name>’s great
                  insight&#8212;in moving past the battlefield to this higher level of abstraction,
                  historicism also moves away from experience per se. </p>
               <p>Precisely because they have lost, because they have suffered history as an
                  “unintended experience,” the vanquished are adept in developing historiographical
                  methods that, in the case of the Scottish Enlightenment, enable the move to a
                  detached view of “structural, long-term change” (80). Method, as <name
                     ref="KoselleckReinhart">Koselleck</name> elaborates his account, serves as an
                  alternative to experience, especially an experience of suffering, because methods
                  “can be abstracted from the unique event; they can be applied elsewhere” (83).
                  Historicist methods allow the transposition of loss into a form of knowledge where
                  it remains, or at least this is the hope, “accessible beyond all change of
                  experience”&#8212;unassailable (83). For <name ref="KoselleckReinhart"
                     >Koselleck</name>, historicism substitutes method and knowledge for the
                  experience&#8212;often quite intimate&#8212;of war and its aftermath. In this way
                  he understands <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>’s “grid” or “historical
                  discourse’s truth-matrix” not as another version of war but as a means of stepping
                  outside of the suffering exacted by war. An unassailable method, the historicism
                  developed by Scottish historians “might offer some comfort, perhaps a gain,” he
                  suggests. But he ends more ruefully: “In practice, it would mean saving us from
                  the victors. Yet every experience speaks against it” (83).</p>
               <p> Does the history of the vanquished, with its method and “production of theory
                  that became an imperative of method” offer a viable alternative to war (81)? You
                  have to read to the very end of <name ref="KoselleckReinhart">Koselleck</name>’s
                  rigorous forty-page essay on “Transformations of Experience and Methodological
                  Change” to arrive at the pathos of his project. Tonally his considerations could
                  not be more different from <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>’s and yet
                  both tell us perhaps what a self-consciously post-war generation must: war is
                  either history’s matrix or the experience that history wants to transcend; it is
                  history’s internal or external limit. “History cannot get away from war,” writes
                     <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name>, “quite simply because war itself
                  supports this knowledge, runs through this knowledge and determines this
                  knowledge” (173). <name ref="KoselleckReinhart">Koselleck</name> might sigh and
                  say, “History has to try to get away from war, get off the battlefield to produce
                  some other possibility for knowledge,” even as he admits that all “experience
                  speaks against it.”</p>
               <p> The postwar thoughts of <name ref="FoucaultMichel">Foucault</name> and <name
                     ref="KoselleckReinhart">Koselleck</name> form a sort of resonating chamber for
                  our contemporary thinking about historicism. Here war, history, knowledge and
                  experience jostle and reverberate. As we carry such thinking into our contemporary
                  wartime, we must wonder what it means to dwell within such a chamber, or indeed if
                  the walls of the chamber will hold.</p>

               <p> Another version of historicism has been given more recently by <name
                     ref="ChandlerJamesK.">James Chandler</name>, whose 1998 book, <title level="m"
                     >England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic
                     Historicism</title> also locates the origins of historicism and cultural
                  history in the writings of the Scottish Enlightenment. <name ref="ChandlerJamesK."
                     >Chandler</name>’s characterization of historicism seems to side-step the
                  question of war to focus instead on the development of systems of dating and
                  periodization. But 1819 is markedly a postwar year, and barely so; its proximity
                  to fields of battle threatens to disrupt these very procedures of dating and
                  periodization, and open up its own echo chamber. We will return to that
                  side-stepping and those echoes in a moment. </p>
               <p><name ref="ChandlerJamesK.">Chandler</name> meditates at length on the value of
                  the “dating system” for the study of culture, even as he provides a powerful
                  history and critique of the historicism emerging in Britain in the early
                  nineteenth century. “What the dating system adds,” he suggests, “is a second order
                  code, a method of <hi>translation</hi> from one textually constituted
                  culture/character into another (<name ref="ChandlerJamesK.">Chandler</name> 151,
                  emphasis added). This second order code, developed as a characteristic of
                  Romantic-era writing, derived in part from Scottish Enlightenment historiography.
                  As a method of translation between different “states,” it makes possible both
                  ethnography and historicism; it serves as a method for marking&#8212;and therefore
                  comparing, coordinating and unifying&#8212;differences across the borders of time
                  and geography (95). </p>
               <p>Thus for <name ref="ScottWalter">Walter Scott</name>, the most obvious literary
                  practitioner of historicism, “calendrical chronology functions as the medium in
                  which different time-in-temporalities can be merged into a yet-higher-order
                  calculus: a historian’s code” (132). The uneven rates of development between, say,
                  Scottish and English culture, or between Saxon and Norman culture, can be
                  specified and made visible. The idea of culture as an object of study requires
                  such a code and with it the assumption that “operations of changing times and
                  changing places are mutually defined” (132-3; see also 161). By locating his early
                  novels at the borders of Scottish and English cultures, <name ref="ScottWalter"
                     >Scott</name> could thus delineate such operations. In this way movement across
                  a geographical border could send you into a different temporal state, to a culture
                  “behind” or “advanced” according to some universal chronological measure. </p>
               <p>Like the writers he studies, <name ref="ChandlerJamesK.">Chandler</name> lays
                  particular emphasis on the term “state,” not allowing us to forget the resonance
                  between cultural states and geopolitical entities with cultures to be defined but
                  also defended, promulgated or potentially exterminated. The historian’s code then,
                  as it coordinates heterogeneous temporalities into a system of calendrical dating,
                  as it “translates” between “states,” claims for itself a <hi>diplomatic</hi>
                  function, smoothing over inter-state differences or tensions so that, as <name
                     ref="ChandlerJamesK.">Chandler</name> says, their “operations . . . are
                  mutually defined.” </p>
               <p><name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name> himself, in the 1819 Dedicatory Epistle to
                     <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title> which lays out his methods, defines the area
                  of cultural translation as an “extensive neutral ground”&#8212;and his terminology
                  implies that in the absence of this neutral ground, past and present, there and
                  here would confront each other on contested ground, the ground of battle (<name

                        ref="ChandlerJamesK.">Chandler</name>, in his analysis of Templeton’s

                  on neutral ground thus involves a search for what <name ref="ScottWalter"
                     >Scott</name> calls, in an echo of <name ref="BlairHugh">Hugh Blair</name>,
                  “manners and sentiments” held in common, “principles of our common nature,” in
                  order to offset “indifference,” incomprehension, or (and he leaves this
                  possibility unstated) hostility (9). Edging <name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name>’s
                  own meditations on historiography and the study of cultures, and leaking into
                     <name ref="ChandlerJamesK.">Chandler</name>’s as well, are reminders of states
                  not easily accommodated by diplomatic translation, and of cultures under

                  begin to see how wartime and the state of war vex the work of historicism at its

               <p>The focus on culture as a “field” which organizes and situates historical (and
                  ethnographic) practice, and which <name ref="ChandlerJamesK.">Chandler</name>,
                  following <name ref="WilliamsRaymond">Raymond Williams</name>, understands as a
                  product of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century, has this darker and
                  more destructive aspect: the field of battle. The problem surfaces primarily in
                  the metaphors of “ground” and “field” which <name ref="ChandlerJamesK."
                     >Chandler</name> borrows from <name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name> and which
                  serve as the spatial correlatives of historical “periods” or “ages.” Though these
                  are metaphors common enough in the study of culture, in the self-reflexive
                  practices of Romantic historiography, in terms like “neutral ground,” they betray
                  an awareness of forces otherwise poised to overthrow “states” and the cultures
                  they support. The Dedicatory Epistle itself seems to question the ideal of neutral
                  or common ground. <name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name>’s metaphor for
                  historical-cultural translation recalls&#8212;maybe to repair&#8212;an earlier,
                  unsettling moment in the Dedicatory Epistle which situates itself on the
                  battlefield. There Lawrence Templeton, the English antiquarian serving as the
                  fictional author of the Epistle, is straining to justify the work of the
                  historical novelist, and he turns first not to neutral ground but to the
                  gore-stained ground of war. <quote>The Scottish magician, you say, was like <name

                  desideratum of new historicism, famously voiced by <name ref="GreenblattStephen"
                     >Stephen Greenblatt</name> when he wrote, “I wanted to speak with the dead” and
                  likened himself to a “conjuror” (<name ref="GreenblattStephen">Greenblatt</name>
                  1). </p>
               <p>Certainly the primary purpose of this passage is to differentiate the “time” of
                  the Scottish historical novelist&#8212;witch or warlock&#8212;from that of the
                  English antiquarian, not only by placing the Scots closer to the scene of violence
                  (the visceral as opposed to the dusty “field” of historical research) but also by
                  assigning them to different cultural systems: that of <name ref="Lucan"
                     >Lucan</name>’s <title level="m">On Civil War</title>, a verse history of the
                  wars between Pompey and Caesar in the first century BCE; as opposed to the even
                  more distant Book of Joel from the ancient Hebrew scriptures. The comparison of
                  fields adds philosophical complexity as well to <name ref="ChandlerJamesK."
                     >Chandler</name>’s larger point about historicist dating procedures.
                  “Templeton’s point, though couched in the macabre details of military carnage,
                  might be said to depend on a familiar Rousseauistic paradox about civil society:
                  that we must be forced to be free.” By this reckoning the Scottish novelist
                  working on the recent past is like the witch “free to be forced” to choose her
                  subject, while the English writer, trying to locate a similar “state” is “free to
                  be unconstrained in his selection” (<name ref="ChandlerJamesK.">Chandler</name>
                  169). The emphasis on social contract theory, though, does not sit easily with the
                  macabre details of military carnage: <name ref="Lucan">Lucan</name> is not
                  depicting the operations of civil society but its breakdown in civil war. Warfare
                  complicates (though the verb seems feeble) the field or ground of “translation”
                  (from one state to another) that supports Templeton’s dating system; it
                  complicates as well the issues of “force” and “freedom” involved. </p>
               <p>Templeton does not show the historian revivifying just any old dead; he finds his
                  dead on the contested ground of war.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="7">In a

                     Cumberland’s orders on Culloden Moor in 1746” (168, fn. 27). </note> The past
                  here is not what a generation of Scots historians (the historians <name

                  ought to be: manners and morals, representative characters and social and economic
                  movements are lost in the impersonal remains of the carnage. By grounding <name

                  moreover, Templeton reminds his audience, if inadvertently, of the fragility of

                     images of a world at war, see <name ref="Lucan">Lucan</name>, VI: 305-13, 327;
                     481-82, 339; and 819-20, 365. .Especially notable is the dead prophet’s comment
                     that the “furious civil war’ in Rome has spilled over into the netherworld (VI:
                     780-81, 361), </note> The freedom to be forced, upon which civil society bases
                  itself, narrows drastically in time of war; freedom itself contracts along with
                  time and space. In <title level="m">On Civil War</title>, the field of battle
                  collapses the possibility of other, different places or times as they are all
                  forced into this tight, bloody spot which is also “the whole world.” In <name
                     ref="Lucan">Lucan</name>, that is, the totalizing power of war re-defines the
                  ground or field, scrambling the historian’s code. </p>
               <p>It is perhaps then not remarkable that Templeton neglects one detail built into
                  the story of <name ref="Lucan">Lucan</name>’s witch. When she asks the newly-dead
                  corpse to “give events their names, their places; and provide a voice,” Erictho is
                     <hi>not</hi> asking, as a historian might, in order to establish the ground of
                  past events. She wants to know the future spawned by this slaughter (VI: ll.
                  774-775, p. 361). The utterance emerging from the field of battle, this unsettled
                  ground, tells of the coming fall of the Roman republic. Fittingly, as if the fall
                  of that state takes with it the historian’s code, the prophetic utterance of the
                  fallen warrior (which closes Book VI) further erases distinctions between
                  different places and times in what might be called a trans-historical instability.
                  In the end, the dead man announces, “the battle of the rivals [will] settle
                  nothing but their place of burial” (VI: lines 811-12, p. 365). Prophecy intrudes
                  upon history and finds that the only “state” is the unsettled state of the
                  battlefield; its only settled ground a burial ground. </p>
               <p>The question of settlement&#8212;the settlement that became Julius Caesar’s
                  imperium, the settlement wrought by Culloden or Waterloo&#8212;haunts <name
                     ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name>’s Dedicatory Epistle, no less in the field of
                  Jehoshophat than the field of civil war. Again, Templeton appears to alter the
                  significance of the field, in this case the valley of Jehoshophat, taken from the
                  book of the prophet Joel. He makes it the site of a remote past. In scripture,
                  however, Jehosophat represents the site of the future: it is the “valley of
                  decision” yet-to-be&#8212;not the dusty cemetery of battles past. In Joel’s
                  account, here God will “gather all nations” and proclaim to them the famous words:
                     <quote>prepare warre, wake up the mightie men, let all the men of warre drawe
                     neere, let them come up. Beat your plowe shares into swords, and your pruning
                     hookes into speares. (<title level="m">King James Bible</title>, 1611; Joel 3:
                     14, 2, 9-10) </quote> In the valley of Jehoshaphat, God promises to assemble
                  and sit in judgment upon “the gentiles,” “the heathens,” the nations that have
                  injured his people. “[A]nd the heavens and the earth shall shake,” the prophet
                  tells us (Joel 3: 16). Jumpin’ Jehosaphat, in other words, is the ground of some
                  final, apocalyptic overturning, after which “Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom
                  will be a desolate wilderness. . . . But Judah shall be for ever, and Jerusalem
                  from generation to generation” (Joel 3: 19-20). On the Day of Decision, in the
                  valley of Jehoshaphat, only one state survives: this field reduces “all nations”
                  to one. </p>
               <p>Even as he marks out the “extensive neutral ground” of cultural translation, even
                  as he theorizes a “higher-order calculus” that will allow for comparative analyses
                  of different states, settling them in their moment in chronological time, <name
                     ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name>’s Templeton ventures onto terrain that will not
                  remain past or settled. Despite his insistence that the historical novelist charts
                     “<emph>la vie privee </emph>of our forefathers<emph>” </emph>Templeton–like
                     <name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name>&#8212;begins his research on the ground of
                  what we would now call state-sponsored violence where, as <name ref="ArendtHannah"
                     >Hannah Arendt</name> has explained, an “all-pervading uncertainty,” an
                  insurmountable “arbitrariness” holds sway (<name ref="ArendtHannah">Arendt</name>
                  4-5). In war and through war, chronology is subject to upsetting forces, blasting
                  open its orderly sequencing and synchronies. The Northern Warlock plies his trade
                  on the battlefield of Pharsalia, in Thessaly; the southern, English antiquarian in
                  Jehoshaphat, the borderland between Israel and Judea: some fields merge even as
                  others are eliminated. In the process, the British state leans dangerously close
                  to identification with the up-coming fall of the Roman republic, the historian
                  picks about the bones of the yet-to-be dead in the earth-shaking valley of
                  judgment in the Mid-east. Civil war and the apocalypse of totalizing empire form
                  the horizon of Templeton’s world picture. </p>
               <p>Though Templeton does not admit it, <name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name> knows
                  that the ground had shifted (again), the battlefield had recently come to England.
                  In August of 1819, while he was writing <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>, British
                  citizens peaceably assembling to press for Parliamentary reform were massacred by
                  government troops at St. Peter’s Field, an event christened Peterloo. The very
                  name, echoing Waterloo, suggests a dislocation in time and space, as if the recent
                  wars with Napoleon had to end again and in a new, less distant place; as if
                  history had not moved on from that earlier settlement, but would repeat itself and
                  move closer.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="9">Though he does not directly
                     address the Peterloo massacre, <name ref="ShawPhilip">Philip Shaw</name> does
                     helpfully analyze the psychic wound of Waterloo in <title level="m">Waterloo
                        and the Romantic Imagination</title>. </note> “The battle of the rivals
                  settles nothing but their place of burial,” <name ref="Lucan">Lucan</name>
                  explains. There are always more burials, more fields consecrated and constricted
                  by war. </p>
               <p>On the contested ground of the battlefield, neither the “expanse of the national
                  past” nor the gathering of scattered remains can be taken for granted anymore than
                  the survival of the state which these activities underwrite. Perhaps this threat
                  explains why corpses on the battlefield are not asked to speak for what has
                  passed, but for the possibility of a future (state): whether or not there will
                  remain any fields outside the battlefield. In wartime, the “field” of cultural
                  history may look like prophecy. </p>
               <p>Romantic wartime emerges from this problematic relationship between historicism
                  and the battlefield. It considers, on the one hand, historicism’s need to keep the
                  violence of war at a distance&#8212;the object of geographical and chronological
                  mapping&#8212;in order to delineate that “extensive neutral ground” which becomes
                  the field of cultural history. On the other hand, Romantic wartime attends to the
                  totalizing impulse of warfare, acknowledged even as early as <name ref="Lucan"
                     >Lucan</name>’s <title level="m">De Bello Civile</title>, which refuses to
                  honor historical and geographical distinctions, so that this war or that war are
                  subsumed under something called War; remote causes satisfy present hatreds; and
                  all the world is condensed into one field of battle.<note place="foot"

                  “Dialogue in the Shades” written in 1813 offers a singular answer to this

                  emergent “field” of modern historicism, where historical practice finds it
                  difficult to differentiate its field from the battlefield.</p>
               <p><name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> wrote her prose “Dialogue in
                  the Shades” in the shadow of war and the aftermath of the critical firestorm that
                  erupted around her anti-war poem, “Eighteen Hundred and Eleven.” As the title of
                  that poem indicates, <name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> was
                  concerned there with locating the state of England in the higher-order calculus of
                  dated, universal history and this meant removing it from the mortality of the
                  human body (the poem ends with an ethereal “Genius” or “Spirit” traversing the
                  globe). This process allows the sort of cultural translation advocated by <name

                     asked for advice on her education. </note> Like the poem, “On the Uses of
                  History” understands the mutual implication of geography and chronology in the
                  study of History (they are “the two eyes of History”). In the way these linked
                  texts theorize history, the turn to universal or what <name
                     ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> calls “general” as opposed to
                  “relative” history aims for a point of view outside and above the human body. By
                  contrast the relative or “natural” mode of telling time derives from an
                  individual’s present position and from memory: “in more familiar life [we resort]
                  to this natural kind of chronology&#8212;The year before I was married,&#8212;when
                  Harry, who is now five years old, was born,&#8212;the winter of the hard frost”
                     (<name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> 151). But this way of
                  telling history (and for Barbauld it looks gendered and belongs, as her examples
                  suggest, “to the annals of domestic life”) cannot survive “personal recollection”
                  because it lives within a mortal creature. Even were such accounts recorded in
                  writing, in a temporally coherent narrative, one would still want to know when the
                  “natural” historian lived and died (151). To separate History from this mortal,
                  embodied perspective, there must be some impersonal, “common measure” or “medium”
                  for ordering events: one must “place them with respect to the history of other
                  times and nations.” “General”&#8212;as opposed to “natural”&#8212;chronology,
                     <name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> maintains, “fixes every
                  event to its precise point in the chart of universal time” (152). In other words,
                  general chronology, as practiced in “Eighteen Hundred and Eleven” and explained in
                  “On the Uses of History,” can perform translations between nations and times
                  because, like <name ref="HegelGeorgWilhelmFriedrich">Hegel</name>’s “general
                  idea,” it does not suffer death.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="13">

                  adopts universal history as a means of measuring and coordinating different rates
                  of development, here it poses as a system of limits, a restricted ground, within

                  searches for ways to “make room” for new names and new stories, threatening in the
                  process to blot out the record of warriors and heroes from the ancient past. The
                  ancients, she insists, “have been remembered long enough” (468). Modern war
                  demands History’s revision.</p>
               <p>In some ways <name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name>’s “Dialogue”
                  may appear a simple rehearsal of a long-familiar narrative of supercession, the
                  old giving way to the new. Yet while characterizing the impressive features of the
                  modern moment, <name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> does not
                  quite offer a vision of progress (a departure from her goal in “Eighteen-Hundred
                  and Eleven”). Indeed, she suggests a homology between the work of modern history
                  and the destructiveness of modern war, both feeding off the “taking of lives.” The
                  increased scale and speed of the modern era (“[N]ow I am required to be in a
                  hundred places at once” . . . “in all parts of the globe at once,” moans Clio)
                  have indeed necessitated Clio’s streamlining of her art (470). But the stronger
                  factor is modernity’s lethal power. Thanks to the enormity of deaths in the
                  Napoleonic wars, History has had to take up a grim science of accounting:
                     <quote>“Here am I expected to calculate how may hundred thousands of rational
                     beings cut one another’s throats at Austerlitz, and to take the tale of two
                     hundred and thirteen thousand human bodies and ninety-five thousand horses,
                     that lie stiff, frozen and unburied on the banks of the Berecina&#8212;. . .
                     Nay, the human race will be exterminated if this work of destruction goes on
                     much longer.” (471-2)</quote>
                  <name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> suggests the Malthusian
                  pressures that the on-going wars place not simply upon the future, but also upon
                  the past and the future of the past. Mercury in fact invokes Malthus, “a great
                  philosopher,” in order to placate Clio. For if “twenty or forty thousand men could
                  not be persuaded every now and then to stand and be shot at,” then, by Malthusian
                  “calculation,” “we should all be forced to eat each other” (473). Like Malthus,
                  Clio has her eyes trained on universal scarcity and the vulnerability of the human
                  body, but where he looks forward she looks back; where he fears the force of
                  procreation, she reveals the destructiveness of the battlefield. Modern
                  technologies of warfare take “the human frame, of curious texture,” to “wound. . .
                  lacerate . . . and mutilate [it] with most perverted ingenuity” (472). By this
                  reckoning, History, like futurity, is forced to play a zero-sum game.</p>
               <p>Not surprisingly, the muse of History must reconfigure her sense of time in the
                  grip of this modern war. In the figure of History’s scroll, “long enough to
                  stretch from earth to heaven” but grown “quite cumbrous,” <name
                     ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> finds a handy way to give space
                  and weight to the past. Yet in the age of print, History must economize: what had
                  been written “all in capitals” and illuminated in gold must be squeezed into
                     “<emph>small pica</emph>” type (470). In this newly economic, measured version
                  of the past, History’s&#8212;and war’s&#8212;expansion into “all parts of the
                  world” requires conversely a reduction, even miniaturization in print. Immortal
                  Clio insists therefore on regarding humanity’s past according to the temporality
                  of the mortal body: History&#8212;at least this modern history confronting
                  her&#8212;unfolds in the span of a lifetime. “It takes a life, as mortals reckon
                  lives, to unroll it [her scroll]” (464). History in 1813, in the opening of a new
                  front in North America, in the wake of Napoleon’s costly campaign in Russia,
                  unfailingly “takes a life.” To a certain degree, Clio restates Templeton’s
                  comparison of recent and historically distant fields of battle: the ancient
                  “shades” who talk to her are told they must make room on her rolls for fresher
                  corpses. Rather than offering comparisons and translations, though, the “Dialogue”
                  perversely mirrors a field of battle where there is not room enough for both the
                  warlock’s and the antiquarian’s dead; one army or the other must give way. </p>
               <p>In her neoclassical “Dialogue” on modern history, <name
                     ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name> twists and transforms the
                  emergent concept of a history measured by numbers&#8212;the numbers of
                  chronological time, the years and dates so crucial to historicist understanding.
                  For the mythical Clio, the more pressing numbers to be reckoned are statistics
                  taken from the battlefield, the integers of destruction. Though forced to
                  distinguish between the ancient and the modern, to expunge one to make way for the
                  other, Clio nevertheless reminds Mercury&#8212;the god of news and
                  wealth&#8212;that in the end she measures history not by the abstract markers of
                  moments or periods, nor by conceptual fields, but by the force exerted to curtail
                  the life of one human body. For her, modern global wartime demands this
                  recognition of fatal economies. </p>
               <p>In <name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name>’s “Dialogue in the
                  Shades” and <name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name>’s “Dedicatory Epistle” the
                  practice of historicism in wartime is subject to uncanny, untimely forces. The
                  clear lines that would plot the past in a determinable sequence are subject to
                  vectors that pull in several different directions. When the “expansive neutral
                  ground” that organizes <name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name>’s project of
                  translating between different states finds itself too close to the battlefield, it
                  simultaneously expands into the whole world and all of history <emph>and</emph>
                  contracts into one disastrous moment. By turning to <name ref="Lucan">Lucan</name>
                  and Joel, <name ref="ScottWalter">Scott</name>’s Templeton wants to situate
                  various historical practices and hence various cultures in their proper moment,
                  but his efforts are undermined both by the totalizing violence of the battlefield
                  and by its affiliation with prophecy, rather than history. <name
                     ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name>, for her part, steps outside of
                  human time to “place” the work of modern history. She, like <name ref="Lucan"
                     >Lucan</name>, feels war contracting the scope of history, even as it expands
                  the number of the dead: human mortality now governs the work of History. If
                  History is a field, then <name ref="BarbauldMrs.(AnnaLetitia)">Barbauld</name>
                  understands it as a field of blood-stained scarcity, measured in the final
                  instance by countless dead bodies. </p>
               <p> But of course I have strayed onto these fields during our own time of war and
                  have solicited my examples accordingly. Or have they solicited me? I have lost, I
                  fear, the proper mediating distance.</p>
