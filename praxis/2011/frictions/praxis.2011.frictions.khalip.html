            </div>
            <p>At first glance, my remarks in this essay improvise on Adorno and Horkheimer’s pronouncement
               at the beginning of <em>Dialectic of the Enlightenment</em> that “Enlightenment, in the widest sense of progressive thought, has always aimed
               at liberating men from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the fully enlightened
               earth radiates disaster triumphant” (3). Their narrative of the perilous debris of
               secularized knowledge—the “disenchantment of the world”—negatively offers up the glimmer
               of waste for critical speculation. Indeed, the <em>Dialectic</em>’s critique of progressivism shores up remnants of various projects that lie in the
               wake of thought’s destruction and division, leaving readers in the headlights of the
               very forms of political, social, and cultural subjugation they were meant to overcome:
               “the Enlightenment has extinguished any trace of its own self-consciousness. The only
               kind of thinking that is sufficiently hard to shatter myths is ultimately self-destructive”
               (4).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In what follows, however, I do not propose a therapeutic Romantic response to the <em>Dialectic</em>’s claims; rather, I invert Adorno and Horkheimer in order to explore how the aesthetic,
                  cognitive, and ethical vocabularies of ruination and disaster (what Adorno will himself
                  refer to as “damaged life”) provide ways for <em>dwelling with </em>the non-normative and transformative effects unleashed <em>by</em> disaster—that is to say, how palpable strains of apocalypticism in certain Romantic
                  texts are denatured or flattened out to the point where “disaster triumphant” isn’t
                  merely synonymous wth the denigration of thought, but rather suggests new conditions
                  of intelligibility and complex forms of non-triumphal, wasted life. “I see around
                  me here/Things which you cannot see: we die, my Friend,/Nor we alone, but that which
                  each man loved/And prized in his peculiar nook of earth/Dies with him, or is changed.”
                  (<em>Ruined</em> 67-71).

                  </div> In <em>The Ruined Cottage</em>, Armytage hews an imaginary path through disaster: he perceives the intangible things
                  of his littered environment as figures of reasoning that do not cease to generate
                  unnatural visualizations and understandings. Here, ruins are less triumphalist memorials
                  than wasted terrains that deviate from the normative circulations of sentimental value
                  which the poem has traditionally been thought to sustain at a premium. In an article
                  to which I will return, the architectural theorist Rem Koolhaas has imagined such
                  scorched scenes as “Junkspace”—aesthetically residual stuff, the “apotheosis, or meltdown”
                  of modernization’s enlightened programs of construction: “If space-junk is the human
                  debris that litters the universe, Junk-Space is the residue mankind leaves on the
                  planet” (175). This postmodern proliferation of immanent spaces, which Koolhaas diagnoses
                  as one of the designs of late capitalism, homogenizes and conglomerates things that
                  are readily discarded or treated as underway to being remaindered: “Continuity is
                  the essence of Junkspace; it exploits any invention that enables expansion, deploys
                  the infrastructure of seamlessness: escalator, air-conditioning, sprinkler, fire shutter,
                  hot-air curtain. . .” (175). Risking anachronism, this architectural “stuff” leaks
                  out of <em>The Ruined Cottage</em>’s own continuities of accumulation and regress, progress and memorialization, which
                  are treated as leftover and exposed to exploitation. The poem begs its ruins to be
                  read differently <em>as</em> junk, as “oblivious” spaces of conditioned freedom and “collision” where to look upon
                  disaster is to see and meditate on the deviant mutability of persons and things. Part
                  of the value of identifying such inhumanism and understanding why it countermands
                  the nostalgia, melancholy, and frustration ordinarily associated with modernity’s
                  angst depends on how we perceive the disaster that the poem proposes; after all, these
                  things are not simply ghostly revenants but half-material entities on their way to
                  death. Like Margaret, like the broken objects around the cottage, and finally, like
                  Armytage and the narrator, all things break down in the poem and are rehydrated by
                  its muted lines of sympathy. And yet, if Romanticism has often been read as synonymous
                  with discourses of humanism, personhood, and community, how should we read Wordsworth’s
                  insistence that we must attend to the waste, to things in their various states of
                  destruction? And what would it mean to think of persons as things themselves? The
                  trancelike inhumanism of the spear-grass vision that concludes the poem evokes a disastrous
                  reticence that suffuses Wordsworth’s thought, and in this essay, I want to work toward
                  a ruined cottage as the place where Wordsworth explores the hospitality of dwelling
                  in the rubble of disaster—in other words, disaster <em>not</em> as the pessimistic obliteration of enlightenment promise, but rather as a bleak and
                  elegant reimagination of sociality without a future.</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">Harassed Unrest</span></h2>
               <p>In “Building Dwelling Thinking,” Heidegger states that: ‘“Mortals dwell in that they
                  receive the sky as sky. They leave to the sun and the moon their journey, to the stars
                  their courses, to the seasons their blessing and their inclemency; they do not turn
                  night into day nor day into a harassed unrest” (150). What <em>is</em> harassed unrest? Is it a state lacking in peace, an imposed disruption of everyday
                  life, or the place of disaster? When Wordsworth exclaims in <em>Home at Grasmere</em> that “yon ethereal vault/And this deep Vale” will give us the sense of finding ourselves
                  as “The Inmates not unworthy of their home/The Dwellers of their Dwelling” (<em>Poems</em> 642-648), is he referring to a way of dwelling in <em>un</em>harassed rest? (We might also recall, for example, Wordsworth’s wish in “Tintern Abbey”
                  that Dorothy’s mind “shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,/Thy memory be as a dwelling-place/For
                  all sweet sounds and harmonies”[<em>Poems</em> 140-142]). For the author of <em>Home at Grasmere</em>, how to live or, more importantly, how to dwell essentially conveys the insight of
                  pastoral <em>otium</em>: that “being” is about how one occupies or remains, stops or tarries as a figure
                  in a space that neither precedes nor emerges out of one’s control. “Dwelling” sounds
                  like a parrying move of sorts against the “multitude of causes unknown” blunting everyday
                  life—England’s military-industrial proliferation, war, famine, poverty, amongst other
                  elemental matters of late eighteenth-century European life (Wordsworth, <em>Literary</em> 21). In <em>Home at Grasmere</em>, Wordsworthian dwelling emerges as a defensive habitat—the ruling figure of contained,
                  domesticated housing or sheltering where to live is to coincide (to prove “not unworthy”)
                  with place and purpose. Finding a home marks a singular attempt on the poet’s part
                  to avoid disasters that would demolish dwelling entirely.</p>
               <p>Heidegger etymologically traces <em>dwelling</em> to mean “to stay in a place…to be at peace, to be brought to peace, to remain at
                  peace…preserved from harm and danger, preserved from something, safeguarded. To free
                  really means to spare” (149), and his gloss captures the wistful ambivalence within
                  Wordsworth’s thought which shuttles between containment and anxious openness at all
                  costs: to dwell means to reprieve the imagination from the very stimulations that
                  seek to exploit it—to grant or relinquish a spot to its state of rest, ostensibly
                  without any design of its own. Dwelling, then, is less about home than it is (as Heidegger
                  states) about a thinking and building, a securing of ontological place by allowing
                  it to remain unoccupied or unused.</p>

               <p>In this passage from <em>The Prelude</em>, the imagination does indeed “make abode” as it exchanges its power over and against
                  reason, but it is less concerned with housing authorial power than with deflecting
                  an infinitude which lies “only there” in the most minimal sense of being a space out
                  of reach, rather than an inaccessibility that gestures to a transcendental beyond.
                  The ambiguities in Heidegger’s thoughts, like Wordsworth’s, turn on the question of
                  how and why dwelling must be “brought to peace”: that is to say, is peace an original
                  condition of place—the <em>placing</em> of place—that must be reestablished through a violence that is inextricable from
                  its accomplishment? Or is it a horizon-event left to be discovered through “building”
                  which spares and preserves a spot of rest? Insofar as “securing” is also a “building”
                  for Heidegger, dwelling is a motile gathering of place, a recycling act in view of
                  what he calls the fourfold (earth, sky, gods, mortals). All four of these reciprocally
                  coalesce in dwelling, and nothing is misplaced. “Dwelling preserves the fourfold by
                  bringing the presencing of the fourfold into things. But things themselves secure
                  the fourfold <em>only when</em> they themselves <em>as</em> things are let be in their presencing” (151). Fretful dwelling is thus <em>undwelling</em>—it means a crisis with presencing the fourfold, with its arrangement—an incapacity
                  to let things be. For Heidegger, the “real plight of dwelling lies in this, that mortals
                  search anew for the nature of dwelling, that they <em>must ever learn to dwell.</em> What if man’s homelessness consisted in this, that man still does not even think
                  of the <em>real</em> plight of dwelling as <em>the</em> plight?” (161) Heidegger’s post-war reflections on dwelling and world-homelessness
                  might be thought of as reparative attempts at living: they generate or <em>build</em> forms of life that might dwell without coercion and harassment, not by changing what
                  the world is, but by experiencing its openness as a condition of thinking about it
                  otherwise. The difference for Wordsworth, however, in a poem like <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> and <em>not</em> <em>Home at Grasmere</em>, is that in the former text he specifically dwells in the disastering of the fourfold.
                  Wordsworth thinks about how dwelling in the ruins of unrest brings changes in sociality
                  that are rendered unreal in a landscape dominated by scarcity.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>How to dwell then in disaster? The absence of a precise definition (whether scientific,
                     medical, social, aesthetic) imposes limits and demands a recalibration of its meanings.
                     According to the <em>Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster </em>(<em>CRED</em>), disaster “is a situation or event which overwhelms local capacity, necessitating
                     a request to a national or international level for external assistance.” The <em>OED</em>’s definition—“Anything that befalls of ruinous or distressing nature; a sudden or
                     great misfortune, mishap, or misadventure; a calamity”—reflects the World Health Organization’s
                     emphasis on “extraordinary response from outside.” Disaster thus differs from other
                     variants like crisis, emergency, or catastrophe by virtue of a system of scale and
                     disproportionate intensity: the DEEP Center, for example, emphasizes an “imbalance
                     between the demands of the disaster event and the capacities of the affected community
                     to respond.” Disaster is a relational description of an excess of potentiality and
                     the vulnerabilities produced by and within an environment rendered non-holistic. It
                     forces bodies and objects to collide; rather than evoke a verticalizing sense of obligation
                     and suspension by that which is “evermore about to be,” it intimates that any marked
                     awareness of an alteration of events is at base perspectival—a change in position
                     that outdoes the capacity to properly define and respond to it. As Marie-Hélène Huet
                     reminds us of the etymology of the word, <em>désastre</em> (from the stars) or <em>disastro</em> also signals a particular displacement or dislocation vis-à-vis the sky—a betrayal
                     or disownment by the cosmos: “However, the word ‘disaster’ has not always designated
                     a catastrophic event. Initially it was not a noun by a past participle. In other words,
                     there was no disaster per se, ony the experience of disaster—one was ‘disastered’…In
                     disaster, the very space humans occupy in relation to the stars is destabilized; they
                     are uprooted from their place in the cosmos and cast adrift” (18, 19). As a spatial
                     coincidence of hazard <em>with</em> vulnerability, disaster provokes reflections on the possibilities of living under
                     and <em>through</em> conditions undesirable—a reshifting of the hierarchization of knowledge in view of
                     a change in placement. It is, in other words, a radical change in perspectives on
                     dwelling. Trauma theory, for example, treats disaster as a kind of specialized knowledge
                     of the modern habitus—something that is understood by its unknownness, or the mind’s
                     hospitality to formations it cannot anticipate in advance.

                     these disasters, whether real or imagined, as in some way doubly dismal and displaced:
                     they are hidden by forms of literary obscuration that blunt the “historical” underscorings
                     of place. What these approaches share, however, is an attentiveness to the uncovering
                     of referentiality as a material revelation of the states of life, and they equally
                     treat disaster’s critical magnitude as the payoff for an enrichment of knowing in
                     the face of loss: in other words, what resonates in some of these accounts is the
                     recovery of unwanted knowledge as generative and non-privative. If we accept this,
                     we might risk precluding narratives of non-development that disaster evokes in non-differential
                     terms. For Maurice Blanchot, for example, disaster brings forms of perceptual awareness
                     that cannot be easily shared or drawn into acceptable use because they shortcircuit
                     desires to dwell with <em>oneself</em>: <span class="quote">‘The question concerning the disaster is a part of the disaster: it is not an interrogation,
                        but a prayer, an entreaty, a call for help. The disaster appeals to the disaster that
                        the idea of salvation, of redemption might not yet be affirmed, and might, drifting
                        debris, sustain fear. The disaster: inopportune. (13) ’</span> The question of the disaster is implicitly about dwelling—as a non-reciprocal appeal,
                     it reflects on how to live with unrest while refusing to consent to outside response.
                     For Blanchot, the ability to think is synonymous with a capacity to <em>not</em> exclude difficulty—to forestall the expectation of what is “evermore about to be,”
                     or what is cognitively expected of the unknown when it is construed as inevitable.
                     On the one hand, disaster appears to read like a structure of desire (like love, risk,
                     mourning), but even more for Blanchot, the disaster figures for the non-affirmation
                     of hope, a plea that can never be attested to nor secured. It is a state of displacement,
                     of non-affective dwelling that fails to imitate a relational stance toward salvation
                     or redemption because neither can be properly anticipated. To believe in them is to
                     erroneously seize upon each as structures of promised opportunity. <span class="quote">‘The disaster ruins everything, all the while leaving everything intact. It does not
                        touch anyone in particular; ‘I’ am not threatened by it, but spared, left aside. It
                        is in this way that I am threatened; it is in this way that the disaster threatens
                        in me that which is exterior to me—an other than I who passively become other. There
                        is no reaching the disaster…To think the disaster (if this is possible, and it is
                        not possible inasmuch as we suspect that the disaster is thought) is to have no longer
                        any future in which to think it. (1)’</span> A number of thoughts emerge in this tightly-knit fragment: how does disaster “ruin
                     everything” while changing nothing at the same time? And how can one speak of the
                     disaster if it touches no one “in particular”? Blanchot’s fragmentary descriptions
                     undo the privileging aspects of reference: to consider disaster as both preserving
                     and destroying (to echo Shelley’s west wind) is to denature any demonstrative sense
                     of its meaning. It intimates that progressive transformation is evanescent or slight
                     or, moreover, that disaster is an inertia, something passively imponderable. Disaster
                     is posthumous: it “neither is, nor is it not”

                     Since one cannot know “what comes to pass,” disaster attenuates revelation to the
                     point of translating knowledge of <em>an </em>experience into knowledge of the <em>afterlife</em> of that experience. The difference between stasis and change, human and non-human,
                     is thus neutralized by an ethics of reading that erases the experience of thinking
                     of such difference as something felt to be discovered <em>within</em> the self, something made recognizable by the temporalization of a narrative that distributes
                     events and their perception as seemingly successive and accountable. To be left untouched
                     or to dwell <em>as</em> untouched means to go without registering the slightest kind of acknowledgment, the
                     unaffective or non-traumatic impression that occurs by virtue of the fact that there
                     is <em>no one there to be touched by it in the first place</em>. A “bond/Of brotherhood is broken” when a “human hand” does not touch the stillness
                     it had earlier sought to disturb. The British geographer Nigel Clark has argued that
                     the very desire to define disaster as “an event that makes a difference” is to reduce
                     it to historical or social determinants, and thus do conceptual damage to the virtual
                     materializations it unleashes: “Is it really ‘difference’ if we conceive of the disaster
                     as a making manifest of vulnerabilities that could and should have been visible prior
                     to the event; if the disaster serves primarily to reveal, re-inscribe and retrench
                     pre-existing hierarchies and structures? And for whom is it a disaster, if in the
                     very event of disrupting and unravelling a spatial or geographic order, it turns out
                     to authorise the discourse that speaks of disruption and unravelling of spatial and
                     geographic orders?” (1132-1133.) Difference can mark too easily an emerging pattern
                     of articulation, of revelation and necessary sequence—it compels a relentless sameness,
                     a rewinding of time to maintain repetition and inertia. By contrast, disaster is an
                     unwilled, unseeable, and <em>indifferent</em> eventfulness, a “dwelling-with” so deeply ruined that its non-apparency marks a resistance
                     to its claims. Although Blanchot’s cryptic descriptions mystify the term to the point
                     of rendering it uninterpretable, it is important to recall how the question <em>of</em> disaster is always an entreaty to speak well of it. “Everything is the disaster” is
                     an injunction to dwell with and not look away from oneself, and others, in ruin.</p>

               <p>When Wordsworth speaks of the “fretful dwellings of mankind” at the beginning of the
                  <em>Two-Part Prelude</em>, he does so by way of what Timothy Morton has called an “ambient poetics”: a surrounding,
                  reverberating environment of co-existence, rather than a marker or mere spot of time
                  (Morton 22). Both the 1805 and 1850 <em>Prelude</em> repeat this passage with a teleological inflection that marks out the eventual home
                  of Wordsworth’s poetic ambition. But instead of further amplifying these gladdening
                  descriptions, I want to suggest a counter-Wordsworthian reading that turns especially
                  on the withdrawal of personal will in favor of passive acceptance and receipt of unassumed

               <p> In this passage, which was not reproduced in the subsequent 1805 and 1850 versions
                  of <em>The Prelude</em>, Wordsworth speaks of “distresses and disasters” as causal breaks, events that are
                  neither anticipated by nor fulfill the experiences that precede them. Wordsworth’s
                  disaster is closer to Deleuze’s theory of the event, for whom the event is not anything
                  in particular but rather a virtualization of material possibilities that are always
                  occurring: “The event is not the state of affairs. It is actualized in a state of
                  affairs, in a body, in a lived, but it has a shadowy and secret part that is continually
                  subtracted from or added to its actualization: in contrast with the state of affairs,
                  it neither begins nor ends but has gained or kept the infinite movement to which it
                  gives consistency” (<em>What is Philosophy</em> 156). The Deleuzian event is a disastrous irruption that is not to be confused with
                  the actual occurrence precipitated by the event itself. It is always belatedly captured
                  by the literary which doesn’t represent it but rather <em>expresses</em> it, not symptomatically but almost metabolically “counter-effectuating” the event
                  (159). In this sense, Wordsworth’s distresses and disasters effect a non-pathological
                  counter-effectuation: they permit a moment of freedom, an allusion to a virtuality
                  of experience that won’t reduce the meaning of the disaster to the facticity of life.
                  The “images to which in following years/Far other feelings were attached” certainly
                  conjure a Humean reading of the image as a mechanism between sense and mind to which
                  feeling incrementally attaches and in turn embellishes thought. But what Wordsworth
                  also seems to suggest is that the images of “Distresses and disasters, tragic facts/Of
                  rural history” which merge into “independent life” subsequently outlive, metaphorically,
                  the real casualties out of which they come, not as naturalized copies or <em>eidolons</em> that rival reality, but which exist apart as simulacra requiring a violent dissemination
                  in order to be reborn again. Rather than see such images as redemptive breakaways
                  from disaster, Wordsworth points here to the mind <em>not</em> working to therapeutically overcome disaster (recuperating itself outside of these
                  disasters and metastisizing out of it); rather, it is passively fascinated by the
                  images’ endurance, “like archetypes,” in spite of the mind’s own individuation. If
                  the disaster does signal a difference in the speaker, it is one which emerges with
                  insignificant detail: “that what we feel of sorrow and despair/From ruin and from
                  change, and all the grief/The passing shews of being leave behind,/Appeared an ideal
                  dream that could not live/Where meditation was” (520-524); But at the same time, disaster
                  also brings to awareness a life that somehow dwells under conditions that leave it
                  to compose or decompose itself anew. If dwelling, for Heidegger, is an overcoming
                  of “harassed unrest” that opens one up to and gathers the fourfold, Wordsworth’s “disasters”
                  point to a kind of life whose unrest <em>is</em> unharassed, non-coercive, and non-apocalyptic. It scatters the fourfold.</p>

               <p>What if we were to conceive of the disasters of the past as pulverizing our standard
                  forms of attachment? Because disasters are silently happening all around us, what
                  would it mean to insist that our response should not be one of sudden regrouping,
                  but of welcoming the unwanted changes that a form of disastrous hospitality commits
                  on our moral exchanges, undoing our models of personhood, and transforming us into
                  debris, waste, and ruin? Derrida writes after Kant that hospitality is a right or
                  duty rather than an affective form of philanthropy because it is an obligation that
                  challenges the seeming “naturalness” of our sentimental attachments: “it already broaches
                  an important question, that of the anthropological dimension of hospitality or the
                  right to hospitality: what can be said of, indeed can one speak of, hospitality toward
                  the non-human, the divine, for example, or the animal or vegetable; does one owe hospitality,
                  and is that the right word when it is a question of welcoming-–or being made welcome
                  by-–the other or the stranger as god, animal or plant?” (4) Hospitality in fact concerns
                  the question of unrestful dwelling because it won’t let the sky or the earth simply
                  be—it marks the torquing between identities, the queering of our relation to the non-human,
                  of the person to the vegetable. As inmates of dwellings, we should begin to read Wordsworth’s
                  poetry as reflecting on the forms of dwelling afforded in the face of conditions that
                  are, to say the least, intolerable and inhospitable. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When Armytage points to the scene of disaster at the beginning of <em>The Ruined Cottage</em>, he gestures to the “cheerless spot” where the fourfold is at once gathered <em>and</em> disseminated, where disaster is kept open as a question over the ruins of a poem that
                     has often been read as an act of reparative memorialization.

                     </div> In keeping with Clark’s definition, I want to suggest that the ruins Wordsworth attends
                     to closely resemble an “event of disrupting and unravelling,” and are linked to his
                     antirepresentational preoccupation with disaster’s ruination of the gains of pastoral
                     elegy. <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> thus doesn’t simply rehumanize our relationship with things in the world; instead,
                     it marks an unworking or <em>désoeuvrement</em> of things, and troubles the kinds of economies that shuttle persons and things between
                     durability and transience, gain and loss, wealth and waste. The elegy, in other words, <em>does not give</em>, and similarly does not owe (after Derrida): it disasters the payments ordinarily
                     recouped by acts of mourning that assure normative dwelling “evermore.”

                     </div> On the one hand, of course, <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> does seek to sublimate grief into what Joel Faflak calls a “desire for moral management”
                     (“Was it”), creating pathetic fallacies which substantialize and organize emotions
                     already resistant to duration (“The Poets in their elegies and songs/Lamenting the
                     departed call the groves,/They call upon the hills and streams to mourn,/And senseless
                     rocks, nor idly; for they speak/In these their invocations with a voice/Obedient to
                     the strong creative power/Of human passions” [73-79]). But there are always “Sympathies…//More
                     tranquil” (79-80) in the sense of being non-reciprocal, that do not instrumentalize
                     streams and rocks in order to make them weep: while the poem’s opening rehearsal of
                     the history of elegiac address seeks to re-cite (and re-assert) its precedence over
                     a world of things, it also exhumes the “senselessness” of a triadic encounter laid
                     waste in a leftover world. As Paul J. Alpers has noted, the intertextual echoes of
                     Vergilian eclogue in the poem work less to develop a dark antipastoralism than to
                     script a new mode of pastoral poetry that literally digs up the “bare Common” of its
                     initial setting, and reconfigures it in new encounters and experiences where “the
                     question of whether and how the earth is a fit habitation for human beings” (267)
                     persists throughout the Romantic junkspace, where disaster makes the difference between
                     change and death imperceptible. Indeed, as we are soon brought to a “ruined house,
                     four naked walls/That stared upon each other,” the poem implies that any kind of ethical
                     response to this spot will be measured in terms of how well we look upon (rather than
                     away from) the ruins—a different kind of pedagogical approach, moreover, that risks
                     changing everything and nothing, eliding being with non-being.</p>
               </div>
               <p><em>The Ruined Cottage</em> in fact begins with a scene of lugubrious oversaturation in the world, a wasting
                  away of time that defines the narrator’s own way of being which, from the outset,
                  is beset by “no rest” (23). This unrest of dwelling is characterized by intellectual
                  distraction and barely recorded somatic movements: “careless limbs beside the root/Of
                  some huge oak whose aged branches make/A twilight of their own” (11-13), or just after,
                  the speaker toiling “With languid feet which by the slipp’ry ground/Were baffled still”
                  (20). Unlively feet here are baffled into stillness and continue, as Wordsworth suggests,
                  to be baffled by a groundlessness the poem asks us to accept as its state of unrest—the
                  unraveling of our own being into a baffled stillness of matter. Armytage, as numerous
                  critics have noted, is signaled as ruined or thing-like himself: “his hat/Bedewed
                  with water-drops, as if the brim/Had newly scooped a running stream. He rose/And pointing
                  to a sunflower, bade me climb/The [ ] wall where that same gaudy flower/Looked upon
                  the road” (49-54). The MS. B version of the poem seems to overhaul this reification
                  by inserting the as-yet unnamed pedlar’s self-narrative early on in the poem as an
                  exemplary biography: as a “chosen son” (MS. B 76), the pedlar is described as entirely
                  of a piece with the natural landscape, giving “moral life” to “every natural form,
                  rock, fruit, and flower,/Even the loose stones that cover the highway” (80-82). The
                  pedlar is individualized in the very act of his own self-discerning capacities to
                  overcome the psychoanalytic frustration of Margaret’s abjection through philosophical
                  narrative and moral therapy, or what Faflak elsewhere describes as the “conflict between
                  a desire for a system that will discipline the aberrant empirical phenomena of psychic
                  life and his fascination with those phenomena” (“Analysis”): </p>

               <p> Aesthetic contemplation here mingles with a relentless moral uncovering of difference:
                  the eye’s vigilance over the environment repetitively binds or “chains” it to assent
                  to things that do not rest. These surfaces differentiate themselves as phenomena that
                  coherently assemble the world’s facticity. But the pedlar’s look is not quite so self-absorbed
                  and self-discerning: the biographical insert in MS.B literally “frame[s]” (104) Armytage
                  so as to suggest that even in solitude, he is never detached from the “perpetual logic”
                  that enchains him to all things. Indeed, the perpetuity of his thought serializes
                  him into a landscape where he is dispersed into the scenic abstractions of “surface”
                  and “shades.” Ocular power is scattered through a kind of ever-metamorphosing formalism.
                  When Armytage exclaims in the MS.D version of the poem that at the “hour of deepest
                  noon…/This hour when all things which are not at rest/Are chearful…Why should a tear
                  be in an old man’s eye?” (187-192), his apparently stalled response over “feeding
                  on disquiet” divests thought from thinker and contagiously passes it onto the poet
                  who, on looking on the pedlar’s face, feels “that simple tale/[Pass] from my mind
                  like a forgotten sound,” (203-204). The moment of forgetfulness is less one of sympathetic
                  resemblance than a strange example of sfumato, or a literal <em>inhumanizing</em> of the face to the point where what is perceived is several disfigurations away from
                  the object or person beheld. “[L]ooking round/Upon that tranquil ruin” (217-218),
                  the poem reverses the compulsion to gaze upon things as if they were subject to coerced
                  judgment. A different kind of unanticipated perception develops, a low-grade suspended
                  attentiveness or distracted “looking away” that recalls what Rei Terada has studied
                  as phenomenophilia—a love for “emigrating” or fleeting things. Such a love runs counter
                  to the usual normativity of appearances foisted upon us by the social world (<em>Looking</em>).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Alan Bewell has noted that “Wordsworth’s ‘ruined cottage’…should be read not only
                     in terms of the discourse of the picturesque, but also as part of that ‘alien’ landscape
                     of death that first emerged in his poetry with <em>Salisbury Plain</em>,” and the poem moves further into an astonishingly bleak poetic vision that reduces
                     the picturesque almost to the level of still life (124-5). As Harold Bloom wrote years
                     ago (37-52), Wordsworth’s cinematic Romanticism consists of a preternatural zooming
                     in on the world: the poem unfurls a series of time-lapse vignettes that contrast the
                     barest inklings of movement with interminable motionlessness, effecting a degradation
                     of the narrative’s kinetic pull to the point where the hypersensations afforded by
                     the elegy are shown to be utterly external to the form itself. In other words, the
                     poem demonstrates how perception is negotiated <em>through</em> a poetic materiality that in turn abstracts sensation and leaves behind virtual, corroded
                     images of things “at peace,” or things that “presence” the world and dwell insofar
                     as they cannot be normatively reinhabited:

                     in the same way as the worm is “on” Margaret’s cheek. In these instances, one gesture
                     appears to set off the energy of another in a Rube Goldberg-like process. Material
                     figure hits against material figure with the slimmest sense of tangible action, and
                     the effects of this lyric movement are in turn abstracted into the arc of disuse that
                     degrades the image into a rubble of representation. What kind of durability does Wordsworth
                     lend a character like Margaret, who is at once utterly obsolete, subject to decay,
                     while also movingly thing-like? As Adam Potkay has noted, Romantic writers frequently
                     point to the “thing” as a term that is not always reducible to sociological and materialist
                     readings: neither commodity, fetish, nor concrete object, the “things we cannot see”
                     disturb the gap between person and thing, self and other, and offer a challenging
                     ecological ethics.

                     is literally the “no future,” the superfluity of stuff that glimmers in a history
                     of disaster that divests the poem of any redeemable conditions.

                  the point of producing veritable kitsch or detritus. Put another way, the poem returns

               <p> This disastrous overturning of the dwelling-with of objects, persons, and spaces
                  in Wordsworth’s poem predictably recalls a fallen Eden, but it is more to the point
                  that Armytage’s words turn the materiality of the environment into a text of disastrous
                  interconnectivity. The rose suffocates under the violent pressures of the bindweed;
                  combined, the two effect a <em>junkimage</em>, a residual poetic perception. Rose and bindweed serve as topological points of mediation
                  which “gather” just as well as they disaster the various intimacies the passage seeks
                  to render adjacent. Much like the passage where the narrator stoops to drink the water,
                  here agency is several times relocated from honeysuckle to stone-crop, weed, bindweed,
                  rose, chamomile, thyme—none of which are isolated things unto themselves, but “objects”
                  that only mean insofar as they are brought into a web of proximation by the pedlar’s
                  visualized narration. In just this way, pastoral ruination veers away from psychologizing
                  lament, and produces a different kind of figural traffic.</p>
               <p>As Armytage, the poem’s bewildered documentarian, casts his eye on the <em>Grey Gardens</em>-like world of Margaret’s desuetude, he creates and <em>transforms</em> the cottage’s past and present. The infinitesimal alternation between stoppage and
                  motion unleashed by the scene of disaster is of a piece with the unworking of images
                  which moulder in their own inoperative pathetic fallacies, and the strangely atemporal,
                  stop-motion description of things that <em>do not move,</em> much like the “insidious half-life” of Koolhaas’s Junkspace: “Aging in Junkspace
                  is nonexistent or catastrophic; sometimes an entire Junkspace—a department store,
                  a nightclub, a bachelor pad—turns into a slum overnight without warning: wattage diminishes
                  imperceptibly, letters drop out of signs, air-conditioning units start dripping, cracks
                  appear as if from otherwise unregistered earthquakes; sections rot, are no longer
                  viable, but remain joined to the ﬂesh of the main body via gangrenous passages” (180).
                  The “catastrophic” upsets of junkspace plot time to be at once stopped <em>and</em> contracted to the point where change is instantaneous with presence. Junkspace thus
                  spatializes the destructivity of endless movement and the excessive remains it jettisons:
                  while space changes, junk accumulates but is relocated to different foci or lines
                  of sight that turn habitation into an ethics of reading, or reading <em>as</em> a dwelling in states of disrepair between being and non-being where things cannot
                  be appropriated.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Raimonda Modiano has identified this de-instrumentalization of things as a feature
                     of eighteenth-century picturesque, where human figures, like their non-human opposites,
                     are ambiguously caught between prospect and property, and in turn are frequently depicted
                     as <em>found</em> objects: “It is an object which has no known owner or if the owner is known, he or
                     she is either unlocatable or out of reach. Because this object is not given by someone,
                     a relationship with it incurs no obligation and fosters no dependency, as in gift
                     exchange. On the contrary, this object guarantees the discoverer’s independence for
                     it asks nothing and invites no attachments” (212-213).

                     </div> Thus the picturesque economizes a non-reciprocal form of gift-giving that assumes
                     the found object as the ungiven gift. The strangeness of <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> lies precisely in this emphasis on the foundness of things <em>as if there were no prior authorship nor ownership</em>: things are seemingly returned as unrepaired and not to be used, or as gifts never
                     put into circulations of exchange or obligation. While their affective kitschiness
                     nostalgically recalls the commodified literary history out of which they have emerged—as
                     Karen Swann has taught us, they are almost certainly Gothic ephemera

                     </div> —the elegy just as convincingly organizes the broken bowl, Margaret, her child, the
                     spear-grass, and the cottage itself as things found <em>in</em> a limbic state between being for another and being for themselves. Like Van Gogh’s
                     peasant shoes, what we see are the traces of <em>inhuman</em> objects rid of their wearers or dwellers, poetic fallacies that occur without the
                     error of human intention. These things are specifically <em>irreparable</em> in Giorgio Agamben’s sense of the word: they “are consigned without remedy to their
                     being-thus, that they are precisely and only their <em>thus</em>…[for these things] there is literally no shelter possible, that in their being-thus
                     they are absolutely exposed, absolutely abandoned” (39). For Agamben, this irreparability
                     is a quality of what he calls its “being that is always already given in modality,
                     that <em>is</em> its modalities. It is not <em>thus</em>, but rather it is <em>its</em> thus” (92). The “being-thus” of the irreparable imagines being not in terms of essence,
                     state, or condition, but in an “abandoned” excessiveness, a mode of “ecstatic dwelling,”
                     as Kate Rigby calls it (“Ecstatic”). Like disaster, Agamben’s sense of the “irreparable”
                     throws into high relief a form of sociality that is borne out of a decommodified and
                     desacralized world—in other words, inoperative communities freed from universal judgment
                     (“if the sensible world was ordered to fit the dignity and the habtation of imperfect
                     humans, then what sense can that world have when those humans arrive at their supernatural
                     destination?” [39]). Persons and things will “thus” not be expropriated; they are
                     the stuff of an ontological desuetude that is intensely careless and negatively “<em>capable of not not-being</em>” (40).</p>
               </div>
               <p>It is customary to note how the poem’s narration of Margaret’s wartime destruction
                  is tempered by both the speaker and by Armytage, but what is less remarked on is how
                  the moral helplessness of tending for her—of letting the disaster literally shift
                  things before our eyes—is less a form of resignation than a thingifying counter-effect
                  of Armytage’s trances: to cede to the “passing shews of being” is to be desubjectified,
                  to enter the space from “ruin and from change” where the elegy’s pathic distractions
                  express the degree to which the speakers themselves have become utterly irreparable:
                  “ ‘I turned away/And walked along my road in happiness’ ” (524-525), says Armytage,
                  his joy as impotent as the grief that “traced” (502) the “secret spirit of humanity”
                  surviving “’mid the calm oblivious tendencies/Of nature, ‘mid her plants, her weeds,
                  and flowers” (503-505). While criticism has often focused on this image of “humanity”
                  as an ideological purification of the humanness of Margaret, what often goes unsaid
                  is how the poet’s blessing of Margaret’s thingification in fact marks the point where
                  the rubble is asserted as having a spooky perspective all by itself: as an object
                  of care and not appropriation, the rubble is hospitably turned away from because in
                  this refusal of identification, a refusal of the viral nature of sympathetic co-existence,
                  a different kind of non-recognitional “ministering” is formed. Such distractions signify
                  a life that is neither subjective nor objective, between being and non-being; it is
                  a life that is rendered superfluous, or irreducible to its biopoliticized specificity—a
                  dwelling in a disastrous or ruined mode that hears a gothic ecology of warbling linnets,
                  singing thrushes “and other melodies” (533) that are as mechanized as the friendship
                  between pedlar and poet. The elegy’s final musicality, moreover, recalls the thick
                  silence of Keats’s “To Autumn,” but even more, the emphasis on the “evening resting-place”
                  literally <em>evens out</em> the dwelling of poet and Armytage to the point where by now, we watch them mutate
                  to the point of failing, <em>as figures</em>, to bear witness anymore to the human. Armytage falls into just this inhumanizing
                  trance when he speaks of how “so familiarly/Do I perceive her manner and her look/And
                  presence, and so deeply do I feel/Her goodness, that not seldom in my walks/A momentary
                  trance comes over me/And to myself I seem to muse on one/By sorrow laid asleep or
                  borne away,/A human being destined to awake/To human life, or something very near/To
                  human life, when he shall come again/For whom she suffered” (365-375). The Christianizing
                  redemption of these last lines notwithstanding, Armytage’s trance also compels him
                  (and us) to attend to the way in which Margaret’s life becomes superfluous in the
                  sense of becoming disposable, not knowing whether she sleeps or is borne away, or
                  to which “life,” human or not, she is to awake. The interpassivity of her actions—suffering
                  for Christ—suggests that her own waiting is less expectation than a process of strange
                  erosion compelled by the elegy itself, one undertaken not in order simply to better
                  translate Margaret into the ground or virtualize her into the “secret spirit of humanity”
                  amid plants, weeds, and flowers, but rather to have us attend to her indistinction,
                  to a life that is not quite human—a “passing shew” that has yet to awaken into <em>a</em> human life because she never experienced humanity in the world at all.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Affixed to this site, Armytage compulsively “clings” to Margaret’s ghostly materiality
                     as if she were a machine that spun him out into existence. In this “tale of silent
                     suffering, hardly clothed/In bodily form, and to the grosser sense/But ill adapted,
                     scaracely palpable/To him who does not think” (233-236), narrative propulsion does
                     seem to become, as Davd Simpson has powerfully argued, a spectralized commodity itself
                     that produces virtual figures and environments hovering between tangibility and phantom-like
                     invisibility—states of “bare life” that testify to the buying and selling of mortality
                     (<em>Wordsworth</em>). But at the same time, Margaret’s thingification occurs while she “wastes [her]
                     time” (352), thus congealing her in debris and preventing any investment in what Alan
                     Liu has called the poem’s “capitalization upon inhumanity” (325). Indeed, it isn’t
                     clear if the commodification of labor has even begun: Margaret’s “pac[ing] through
                     many a day/Of the warm summer, from a belt of flax/That girt her waist spinning the
                     long-drawn thread” (459-462), which foreshadows her eventual demise into a spirit
                     of humanity, seems like a mode of profligate dalliance. Deleuze would call this aspect
                     of Wordsworth’s poem its <em>éspace</em> <em>quelconque</em>, or “whatever space”—a space denuded of human participation, that endures not simply
                     as the remnant of human life, but of life itself in its state of desertion (<em>Cinema</em>). After all, garbage is precisely that which is prohibited, that which we ought not
                     look at.

                              natural of culture, what culture, eating nature, tries to cast away. In the midst

                              (339).</span></div>
                     </div> And because we <em>do</em> look at it here, Wordsworth points to the poem’s mise–en–scène, to the unrestful dwelling
                     in rubbish that is brought into the poem’s foreground as the environment that sticks
                     around and cannot be redeveloped. Although biblical images like the broken bowl imply
                     a certain predestined fulfillment of catastrophic prophecy, Wordsworth’s writing concentrates
                     on such images <em>as</em> rubbishy, irreparable <em>ready-unmades</em> that block any kind of recuperating interpretation—what Alphonso Lingis, in another
                     context, calls “the empty endurance of the void” (21). What Wordsworth points to,
                     in my view, is uncomfortably compelling: a reading of disaster in terms of a grief
                     without grief, a hope without hope, and a style of extraindividual, catastrophic aestheticization
                     that dwells beyond elegy. If <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> evokes a singular inhumanism in its lines of sympathetic attachment, it just as well
                     concentrates on the less palatable moments of unrest where the vulnerability of persons
                     catalyzes a kind of disastrous thought—one which turns women into things and men into
                     ruins. Persons are readily thingified, and the desire to treat persons as things becomes
                     a necessary component of Romantic modernity—to recirculate persons in an aesthetic
                     economy that cannot bear to possess or dwell with anything, that treats persons as <em>res nullius</em>, and would have us literally waste life.</p>

               toward the poles—detritus is both its curse and its alternative. Trash is the becoming
               natural of culture, what culture, eating nature, tries to cast away. In the midst
               of simulacra, it is also a substance in which we can encounter decay and mortality”
