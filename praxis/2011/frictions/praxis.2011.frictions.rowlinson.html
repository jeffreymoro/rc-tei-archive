                  <p>The third of Sir Walter Scott’s Waverley novels, <em>The Antiquary</em> was published in 1816 and set in 1794. It was Scott’s favorite among his novels and
                     of them all displays the most playful consciousness of itself as a fiction. Historic
                     struggles elsewhere in the series are fought to a close by characters who, according
                     to Lukács, engage in them as types of whole contending classes. Here some of the same
                     conflicts appear in a belated and oddly inconsequential staging—Marx might say, as
                     farce—with characters whose enactments of political struggle the novel tends to expose
                     as fantasy. “In <em>The Antiquary</em>,” as Ian Duncan writes, “Scott undertakes what might be called the Shandyfication
                     of historical romance, glossing his earlier fiction and its cultural themes in a self-reflexive
                     and metafictional novel in which ‘nothing happens’” (<em>Scott’s Shadow</em> 139).

                              in the history of realism as its dominant topic; the facetiousness of The Antiquary’s
                              representation of history made it for this criticism a marginal title in the series.
                              Duncan’s treatment of the work results from his stated aim of taking seriously the
                              fictional character of Scott’s novels. The novel’s stress on the unreliability of
                              antiquarian narratives has led other critics to adopt it as a key text in readings
                              of Scott as a novelist whose realism is strongly qualified by skepticism and a belief
                              in the conti…</span></div>
                     </div> The conflict of the Stewart and Hanoverian monarchies thus dwindles into the after-dinner
                     quarrels of Jonathan Oldbuck, the antiquary of the title, and his neighbor, Sir Arthur
                     Wardour.

                              Lukàcs himself, deals at length with The Antiquary, see Maxwell. Regarding the “emptiness”
                              of history in the Waverley novels, of which the non-events of The Antiquary provide
                              the essay’s paradigm, see Maxwell 444 and 455.</span></div>

                     Norman knight, establish their figural relation to the rival parties of 1688, 1715,
                     and 1745. In spite of Wardour and Oldbuck’s quarrels, the novel’s topic is historical
                     closure; it argues that the struggles these characters seem to represent are actually
                     concluded, and that both are in practice loyal subjects of a united Britain, who share
                     a single class position as members of the landed gentry. The differences between them
                     are mere remainders and are appropriately staged by their disagreements about the
                     value of old coins, curiosities, and other relics. These disagreements arise, in their
                     most elementary form, from the absence of single standard of <em>price</em>, which thus functions in the novel as the belated afterimage of a century-long absence
                     in Scotland of a single accepted monarch.

                              More recently, Ian Duncan has read the characters of the Waverley novels as types
                              of contrasting narrative genres and discursive modes, whose dialectical engagement
                              the novel stages through their interaction—see Duncan Modern Romance and Transformations

                     </div> In the first section of this essay, however, we will discuss problems of identifying
                     and representing money that do not operate in <em>The Antiquary</em> only at the level of character. Individual characters disagree about what counts as
                     money, or show irrational preferences for one representative of money over another.
                     The novel itself embraces difference and mediation in the money form; money proper—in
                     the form of silver, which in 1794 still provided the legal standard for British money—appears
                     in it only as an alien and unintelligible intruder. Standard money, moreover, proves
                     alien not only to the historical setting the novel represents, but also to its own
                     diegetic conventions. Its appearance produces a crux, not only in the novel’s historical
                     representation, but also in its text.</p>
               </div>
               <p>When in chapter 22 Wardour presents Oldbuck “as a gift of friendship” with a collection
                  of antique coins and medals, begging him to choose those that will improve his collection,
                  he initiates a sequence of misunderstandings. Wardour owes Oldbuck money—and is in
                  fact offering the gift as propitiation before requesting a further loan—so Oldbuck
                  proposes to take the pieces at their catalogue valuation as partial payment of the
                  debt. Wardour objects both to the confusion of a gift with payment, and more centrally
                  to the catalogue itself, with its implication that the curiosity’s value derives from
                  the auction room rather than from the mere facts of age and association with the crown.
                  Oldbuck himself shows a different kind of scepticism about market prices when he finally
                  values the gold and silver pieces at twenty guineas in bullion and as much more only
                  “to such fools as ourselves, who are willing to pay for curiosity” (<em>The Antiquary</em> ch. 22; Scott <em>The Waverley Novels</em> 3: 217). The market, in this final view, would be a confederation of fools who collectively
                  drive the curiosity’s price over what Oldbuck ironically pretends to believe is its
                  only real value, that of the bullion it contains.</p>
               <p>The problem of valuing the curiosity involves both characters in contradiction. Wardour
                  owes Oldbuck a money debt, but offers him coins on which he does not want to set a
                  money value. Oldbuck proposes first to cite their value <em>in</em> money, then to value them <em>as</em> money. For each of them the curiosity flashes into existence, either as a gift or
                  as a commodity in its own right, only as the negation of money. The recurring difficulty
                  of valuing old and curious artifacts that Yoon Sun Lee has noted in <em>The Antiquary</em> is especially acute in this episode because in the case of old coins the indeterminate
                  value of the curiosity is the mirror-image of the indeterminacy of circulating coin,
                  a trait of late eighteenth-century Scotland that forms one of the novel’s minor recurring
                  themes.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Jonathan Oldbuck’s collecting mania is an object of mild satire throughout the novel;
                     the major vehicle for this satire is the beggar Edie Ochiltree. Ochiltree is the novel’s
                     principal truth-teller, repository of secrets, and returner of persons and things
                     to their proper places. One of his running jokes at Oldbuck’s expense concerns the
                     antiquary’s exchange of “siller” with a packman for an artifact he believed to be
                     an old coin. Twice in the novel Ochiltree reminds him of this transaction, tormenting
                     him with the fact that the supposed “auld coin” had actually proved only to be a “bodle”
                     (<em>Antiquary</em> chs. 4, 44; <em>WN</em> 2: 42, 400). This joke is odder than it at first seems, since the bodle was a copper
                     two penny piece of the old Scots coinage, which had nominally been superseded at the
                     Act of Union in 1707.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                              (5)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Ochiltree’s Scots vernacular refers to money as either “siller” or “gowd.” He distinguishes
                              regularly between the two, refusing gifts of gold as excessive, and begging only for
                              silver. In this respect, as in others, the novel is meticulous in its registration
                              of the heterogeneity of the circulating currency in late eighteenth-century Scotland.</span></div>
                     </div> The bodle itself was last minted in 1697 (Stewart 117); since the old Scots currency
                     was converted into Sterling at the rate of twelve to one, it might after the Union
                     be said to have the value of one sixth of a penny—though legally it had no monetary
                     value at all. In 1794 a bodle would thus have to be at least 97 years old; it would
                     also have been a relic of Scotland’s former status as an independent state with its
                     own mint. Why does Edie Ochiltree, apparently with the novel’s endorsement, take it
                     for granted that a bodle is not an “auld coin”?</p>
               </div>
               <p>The episode demonstrates both the indeterminacy of the category ‘money’ and the curiosity’s
                  status as money’s negative image. The reason the bodle doesn’t count as an old coin
                  in 1794 appears to be that even a century after the last example was minted it still
                  counts as money. At the union the gold and silver Scots coinage was reminted to the
                  English standard; not so the copper. Nor was there anywhere in Britain enough copper
                  minted during the eighteenth century to supply the need for change. The result was
                  a dilapidated and heterogeneous copper circulation throughout the country, the more
                  so the further one got from the Mint in London. In the latter part of the eighteenth
                  century some merchants and manufacturers took to issuing their own copper tokens to
                  supply the needs of local trade. This practice, illegal though tolerated, was especially
                  common in Scotland (Stewart 124 and plate XX). Such tokens continued to be issued
                  into the nineteenth century; some were merely old coins stamped with a new countermark:
                  an 1811 example of such recycled coinage was made from old bodles (Stewart 166), which
                  suggests a terminal date for their circulation as originally minted.</p>
               <p>The problematic relation of the curiosity to current coin is not the only form in
                  which <em>The Antiquary</em> represents money’s inhomogeneity and the consequent difficulty of identifying it.
                  More important to the plot than Oldbuck’s purchase of ambiguous coins is the duping
                  of his neighbor by a German named Dousterswivel. Dousterswivel’s swindle is to take
                  Wardour’s money as a fee, offering in exchange to discover by occult arts, first a
                  lead mine, then hoards of silver and gold supposedly hidden on his property in the
                  ruined priory of St. Ruth’s. During the course of the novel Wardour is bilked of his
                  entire fortune, with the eventual result that his property is seized by creditors
                  and he narrowly avoids bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Like Oldbuck’s pursuit of the curiosity, his neighbor’s quixotic pursuit of gold and
                  silver takes the form of an irrational exchange of money for money. While Oldbuck
                  makes himself ridiculous by exchanging good silver for bad copper, Dousterswivel appeals
                  to his victims by promising not only to multiply their money, but to change its kind:
                  "If you join wid Sir Arthur, as he is put in one hundred and fifty—see, here is one
                  fifty in your dirty Fairport banknote—you shall put in one other hundred and fifty
                  in de dirty notes, and you shall have de pure gold and silver, I cannot tell how much!"
                  (<em>Antiquary</em> ch. 23; <em>WN</em> 3: 218). Dousterswivel’s arts will transmute money from mere dirt into something
                  sublime.</p>
               <p>In the Lacanian formula for the sublime, it is an object that has been raised to the
                  dignity of the Thing; that is to say, it is an object that can appear to fill the
                  gap or pay the debt on which the Symbolic order is founded (Lacan 126, 134). In Scott,
                  the promise of such an object always turns out to be a snare: Wardour’s acceptance
                  of the offer to produce pure gold and silver in exchange for paper money leads him
                  to spend his entire fortune and everything he can borrow. His debts are paid in the
                  end with bills of exchange supplied by the novel’s pseudonymous hero Lovel in a resolution
                  that restores the circulation of symbolic as well as monetary debt, since Lovel’s
                  gift is ultimately repaid by his marriage to Wardour’s daughter.</p>
               <p>In the interim, however, Doutserswivel’s diggings in fact prove to contain silver
                  ingots worth £1000. These have "neither inscription nor stamp upon them, excepting
                  one, which seemed to be Spanish" (<em>The Antiquary</em> ch. 23; <em>WN</em> 3: 225). Their origin is a mystery, especially to Dousterswivel, who is deluded by
                  the discovery to believe in his own spells, and ultimately led to become his own greatest
                  dupe. Eventually, the silver turns out to have been left as a gift for the almost-bankrupt
                  Baronet to find. Both the medium of the gift—unstamped silver—and the means of conveying
                  it have been chosen to conceal that its source is Lovel, his daughter’s suitor.</p>
               <p>Lovel’s courtship of Sir Arthur’s daughter Isabella is the novel’s principal narrative
                  thread; he believes himself to be illegitimate, and the bar to his suit is a prejudice
                  against illegitimacy that has been handed down in the Wardour family ever since its
                  founding. The blank surface of the silver ingots he leaves for the baronet both conceals
                  his identity and figures the bastard’s lack of a proper name. But the romance-plot
                  of <em>The Antiquary</em> is oriented towards the discovery at its close that the hero is not illegitimate
                  at all. He was raised as the illegitimate son of Geraldin Neville, in Yorkshire, but
                  discovers that Neville had in fact only adopted and not fathered him. When his adoptive
                  father refused to reveal his real paternity, the son renounced his name and took the
                  fictitious one of Lovel. He inherits the mysterious silver from Neville, who dies
                  in the course of the novel; it had come to Neville as plate from the family of Glenallan,
                  of which Lovel/Neville’s real father is the head. The novel as Scott published it
                  affirms that the blank silver ingots which make it possible for the son to conceal
                  his identity—as Lovel or Neville—had originally been melted down to conceal <em>from him</em> the identity he bears without knowing it as the heir of Glenallan, with whose arms
                  the silver plate would have been stamped.</p>
               <p>The silver ingots at the center of this episode appear to resolve the problem we began
                  with, that of money’s indeterminate identity. Britain in the eighteenth century was
                  nominally on a silver standard; the silver coinage was in such poor condition, however,
                  that legislation of 1774 provided that silver would be legal tender for debts of over
                  £25 only by weight, not by tale (Kindleberger 61). A box of silver ingots would in
                  1794 have been the most exact possible representation of money as such. In this form,
                  money is antithetical to symbolic identity; the blank surface of the silver figures
                  the effaced names of those through whose hands it has passed and the illegibility
                  of its own history.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The effects of Scott’s representation of money as a materialized gap in the Symbolic,
                     however, are not confined within the frame of his novel. The impossibility of accounting
                     for the silver’s appearance in Dousterswivel’s excavations is a problem that the novel
                     shares with its own characters. The sentences from chapter 45 (<em>WN</em> 3: 408-09) that provide the narrative summarized above are, like the novel’s protagonist,
                     of dubious legitimacy. They are uttered by “Lovel” himself, and, as we have seen,
                     they explain that the silver’s ultimate source was his father the Earl of Glenallan.
                     At this point in the novel, however, “Lovel” does not yet <em>know</em> his true descent—that discovery is reserved for the following paragraph. His explanation
                     of the silver’s source thus assumes information he does not yet possess. The novel’s
                     latest editor, David Hewitt, has discovered that this error in its diegesis was introduced
                     into the novel as an authorial revision. Scott originally had “Lovel” explain that
                     he bought the silver from a bank that had recently imported it, and it is this version
                     that Hewitt prints in his 1995 Edinburgh edition. Scott changed the story on the verso
                     of his original manuscript before the relevant passage had been set up in type, though,
                     and it was the revised version that appeared in print, both in the first edition and
                     in each of the two or three subsequent editions that he oversaw.

               <p>Scott’s plot required that the money-hoard uncovered by Dousterswivel should have
                  no legible history. It hence could not have been paper, or even coin. But the Scottish
                  monetary system in the second half of the eighteenth century afforded no very plausible
                  source of specie. Unlike England, where gold and silver were in general circulation
                  owing to a ban on banknotes of less than £5 (Kindleberger 78), in Scotland small denomination
                  banknotes had driven most gold and silver out of circulation. Much of what precious
                  metal did make its way to Scotland was used to pay debts in England, which enjoyed
                  a trade surplus with Scotland throughout the eighteenth century. The effect on Scottish
                  money and banking was notorious: in 1776 Adam Smith estimated the whole Scottish circulation
                  at £2 million, of which no more than a quarter was in gold and silver (1: 316). Scott
                  writes in 1826 of Scotland as a nation that had adopted paper money because it “is
                  too poor to retain a circulating medium of the precious metals” (<em>Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</em> 3: 350).</p>
               <p>The unlikelihood of finding £1000 worth of silver at a rural Scottish bank in 1794
                  seems to have led Scott to revise his original account. Hewitt retains the deleted
                  reading in the name of narrative coherence, but at the cost of introducing an historical
                  and textual anomaly. Needing to represent an embodiment of money whose history is
                  as illegible as its protagonist’s, the novel succeeds too well, and produces one of
                  whose history its own text can provide only defective accounts. The representation
                  of money as such opens an irreducible textual fault.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This fault does not arise from the divided political allegiance of eighteenth-century
                     Scots, but from divided allegiance among Scott’s modern editors with respect to the
                     authority of manuscript and print.

                     </div> The reason for this divided allegiance lies in the social process by which Scott and

               <p>“Mr. Cadell, there is a certain thing called Capital. You should look to that, for
                  these times are bad, and your transactions very large” (Constable 3: 361). Thus the
                  manager of an Edinburgh bank to Robert Cadell, Archibald Constable’s junior partner,
                  in the fall of 1815. Constable had already published the first two Waverley novels
                  and had the third, which was to be <em>The Antiquary</em>, under contract; it was eventually published in May of 1816. Publishing Scott was
                  an expensive business as well as a lucrative one, and, as this rebuff implies, Constable
                  carried it on for the most part with borrowed money. In refusing to extend further
                  credit, Cadell’s interlocutor tells him that the amount of his firm’s transactions
                  with borrowed money is already in disproportion to the small size of its own capital.</p>
               <p>Cadell must have found it a heavy-handed irony to be addressed not as if his firm
                  had too little capital, but as if he had never heard of it. Like other rhetorical
                  figures that sometimes intrude on discussions of money (“Do you think I’m made of
                  money?” “Money doesn’t grow on trees”) however, this one suggests a problem of reference
                  for which its extravagance is a kind of compensation. <em>Is</em> capital a thing? How sure can anyone, even a banker, be of recognizing it when they
                  see it?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Marx’s elementary formula for capital in Vol. 1 of <em>Capital</em>, M-C-M, designates the exchange of money for a commodity that is once more sold as
                     money. For our purposes, the central point of this formula is that it locates the
                     identity of capital in the money form. Though capital may and indeed must repeatedly
                     assume the form of commodities, these commodities’ identity as capital depends upon
                     their eventual retransformation into money. The commodity is capital’s “disguised”
                     mode of existence, while money is its “general” one; capital’s “identity with itself”
                     can be affirmed only by its repeated re-embodiment of itself in money (Marx 255).

               <p>For Marx money is both a commodity, the material product of social labor, and the
                  mediator of other commodities’ value. As capital, however, money is a mediator that
                  appears to mediate itself; at the center of <em>Capital</em> is the critique of this appearance. For Marx the appearance of capital’s self-identity
                  belongs to metaphysics, and he satirizes the way it “differentiates . . . itself from
                  itself” while still remaining the same by comparing it to the theology of the Incarnation,
                  according to which “God the Father differentiates himself as God the Son” (256).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The project of <em>Capital</em> is to dissolve this appearance of capital’s identity. In discussing Scott, we are
                     concerned with an historical moment at which that appearance has scarcely yet been
                     constituted. If money is the medium in which capital identifies itself, Scott wrote
                     at a time and in a place where the money supply was in practice extremely heterogeneous
                     and monetary theory was a hotly debated topic in political economy. As we have seen,
                     in Scotland throughout the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the circulating
                     currency mostly comprised notes of Scottish joint-stock banks and dilapidated token
                     coin. Legal tender coin minted in England was rarely found there. Between 1797 and
                     1817, moreover, all of Britain was in the anomalous position of having <em>no</em> legal tender in circulation. Owing to the exigencies of wartime, the government prohibited
                     the Bank of England from paying out gold and allowed issues of small-denomination
                     bank notes to circulate in its place.

                              its notes in gold. From 1817, the Bank began to mint gold in the form of a new coin
                              with a one-pound face value, the sovereign. Owing to the overissue of notes that Restriction
                              made possible, however, most of the early sovereigns were immediately taken out of
                              the country rather than being used in Britain at a depreciated value. See Clapham
                              2: 63-64.</span></div>
                     </div> Gold and silver rapidly became scarce throughout Britain, but the government decided
                     that they would remain the only legal tender. During this period, adjudicating the
                     value of different representatives of money was an everyday problem for Britons of
                     all classes.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This history provides a backdrop to the specific conditions in which Scott sold his
                  labor in the Waverley novels during the first two decades of the nineteenth century.
                  In a cash-poor economy without capital markets or facilities for long-term lending
                  other than on mortgage, trade was financed by regional or trade-specific networks
                  of short-term credit. When Scott sold his labour he encountered his publishers’ capital
                  as a series of obligations dispersed in networks of this kind.</p>
               <p>The commodity forms in which Scott sold his labour were no more ready to assume a
                  determinate form than the money for which he exchanged them. Until the end of the
                  eighteenth century, authors’ agreements with publishers normally involved the outright
                  sale of copyright for a one-time payment or, in exceptional cases, for other consideration
                  such as an annuity. The transfer of copyright would be embodied in the delivery of
                  fair copy to the press, and, from the point of view of the author, copyright as an
                  abstraction would remain invisible. Scott’s contracts were very different. For all
                  of the Waverley novels, he retained the copyright at the time of first publication
                  and sold only the right to publish editions of a specified size. The copyrights to
                  the first nine of the series were sold to Constable in a separate agreement in 1819;
                  Scott retained his subsequent copyrights until he became insolvent in 1826. Scott’s
                  contracts are thus documents in the historical development of commodity forms in which
                  intellectual labor circulates independently of any particular material embodiment.
                  In his practice, however, this apparent independence is invariably qualified. Scott
                  did not merely license his publishers to print editions of his work; he ensured that
                  the physical books making up the edition would be printed at his press. The mass sale
                  of his copyrights to Constable in 1819 was accompanied by a gift of all the corresponding
                  manuscripts—whose return Scott demanded when in 1826 he sued to recover the copyrights
                  on the grounds that they hadn’t been paid for. The commodity forms involved in these
                  transactions—and indeed the nature of the transactions themselves—prove to be as indeterminate
                  as the money that mediates them.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is my main theoretical claim in this essay that the indeterminate form in which
                     Scott sold the labor embodied in his novels is allegorized in traits of the novels
                     themselves. The most important of these for my purpose is their anonymity.

                     </div> <em>Waverley</em>, the first novel of the series, was published anonymously in 1814; upon its success,
                     the next two were published as by “the Author of <em>Waverley</em>.” Subsequent novels either appeared under this signature, or were presented by “editors”
                     under obviously fictitious names as works deriving from oral or manuscript traditions.
                     Very soon, this kind of elaborate disguise of the author’s identity was recognized
                     as itself a trait of what came to be known as the Waverley novels. Though I am afraid
                     that at this point the analogy will seem fanciful, the identity of the Author of <em>Waverley</em>, like that of capital itself in Marx’s account, becomes an effect of serial self-reference

                  <p>Scott himself seems to have half believed that there was an uncanny connection between
                     the anonymity of his work as a writer of fiction and the historically unprecedented
                     sums he made by it. In writing about his earnings, he tends to describe them as if
                     they had been gained by a deception, or else by magic. Consider the following, published
                     in a retrospect of his career written well after insolvency had forced Scott to give
                     up his incognito. Looking back at his the period of his anonymity, he writes that
                     “in the pen of this nameless romancer, I seemed to possess something like the secret
                     fountain of coined gold and pearls vouchsafed to the traveller of the Eastern Tale
                     " (<em>Chronicles of the Canongate</em>, Introduction; <em>WN</em> 19: 321). One striking point about this figure is that even as Scott in a signed preface
                     acknowledges his identity as author of the Waverley novels, he disavows it, referring
                     in the third person to “the nameless romancer” who held the pen that composed them.
                     Another is that the figure’s identification of the pen and the fountain is founded
                     as much on the fact that they are both secret as on their apparently limitless flow.
                     Taken as a whole, the figure aligns the authorship of the Waverley novels with possession
                     of the money for which they were sold, both the money and the novels being tokens
                     of an identity that is constitutively secret and fated to vanish when revealed.

                  The protagonists of <em>Guy Mannering</em> and <em>The Antiquary</em> cannot sign because they do not know their own names. Waverley knows his all too
                  well; the romance of his life begins when he is separated from it by the theft of
                  his signet ring. Without his knowledge the signet is used to enlist him as a supporter
                  of the 1745 Jacobite uprising—and in so doing, ironically, to constitute for him the
                  true symbolic identity he is destined to assume. In each of these novels, then, Scott
                  works a gambit in which the protagonist’s proper signature is hidden from him and
                  from other characters. In Scott’s subsequent fiction the deception of characters about
                  their own identity is less characteristic than the deception of the reader; it becomes
                  a favorite device of his to introduce a major character under a disguise that is only
                  gradually lifted. Often the character is the monarch or a claimant of the throne,
                  as in the cases of <em>Ivanhoe</em>, <em>Quentin Durward</em>, and <em>Redgauntlet</em>. Even where the reader is in on the secret, Scott’s monarchs are typically as fond
                  of masquerade, concealment, and bluff as the Author of <em>Waverley</em> himself.</p>
               <p>The Waverley novels often represent a narrative of the protagonist’s self-discovery;
                  in these narratives, the protagonist’s proper name and symbolic identity are hidden
                  in the world the novel represents, from which they emerge to view before the close.
                  They are often embodied in a material token, the symbolon, such as Waverley’s signet
                  or Elspeth Mucklebackit’s ring in <em>The Antiquary</em>. From a formal standpoint, such narratives are a guarantee of closure; the novel
                  sets no problems and presents no appearances for which it does not contain the corresponding
                  solution or reality. The material token that the novel represents as guaranteeing
                  the identity of its protagonist thus also figures its identity with itself.</p>

                  <p>Precisely because it recurs from novel to novel, the protagonist’s narrative of self-discovery
                     is a central topic in criticism of Scott’s fiction;

                              Waverley novels the protagonist’s discovery of his destiny, both as an heir and as
                              a lover, involves accession to real estate. The identity-conferring power of this
                              kind of property is distinguished from the effect of conveyables, from too close an
                              association with which Scott “carefully protects” his heroes and heroines at the novels’
                              endings (Welsh 79).</span></div>
                     </div> among the effects of its recurrence is to undermine the closure that it also guarantees.
                     At the opening of <em>The Antiquary</em> the protagonist presents himself to the novel’s title character under the name of
                     Lovel. It emerges however that the name is a disguise which he has been using to conceal
                     the name under which he was raised, that of Neville. Finally, at the novel’s close,
                     the antiquary learns that he himself possesses the information necessary to discover
                     the truth about his friend’s birth, and is able to inform him that his name is no
                     more Neville than it is Lovel, but is rather William Geraldin. In this last reversal
                     the dupe and the subject of knowledge change places with a symmetrical neatness that
                     provides the novel’s final cadence. The effect of closure is however undermined by
                     the traits that <em>The Antiquary</em>’s protagonist shares with those of other novels. These traits liken him for instance
                     to Waverley, to Harry Bertram, to Frank Osbaldistone, and to others from other novels
                     in the series.

                  <p>In some of the paratexts with which Scott increasingly surrounded his novels as the

                     from different novels together in a single scene and even allowing them encounters
                     with the anonymous Author who invented them. The most elaborate such paratext is the
                     introduction to <em>Tales of the Crusaders</em>, published in 1825; it presents itself as the transcript of a meeting between the
                     still-anonymous Author of Waverley and a miscellaneous collection of characters from
                     the novels—or, where this would violate chronology, of their descendants. Present
                     therefore are Jonathan Oldbuck of <em>The Antiquary</em>, Josiah Cargill of <em>St. Ronan’s Well</em>, Lawrence Templeton, the purported editor of <em>Ivanhoe</em>, Captain Clutterbuck of <em>The Monastery</em> and <em>The Fortunes of Nigel</em>, the son of Dandie Dinmont of <em>Guy Mannering</em> and so forth. The introduction’s conceit is that the characters, along with the Author,
                     have produced the Waverley novels already in print collectively, in accordance with
                     “the doctrine so well laid down by the immortal Adam Smith, concerning the division
                     of labour” (<em>Tales of the Crusaders</em>, Introduction; <em>WN</em> 19: 11).

                     property, and a text representing in a single scene characters from divers sources
                     is thus in our own day not only an example of the intertextual citation of character
                     but also of the social circulation of value.

                     </div> For Scott, the assembly of the characters is more ambiguous: they appear as proprietors

                     in a Waverley novel, becomes a part of the property of which he is also the proprietor.
                     The breaching of the novelistic border effected by paratext here generates an incoherence

               <p>To put the point otherwise, I am claiming that the difficulty in the Waverley novels
                  of identifying certain characters, like the difficulty of identifying the author,
                  allegorizes the difficulty of identifying the value form of the novel itself. Like
                  the King, the protagonist, or the author, the Waverley novel too comes hedged about
                  by disguises and proxies in the form of prefaces, frames, and apparent narrative dead
                  ends. Insofar as these formal traits are shared by novels with different historical
                  settings they are anachronisms; in <em>The Antiquary</em> we saw that the anachronism of disputing the monarch’s legitimacy is an explicit
                  theme, conveyed by staging the difference between the Jacobite and Whig positions
                  as a dispute between antiquaries and reducing it to a series of disagreements over
                  the authenticity and value of curiosities.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>These disagreements, however, remain unresolved at the novel’s close. Moreover, the
                     botched or disputed purchase of the curiosity is one of the forms in which it presents <span class="foreign">en travesti</span> the exchange of money for money. This exchange, which Marx was to identify as the
                     elementary form of capital, appears in <em>The Antiquary</em> only as a mistake or a deception. The exchange M-&gt;M in Marx enables an identification;
                     in <em>The Antiquary</em>, quite the contrary, it is structured by difference and masquerade. The novel’s insistence
                     on the problem of relating money to money, indeed on the problem of identifying money,
                     leads me to propose that in its allegorical dimension, as is necessarily the case
                     with allegory, it has more than one point of historical reference. Though the topic
                     of money’s indeterminacy appears in <em>The Antiquary</em>’s representation of 1794 as an after-image of historic struggles that the novel regards
                     as closed, it also falls on it as a shadow of the future in which the novel itself
                     will be written and published.

               <p>For historical and geographical reasons, Scott had a particularly acute experience
                  of the impossibility of fully identifying a capital: of specifying what is and what
                  is not part of it at a given moment, and of symbolizing his own relation to it. Scott’s
                  relations with his publishers were so complex that it is difficult to discover in
                  them the underlying exchange of the product of his labor for money. The formal anonymity
                  under which the novels appeared to the public was maintained, as a more or less transparent
                  fiction, with their various publishers. For the most part Scott communicated with
                  his publishers through the brothers John and James Ballantyne, who in functioning
                  as his literary agents carried on correspondence for him in which he is typically
                  referred by periphrasis, usually as the Author of <em>Waverley</em>. In his communications with his publishers themselves, then, Scott acts by proxy.
                  As his hand is concealed in his negotiations with the publishers, moreover, so it
                  is in the production of the novels themselves, of which the publishers were not shown
                  the original manuscripts. Sometimes they were allowed to read transcriptions by James
                  Ballantyne; more often they were only shown page proofs printed at Ballantyne’s press.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>James Ballantyne’s press was thus the medium in which the work of Scott’s hand was
                     transmuted into the anonymous Authorship of the Waverley novels. It was not, however,
                     only as a producer and seller of fiction that Scott’s identity was hidden by the Ballantynes.
                     Much more closely held than the secret of his authorship was the further secret that
                     Scott himself owned more than half of Ballantyne’s printing office and was in fact
                     the dominant partner.

                              1802, with the assistance of a £500 loan from Scott, leaving the Kelso business in

                     between the payment for the <em>right</em> to print a specified number of copies of a work and the payment for the <em>printed copies themselves</em> is far from explicit. Using the Ballantynes as intermediaries, Scott confronts his
                     publishers at once and—on my reading of the contracts—indistinguishably as the seller
                     of a copyright and as the seller of printed volumes.</p>

                              this form replaced the earlier institution of copy; this was a license to print a
                              given work granted by the Stationers’ Guild and ultimately sustained by state power.
                              The history of intellectual property began with the first copyright statute, passed
                              in 1710; disputes over how the statute was to be applied were however not resolved

                     in which the value of Scott’s labor was realized. No more in Scotland in 1815 than
                     at other times and places could transactions on the scale of Scott’s and Constable’s
                     have conveniently been carried out in cash. David Hewitt estimates Scott’s share of
                     the profits from the first 5000 copies of <em>The Antiquary</em> at about £1682 (364), independent of his share of the profits from the printing-office.
                     In England during the period of the Bank Restriction Act (1797-1821), and in Scotland
                     at any time since the early eighteenth century, the payment of such a sum in legal
                     tender coin would have been almost unthinkable. The actually circulating currency,
                     as we have seen, comprised a regionally variable combination of token silver used
                     as change and of different kinds of locally-issued paper instruments that served as
                     money-substitutes. Legal tender was at this period effectively unavailable throughout
                     Britain, and especially so in Scotland.</p>
               </div>
               <p>For the immediate discharge of debts, therefore, in 1815 Scots used the token silver
                  currency of the Royal Mint in London and banknotes issued by Scots banks. For the
                  purposes of trade, however, which was normally conducted on credit, the usual instrument
                  was the bill of exchange, as it had been throughout Britain for more than a hundred
                  years. A bill of exchange is draft by a creditor on a debtor, made payable to a third
                  party at a specified date and place. Bills of exchange originated as a means of making
                  payments at a distance, but in the eighteenth century they came to be used as a way
                  of extending credit in transactions among producers, merchants, and tradespeople even
                  within a single locality. Bills continue nonetheless to articulate place: a bill on
                  London, for instance, would in Edinburgh carry a premium over one payable locally,
                  owing to the trade imbalance between Scotland and the South.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The bill extended credit by deferring payment: if a retailer bought commodities from
                     a producer, the latter would draw a bill on the former, payable at a date when the
                     commodities could be expected to have sold, enabling the retailer to pay it with the
                     proceeds. Normally, the drawer of the bill, wanting ready money, would take it at
                     once to a bank, which would give cash for it at a discounted rate, taking interest
                     for the time until it fell due. This was broadly the system by which Scott received
                     payment for his fiction. Thus, contracting for <em>The Antiquary</em> in January of 1815 he drew bills dated at six, twelve, and eighteen months on the
                     publishers, Constable and Co. in Edinburgh and Longmans in London. Acting through
                     James Ballantyne, Scott would at once have discounted the bills, thus obtaining—at
                     the cost of some interest—his half of the profits for the first 5000 copies before
                     he even began to write the novel. As <em>The Antiquary</em> was slated for publication in early June, the publishers expected it to be bringing
                     in revenue before they had to pay even the first set of bills—though in the event
                     Scott was more than a year late with it, causing some anxious correspondence between
                     Longmans and Constable.

                  <p>When he sold his fiction, then, Scott encountered a capital whose identity, like his
                     own identity as an author, was mediated and hedged about with substitutes. The capital
                     into which his labor was incorporated could appear to him only in the dispersed form
                     of the bills of exchange that served as its representatives. This form of appearance
                     necessarily obscured from him its borders and indeed its mode of existence as property.
                     The example of <em>The Antiquary</em> has shown us how a publishing house—or any other business—could operate without investing
                     money in an undertaking at the outset. In negotiating for an advance, then, Scott
                     would consider not the actual assets of his publishers, but the ease with which he
                     would be able to discount their bills—a question decided by the general state of their
                     credit, and more specifically by the number of their bills already outstanding and
                     in the hands of the banks. Scott insisted that Longmans be brought in as the London
                     co-publisher of his second novel, <em>Guy Mannering</em>, and then of <em>The Antiquary</em>, precisely because fewer of their bills were in the Edinburgh market than of Constable’s,
                     and he wanted to give Constable’s credit a rest.

                     </div> The market value of a bill thus depended on the state of an entire circulation of
                     bills on which the acceptor’s name appeared. For this reason, it represented a capital
                     only visible in dispersal, having been at no time in the immediate possession of any
                     single individual.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This effect of dispersal was exacerbated by the fact that bills circulated by endorsement.
                  As we have seen, a bill needed not be held until its due date; it could be discounted
                  at a bank, or it could be used by its drawer to make payments in further transactions.
                  In either case, the bill would change hands at a price determined by the time left
                  until it fell due. As it did so, each person through whose hands it passed would endorse
                  it, beginning with the original drawer. Each endorser became liable to pay the bill
                  if the acceptor and earlier endorsers failed to do so. The value of a bill in circulation
                  was thus supported not only by the credit of its original acceptor but also by that
                  of its drawer and very likely by a series of other endorsers.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In taking payment for his fiction by means of bills, therefore, Scott legally made
                     himself liable to pay again the very payment he took. The reason why the hazards of
                     trade were so notorious throughout the eighteenth century, and why book-keeping was
                     so difficult, was that neither the acceptance of a payment nor the discharge of a
                     debt could be considered final until the bill involved had finally been paid by its
                     original acceptor—possibly years after many of the transactions in which it had played
                     a part.

                     </div> In the crash of 1826, many of the debts of Constable that Scott was required to pay
                     were thus debts which had originally been due to him in return for novels promised
                     or actually written.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To be paid by bill was thus for Scott invariably to sign; and since after <em>Waverley</em> itself he always had an advance on his share of the profits, Scott <em>wrote his novels to make sure that the bills he had signed were retired</em>. Scott wrote, in short, <em>to withdraw his signature from circulation</em>. And we recall that in mentioning his signature, we are in fact referring to a hand
                     that was until 1826 concealed behind those of James and John Ballantyne—far more so
                     in entering into bill transactions than it was in producing fiction. The major reason
                     for Scott’s employment of a literary agent and for his secret ownership of a printing
                     works was not to conceal his identity as the Author of <em>Waverley</em>, but to conceal the extent of his potential liability in the bill market and so extend
                     his ability, using his proxies, to discount new bills. Scott increased his liabilities
                     by personal expenditure, but the fundamental cause of his exposure in the bill market
                     and eventual insolvency was the historical necessity that dictated the mode of his
                     payment. The phenomenon of the Waverley novels could not have been financed by a capital
                     embodied in a retail bookselling establishment or in a printing shop, as publishing
                     ordinarily had been hitherto.

                     </div> Constable could not have paid Scott the unprecedented sums he received, nor financed
                     the publication of the novels in the size and variety of editions that he did, without
                     mobilizing bank capital through loans secured by the signatures on his bills.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The means by which Scott was paid for his novels thus make it extraordinarily difficult
                  to say when the sale and purchase of a given novel have been completed. When he is
                  paid with a bill, Scott involves himself, and his proxies, in an indeterminate series
                  of future transactions and obligations; this fact is reflected in the serial character
                  of the novels themselves and the series of mutually supporting signatures that they
                  bear. To put the point otherwise, when Scott accepted payment, he also assumed an
                  obligation. The internal difference in the money form in which he realized the value
                  of his work was the specific form in which he encountered the difference of capital
                  from itself, and it is reflected in the internal self-differentiation of his novels
                  and of the Authorship they embody.</p>

                     annotator, and also as a character and as proprietor. This multiple self-inscription
                     is an extension of the internally differentiated representations of authorship that
                     appeared in the novels and their paratexts from the very outset, which are my topic
                     here.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In one of these representations, the Introductory Epistle to <em>The Fortunes of Nigel</em>, the “eidolon” or image of the Author of <em>Waverley</em> appears—in the act of correcting proof for the very volume in which he is described—at
                  the back of Archibald Constable’s Edinburgh bookshop (<em>WN</em> 14: 8). The author is thus an emanation of the premises where the writer’s product
                  is put into circulation and not of the scene of production itself. The social processes
                  by which Scott’s labor was commodified and circulated were indeed integral to the
                  shaping of the novels and the institution of their authorship. This was as true for
                  the first editions as for any others. Before they were shown to his publishers, Scott’s
                  novels were transcribed and usually set up in print by John and James Ballantyne.
                  During this process they underwent extensive correction and revision. Scott anticipated
                  and relied on this work, which was part of the authoring of the novels.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>By far and away the most fully documented and carefully edited version of Scott’s
                     fiction ever to appear is the recently completed Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley
                     Novels (EEWN). Though this edition will be invaluable to future scholarship on Scott,
                     as it has been to my own, the texts it establishes must be used with some caution,
                     as its editorial procedures do not take sufficient account of the novels’ social origin.
                     The general editor states that the EEWN aims to produce an “ideal text” of the novels’
                     first editions (Hewitt xv),

                     As we have seen, however, this process was irreducibly social. No more than any of
                     their successors were the first editions of the Waverley novels the sole product of
                     the historical Sir Walter Scott; yet the EEWN announces that integral to its project
                     is “a return to the authentic Scott ” (Hewitt xii), to be achieved by stripping away
                     from the first edition texts “mistakes” introduced there by those whom the editors
                     characterize as “intermediaries”—James Ballantyne and other copyists, compositors,
                     and copyeditors.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The result is a series of texts that are fundamentally unhistorical. Neither a version
                  of the first editions, in whose production Scott’s collaboration with the so-called
                  intermediaries played an essential part, nor a presentation of Scott’s manuscripts,
                  the Edinburgh edition of the novels too often corresponds to no historically specifiable
                  state of the texts.</p>
               <p>The anomalies introduced into the novels by this editorial practice are in several
                  cases substantial and thematically significant. I will give a summary account of three
                  examples:</p>
               <p>1) Since Lockhart’s biography in 1838 it has been known that Scott was persuaded by
                  James Ballantyne to alter the last chapter of <em>St. Ronan’s Well</em> after the novel had been set up in type. At issue was a revelation in the <span class="foreign">dénouement</span> that the hero and the heroine had been lovers before she was tricked into a feigned
                  wedding with someone else. Ballantyne objected to the supposed indecency; after protesting,
                  Scott acquiesced and altered the passage in which the revelation occurs. The censored
                  version was the one published in the first and every subsequent edition; Mark Weinstein,
                  the editor of the Edinburgh edition, however prints the text of the original proof
                  (363-64, 403-04). By so doing he may arguably recover a more “authentic” Scott than
                  the one who actually approved the other version—but he produces a text that effaces
                  an important effect of the novel’s social production.</p>
               <p>2) As in <em>St. Ronan’s Well</em>, a textual crux in <em>The Antiquary</em> arises from Scott’s revision during the production process of the first edition.
                  In this case—which I have discussed at more length above—there is no evidence of pressure
                  from any of the “intermediaries.” Rather, Scott altered the <span class="foreign">dénouement</span> of the novel he had originally written to another that he apparently preferred. It
                  was the revised text that appeared in every edition of <em>The Antiquary</em> he published. Unfortunately, in making the revision, Scott introduced an anomaly
                  into the sequence of events that he narrates, making an effect precede its cause.
                  On the grounds of narrative coherence, therefore, the novel’s editor, David Hewitt,
                  who is also the EEWN General Editor, has restored Scott’s first version from the manuscript.
                  There is no question here of restoring the work of an authentic Scott that has been
                  obscured by other hands; Hewitt’s decision aims rather to correct what appears to
                  him a mistake of Scott’s own—a mistake, moreover, that exists only if the novel is
                  judged by standards of narrative coherence for which there is every evidence Scott
                  cared very little.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>3) Most egregious is the case of <em>The Bride of Lammermoor</em>. The dating of this novel’s action has long been a matter of dispute;

                     </div> in every edition Scott published there are indications that point to dates in the
                     eighteenth century both before and after the crucial year of 1707, when the Act of
                     Union ended Scotland’s existence as an independent kingdom. The historical events
                     on which Scott based his story, moreover, belong in the seventeenth century, and traces
                     of this setting also made their way into the novel. The editor of <em>The Bride</em> for EEWN, J. H. Alexander, follows Jane Millgate in the view that the action of the
                     novel in its first edition can best be dated just before the Act, between 1702 and
                     1707. This dating is perhaps more plausible than any other; nonetheless, it requires
                     a distinctly tendentious editorial note explaining away passages that seem to refer
                     to a date after the union (Alexander 333-35). Worse yet, to prevent the date from
                     slipping the other way, to before 1702 when Queen Anne ascended the English throne,
                     it requires the explaining away of several references to the reigning monarch as male
                     and in one passage the outright emendation of the word “King” to read “Queen” instead
                     (Alexander 209, 334 and 337n. 9). Alexander makes this emendation <em>without warrant from any prior printed or manuscript version of the text</em>.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In so doing, Alexander effaces the historical fact of a mistake or inconsistency and
                  deprives the text of its status as an historical artifact. The appeal to the authority
                  of the “authentic Scott” has here been stripped of any historical content whatsoever
                  and has become the pure means of imposing an arbitrary formal coherence on his novel.</p>
               <p>Recent interest in the cultures of collecting and antiquarianism has also brought
                  the novel new attention. Lee 90-101 gives a particularly full account of the practices
                  of antiquarianism in late eighteenth-century Britain and of their embeddedness in
                  the institutions of the marketplace and consequent conflict with an organic or Burkean
                  historicism. A contrasting argument that sees the novel as countering charges of unmanliness
                  leveled against Burke in the 1790’s appears in Goode. Ferris discusses the contrast
                  between the enlightened historian and the antiquary in Romantic-era discourse, with

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">For much of the twentieth century criticism of the Waverley novels had their place
               in the history of realism as its dominant topic; the facetiousness of <em>The Antiquary</em>’s representation of history made it for this criticism a marginal title in the series.
               Duncan’s treatment of the work results from his stated aim of taking seriously the
               fictional character of Scott’s novels. The novel’s stress on the unreliability of
               antiquarian narratives has led other critics to adopt it as a key text in readings
               of Scott as a novelist whose realism is strongly qualified by skepticism and a belief
               in the contingency of representations of the past; see Elam and McCracken-Flesher.
               The novel has also attracted interest as one of several among the Waverley novels
               in which the claim of historical realism coexists more or less uneasily with an adoption
               of the conventions of gothic; see Robertson.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">For a bravura return to Lukàcs as an interpreter of Scott in an essay that, unlike
               Lukàcs himself, deals at length with <em>The Antiquary</em>, see Maxwell. Regarding the “emptiness” of history in the Waverley novels, of which
               the non-events of <em>The Antiquary</em> provide the essay’s paradigm, see Maxwell 444 and 455.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">See the argument that antiquarianism’s “family resemblance to commerce” makes it the
               “negation” of traditionalism in Lee 78-79.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Alexander Welsh treats Scott’s protagonists as types of a particular historical formation
               of masculinity in relation to landed property in his <em>The Hero of the Waverley Novels</em>. More recently, Ian Duncan has read the characters of the Waverley novels as types
               of contrasting narrative genres and discursive modes, whose dialectical engagement
               the novel stages through their interaction—see Duncan <em>Modern Romance and Transformations of the Novel</em>. Among critical works on Scott for which character is not a crucial analytic category,
               I should note readings of the Waverley novels’ construction of authorship in Ferris
               and Wilt. As I shall do in this essay, Wilt argues that there is a homology between
               the quest romance structure of the Waverley novels and their production of authorship
               as self-concealment.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Ochiltree’s Scots vernacular refers to money as either “siller” or “gowd.” He distinguishes
               regularly between the two, refusing gifts of gold as excessive, and begging only for
               silver. In this respect, as in others, the novel is meticulous in its registration
               of the heterogeneity of the circulating currency in late eighteenth-century Scotland.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">From 1797 to 1821 the Bank Restriction Act forbade the Bank of England from redeeming
               its notes in gold. From 1817, the Bank began to mint gold in the form of a new coin
               with a one-pound face value, the sovereign. Owing to the overissue of notes that Restriction
               made possible, however, most of the early sovereigns were immediately taken out of
               the country rather than being used in Britain at a depreciated value. See Clapham
               2: 63-64.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Scott’s money and his incognito really did vanish together; as he faced insolvency
               in late 1825, he knew that one of the consequences would be his exposure as the Author
               of Waverley. Hence his complaint in his <em>Journal</em>: “the wand of the Unknown is shivered in his grasp. He must henceforth be termed
               the Too well known” (Scott <em>Journal</em> 40). Here too for Scott the magic of authorship is the magic of money, and both of
               them disappear when they are exposed to view.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">For Alexander Welsh this narrative is a “romance of property.” He argues that in the
               Waverley novels the protagonist’s discovery of his destiny, both as an heir and as
               a lover, involves accession to real estate. The identity-conferring power of this
               kind of property is distinguished from the effect of conveyables, from too close an
               association with which Scott “carefully protects” his heroes and heroines at the novels’
               endings (Welsh 79).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               1800 Ballantyne was the owner of a thriving print-shop and a newspaper there; at that
               date Scott proposed to him that he should set up shop in Edinburgh. This he did in
               1802, with the assistance of a £500 loan from Scott, leaving the Kelso business in
               the hands of his brother Sandy. In 1805 Scott increased his investment in the firm
               to £2008, becoming half-owner (Johnson 233). The partnership continued until the crash
               of 1826, with the exception of the years 1816-22, during which Scott assumed sole
               ownership of the firm, while Ballantyne continued to manage it at a salary of £400
               a year (Johnson 516, 764). Constable certainly knew that in dealing with the Ballantynes
               he was effectively dealing with Scott. On the other hand, in 1826 Scott was obliged
               to reveal his dealings to his own lawyer, who affirms that he had no idea that Scott
               was involved in the printing firm (Gibson 4-5). See also the discussion of this controversial
               aspect of Scott’s business dealings in Sutherland 97-98.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">See Rose 67-112 for an account of the eighteenth-century emergence of copyright as
               a form of abstract intellectual property created by an author’s labor. Copyright in
               this form replaced the earlier institution of copy; this was a license to print a
               given work granted by the Stationers’ Guild and ultimately sustained by state power.
               The history of intellectual property began with the first copyright statute, passed
               in 1710; disputes over how the statute was to be applied were however not resolved
               until the House of Lords’ verdict in Donaldson v. Becket in 1774. It was in the legal
               and philosophical debates over copyright during this period that the idea of the author
               as producer of an abstract intellectual property distinct from any of its material
               embodiments entered British jurisprudence and publishing practice. For another account
               of Donaldson v. Becket as a decisive moment for the whole subsequent history of intellectual
               property, see St. Clair 111-21. For a theory of the “commodity-text” as the form of
               abstract intellectual property that emerged in the period 1710-74 and an account of
               its difference from the “commodity-book,” see Feltes 7-8.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
