                  <p>My essay takes its title, “Field of History, Field of Battle,” not to assert that
                     the field of history is somehow embattled, but rather to question the reflex that
                     brings forward the metaphor of field, writes one field next to the other, so that
                     when given a field, we imagine a battle,—or when presented with history, we conjure
                     warfare. It happens often and in complicated ways. The reflex includes two motions:
                     the first locates history spatially as a field, a terrain to be observed and surveyed;
                     the second converts that terrain into battleground, to be won or lost through violent
                     contestation. The motions seem hardly inevitable: surely many fields—magnetic fields,
                     fields of dreams, strawberry fields—do not lead to warfare. But I will argue that
                     especially in wartime (and indeed in a historiography that dates itself as “wartime”
                     or even “post-war”) history-as-field inclines fatally to the battlefield. The metaphorics
                     involved slide along a scale from far to near, at one end detached and analogical,
                     at the other end nearly reaching identification. The double motion involved in recourse
                     to this metaphor—terrain to be surveyed, site of contestation—itself complicates matters
                     of distance and proximity. Here for instance is Thomas Babington Macauley, writing
                     in 1828, defining the duty of a historian: it is “[t]o make the past present, to bring
                     the distant near, to place us in the society of a great man on an eminence.” Up to
                     this point Macauley’s prescription sounds familiar enough as it makes nearness its
                     goal. Yet he continues: “to place us in the society of a great man on an eminence <em>who overlooks the field of a mighty battle</em>” (Macauley I: 310).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Macauley’s other examples climb down from this height, until we are “seated at the
                              table” with “our ancestors” and “rummag[ing] through their old-fashioned wardrobes”
                              (I: 308). Warfare thus posed a sticking point, an obstacle, to the practice of sympathetic
                              insight (Verstehen) which, as Mark Salber Phillips argues, “came to be understood
                              as the central feature of historical understanding” (Phillips 347).</span></div>
                     </div> Macauley’s image of proximity keeps its distance from the ugliness of battle per se,
                     the metaphor of field securing more elevated and unifying impressions.</p>
               </div>
               <p>So my title finds these two terms, field of history, field of battle, close to each
                  other with a shared metaphor yet without a mediating conjunction, in order to open
                  up the question: what relationship, if any, governs these two terms? The essay will
                  press this metaphor and the accompanying questions of distance and proximity by situating
                  their use first in the aftermath of war, in post-war writing, and then within wartime.
                  In seeing the persistent war that governs much historical thinking, it brings together
                  influential concepts of history from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century—a
                  period of far-flung wars of European imperialism and expansion—with those of the late
                  twentieth century. Precisely as “post-war” suggests a certain vantage upon and distance
                  from a finite scene of war (a discernible field of study), “wartime” is where present
                  history and the history of the present find it difficult to pull away from or “overlook”
                  the inchoate scene of war. Indeed, my concluding example, a wartime consideration
                  of historiography, will move down from Macauley’s eminence and measure history no
                  longer by the metaphor of field but by the fallen human body, found in extreme proximity
                  to the field of battle. </p>
               <p>In locating the field of history in relationship to the time of war, I take instruction
                  from Macauley’s predecessors, British writers of the Romantic period. For them a governing
                  question was how to tell of war given the mode of historiography they had inherited:
                  one that aspired to write the gradual improvement of society and civilization, the
                  progress of morals and mind—the historical mode inherited, in other words, from the
                  Scottish Enlightenment. In a paradigmatic statement about recent “improvements” in
                  the art of History, Hugh Blair in his well-known <em>Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</em> (published 1783; delivered in 1759-60), asserts, <span class="quote">‘It is now understood that it is the business of an able Historian to exhibit manners,
                     as well as facts and events; and assuredly, whatever displays the state and life of
                     mankind, in different periods, and illustrates the progress of the human mind, is
                     more useful and interesting than the detail of sieges and battles (288; qtd. in Phillips
                     44). ’</span> For Blair, an influential professor at the University of Edinburgh and avowed admirer
                  of David Hume’s innovative <em>History of England</em>, history kept its distance from battle. Hume, for instance, claimed a dispassionate
                  distance, and to have “neglected present power, interest and authority, and the cry
                  of popular prejudices” in depicting the wars and factionalism that had led to the
                  formation of the current United Kingdom. He had examined the Protestant Succession,
                  for instance, “as coolly and impartially as if I were removed a thousand Years from
                  the present Period” (qtd. in Phillips 35, 36n.). Such a deliberately postwar historiographical
                  style aimed, among other things, to free its readers from the claims of that earlier
                  violence. The thought was, as Mark Salber Phillips points out, that through such a
                  history <span class="quote">‘the conflicts of the previous century could finally be left behind, because they
                     [could be shown to have] resulted in a new order of government as well as, more comprehensively,
                     in accompanying changes in manners and opinions. The new order [would be written not
                     as] . . . the work of any single party, but . . . as an indirect consequence of the
                     irregular . . . politics of [past] times (Phillips 36).’</span> In writing an account that transcended factional feeling, the Enlightenment historian
                  could help produce a history of a nation itself transcending the violence of faction.
                  The England (or Britain) of this new order and changed manners would be free to contemplate
                  what Robert Henry, another Scottish historian of the period, dubbed “the more permanent
                  and peaceful scenes of social life” (qtd. in Phillips 4). This form of cultural history
                  deliberately situated itself apart from warfare and factional strife, in more convivial
                  environs.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>By the end of the eighteenth century, however, faced with the incontrovertible fact
                     of world-wide war and the repetitive and increasing impact of war throughout the century
                     of Enlightenment, such an improved history began to look like wishful thinking. Even
                     while responding to the sociable and even anti-military conceptualizations of history
                     offered by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers such as Blair, Hume and Adam Smith, Romantic
                     authors had to ponder in wartime the field of history. Writers such as Walter Scott
                     and Anna Barbauld were crucial in formulating still-current protocols of cultural
                     history and historicism in particular. Both suggest that it is primarily not approximation—not
                     “bringing the distant near”—but rather distance in space and time that enables the
                     field of history to take itself as a field of battle. Brought too close to the fighting,
                     the field of history, especially the field of cultural history, threatens to lose
                     definition and disappear. The focus on culture as a “field” which organizes and situates
                     history as a comprehensive practice is, as we will see, a product of the late eighteenth
                     and early nineteenth-century; yet its use discloses something which, at the very moment
                     of its emergence, displays its vulnerability.

               <h2><span class="head">Looking Backward, Looking Forward</span></h2>
               <p>To give this Romantic metaphor of field its proper scope and currency, it helps to
                  look both before and after the nineteenth century, and I will do this by turning to
                  two twentieth-century postwar theorists of history, Michel Foucault and Reinhart Koselleck,
                  each writing a generation after world war about the modern field of history, and each
                  locating that field in the eighteenth century, also in the aftermath of war. The problematic
                  of distance from or nearness to the field of war reveals itself in these crucial thinkers
                  as the problematic underlying our own contemporary understanding of history. </p>
               <p>In his lectures of 1975-78, Foucault turns for inspiration to Karl von Clausewitz,
                  the great military theorist of the Napoleonic period, in order to propose warfare
                  as the model through which to understand the infinitesimal workings of power in daily
                  life. In perhaps his most provocative extension of this idea, Foucault argues that
                  history itself is and ought to be engaged in war. In his lecture of February 26, 1976,
                  history not only “decipher[s] the war and the struggle that is going on within the
                  institutions of right and peace”; history also participates in that war (Foucault
                  171). Foucault attributes this formulation of history (he will go on to call it historicism)
                  to the French nobility of the eighteenth-century. Defeated by an absolutist monarchy
                  and its armies, these early historicists direct the energies of that defeat into a
                  historiography devoted to undermining and de-legitimating the powers that be. From
                  this unlikely source Foucault takes up historicism in a late twentieth-century call
                  to arms: <span class="quote">‘This. . . is our first task. We must try to be historicists, or in other words, try
                     to analyze the perpetual and unavoidable relationship between the war that is recounted
                     by history, and the history that is traversed by the war it is recounting (173-4).
                     ’</span> The war, in other words, is not over or past; it “traverses” the very field of historiography.
                  It is hard to overestimate the influence of this imperative, where war becomes the
                  transcendent term (perpetual and unavoidable) arching over but also grounding the
                  work of historicism. For Foucault in the 70’s, war is the general idea of history:
                  “No matter how far back it goes, historical knowledge never finds nature, truth, order
                  or peace. However far back it goes, historical knowledge discovers only an unending
                  war” (172). By implication, however far forward it goes into the future, historical
                  knowledge will only discover—and promote—unending war.</p>
               <p>The temptation here is to take Foucault’s language as figural. This war is merely
                  metaphorical: no lives are lost in its prosecution, no states rise or fall. Foucault
                  nevertheless wants to push his martial metaphors as close as he can to the literal,
                  to insist we allow for the possibility that the writing of history may cost lives,
                  and that states do win or lose legitimacy on the basis of this writing. He famously
                  inverts Clausewitz’s dictum: “Politics,” Foucault insists, “is the continuation of
                  war by other means”; and by “politics” he designates a full array of the discourses
                  of power (165). Rather than suggest an analogy (what war does in one way, politics
                  does in another) it announces that the work of war proceeds into, infiltrates, the
                  work of politics—and therefore, for Foucault, infiltrates the work of history. The
                  eighteenth-century French historian Boulainvilliers, whom Foucault takes as exemplary,
                  <span class="quote">‘makes the relationship of war part of every social relationship, subdivided into
                     a thousand different channels, and reveals war to be a sort of permanent state that
                     exists between groups, fronts and tactical units as they in some sense civilize one
                     another, come into conflict with one another, or . . . form alliances. There are no
                     more multiple and stable great masses, but there is a multiple war. . . . It is obviously
                     not a war of every man against every man in the abstract and—I think—unreal sense
                     in which Hobbes spoke. . . . With Boulainvilliers, by contrast, we have a generalized
                     war that permeates the entire social body and the entire history of the social body.
                     . . . one in which groups fight groups. (162)’</span> Foucault brings war as close as he can to history; he wants it to permeate history
                  so that we understand history as the continuation of warfare in one more field, transferred
                  but not essentially altered.</p>
               <p>And yet, even as the passage moves toward full equation—not “abstract,” not “unreal,”
                  but real war—it falters: war is “sort of” a permanent state; the “tactical units”
                  of this state “in some sense” engage in the activities of war. War becomes, as Foucault
                  says repeatedly, “generalized”: “in some sense” everywhere. In fact, war itself must
                  be transformed into an analytic category, an intellection, if it is to pervade history
                  in the way Foucault’s historicism demands. War becomes the “grid of intelligibility”
                  we have inherited; “war is basically [again a slight hitch in the equation] historical
                  discourse’s truth-matrix” (164, 165). As grid or matrix, it helps map out a field,
                  History, but a field one finds difficult to imagine being trampled or blood-stained
                  or strewn with bodies. The only visible body on this field turns out to be the generalizable
                  “social body.”</p>
               <p>How quiet by contrast the account of “the concept of history” offered by the German
                  Koselleck, also writing in the mid-1970s. Like Foucault, Koselleck is interested in
                  situating modernity, and what distinguishes our modernity is its “concept of history,”
                  emergent “sometime between 1750 and 1850” when “European society began to think and
                  act as if it existed in history,” identifying itself with and by its “historicity”(White
                  x). Historicism in this case attends to “a social mode of being in the world marked
                  by a particular experience of temporality”; that is, of social reality undergoing
                  structural change (White xi). The historicism that takes such multi-layered change
                  as its “great theme,” according to Koselleck, is “the history of the vanquished,”
                  its great methodological and theoretical innovations introduced, as we have already
                  seen, by the historians of the Scottish Enlightenment in the wake of Scotland’s defeat
                  and absorption into Great Britain (Koselleck 80). Whereas for Foucault the losers
                  bequeath to modern history an extension of warfare, an on-going battle focused on
                  usurpations, invasions and bloodshed, in Koselleck’s account the vanquished appear
                  to turn away from military contest altogether. Not war but larger and more abstract
                  forces determine history. So, instead of armies and generals, “the social and economic
                  <span class="hi">situation</span> decides whether someone is left behind or thrust forward” (80; emphasis added). We
                  may need to be reminded that he is talking about Scotland in the eighteenth not Germany
                  in the twentieth century, but the larger point is clear: historicism in this instance
                  understands itself moving beyond and past the failed operations of warfare to a more
                  detached perspective, to, for instance, the “social and economic.” Yet—and here is
                  Koselleck’s great insight—in moving past the battlefield to this higher level of abstraction,
                  historicism also moves away from experience per se.</p>
               <p>Precisely because they have lost, because they have suffered history as an “unintended
                  experience,” the vanquished are adept in developing historiographical methods that,
                  in the case of the Scottish Enlightenment, enable the move to a detached view of “structural,
                  long-term change” (80). Method, as Koselleck elaborates his account, serves as an
                  alternative to experience, especially an experience of suffering, because methods
                  “can be abstracted from the unique event; they can be applied elsewhere” (83). Historicist
                  methods allow the transposition of loss into a form of knowledge where it remains,
                  or at least this is the hope, “accessible beyond all change of experience”—unassailable
                  (83). For Koselleck, historicism substitutes method and knowledge for the experience—often
                  quite intimate—of war and its aftermath. In this way he understands Foucault’s “grid”
                  or “historical discourse’s truth-matrix” not as another version of war but as a means
                  of stepping outside of the suffering exacted by war. An unassailable method, the historicism
                  developed by Scottish historians “might offer some comfort, perhaps a gain,” he suggests.
                  But he ends more ruefully: “In practice, it would mean saving us from the victors.
                  Yet every experience speaks against it” (83).</p>
               <p>Does the history of the vanquished, with its method and “production of theory that
                  became an imperative of method” offer a viable alternative to war (81)? You have to
                  read to the very end of Koselleck’s rigorous forty-page essay on “Transformations
                  of Experience and Methodological Change” to arrive at the pathos of his project. Tonally
                  his considerations could not be more different from Foucault’s and yet both tell us
                  perhaps what a self-consciously post-war generation must: war is either history’s
                  matrix or the experience that history wants to transcend; it is history’s internal
                  or external limit. “History cannot get away from war,” writes Foucault, “quite simply
                  because war itself supports this knowledge, runs through this knowledge and determines
                  this knowledge” (173). Koselleck might sigh and say, “History has to try to get away
                  from war, get off the battlefield to produce some other possibility for knowledge,”
                  even as he admits that all “experience speaks against it.”</p>
               <p>The postwar thoughts of Foucault and Koselleck form a sort of resonating chamber for
                  our contemporary thinking about historicism. Here war, history, knowledge and experience
                  jostle and reverberate. As we carry such thinking into our contemporary wartime, we
                  must wonder what it means to dwell within such a chamber, or indeed if the walls of
                  the chamber will hold.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">In the Field</span></h2>
               <p>Another version of historicism has been given more recently by James Chandler, whose
                  1998 book, <em>England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism</em> also locates the origins of historicism and cultural history in the writings of the
                  Scottish Enlightenment. Chandler’s characterization of historicism seems to side-step
                  the question of war to focus instead on the development of systems of dating and periodization.
                  But 1819 is markedly a postwar year, and barely so; its proximity to fields of battle
                  threatens to disrupt these very procedures of dating and periodization, and open up
                  its own echo chamber. We will return to that side-stepping and those echoes in a moment.</p>
               <p>Chandler meditates at length on the value of the “dating system” for the study of
                  culture, even as he provides a powerful history and critique of the historicism emerging
                  in Britain in the early nineteenth century. “What the dating system adds,” he suggests,
                  “is a second order code, a method of <span class="hi">translation</span> from one textually constituted culture/character into another (Chandler 151, emphasis
                  added). This second order code, developed as a characteristic of Romantic-era writing,
                  derived in part from Scottish Enlightenment historiography. As a method of translation
                  between different “states,” it makes possible both ethnography and historicism; it
                  serves as a method for marking—and therefore comparing, coordinating and unifying—differences
                  across the borders of time and geography (95).</p>
               <p>Thus for Walter Scott, the most obvious literary practitioner of historicism, “calendrical
                  chronology functions as the medium in which different time-in-temporalities can be
                  merged into a yet-higher-order calculus: a historian’s code” (132). The uneven rates
                  of development between, say, Scottish and English culture, or between Saxon and Norman
                  culture, can be specified and made visible. The idea of culture as an object of study
                  requires such a code and with it the assumption that “operations of changing times
                  and changing places are mutually defined” (132-3; see also 161). By locating his early
                  novels at the borders of Scottish and English cultures, Scott could thus delineate
                  such operations. In this way movement across a geographical border could send you
                  into a different temporal state, to a culture “behind” or “advanced” according to
                  some universal chronological measure. </p>
               <p>Like the writers he studies, Chandler lays particular emphasis on the term “state,”
                  not allowing us to forget the resonance between cultural states and geopolitical entities
                  with cultures to be defined but also defended, promulgated or potentially exterminated.
                  The historian’s code then, as it coordinates heterogeneous temporalities into a system
                  of calendrical dating, as it “translates” between “states,” claims for itself a <span class="hi">diplomatic</span> function, smoothing over inter-state differences or tensions so that, as Chandler
                  says, their “operations . . . are mutually defined.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Scott himself, in the 1819 Dedicatory Epistle to <em>Ivanhoe</em> which lays out his methods, defines the area of cultural translation as an “extensive
                     neutral ground”—and his terminology implies that in the absence of this neutral ground,
                     past and present, there and here would confront each other on contested ground, the
                     ground of battle (Scott 9).

                              of historical fiction. Chandler, in his analysis of Templeton’s epistle in England
                              in 1819, adds, “This metaphor of the neutral ground between the ancient and the modern
                              presides over the rest of Scott’s analysis” (141).</span></div>
                     </div> Translation on neutral ground thus involves a search for what Scott calls, in an echo
                     of Hugh Blair, “manners and sentiments” held in common, “principles of our common
                     nature,” in order to offset “indifference,” incomprehension, or (and he leaves this
                     possibility unstated) hostility (9). Edging Scott’s own meditations on historiography
                     and the study of cultures, and leaking into Chandler’s as well, are reminders of states
                     not easily accommodated by diplomatic translation, and of cultures under threat.

                  <p>The focus on culture as a “field” which organizes and situates historical (and ethnographic)
                     practice, and which Chandler, following Raymond Williams, understands as a product
                     of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century, has this darker and more destructive
                     aspect: the field of battle. The problem surfaces primarily in the metaphors of “ground”
                     and “field” which Chandler borrows from Scott and which serve as the spatial correlatives
                     of historical “periods” or “ages.” Though these are metaphors common enough in the
                     study of culture, in the self-reflexive practices of Romantic historiography, in terms
                     like “neutral ground,” they betray an awareness of forces otherwise poised to overthrow
                     “states” and the cultures they support. The Dedicatory Epistle itself seems to question
                     the ideal of neutral or common ground. Scott’s metaphor for historical-cultural translation
                     recalls—maybe to repair—an earlier, unsettling moment in the Dedicatory Epistle which
                     situates itself on the battlefield. There Lawrence Templeton, the English antiquarian
                     serving as the fictional author of the Epistle, is straining to justify the work of
                     the historical novelist, and he turns first not to neutral ground but to the gore-stained

                     he wrote, “I wanted to speak with the dead” and likened himself to a “conjuror” (Greenblatt
                     1).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Certainly the primary purpose of this passage is to differentiate the “time” of the
                  Scottish historical novelist—witch or warlock—from that of the English antiquarian,
                  not only by placing the Scots closer to the scene of violence (the visceral as opposed
                  to the dusty “field” of historical research) but also by assigning them to different
                  cultural systems: that of Lucan’s <em>On Civil War</em>, a verse history of the wars between Pompey and Caesar in the first century BCE;
                  as opposed to the even more distant Book of Joel from the ancient Hebrew scriptures.
                  The comparison of fields adds philosophical complexity as well to Chandler’s larger
                  point about historicist dating procedures. “Templeton’s point, though couched in the
                  macabre details of military carnage, might be said to depend on a familiar Rousseauistic
                  paradox about civil society: that we must be forced to be free.” By this reckoning
                  the Scottish novelist working on the recent past is like the witch “free to be forced”
                  to choose her subject, while the English writer, trying to locate a similar “state”
                  is “free to be unconstrained in his selection” (Chandler 169). The emphasis on social
                  contract theory, though, does not sit easily with the macabre details of military
                  carnage: Lucan is not depicting the operations of civil society but its breakdown
                  in civil war. Warfare complicates (though the verb seems feeble) the field or ground
                  of “translation” (from one state to another) that supports Templeton’s dating system;
                  it complicates as well the issues of “force” and “freedom” involved.</p>

                     characters and social and economic movements are lost in the impersonal remains of
                     the carnage. By grounding Scott’s previous novels in this bloody terrain, moreover,
                     Templeton reminds his audience, if inadvertently, of the fragility of any construction
                     of the “state.” The passage he glosses from Lucan, where Pompey’s son asks the Thessalonian
                     witch Erichtho to work her magic in the near aftermath of battle, culminates a series
                     of scenes in Book VI of <em>On Civil War</em>, which are keenly attuned to the problem of ground in time of war. In one early passage
                     Lucan describes extensive fortifications erected by Caesar to encircle his enemy,
                     then questions why "[s]uch an army of busy hands” could not have been set to work
                     building bridges or canals, work analogous to Scott’s cultural translation on “extensive
                     neutral ground.” Why not, he asks, build viaducts that would change “for the better
                     some other region of earth?” Instead, Lucan laments, by the work of these hands <span class="quote">‘[t]he field of war was now contracted <em>[</em> <em>Coit area belli]</em>; here is preserved the blood that will flow hereafter over every land; here the victims
                        of Thessaly and the victims of Africa [two future battles] are penned up; the madness
                        of civil war seethes within narrow lists." (VI: lines 54-63, p. 309)’</span> For Lucan, war contracts time and space into a tight, seething circle, a vortex of
                     tenses (“was now,” “is preserved,” “will . . . hereafter”) and locations (western
                     Italy, Thessalonia, Libya). The blood of future dead in far-flung places is held in
                     the grasp of this one far-from-neutral field; not translation but drastic reduction
                     is at work. Repeatedly Lucan reminds his reader that the whole world, “every land”
                     is present, forced onto this one particular field.

                              see Lucan, VI: 305-13, 327; 481-82, 339; and 819-20, 365. .Especially notable is the
                              dead prophet’s comment that the “furious civil war’ in Rome has spilled over into
                              the netherworld (VI: 780-81, 361),</span></div>
                     </div> The freedom to be forced, upon which civil society bases itself, narrows drastically
                     in time of war; freedom itself contracts along with time and space. In <em>On Civil War</em>, the field of battle collapses the possibility of other, different places or times
                     as they are all forced into this tight, bloody spot which is also “the whole world.”
                     In Lucan, that is, the totalizing power of war re-defines the ground or field, scrambling
                     the historian’s code.</p>
               </div>
               <p>It is perhaps then not remarkable that Templeton neglects one detail built into the
                  story of Lucan’s witch. When she asks the newly-dead corpse to “give events their
                  names, their places; and provide a voice,” Erictho is <span class="hi">not</span> asking, as a historian might, in order to establish the ground of past events. She
                  wants to know the future spawned by this slaughter (VI: ll. 774-775, p. 361). The
                  utterance emerging from the field of battle, this unsettled ground, tells of the coming
                  fall of the Roman republic. Fittingly, as if the fall of that state takes with it
                  the historian’s code, the prophetic utterance of the fallen warrior (which closes
                  Book VI) further erases distinctions between different places and times in what might
                  be called a trans-historical instability. In the end, the dead man announces, “the
                  battle of the rivals [will] settle nothing but their place of burial” (VI: lines 811-12,
                  p. 365). Prophecy intrudes upon history and finds that the only “state” is the unsettled
                  state of the battlefield; its only settled ground a burial ground.</p>
               <p>The question of settlement—the settlement that became Julius Caesar’s imperium, the
                  settlement wrought by Culloden or Waterloo—haunts Scott’s Dedicatory Epistle, no less
                  in the field of Jehoshophat than the field of civil war. Again, Templeton appears
                  to alter the significance of the field, in this case the valley of Jehoshophat, taken
                  from the book of the prophet Joel. He makes it the site of a remote past. In scripture,
                  however, Jehosophat represents the site of the future: it is the “valley of decision”
                  yet-to-be—not the dusty cemetery of battles past. In Joel’s account, here God will
                  “gather all nations” and proclaim to them the famous words: <span class="quote">‘prepare warre, wake up the mightie men, let all the men of warre drawe neere, let
                     them come up. Beat your plowe shares into swords, and your pruning hookes into speares.
                     (<em>King James Bible</em>, 1611; Joel 3: 14, 2, 9-10)’</span> In the valley of Jehoshaphat, God promises to assemble and sit in judgment upon “the
                  gentiles,” “the heathens,” the nations that have injured his people. “[A]nd the heavens
                  and the earth shall shake,” the prophet tells us (Joel 3: 16). Jumpin’ Jehosaphat,
                  in other words, is the ground of some final, apocalyptic overturning, after which
                  “Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom will be a desolate wilderness. . . . But Judah
                  shall be for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation” (Joel 3: 19-20). On
                  the Day of Decision, in the valley of Jehoshaphat, only one state survives: this field
                  reduces “all nations” to one.</p>
               <p>Even as he marks out the “extensive neutral ground” of cultural translation, even
                  as he theorizes a “higher-order calculus” that will allow for comparative analyses
                  of different states, settling them in their moment in chronological time, Scott’s
                  Templeton ventures onto terrain that will not remain past or settled. Despite his
                  insistence that the historical novelist charts “<em>la vie privee </em>of our forefathers<em>” </em>Templeton–like Scott—begins his research on the ground of what we would now call state-sponsored
                  violence where, as Hannah Arendt has explained, an “all-pervading uncertainty,” an
                  insurmountable “arbitrariness” holds sway (Arendt 4-5). In war and through war, chronology
                  is subject to upsetting forces, blasting open its orderly sequencing and synchronies.
                  The Northern Warlock plies his trade on the battlefield of Pharsalia, in Thessaly;
                  the southern, English antiquarian in Jehoshaphat, the borderland between Israel and
                  Judea: some fields merge even as others are eliminated. In the process, the British
                  state leans dangerously close to identification with the up-coming fall of the Roman
                  republic, the historian picks about the bones of the yet-to-be dead in the earth-shaking
                  valley of judgment in the Mid-east. Civil war and the apocalypse of totalizing empire
                  form the horizon of Templeton’s world picture.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Though Templeton does not admit it, Scott knows that the ground had shifted (again),
                     the battlefield had recently come to England. In August of 1819, while he was writing <em>Ivanhoe</em>, British citizens peaceably assembling to press for Parliamentary reform were massacred
                     by government troops at St. Peter’s Field, an event christened Peterloo. The very
                     name, echoing Waterloo, suggests a dislocation in time and space, as if the recent
                     wars with Napoleon had to end again and in a new, less distant place; as if history
                     had not moved on from that earlier settlement, but would repeat itself and move closer.

                  on the battlefield are not asked to speak for what has passed, but for the possibility
                  of a future (state): whether or not there will remain any fields outside the battlefield.

                  <p>Romantic wartime emerges from this problematic relationship between historicism and

                     of war at a distance—the object of geographical and chronological mapping—in order
                     to delineate that “extensive neutral ground” which becomes the field of cultural history.
                     On the other hand, Romantic wartime attends to the totalizing impulse of warfare,
                     acknowledged even as early as Lucan’s <em>De Bello Civile</em>, which refuses to honor historical and geographical distinctions, so that this war
                     or that war are subsumed under something called War; remote causes satisfy present
                     hatreds; and all the world is condensed into one field of battle.

                     of historical representation.

               <p>Anna Letitia Barbauld’s unfinished “Dialogue in the Shades” written in 1813 offers
                  a singular answer to this question. Faced with the slaughter bench of on-going war,
                  Barbauld puts aside the historian’s code of dating, searching for history’s scale
                  and tempo instead in the fragile, impermanent form of the individual human body. Even
                  more explicitly than Scott’s, Barbauld’s work situates this body and the wars it suffers
                  within the emergent “field” of modern historicism, where historical practice finds
                  it difficult to differentiate its field from the battlefield.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Barbauld wrote her prose “Dialogue in the Shades” in the shadow of war and the aftermath
                     of the critical firestorm that erupted around her anti-war poem, “Eighteen Hundred
                     and Eleven.” As the title of that poem indicates, Barbauld was concerned there with
                     locating the state of England in the higher-order calculus of dated, universal history
                     and this meant removing it from the mortality of the human body (the poem ends with
                     an ethereal “Genius” or “Spirit” traversing the globe). This process allows the sort
                     of cultural translation advocated by Scott’s Templeton, and advocated as well in Barbauld’s
                     essay, “On the Uses of History,” a text which, along with “Eighteen-Hundred and Eleven,”
                     serve as touchstones in Chandler’s account (Chandler 115-19).

                     </div> Like the poem, “On the Uses of History” understands the mutual implication of geography
                     and chronology in the study of History (they are “the two eyes of History”). In the
                     way these linked texts theorize history, the turn to universal or what Barbauld calls
                     “general” as opposed to “relative” history aims for a point of view outside and above
                     the human body. By contrast the relative or “natural” mode of telling time derives
                     from an individual’s present position and from memory: “in more familiar life [we
                     resort] to this natural kind of chronology—The year before I was married,—when Harry,
                     who is now five years old, was born,—the winter of the hard frost” (Barbauld 151).
                     But this way of telling history (and for Barbauld it looks gendered and belongs, as
                     her examples suggest, “to the annals of domestic life”) cannot survive “personal recollection”
                     because it lives within a mortal creature. Even were such accounts recorded in writing,
                     in a temporally coherent narrative, one would still want to know when the “natural”
                     historian lived and died (151). To separate History from this mortal, embodied perspective,
                     there must be some impersonal, “common measure” or “medium” for ordering events: one
                     must “place them with respect to the history of other times and nations.” “General”—as
                     opposed to “natural”—chronology, Barbauld maintains, “fixes every event to its precise
                     point in the chart of universal time” (152). In other words, general chronology, as
                     practiced in “Eighteen Hundred and Eleven” and explained in “On the Uses of History,”
                     can perform translations between nations and times because, like Hegel’s “general
                     idea,” it does not suffer death.

               <p>The prose “Dialogue in the Shades” follows “On the Uses of History” and reverses its
                  tack, bringing us back to the field of battle: it recognizes the demands placed by
                  the mortal body upon History, even as History aims to transcend it. (This seems the
                  place to mention that “Dialogue” was not published until 1825, well after the settlement
                  of the Treaty of Versailles, and after Barbauld’s death). In it Clio, the classical
                  embodiment of History, but embodied in immortal form, complains to Mercury, the messenger
                  of the gods, that she cannot possibly keep up with the accelerated flow of bodies
                  pouring into the afterlife. <span class="quote">‘“I have had more business for these last twenty years than I have often had for two
                     centuries; and if I had, as old Homer says, ‘a throat of brass and adamantine lungs,’
                     I could never get through it. . . . my roll is so full, and I have so many applications
                     which cannot in decency be refused, that I see no other way than striking off some
                     hundreds of names to make room . . .” (Barbauld, “Dialogue” 464) ’</span> Clio’s surprisingly bureaucratic sense of the change in History’s tempo (so much
                  business, so many applications!) generates its own version of uneven development.
                  Global war here functions as History’s accelerator, but also its principle of economy.
                  Although elsewhere Barbauld adopts universal history as a means of measuring and coordinating
                  different rates of development, here it poses as a system of limits, a restricted
                  ground, within which something has to give. In the dialogue that follows, the muse
                  of History searches for ways to “make room” for new names and new stories, threatening
                  in the process to blot out the record of warriors and heroes from the ancient past.
                  The ancients, she insists, “have been remembered long enough” (468). Modern war demands
                  History’s revision.</p>
               <p>In some ways Barbauld’s “Dialogue” may appear a simple rehearsal of a long-familiar
                  narrative of supercession, the old giving way to the new. Yet while characterizing
                  the impressive features of the modern moment, Barbauld does not quite offer a vision
                  of progress (a departure from her goal in “Eighteen-Hundred and Eleven”). Indeed,
                  she suggests a homology between the work of modern history and the destructiveness
                  of modern war, both feeding off the “taking of lives.” The increased scale and speed
                  of the modern era (“[N]ow I am required to be in a hundred places at once” . . . “in
                  all parts of the globe at once,” moans Clio) have indeed necessitated Clio’s streamlining
                  of her art (470). But the stronger factor is modernity’s lethal power. Thanks to the
                  enormity of deaths in the Napoleonic wars, History has had to take up a grim science
                  of accounting: <span class="quote">‘“Here am I expected to calculate how may hundred thousands of rational beings cut
                     one another’s throats at Austerlitz, and to take the tale of two hundred and thirteen

                     if this work of destruction goes on much longer.” (471-2)’</span> Barbauld suggests the Malthusian pressures that the on-going wars place not simply
                  upon the future, but also upon the past and the future of the past. Mercury in fact
                  invokes Malthus, “a great philosopher,” in order to placate Clio. For if “twenty or
                  forty thousand men could not be persuaded every now and then to stand and be shot
                  at,” then, by Malthusian “calculation,” “we should all be forced to eat each other”
                  (473). Like Malthus, Clio has her eyes trained on universal scarcity and the vulnerability
                  of the human body, but where he looks forward she looks back; where he fears the force
                  of procreation, she reveals the destructiveness of the battlefield. Modern technologies
                  of warfare take “the human frame, of curious texture,” to “wound. . . lacerate . .
                  . and mutilate [it] with most perverted ingenuity” (472). By this reckoning, History,
                  like futurity, is forced to play a zero-sum game.</p>
               <p>Not surprisingly, the muse of History must reconfigure her sense of time in the grip
                  of this modern war. In the figure of History’s scroll, “long enough to stretch from
                  earth to heaven” but grown “quite cumbrous,” Barbauld finds a handy way to give space
                  and weight to the past. Yet in the age of print, History must economize: what had
                  been written “all in capitals” and illuminated in gold must be squeezed into “<em>small pica</em>” type (470). In this newly economic, measured version of the past, History’s—and
                  war’s—expansion into “all parts of the world” requires conversely a reduction, even
                  miniaturization in print. Immortal Clio insists therefore on regarding humanity’s
                  past according to the temporality of the mortal body: History—at least this modern
                  history confronting her—unfolds in the span of a lifetime. “It takes a life, as mortals
                  reckon lives, to unroll it [her scroll]” (464). History in 1813, in the opening of
                  a new front in North America, in the wake of Napoleon’s costly campaign in Russia,
                  unfailingly “takes a life.” To a certain degree, Clio restates Templeton’s comparison
                  of recent and historically distant fields of battle: the ancient “shades” who talk
                  to her are told they must make room on her rolls for fresher corpses. Rather than
                  offering comparisons and translations, though, the “Dialogue” perversely mirrors a
                  field of battle where there is not room enough for both the warlock’s and the antiquarian’s
                  dead; one army or the other must give way.</p>
               <p>In her neoclassical “Dialogue” on modern history, Barbauld twists and transforms the
                  emergent concept of a history measured by numbers—the numbers of chronological time,
                  the years and dates so crucial to historicist understanding. For the mythical Clio,
                  the more pressing numbers to be reckoned are statistics taken from the battlefield,
                  the integers of destruction. Though forced to distinguish between the ancient and
                  the modern, to expunge one to make way for the other, Clio nevertheless reminds Mercury—the
                  god of news and wealth—that in the end she measures history not by the abstract markers
                  of moments or periods, nor by conceptual fields, but by the force exerted to curtail
                  the life of one human body. For her, modern global wartime demands this recognition
                  of fatal economies. </p>
               <p>In Barbauld’s “Dialogue in the Shades” and Scott’s “Dedicatory Epistle” the practice
                  of historicism in wartime is subject to uncanny, untimely forces. The clear lines
                  that would plot the past in a determinable sequence are subject to vectors that pull
                  in several different directions. When the “expansive neutral ground” that organizes
                  Scott’s project of translating between different states finds itself too close to
                  the battlefield, it simultaneously expands into the whole world and all of history
                  <em>and</em> contracts into one disastrous moment. By turning to Lucan and Joel, Scott’s Templeton
                  wants to situate various historical practices and hence various cultures in their
                  proper moment, but his efforts are undermined both by the totalizing violence of the
                  battlefield and by its affiliation with prophecy, rather than history. Barbauld, for
                  her part, steps outside of human time to “place” the work of modern history. She,
                  like Lucan, feels war contracting the scope of history, even as it expands the number
                  of the dead: human mortality now governs the work of History. If History is a field,
                  then Barbauld understands it as a field of blood-stained scarcity, measured in the
                  final instance by countless dead bodies.</p>
               <p>But of course I have strayed onto these fields during our own time of war and have
                  solicited my examples accordingly. Or have they solicited me? I have lost, I fear,
                  the proper mediating distance.</p>

               table” with “our ancestors” and “rummag[ing] through their old-fashioned wardrobes”
               (I: 308). Warfare thus posed a sticking point, an obstacle, to the practice of sympathetic
               insight (<em>Verstehen</em>) which, as Mark Salber Phillips argues, “came to be understood as the central feature
               of historical understanding” (Phillips 347).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               subject to speak, or is it a “moment or stage” from that past for which we hope to
               piece together a representation (Chandler 169)? Is the field to be understood diachronically
               or synchronically? Scott complicates the matter further by offering two examples of
               what it means to “speak for.” In one example, the fallen body (a body, we might add,
               with lungs and other body parts intact) “hails you, as it were, asking to be the representative”;
               in the other “the body has to be composed, or recomposed” out of scattered, neglected
               bones (170). Dominick LaCapra repeats a similar conundrum about historical representation,
               when he describes the historian’s “conversational” exchange with the dead as fundamentally
               uncanny, given that the exchange takes place via a dialogue pieced together “through
               their [the dead’s] textualized remainders” (LaCapra 36).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
