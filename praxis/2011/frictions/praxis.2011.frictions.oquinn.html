                  <p>What difference does a critical awareness of imperial history make for the study of
                     British Romanticism? Material that was formerly the domain of anthropologists, art
                     historians, archaeologists, military historians and historians of empire has become
                     an important archive both for re-thinking canonical texts and for re-imagining the
                     social and cultural dynamics of Georgian society. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> Important critical studies have laid the groundwork for expanding scholars’ sense
                     of the ways in which Romantic discourse was thoroughly permeated by global geopolitical
                     concerns.

                              for a sense of the range of work in this area.</span></div>
                     </div> We can read the editorial consensus among recent anthologies of British Romanticism,
                     all of which contain subsections on anti-slavery and orientalism, as a symptomatic
                     recognition of the importance of these materials. That said, there are also few surprises
                     here. Earlier scholars such as David Erdman established beyond question the importance
                     of imperial problematics to Blake’s work, and there are many other similar examples.
                     What remains constant is a recognition that the period conventionally associated with
                     Romantic discourse saw crucial transformations in imperial governance and colonial
                     discourse. And yet there has been a remarkable containment of this recognition by
                     relegating this scholarship into sub-fields. Scholars who work on British India are
                     well aware of this predicament, for in spite of widespread recognition of the importance
                     of developments on the Indian subcontinent to British society in the late eighteenth
                     and early nineteenth centuries, important work on Romantic interculturalism, on the
                     emergence of proto-anthropological disciplines, on models of racialization, on global
                     economics and other topics remains either the domain of a few scholars bridging the
                     divide between literary studies and history or it remains largely unexplored. A similar
                     problem exists for scholars of trans-Atlantic Romanticism whose work has the potential
                     to undermine the recalcitrant division of literary studies into the study of national
                     literatures.</p>
               </div>
               <p>My concern here is not simply one of disciplinary exclusion—although that is an important
                  issue—or of expanding the field of enquiry yet again. The question with which I opened
                  this essay does not pertain simply to questions of “context” or of “canon”. The issue
                  I want to address here is how increasing awareness of the global flow of people, commodities,
                  and cultural products impinges on how we analyze Romantic culture. Obviously, I cannot
                  provide an exhaustive answer to such a question in an essay. What I will do instead
                  is offer a set of linked examples of the kind of analysis that might begin to give
                  a sense of the potential afforded by allowing knowledge of imperial history to permeate
                  close reading and vice versa. I use the word permeation advisedly, because beyond
                  demonstrating how historical context enables cultural analysis, I also show how close
                  reading itself does historical work, and thus cannot be separated from some world
                  beyond the text.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the process, I am going to make at least two grand claims, hardly new, but which
                     inform everything which follows. The first concerns the unabated prosecution of war
                     throughout the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As Mary Favret has
                     persuasively argued, Romantic literature is a wartime literature, and from the Seven
                     Years War onward Britain’s wars were global affairs. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)

                              “War in the Air”

                     </div> The second follows from the first and has to do with chronology. The more that one
                     reads the imperial archive, the more it becomes clear that consideration of the emergence
                     and practice of what we call Romanticism needs to start with the loss of the American
                     colonies. In my opinion, the preponderance of scholarship on the French Revolution
                     is one of the decisive critical obstacles to a genealogical analysis of the relationship
                     between Romanticism and empire because it so frequently re-inscribes the nation as
                     the primary political entity. This is not to say that this scholarship is invalid
                     or wrong-headed, but rather that it radically limits the historical purview of cultural
                     analysis.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Historians as differently motivated as J.G.A. Pocock and Dror Wahrman have argued
                     that something fundamental happens to British culture and society during the American
                     crisis. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> Pocock’s influential account of the political crisis in the Atlantic traces the problem
                     of imperial governance back to two key problems: the lack of any coherent theory of
                     confederation in British political thought and the troubling duality of the term “imperium”.
                     As he states, <span class="quote">‘the primary meaning in English of “empire” or <span class="foreign">imperium</span> had been “national sovereignty”: the “empire” of England over itself, of the crown
                        over England in the church as well as state, the independence of the English church-state
                        from all other modes of sovereignty.(257)’</span> Empire in this sense denoted sovereignty of the British realm over itself. This primary
                     meaning came crashing into another meaning of empire following “the momentous if transitory
                     establishment of an English-speaking universal empire in the North Atlantic and Alleghanian
                     America” following the Seven Years War. Instabilities in the governance of this extensive
                     empire undermined triumphalist rhetoric from an early stage and thus analysis of the
                     colonial challenge to imperial rule looked back to earlier moments of instability
                     in the realm. The recent experience of the historical trauma of civil war and the
                     hard won sense of stability following the Glorious Revolution and the quelling of
                     the Jacobite rebellion inflected all of the responses to the American crisis. “Englishmen
                     could see that the American programme entailed the separation of crown from parliament,
                     threatening the unity of ‘empire’ which was the only guarantee against civil war and
                     dissolution of government, those deep and still bleeding wounds in their historical
                     memory”.

                     </div> This history proved to be decisive for Britain, because it meant that “the heart of
                     the American problem for Britain was less the maintenance of imperial control than
                     the preservation of essentially English institutions which the claims of empire were
                     calling into question”.

                     </div> As Pocock demonstrates, American secession allowed for the maintenance of “colony”
                     as a constitutive outside for British sovereignty because America acceded to the condition
                     of a state. Thus one of the crucial adjustments in the era following the American
                     war was a redefinition of coloniality itself such that colonial governance was carried
                     out not by legislatures, but rather by governors, “often military men, [who] directly
                     exercised their sovereign’s authority, representing him in his personal, imperial
                     and parliamentary character” (Pocock 301). This new imperial regime stabilized both
                     the notion of King-in-Parliament, and the global economic networks which it governed.</p>

                  <p>Losses in America in the early 1780s are inextricably bound up with reverses in India
                     during the same period. As Linda Colley has reminded us, news of Haider Ali’s victory
                     over the British at Pollilur in 1780 arrived in London in 1781 and provoked ‘universal
                     consternation’ in part because the news coincided with reports of the fall of Yorktown.(270)
                     To commentators in the American colonies, in Britain and in India at this time, the
                     East India Company’s hold over territory in India empire seemed in equal jeopardy.
                     Like the first war with Mysore in 1767-9, the Second Mysore War ended inconclusively
                     in 1784, and it cost the East India Company a great deal both in resources and confidence.
                     According to a British medical officer stationed in Calcutta at the time, <span class="quote">‘There appears to be nothing wanting but an European enemy to act in concert with the
                        country powers, to hurl destruction among the company’s possessions in that part of

                     of renewed French intervention in India, but also replicated the trajectory of the
                     American campaign, in which the French played a decisive role from 1778 onward. Metropolitan
                     anxiety about these defeats was at its height throughout the 1780s, and when the Third
                     Mysore War commenced in 1790 both the newspapers and the print satirists predicted
                     further humiliation of the British forces. Cornwallis defeated Tipu in the Third Mysore
                     War and the elaborate settlement which ensued from his victory at Seringapatam played
                     a crucial part in the shift from anxiety to triumphalism in the 1790s.</p>

                  <p>In contrast to Stephen Conway’s influential argument that the experience of the American
                     conflict did not alter British attitudes to war and empire (315), this essay contends
                     that the transit from the early 1780s to the early 1790s involved extremely complex
                     shifts in British subjectification—i.e. the processes through which subjects make
                     themselves accountable to normative discourses which in turn recognise and make them
                     visible—and that these shifts are perceptible in the cultural field.

                     </div> This essay looks at two seemingly unconnected texts—William Hodges’s <em>Travels in India During the Years 1780, 1781, 1782 and 1783</em> (1793) and William Cowper’s 
                     “Yardley Oak”
                      (ca. 1791)—to explore not only how changes in imperial governance can be traced in
                     the formal and aesthetic elements being analyzed, but also how close reading of these
                     formal elements can elucidate the historical dynamics of global empire. In both cases,
                     I argue that the works themselves act as conduits from the early 1780s to the early
                     1790s, from one revolutionary situation to another, and thus need to be considered
                     in light of this transit through historical time. Specifically, I will be looking
                     at the emblematic representation of trees as metaphors for governance in order to
                     show how each reconfigures the relationship between men and things in a way that cancels
                     the memory of past imperial reverses. Lurking in the centre of the essay is brief
                     reading of another notable tree, Burke’s famous oak from the <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>, in order to show how the figural exchange between empire and nation can productively
                     engage with extant scholarship on the 1790s. In my readings of Hodges, Burke and Cowper,
                     these botanical figures become surrogative in Joseph Roach’s sense of the term in
                     that they overwrite a historical wound in order to allow an enabling supplemental
                     fantasy to gain traction in a time of national and imperial crisis (2). As prosthetic
                     devices to overcome the loss of the American colonies, Hodges’s deployment of the
                     Banyan tree, and Cowper’s re-orientation of the oak metaphor allow us to see what
                     kind of cultural work was needed to reconfigure imperial subjectivity at this transitional
                     juncture.</p>

                  <p>William Hodges’s <em>Travels in India</em> is a text literally structured by war. Hodges’s journey and his narrative are repeatedly
                     interrupted by armed conflict between the forces of the East India Company and resistant
                     native powers across the subcontinent. The first chapter records the humiliating loss
                     at Pollilur in the Second Mysore War which not only raised questions regarding Warren
                     Hastings’s bellicosity, but also haunted representations of British rule in India
                     until the final defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1799. Later chapters are closely intertwined
                     with the East India Company’s response to Chait Singh’s rebellion and many of the
                     most famous images—the picturesque rendering of hill fortresses at Bidjegur and Gwalior—have
                     an integral relation to siege operations carried out while Hodges was traveling with
                     Hastings’s retinue.

                     disjunctions instantiated by these earlier conflicts destabilize Hodges’s explicit
                     argument that British governance in the region is not only benevolent, but also reminiscent
                     of prior examples of enlightened Moslem rule.

                     The text’s strategies of exemplification, negation and obfuscation intervene not only
                     in the rhetorical assault on Warren Hastings, but also in the attemp to justify British
                     rule during the Cornwallis era. What I wish to demonstrate, through the close reading
                     of compositional adjacency and metonymic contiguity in one image and one fragment
                     of text, is how Hodges’s rendering of the banyan tree coalesces with larger historical
                     and political developments which transformed not only British rule in the Asian subcontinent,
                     but also the very notion of empire itself.</p>

                     of the Company’s humiliating defeat at Pollilur? It is important to recognize the
                     chain of associations invoked by this material. The loss at Pollilur resulted in the
                     captivity and enslavement of numerous British soldiers. As Kate Teltscher and Linda
                     Colley have demonstrated, accounts of their forced conversion and circumcision were
                     widely circulated throughout the 1780s, and they generated significant anxiety regarding
                     the blurring of lines between Mysorean and British identities.

                     </div> Describing his time in Madras, Hodges presents the conflict with Hyder Ali as an interruption
                     in artistic and commercial production: <span class="quote">‘I prepared eagerly for a tour through the country; but my route was scarcely fixed,
                        when I was interrupted by the great scourge of human nature, the great enemy of the
                        arts, war, which, with horrors perhaps unknown to the civilized regions of Europe,
                        descended like a torrent over the whole face of the country, driving the peaceful
                        husbandman from his plow, and the manufacturer from his loom. (5)’</span> This image of the manufacturer separated from his loom is extremely important not
                     only because there is an implicit comparison between his inactivity and the inactivity
                     of the artist, but also because this trope becomes a lynch-pin in Hodges’s later account
                     of the banyan tree. At this point in the text, the populace is starving and the reader
                     is starved for images. This passage is followed by an extended and detailed account
                     of the British reversals and by the introduction of the volume’s first plate—a view
                     of the great pagoda at Tanjore, which Hodges emphasizes was worked up from “an accurate
                     drawing from Mr. Topping.”

                     to plein air landscape painting but rather with its repudiation by historical events.
                     Chapter 1 therefore is about military and aesthetic failure. And it is about surrogation:
                     here is something else in lieu of what I could not give you. This is important because
                     Chapter 2 opens with a turning away from this problematic: Hodges removes to Bengal,
                     comes more directly under the patronage of Hastings and undertakes the journey towards
                     Benares and Agra which became the basis of much of his representation of India.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>From the period immediately prior to the passing of the Regulating Act to the East
                     India Company Charter Act, the governance of the East India Company generated significant
                     controversy regarding the appropriate form and quality of colonial rule. Michel Foucault,
                     in his essay 
                     “Governmentality,”
                      defined “Government as the right disposition of things,” and his notion of disposition
                     is useful here, because it draws attention to how power is distributed by the very
                     selection and arrangement of populations, commodities and flows. Hodges’s text engages
                     with this problematic by presenting figures of the right disposition of men and things.
                     The absence of women in this phrase is intended because it lies at the core not only
                     of Hodges image of the banyan tree, but also in key developments in colonial discourse
                     in the early 1790s. Harriet Guest’s recent reading of the deployment of femininity
                     in Hodges’s narrative argues that the “great distinction” between Indian and European
                     society is negotiated by the ascription of femininity to Indian peoples, places and
                     things (2007, 28-32). Within the chain of images engraved for the <em>Travels</em>, the banyan tree image is caught in the tangle of gendered fantasies which inflected
                     much of the European and specifically British account of imperial rule. It is preceded
                     by a Mughal painting of a Zenanah (24) and followed by a highly sentimental image
                     of 
                     “Mahommedan Women attending the Tombs of their Parents, Relatives, or Friends at Night”
                      (28). Two of the next three images focus specifically on Hindu women: first, an image
                     of mother and child (30) and then the famous stele-like image of the 
                     “Procession of a Hindoo woman to sacrifice on the funeral pile”
                      (84). At the risk of simplifying this chain of images, I would suggest that the banyan
                     tree is ensconced in a series of proto-ethnographic images which focus almost exclusively
                     on the lives of women. The subjects here are not incidental for they are connected
                     to precisely the social and religious practices most frequently remarked upon by European
                     travelers—the sequestration of women, marital constancy and suttee—as signs either
                     of Moslem despotism or Hindu fanaticism/superstition. And each in their own way argues
                     against prior visualizations of these elements of Indian sociability. The Zenanah
                     image hands over representational agency to an unnamed Mughal artist, thereby squelching
                     any imputation of voyeurism. The mourning image figures it as a scene of exemplary
                     sensibility; and the suttee scene is rendered as a scene of horrified yet erotically
                     charged observation.

               <p>In this image the viewer is placed beneath the canopy of the tree as a witness to
                  what Picart and Tavernier before him refer to as idolatrous practices. The key issue
                  here is one of metonymic adjacency: the tree takes on monstrous qualities because
                  it is adjacent to the superstitious practices of the fakirs. That metonymic relation
                  is the ground on which a much more complex metaphorical relationship is built. The
                  tree’s excessive extension and the confusion between parent and child trees are equated
                  with the excessive practices of the fakirs. That excess has specifically non-normative
                  sexual connotations because in the groups of figures we have women consorting with
                  naked fakirs.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>That monstrous excess is figured forth by the face on the tree’s trunk, which occupies
                     the centre of the composition, and which is framed by the central temple. Picart’s
                     adjoining text identifies that face: <span class="quote">‘You may see, says he [Tavernier], about the Borders of Surat, under a spacious Tree
                        where the Banians resort, several Pagods, consecrated to their Idols. The Pagod that
                        leans against the Body of the Tree is dedicated to <span class="foreign">Mamaniva</span>, whose formidable Head may be discerned in the Middle of the hollow Trunk. Hither
                        resort several Votaries, who prostrate themselves before this monstrous Idol, and
                        a Bramin collects at the same time their Free-will offerings, which consist of Rice,
                        Millet, &amp;c. Whoever comes to offer up their Supplications before this Pagod of <span class="foreign">Mamaniva</span>, are marked on the Forehead with Vermillion, with which they beautify and adorn their
                        Idol. Honoured with this Mark, their Votaries imagine no evil Spirit can have the
                        least prevailing Power over them. (7-8)’</span> Mamaniva is a corruption of Mahadevi the great mother goddess of Hinduism, therefore
                     both the metonymical and metaphorical correlations of the image conspire to represent
                     Hindu religion, and by extension, its practitioners, as a monstrous mother which reproduces
                     either autonomously or with its own children. In this light, the framing function
                     of the central pagod gains a certain eloquence because it effectively envaginates
                     the face. The hyper-maternalization of the scene effectively evacuates the father

               <p>Hodges’s rendering of the banyan tree effectively interrupts the entire network of
                  associations mobilized by Picart and performs a complex series of displacements. Again
                  the key lies in compositional adjacency, in the disposition of the image’s component
                  elements. A metonymic relation is built between the two shaded figures and the tree.
                  In contrast to the Picart image, the two figures are unloading the boat on the extreme
                  left so the tree is adjacent, not to fanaticism, but to idealized labour and prosperity.
                  This specifically contrasts with the Bramin from Picart’s text who ostensibly profits
                  from the “superstition” of the votaries. This substitution of one kind of accumulation
                  for another is crucial to Hodges’s textual description of the banyan tree: <span class="quote">‘I proceeded from Sultungunge to Bauglepoor, where my pursuits were promoted with
                     a degree of liberality that peculiarly marked the mind of the gentleman [Augustus
                     Cleveland] who then governed this district; and of whom, in common gratitude, I must
                     ever speak with veneration and esteem. At the entrance of the town of Bauglepoor,
                     I made a drawing of a banyan tree, of which a plate is annexed. This is one of those
                     curious productions of nature which cannot fail to excite the attention of the traveller.
                     The branches of this tree having shoots depending from them, and taking root, again
                     produce, and become the parents of others. These trees, in many instances, cover such
                     an extent of ground, that hundreds of people may take shelter under one of them from
                     the scorching rays of the sun. The care that was taken in the government, and the
                     minute attention to the happiness of the people, rendered this district, at this time,
                     (1781) a perfect paradise. It was not uncommon to see the manufacturer at his loom,
                     in the cool shade, attended by his friend softening his labour by the tender strains
                     of music. There are to be met with in India many old pictures representing similar
                     subjects, in the happy times of the Mogul government. (27)’</span> In the text, the tree offers shade and sustenance to all who come under its canopy
                  and it is figuratively linked to Augustus Cleveland’s, and by extension Hastings’s,
                  management of the region. Its vitality and, above all, its naturalness accrue to the
                  governmentality of the East India Company, and thus it ostensibly stands as a figure
                  of prosperity, hope and stability in a time of war and economic uncertainty.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The text achieves this rhetorical sleight of hand through the careful management of
                     adjacent sentences and figures. The first sentence indicates that it is Cleveland
                     who not only governs the district, but also fosters Hodges’s artistic production.
                     This has a kind of inaugural effect because Hodges ostensibly made no art in Madras
                     during the campaign against Mysore. This frames the next four sentences which specifically
                     address the banyan tree. The final three sentences of the paragraph then suddenly
                     cut back to the framing issue by speaking directly about good governance. If we break
                     the paragraph into these three, the gap between the internal description of the tree
                     and the framing remarks on governmentality become immediately conspicuous. It is literally
                     the paratactic adjacency of the frame to the internal description that allows the
                     tree to figure for good government. And each of the sentences of this internal unit
                     is notable for how it re-writes prior descriptions of the banyan tree. By describing
                     the tree as a natural curiosity which “cannot fail to excite the attention of the
                     traveller”, Hodges invokes the long line of travel narratives and quasi-scientific
                     accounts of Asia, which includes Tavernier, Picart and Fenning. However, the subsequent
                     sentence performs a key divagation from these prior discourses when it refuses to
                     refer to the tree as a mother and when it rigorously separates the child-like dependent
                     shoots from the newly rooted “parents of others”. This effectively counters not only
                     the feminization of the tree, and hence its connection to Mamaniva in Picart, but
                     also replaces non-normative sexuality with a carefully managed sphere of reproduction
                     where parents and children are never confused.

                              closure effected in Hodges’s representation of the banyan tree. As we will see later
                              in this essay, Milton’s deployment of the banyan tree is important to Cowper’s rendering

                     sentence picks up on the tree’s ability to shade “hundreds of people”, but does not
                     refer to this group as a regiment as in Fenning. This erases the military in favour
                     of a subject people and thus erases both native insurgency and British military activity

               <p>The final three sentences of the paragraph play out the implications of Hodges’s re-writing
                  of prior discourses on the banyan tree with an uncompromising logic. When we jump
                  the gap from the fifth to the six sentence, Cleveland’s good governance has generated
                  a paradise on earth. In light of the prior evacuation of the tree’s metonymic and
                  metaphorical connections to Mahadevi, this declaration seems to imply that Cleveland,
                  and by extension, the East India Company, operate as a benevolent God who, rather
                  than inculcating fanaticism and non-productivity, fosters both commercial and artistic
                  production. This helps explain why the religious elements of Picart’s image are invoked
                  but visually contained in both the church-like building in the background and the
                  walking figure in the foreground.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The face of Mamaniva is doubly displaced, and I would argue that this doubling poses
                     a series of complex problems. The architectural element in the background still occupies
                     the precise centre of the composition, but it no longer frames the trunk and if anything
                     its tiny church-like spire replaces the envaginated female face in Picart with a certain
                     quiet phallicism. Could we not argue that the monstrous mother of Hinduism has been
                     replaced by a pagod whose undecidable construction suspiciously resonates with the
                     Christian discourse used to legitimate Cleveland’s governance? The compositional displacement
                     and the undecidable architectural element figures forth a form of Hindu culture dissociated
                     from fanaticism at precisely the moment when the question of Chrisitianizing the Asian
                     subcontinent is very much in the air.

               <p>Hodges' sense of “pensive melancholy” has multiple valences in 1793—its year of publication—and
                  it is hard not to hear, in the phrase “civil dissentions”, a certain cautionary admonition
                  regarding not only imperial, but also national affairs. In light of the melancholy
                  prompted by this icon of the mutability of dynastic power is thus entirely appropriate
                  that phallic British governance be figured forth not architecturally but rather as
                  a living organism whose extension constitutes a fantasy of paternal self-replication.

                     which ended the third Mysore War in 1793, Cornwallis, and those representing the event,
                     did everything possible to suggest that Tipu Sultan’s sons would receive a form of
                     paternal care previously unknown to them in their father’s household. This declaration
                     of paternal benevolence was explicitly mobilized to contrast with the treatment of

                     in the first chapter of the <em>Travels</em>, but it does so in a way that both forecloses and opens the problematic of governmentality.

                     Company exist uneasily in this realm of normativity because the distinction between

                  <p>If we take one last look at the banyan tree image we can discern three layers of displacement.
                     In the background, the ancient pagod which framed Mahadewi in Picart’s picture has
                     given way to an image from the future: a small parsonage superimposed on a now obsolete
                     Hindu temple. In the middle ground, Mahadewi’s envaginated face has been erased and
                     the tree itself emerges as a fantasy of phallic British rule. And the ancient religious
                     practices of the faqirs have been replaced by present commerce. And in the foreground,
                     something new emerges. The aged Hindu man looking out at the viewer is not only detached
                     from the past of Picart’s image, but he seems to hail the viewer, or perhaps even
                     Hodges, into a new temporal relationship beyond the conventional aesthetic objectives
                     of the picturesque. It is as though the old man’s gaze establishes precisely what
                     Hodges and by extension his audience desired all along: a relationship which figures
                     forth the artist/observer as a phallic ruler over the subject of the image. Remember
                     Hodges asserts that during the time of truly successful native insurgency there is
                     no art. Here in 1793 following what was supposed to be victory over Tipu, Hodges text
                     can revel in the power of domination. Isn’t that what is coded into the penitential
                     pose of the figure in the foreground, for this is not an intersubjective glance, but
                     a gaze of subjection. And the viewer accedes to the scene of paternal forgiveness
                     perhaps needed to overcome the psychic, governmental and historical impasse occasioned
                     in 1781. In this re-figuring of the past Hodges has sketched the future for himself
                     and for those to whom he wishes to sell the <em>Travels</em>—a future that brings his art through the picturesque distancing from the political
                     towards the moral exemplifications and re-invigorated Georgic tropes associated with

                     on the right frames both the stags in the foreground and the castle in the background,
                     and thus perform precisely the sheltering function that oaks had performed in numerous
                     contexts from at least the time of Locke. Pope’s

               <p>This figure of the spreading branches of the British oak—here extending across the
                  Atlantic itself—is simply not possible in the 1780s. The loss of the American colonies
                  has lead to a certain restraint in this emblematic figure. But this spatial restraint
                  is supplemented by a renewed investment in the oak’s capacity to figure forth historical
                  continuity: spatial extension gives way to temporal reach.</p>
               <p>I think we can see something of this in Hodges' picture, for its rendering of power
                  is remarkably contained and in many ways looped in on itself. The oak frames the stags
                  which rest before the seat of the King. All three pictorial elements are the literal
                  possessions of the Crown and each one figures for the Crown. In this sense, they are
                  doubled versions of each other and thus the concentration of power is in a sense overdetermined.
                  That overdetermination suggests that the entire composition is attempting to shore
                  up something that may not be as solid as it first appears. This is only exacerbated
                  by the format of the print itself. Modelled on his iconic pictures of the ruins of
                  former Mughal stability, Hodges’s view of Windsor has the potential to be read not
                  only as the consolidation of dynastic power, but also as a further example of the
                  mutability of empire. In other words, the allegorical relation set up between Windsor
                  and the Tomb of Akbar establishes the British crown as both the substitute for Mughal
                  power and its double. This reaffirms Britain’s claim to governance in the present,
                  but uses the Mughal past to interrogate the future of British rule not only in the
                  colonies, but also at the very centre of the empire. The question posed by the comparison
                  is what will prevent the British state from receding into obsolescence in roughly
                  the same manner as Akbar’s regime?</p>
               <p>Hodges’s picture allows us to recognize a similar combination of restraint and overdetermination
                  in what is perhaps the most significant mobilization of the oak figure in the late
                  eighteenth century. I am referring of course to Burke’s use of the oak to figure forth
                  the British constitution in <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>: <span class="quote">‘Because half-a-dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate
                     chink, whilst thousands of great cattle, reposed beneath the shadow of the British
                     oak, chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the noise
                     are the only inhabitants of the field; that of course they are many in number; or
                     that, after all, they are other than the little shrivelled, meagre, hopping, though
                     loud and troublesome insects of the hour. (180)’</span> As a figure for the nation/constitution the important feature of this oak is its
                  capacity of its branches to give shade, but the animalization of British subjects—whether
                  they be revolutionary grasshoppers or loyal cattle—not only privileges the silence
                  of the cows, but also renders the entire political arrangement quite compact. As in
                  Hodges’s picture, the oak’s protection is nativist; there is none of the extensibility
                  which played such a key role in Pope or Whitehead. This marks a significant curtailment
                  of the diffusion of British liberty beyond the shores of the British Isles. And we
                  need to recognize that this constitutes a re-calibration of imperial governance as
                  much as it does a rejection of Whig suggestions at the time that Burke was writing
                  the <em>Reflections</em> that the revolution in France had the potential to diffuse English models of liberty
                  into the heart of Europe. Burke’s supplementation of the oak figure with that of the
                  cattle is aimed at ensuring that the oak does not become confused with a younger liberty
                  tree.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is for this reason that Burke’s figure sacrifices extensibility to duration by
                     intertwining the life cycle of the tree with the bonds of the family: <span class="quote">‘Our political system is placed in a just correspondence and symmetry with the order
                        of the world, and with the mode of existence decreed to permanent body composed of
                        transitory parts; wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, moulding together
                        the great mysterious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never
                        old, or middle aged, or young, but in a condition of unchangeable constancy, moves
                        on through the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation and progression.
                        Thus, by preserving the method of nature in the conduct of the state, in what we improve
                        we are never wholly new; in what we retain we are never wholly obsolete....In this
                        choice of inheritance we have given our frame of polity the image of a relation in
                        blood; binding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic affections....
                        (120)’</span> This is a confusing passage precisely because the image of “a relation in blood” does
                     not sit well with “the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation and progression”.
                     Burke wants the constitution to be both an “incorporation of the human race” and something
                     which shelters the polity of Britain. This strange hybridization of blood and oak,
                     human and tree, through its very overdetermination, performs a rhetorical intensification
                     which separates him from his predecessors. By collapsing the distinction between humans
                     and plants, Burke has opened the door for a racial interpretation of the constitution:
                     “we have given our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood”. And this racialization
                     of governance lays claim to historical constancy by aligning itself with the durability
                     at the heart of the oak figure. The tension between the symbolics of blood nascent
                     in Burke’s analogy between family and constitution on the one hand, and the more subtle
                     invocation of the tree on the other, not only signals the struggle to re-define the
                     oak figure for a new imperial era, but also opens the door for—and perhaps even demands—a
                     re-evaluation of the relationship between extension and duration in the notion of
                     British liberty.

                  <p>As with my analysis of Hodges, we need to go back to the global war of the early 1780s
                     in order to move forward. In early December of 1781, less than two months after Cornwallis’s
                     surrender at Yorktown, William Cowper sent an imaginary “sociable conversation” to
                     his friend Joseph Hill in which Cowper articulated his thoughts on the American War.
                     After stating that he knew of no one up to the task of leading Britain out of the
                     conflict, Cowper offered the following summary of the state of the empire: <span class="quote">‘If we pursue the war, it is because we are desperate; it is plunging and sinking year
                        after year in still greater depths of calamity. If we relinquish it, the remedy is
                        equally desperate, and would prove, I believe, in the end no remedy at all. Either
                        way we are undone—perseverance will only enfeeble us more, we cannot recover the Colonies
                        by arms. If we discontinue the attempt, in that case we fling away voluntarily, what
                        in the other we strive ineffectually to regain, and whether we adopt the one measure
                        or the other, are equally undone. For I consider the loss of America as the ruin of
                        England; were we less encumbered than we are, at home, we could but ill afford it,
                        but being crushed as we are under an enormous debt that the public credit can at no
                        rate carry much longer, the consequence is sure. Thus it appears to me that we are
                        squeezed to death between the two sides of that sort of alternative, which is commonly
                        called a cleft stick, the most threat’ning and portentous condition in which the interests
                        of any country can possibly be found.

                        </div>’</span> Of the myriad statements of imperial doom from this period, Cowper’s remark stands
                     out because the metaphor of the cleft stick captures the predicament of imperial subjectivity
                     at this moment so vividly. To be cleft is to be split or divided to a certain depth,
                     but the expression “a cleft stick” uses the notion of bifurcation to figure the two
                     horns of a dilemma: as the OED states, it indicates “a position in which advance and
                     retreat are alike impossible”. For Cowper, the nation, and by extension the imperial
                     subject, is entangled to the point of being unable to move. Disentangling the imperial
                     subject from this painful, static, almost abject, position involves a phantasmatic
                     re-configuration of the political beyond the limits of specific policies and actions.
                     In short, the predicament seems to call forth a new kind of political and poetic utterance.</p>
               </div>
               <p>For Cowper and others, the reverses of the early 1780s, both in America and in other
                  colonial locales, raised the simultaneous possibility that British culture may die
                  and yet live on in a ghostly form elsewhere. The complex temporality of this ghosting
                  procedure and the figural attempts to keep it under control are the primary focus
                  of the reading which follows. In Hodges, I demonstrated one example of how past losses
                  could be refigured as future domination. Cowper’s 
                  “Yardley Oak”
                  enacts a similar phantasmatic displacement of past losses. The crucial difference
                  is that Cowper’s focuses far less on the compensatory fantasy of domination over colonial
                  others, but rather on the renewed fantasy of national consolidation.</p>
               <p>The political dilemma presented in Cowper’s letter presupposes a strong sense of the
                  integration of colony and metropole. For Cowper, the loss of America implies the ruin
                  of England; his thoughts on the non-distinction of England and America emerge frequently
                  in his letters, but nowhere more explicitly than in the following missive to John
                  Newton: <span class="quote">‘I consider England and America as once one country. They were so in respect of interest,
                     intercourse, and affinity. A great earthquake has made a partition, and now the Atlantic

                     so as to make them aptly coincide and meet each other in every part, can unite them

                     heal the breach between us. (1:569-70)’</span> What is strange about this account of the American war is that it forgets that the
                  Atlantic Ocean has always separated the colonies from the British Isles. Cowper here
                  imagines a pre-revolutionary state which negates the very material structure of the
                  globe. In this fantasy it is contiguity that matters most: the shores must “aptly
                  coincide”. It is a figure of an organic whole rent asunder, which in some ideal future
                  state could be sutured together again by none other than God himself. God’s role here
                  is important because elsewhere in both the poems and the letters from this period,
                  Cowper emphasizes that this fatal wound—here it is naturalized as an earthquake—is
                  inflicted by Providence because England is a “sinfull Nation” (2:104). Like many other
                  commentators at this juncture, Cowper felt that England had been hollowed out from
                  within and held aristocratic dissipation and political corruption to be the undoing
                  of both the empire and the nation. But as in the cleft-stick passage, agency has been
                  fully wrested from politicians and citizens and is transferred to a divine non-human
                  process. Failed military and state policy not only are subsumed into a narrative of
                  irrevocable decline and fall, but also are corrected in a field where men have little
                  or no active role to play.</p>
               <p>Roughly ten years after Cowper’s appraisal of the end of the American war, he found
                  himself again contemplating the destruction of the nation, only this time he deploys
                  a cultural rather than a natural trope for disintegration: <span class="quote">‘I am entirely of your mind respecting this conflagration by which all Europe suffers
                     at present, and is likely to suffer for a long time to come. The same mistake seems
                     to have prevailed as in the American business. We then flattered ourselves that the
                     colonies would prove an easy conquest, and when all the neighbour nations arm’d themselves
                     against France, we imagined I believe that she too would be presently vanquish’d.
                     But we begin already to be undeceived, and God only knows to what a degree we may
                     find we have erred, at the conclusion. Such however is the state of things all around
                     us, as reminds me continually of the Psalmist’s expression—<em>He shall break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel</em>, and I rather wish than hope in some of my melancholy moods that England herself
                     may escape a fracture. (4.426)’</span> As a figure, the broken shards of the nation implied by his allusion to Psalm 2:9
                  is more coherent than his strange cancellation of the Atlantic in his 1784 letter,
                  but it still argues that God will break that which man has made, because Britain has
                  set itself against God.</p>

                     </blockquote> Cowper’s address does two things. First it establishes a relation of intimacy between
                     this last surviving oak and the aged speaker. This is achieved by constructing the
                     effect of physical proximity between speaker and oak: the poem’s descriptive specificity
                     is one of the poem’s most prominent rhetorical strategies. And this effect of intimacy
                     is intensified almost immediately by the syntactical ambiguity introduced by the parenthetical
                     phrase in line three. Cowper’s sudden specification of the speaker’s age suspends
                     the syntax at the end of line four and thus allows “A shatter’d vet’ran” in line 4
                     to figure not only for the oak, but also for the speaker. This figural ambiguity sets
                     up the possibility for complex identifications between the speaker and the tree which
                     will have important political ramifications as the poem unfolds. At this point it
                     is enough to recognize that this establishes the potential for precisely the same
                     collapse between the body of the subject and the arborial figure for governance that
                     animated Burke’s overdetermined deployment of the oak in the <em>Reflections</em>. As we will see, Cowper does not allow that collapse to occur.</p>
               </div>
               <p>But this isn’t all that is achieved here. The metaphorical comparison between the
                  oak tree and “the shatter’d vet’ran” also activates the memory of past war—and not
                  the triumphalism following the Seven Year’s War, but rather the sense of loss characteristic
                  of Cowper’s remarks on the American war. I believe that this phrase evokes the wounded
                  veteran of the American war and this oak is shattered like the potter’s vessel alluded
                  to in Cowper’s 1793 letter. The full connotations of this metaphor are not activated
                  until seventy lines later, but it is the central enigma of the poem. In what sense
                  is the tree shattered and in what way is it a veteran?</p>
               <p>These questions are temporarily supplanted by an explicit statement of the desire
                  to venerate the tree, which concludes the first verse paragraph:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

               <p> This is a rather startling turn because it suggests that veneration of the oak is
                  not only a form of pagan idolatry, but also akin to Adam’s attempt to hide from God’s
                  view after consciously breaking God’s explicit proscription. The allusion to Book
                  9 of <em>Paradise Lost</em> is deeply significant because the “thickest shades” referred to here are not offered
                  by oak trees. Adam expresses the desire to be “Obscured where highest woods impenetrable/To
                  star or sunlight spread their umbrage broad” (1086-7) and ultimately chooses the banyan
                  tree: </p>

               </blockquote>
               <p> As Balachandra Rajan has argued, the evocation of the banyan tree from Milton speaks
                  directly to the question of shelter (60-1). Adam chooses the tree because it provides
                  shade, or in Cowper’s phrase “gloom”. To venerate the oak for its shelter is to misrecognize
                  it as the banyan and the spiritual cost is, in Cowper’s eyes, catastrophic: it is
                  further evidence of the nation’s alienation from God. In this context, the verb “might”
                  in line 8 of 
                  “Yardley Oak”
                  becomes crucial, for it signifies temptation and the speaker’s resistance to it. The
                  speaker might have worshiped the tree, except for his belief that to do so would be
                  to be attempting to hide from one’s responsibility before God.</p>
               <p>When we recognize that the capacity to provide shade is precisely the feature of the
                  figure that is so appealing to Burke, then I think the full import of Cowper’s intervention
                  becomes clear. For Cowper, the loss of the American colonies and the predicted failure
                  of the war with France amount to symptomatic signs of God’s displeasure with the corruption
                  of British liberty, both at a national and imperial level. What is remarkable here
                  is that Cowper’s opening verse paragraph activates the entire historical predicament
                  with such iconic specificity: the shattered oak, the banyan tree, the sense of a nation
                  deformed and hollowed out from the inside. But most importantly their collocation
                  suggests that all of these connotations are comparable to one another and to the speaker
                  himself. This collocation lies beneath my decision to consider the banyan and the
                  oak in the same essay, because it implies that these figures, like India and Britain,
                  are bound up in a global historical dynamic.</p>
               <p>As the poem unfolds, the two primary elements of the oak figure—extension and duration—are
                  scrutinized historically; and by this I mean that their figural potential is tested
                  against the historical moment of 1791. Cowper’s evaluation of this moment in Britain’s
                  history is dire and the poem is suffused with a sense of past or passing glory. As
                  one might expect, Cowper plays out the “mutability in all/That we account most durable
                  below” (70-1), and traces “thy growth/From almost nullity into a state/Of matchless
                  grandeur, and declension thence/Slow into such magnificent decay.” (87-90) The pun
                  on “state” bolsters the direct assertion that Britain is in a condition of irrevocable,
                  but nonetheless majesterial, decline. It is almost the same language used by Hodges
                  to describe the obsolescence of the Mughal dynasty.</p>
               <p>But Cowper’s description of the tree focuses our attention on the tree’s boughs and
                  on the hollowing out of its trunk:</p>

               <p> I want to look at the fate of the boughs and trunk in turn, because the loss of the
                  former has an extraordinary effect on the latter, and because it is in the destruction
                  of these elements that the reader gets a sense of precisely how and why this tree
                  is a “shatter’d vet’ran”. After declaring the tree’s “magnificent decay”, the speaker
                  brings the tree within the orbit of human affairs:</p>

               <p> It is hard not to think of Pope’s 
                  “Windsor Forest”
                  here, especially since Cowper’s presentation of the oak’s potential use in the construction
                  of warships and merchant vessels tallies so well with Pope’s double understanding—both
                  military and commercial—of the rush of oaken timber around the globe. The oak addressed
                  in this poem’s opening line is a “sole survivor” not because it has been the object
                  of symbolic veneration, but rather because its “brethren” have become the material
                  basis for imperial wars that Cowper clearly signals have more to do with the hubris
                  of politicians than the benefit of the state. Again Cowper is reiterating his frequently
                  stated reservations about the failure of corrupt politicians to recognize the true
                  interests of the nation. As the passage unfolds, it becomes clear that man destroyed
                  the forest for ill-advised war, and now it is only a matter for Time to finish the
                  task by “disjoining” atom by atom this “shatter’d vet’ran” (103-8) .</p>
               <p>But nestled within this fairly explicit critique is a very subtle gesture. Imperial
                  war is evoked by the pun on “tortuous arms”, but by focussing the reader’s attention
                  on a fairly arcane element of ship-building—knee timber—Cowper consigns the “arms”
                  figure to the notes, only to activate it in a surprisingly brutal fashion in the next
                  verse paragraph. At the most explicit comparison between the oak and the state, the
                  speaker suddenly discloses that the tree affords no shelter because it has no limbs:</p>

               <p> The suspension of the tree’s lack of limbs until this point is extremely shocking
                  because it disjoins this particular tree from the usual political connotations of
                  the emblematic oak figure. And yet the figure of the tree’s arms reveals itself to
                  be exceedingly complex. If we understand arms to signify the martial capacity of Georgian
                  England, particularly its naval strength, then the poem recognizes that the diffusion
                  of liberty which was so integral to early theories of empire relies on the felling
                  of oaks such as the one being addressed by the speaker. But the corruption of ministers,
                  and the implicit sinfulness of the nation, have generated a situation where “Thine
                  arms have left thee” in both senses of the word. After the loss of the American war,
                  one can no longer simply assume that Britain can successfully protect its imperial
                  holdings through force of arms, nor can one assume that the symbolic shelter afforded
                  by the boughs of the constitution will protect the citizenry. The implication is that
                  both the military, and what Burke described as the frame of the polity, have been
                  “pulverized by venality”. So the reader is presented with a particularly dangerous
                  situation where the diffusion of liberty through empire—here figured by the propagation
                  of ships from oaks—has undercut one of its fundamental principles—the notion that
                  the state through its laws will, like the oak, shelter the people. It is the same
                  organic loop that allowed Cowper to understand the loss of America as equivalent to
                  the loss of England.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>With the loss of its arms, the tree’s capacity to figure forth shelter has been permanently
                     compromised. From this figural dismemberment comes a different possibility for metaphor.
                     This tree becomes notable not for its arms, but for its screaming mouth:

                     for arms. With the capacity to subdue enemies and to provide shelter for the polity
                     shorn away, the tree becomes a remarkable figure for the poet. It becomes a mouth
                     calling for sustenance from the sky so that it can sustain the only thing worth sustaining—its
                     roots.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>There are certain resonances between this passage and the opening of Book 3 of Virgil’s
                              Aeneid. In Dryden’s translation, the speaker refers to the cutting of sacred trees:Near
                              old Antandros, and at Ida's foot,The timber of the sacred groves we cut,And build
                              our fleet; uncertain yet to findWhat place the gods for our repose assign'd. (3.7-10)
                              The speaker goes on to narrate a remarkable scene in which the uprooting of a myrtle
                              tree yields “Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground” (3.29). The tree eventually
                              speaks and reveals that in death Polydore has been transformed into a myrtle tree.
                              I…</span></div>
                     </div> It is in this sense that the tree is a “shatter’d vet’ran” and why the syntactical
                     ambiguity which allows the phrase to also refer to the speaker in the opening verse
                     paragraph is so important. Cowper is laying the groundwork for a different kind of
                     relationship between patriotic poet and national figure. There is an analogy between
                     tree and speaker here, but it does not conform to Burke’s “philosophical analogy”
                     between constitution and blood. The analogy does not rest on the capacity for auto-generation
                     nascent in Burke’s naturalization of the constitution or in Hodges’s fantasy of the
                     banyan tree as an auto-reproductive structure, but rather on the capacity for mediating
                     between sky and soil that Cowper aligns not only with expressivity, but also with
                     patriotic Christian humility. This mediating function in the face of physical, spiritual
                     and national decline is the ultimate task of the poet in the time of national and
                     imperial crisis, when the oak can no longer protect anyone due to ill usage.</p>
               </div>
               <p>It is in this light that the poem’s truncated ending—the poem remained incomplete—gains
                  its resonance. At the very moment that the speaker declares that the tree is bereft
                  of arms and un-memorialized, he also insists that the tree endures:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">Yet life still lingers in thee, and puts forth</div>

                     <div class="l">Even where Death predominates. The Spring</div>

                     <div class="l">So much thy juniors, who their birth received</div>
                     <div class="l">Half a millenium since the date of thine. (130-6)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> The question which remains is what is to be done with this “sweet force” in the face
                  of decrepitude. What is the dismembered tree/nation/poet to do? The “yonder upstarts
                  of the neighbour wood” are presented as signs of the future. The fact that the poem
                  does not specify their species is, I think, important because “upstarts” may be referring
                  to the revolutionaries of a neighbouring nation—especially at the time when this poem
                  was composed.</p>
               <p>But whether Cowper is referring to France or to new patriots in Britain is not crucial.
                  What follows in both the cancelled and the retained versions of the poem is an explicit
                  adoption of a pedagogical stance. Since the “shatter’d vet’ran” can no longer speak,
                  its double, the oracular poet, must perform:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">But since, although well-qualified by age</div>
                     <div class="l">To teach, no spirit dwells in thee, seated here</div>
                     <div class="l">On thy distorted root, with hearers none</div>
                     <div class="l">Or prompter save the scene, I will perform</div>
                     <div class="l">Myself, the oracle, and will discourse<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                     <div class="l">In my own ear such matter as I may. (137-142)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> The way “Myself” is stranded at the beginning of line 141 is for me one of the differential
                  marks through which we could define Romanticism, for it is here that an entire political
                  narrative, an entire political symbolics, is suddenly transformed into an example
                  of what not to do. History’s dismemberment of the oak has allowed the poet to suddenly
                  and boldly speak to and for the figure in what is described as a theatrical space.
                  But he does so while “seated here/On thy distorted root”. He does not become the tree,
                  but rather contends with disfiguration. It is in this light that the poem’s obsession
                  with the contorted structures of the ruined tree, its distorted roots and tortuous
                  arms, is so important. The figure has been disfigured and that spectacle demands a
                  performance where private desire and public discourse intersect in a profound engagement
                  with the past. In retrospect, could we not simply state that Cowper’s sense of dismemberment,
                  traceable to the global crisis which would reconfigure the Atlantic imperium and re-orient
                  the entire project of empire, has called forth the performance of Romanticism? That
                  the poem leaves off at this point is apt, not only because the September massacres
                  would so radically call into question the hope expressed for the “Spring”, but also
                  because Cowper had cleared the ground, or allowed future readers such as Wordsworth
                  and Clare to see how the ground was cleared for their future utterances.</p>

                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">Near old Antandros, and at Ida's foot,</div>
                     <div class="l">The timber of the sacred groves we cut,</div>
                     <div class="l">And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find</div>
                     <div class="l">What place the gods for our repose assign'd. (3.7-10)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote> The speaker goes on to narrate a remarkable scene in which the uprooting of a myrtle
               tree yields “Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground” (3.29). The tree eventually
               speaks and reveals that in death Polydore has been transformed into a myrtle tree.
               If we allow this allusion to play out then the speaker’s encounter with the Yardley
               Oak presages a restoration of empire. I would like to thank Theresa Kelley for directing
               me to these lines.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note33_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
