               <p>Talk of consciousness has largely disappeared from Romantic studies and, indeed,
                  from literary scholarship more generally. As a symbol of this disappearance we
                  might look to <name ref="BloomHarold">Harold Bloom</name>’s edited volume <title
                     level="m">Romanticism and Consciousness</title> (1970). While the volume was
                  officially dedicated to the proposition that to talk about Romanticism simply
                     <emph>was</emph> to talk about consciousness, its inclusion of <name
                     ref="deManPaul">Paul de Man</name>’s essay “The Intentional Structure of the
                  Romantic Image” (written in 1960) in fact marked the beginning of the end of the
                  association between Romanticism and consciousness. Some years later <name
                     ref="deManPaul">de Man</name> could retrospectively mark his own deconstructive
                  turn as a swerve, however imperfect, from consciousness-talk. Writing in 1983,
                  looking back on his landmark 1969 essay “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” <name
                     ref="deManPaul">de Man</name> remarked that the essay was “still uncomfortably
                  intertwined with the thematic vocabulary of consciousness … that was current at
                  the time, but it signals a turn that, at least for me, has proven to be
                     productive.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="1"> Paul <name ref="deManPaul"
                        >de Man</name>, <title level="m">Blindness and Insight: Essays in the
                        Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism</title>, rev. 2nd
                     ed., (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983), xii. De Man’s turn, of
                     course, was to substitute language—allegory, specifically—for the
                     subject-object dialectic that had dominated post-Kantian idealism; the
                     implication is that with this move consciousness is revealed as a rhetorical
                     effect. </note> One could note other similar “turns” at about this same time,
                  for example within the Yale School and its turn away from phenomenology (in the
                  careers of Geoffrey Hartman and J. Hillis Miller), and also in Philippe
                  Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy’s <title level="m">Literary Absolute</title>
                  (1978).</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the historicism that has dominated Romantic studies for the
                  past-quarter century has likewise had little patience with consciousness talk.
                  Inspired by Marx and Engels’s <title level="m">German Ideology</title>, it has
                  tended to identify consciousness with “false consciousness.” There is a
                  complicated intellectual history here that would have to be traced in some detail.
                  Perhaps we can simply note, first, that some of the foundational texts for this
                  turn date, like <name ref="deManPaul">de Man</name>’s turn, to an approximately
                  10-year period from 1965-1975<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">For example,

               <p>And yet, as sometimes happens in academic discourse, the preoccupations that
                  disappeared in one quarter have popped up in another. As consciousness-talk was
                  disappearing from literary study (especially from versions of literary study that
                  referenced Continental philosophy), it was re-emerging in neuroscience and
                  philosophy of mind. Under the influence of behaviorism, Anglo-American philosophy
                  had gone through its own skepticism about consciousness in the early years of the
                  twentieth century, but the demise of behaviorism after the middle of the century
                  and the rise of what we now know as cognitive science has resulted in a rich,
                  varied, and completely unresolved conversation about the mind’s relationship to
                  the brain and how that relationship might produce conscious experience. Thus <name

                     just now. It boasts new journals of its very own, from which learned articles
                     overflow. Neuropsychologists snap its picture (in colour) with fMRI machines,
                     and probe with needles for its seat in the brain. At all seasons, and on many
                     continents, interdisciplinary conferences about consciousness draw together
                     bizarre motleys that include philosophers, psychologists, phenomenologists,
                     brain scientists, MDs, computer scientists, the Dalai Lama, novelists,
                     neurologists, graphic artists, priests, gurus and (always) people who used to
                     do physics. Institutes of consciousness studies are bountifully subsidised.
                     Meticulous distinctions are drawn between the merely conscious and the
                     consciously available; and between each of these and the preconscious, the
                     unconscious, the subconscious, the informationally encapsulated and the
                     introspectable. There is no end of consciousness gossip on Tuesdays in the

                     Nobel laureates pronounce on the connections between consciousness and

                     theory and the activity of neural nets. Everybody gives lectures about
                     consciousness to everybody else. But for all that, nothing has been ascertained
                     with respect to the problem that everybody worries about most: what
                     philosophers have come to call ‘the hard problem’. The hard problem is this: it
                     is widely supposed that the world is made entirely of mere matter, but how
                     could mere matter be conscious? How, in particular, could a couple of pounds of

                     is not a brief for so-called “cognitive literary studies,” about which I have
                     my doubts. Whether humans have a brain module for understanding fictional
                     characters does not strike me as a very interesting question. </note>

               <p>It may seem that talking about consciousness will re-open the very Pandora’s Box
                  of dualism that literary scholars have spent the last 40 years trying to close.
                  One might posit, moreover, that the Romantic writers themselves were anti-dualist
                  (something not always appreciated by their later admirers) and thus that talking
                  about consciousness again would be like turning back the clock. And yet a
                  substantial number of cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind writing today
                  agree that consciousness-talk and physicalism are not, in principle, mutually
                  exclusive. Indeed, as <name ref="FodorJerry">Fodor</name>’s comments suggest, this
                  is precisely the issue around which a good deal of the current conversation
                  circles: whether one can both be a physicalist <emph>and</emph> grant the
                  legitimacy of our phenomenal experiences. The fact is that we have conscious
                  experiences (C); the perplexing question is how those experiences relate to a
                  neural substrate (N). </p>
               <p>As <name ref="FodorJerry">Fodor</name> indicates, how we get from N to C has
                  become known in philosophy of mind as the “hard problem.”<note place="foot"

                  And although the hard problem has gotten a lot of attention lately, its roots go
                  back to the beginning of modern philosophy. Descartes worried about the causal
                  interaction between brain and mind and eventually settled on the pineal gland as
                  the place where they came together, though this didn’t convince some of his
                  contemporaries. With the famous analogy of the mill in his <title level="m"
                     >Monadology</title>, meanwhile, Leibniz suggested that materialism couldn’t
                  account for perception. By 1866 <name ref="HuxleyThomas">Thomas Huxley</name> had
                  posed the hard problem in a recognizably modern form: “[H]ow it is that anything
                  so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating
                  nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when
                  Aladdin rubbed his lamp.” In 1985 <name ref="NagelThomas">Thomas Nagel</name>
                  reiterated the point: “The strange truth seems to be that certain complex,
                  biologically generated physical systems, of which each of us is an example, have
                  rich nonphysical properties.” This happens, <name ref="NagelThomas">Nagel</name>

               <p>We can group responders to the hard problem as follows: (<hi>a</hi>) those who

                  think that the hard problem is really hard but is solvable in principle;
                     (<hi>c</hi>) those who think that the hard problem is so hard that we can’t

                  self-consciousness, I’ll discuss position (<hi>a</hi>), particularly a version of
                  it that tends to appeal to neuroscientists, and position (<hi>b</hi>), which
                  admits of a variety of possible approaches and tends to occupy philosophers of

               <p>We need first to distinguish consciousness from self-consciousness. Literary
                  scholars tend to use the terms interchangeably; we might speak about a
                  character—Prufrock, for instance—as being overly conscious, by which we mean
                  excessively self-aware. This is essentially the same state that Coleridge calls
                  “Dejection,” and that <name ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name> analyzes in
                  the opening 200 lines of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>. A more accurate

                     level="m">Romanticism and Self-Consciousness</title>. When philosophers and
                  cognitive scientists speak of consciousness, by contrast, they mean something more
                  basic. Here is <name ref="SearleJohnR.">John Searle</name>’s definition: “those
                  states of sentience or feeling or awareness that begin when you wake up from a
                  dreamless sleep and continue on throughout the day until you fall asleep again, or
                  otherwise become unconscious. Dreams are also a form of consciousness.” <note

                     53:17 (November 2, 2006). </note> Consciousness is the thing we lose when we go
                  under general anesthesia. </p>
               <p>Consciousness in this strict sense is sometimes referred to as “phenomenal
                  consciousness” because it seems to have phenomenal qualities: there is a redness
                  to the red rose that I see in my garden; there is a painness to the pain I feel
                  when its thorn pricks my finger. There is <emph>something that it is like for
                     me</emph> to see or feel these things. In his classic 1974 article “What Is It
                  Like to Be a Bat?” <name ref="NagelThomas">Thomas Nagel</name> helped to put this
                  subjective character of experience at the center of the reviving consciousness
                  conversation. According to <name ref="NagelThomas">Nagel</name>, we can safely
                  assume that bats have experiences; but bats are neurologically different enough
                  from humans that we can also assume that their experiences are quite different. So
                  what is it like to be a bat, then? <name ref="NagelThomas">Nagel</name> argues
                  that there is no way we could know, because the facts of experience are only
                  accessible from one point of view: in this case, the bat’s. If this is right, then
                  there is no way that an objective physical description—of the way that sonar
                  works, for example—could capture the subjective character of the experience that
                  sonar delivers. <note place="foot" resp="editors" n="8">

                     The phrase “what it is like” has become common in the literature. It is worth
                     noting that this phrase is not intended to name a metaphorical relationship but
                     rather to mark the specificity of a first-person phenomenal experience. A
                     reader might nonetheless wonder about the largely unexamined appeal to
                     “likeness” in the philosophical literature on consciousness. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Now it might be that the notion of consciousness in this sense isn’t very
                  interesting for literary studies; its focus on first-person phenomenal experience
                  would seem to require attention of the sort that disappeared from literary study
                  with the collapse of phenomenology. Thinking in terms of
                  <emph>self</emph>-consciousness and its deconstruction, by contrast, allows us to
                  bring culture and history and biography into the mix and this is where most of the
                  action has been for literary studies.<note place="foot" n="9" resp="editors"> One
                     answer to this objection, not pursued here, is that literature in fact
                     frequently aspires to describe what it feels like to be conscious; think of a
                     Henry James novel, or the modernist experiments of Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, and
                     others. Arguably, this is true as well of earlier writers and techniques: free
                     indirect style, for example, or the movements of thought characteristic of the
                     Greater Romantic Lyric. We could surely go back further. </note> It is commonly
                  asserted, for example, that the Romantic period witnessed an unprecedented level
                  of historical self-consciousness. The gamble of this essay, however, is that
                  students of literature and culture have something to learn from the challenges
                  involved in grappling with the “hard problem” of consciousness rather than simply
                  overleaping it on the way to issue of self-consciousness. Having now distinguished
                  consciousness from self-consciousness a little more fully, I turn in sections two
                  and three to the position often described as “neural correlates of consciousness”
                  (NCC), a position that tends to avoid strictly philosophical considerations. I
                  will suggest that <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Alan Richardson</name>’s recent work
                  on Romantic-era brain science overlaps with the NCC position. In section four I turn
                  to <emph>emergence theory</emph>, a variant of position (<hi>c</hi>) with
                  important Romantic-era roots; in section five I consider <name ref="LiuAlan">Alan
                     Liu</name>’s recent writings about emergence. In sections six and seven I distinguish
                  my position from <name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name>’s by identifying “natural piety”
                  as the characteristic attitude of emergence theory, and I extrapolate natural
                  piety’s importance for thinking about the relationship between Romantic culture
                  and mind-body questions. At stake is a Romantic physicalism that can only be
                  recovered, I argue, when literary study turns its attention to the mind-body
                  problem and the question of phenomenal consciousness that makes that problem so
                  hard.</p>

               <head>2. Neural correlates of consciousness</head>
               <p>Many neuroscientists would fall into my category (<hi>a</hi>); they think that the
                  hard problem is not so hard and that neuroscientists (unlike philosophers) are
                  getting to work solving it. They are busy searching for what they call the “Neural
                  Correlates of Consciousness” (NCC). It should be noted that everybody thinking
                  about the mind-body problem takes it for granted that conscious states and
                  neuronal states correlate in some way. The question is whether an accurate
                  description of that correlation is all that is required to explain consciousness.
                  The NCC proponents are betting that the answer is “yes.” If we map the NCC, their
                  thinking goes, we will either get consciousness along the way (which will indicate
                  that the hard problem wasn’t such a hard problem after all) or we’ll discover that
                  we don’t really need a theory of consciousness at all (which will indicate that
                  the hard problem was a pseudo-problem). The late <name ref="CrickFrancis">Francis

                  entirely new light. It might even disappear.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"

                  needed would be to locate exactly where and how a particular group of neurons
                  fires when I see red, or prick my finger with a needle, or smell my coffee in the
                  morning: “locating the neurons in the cerebral cortex that correlate best with
                  consciousness, and figuring out how they link to neurons elsewhere in the brain,”
                  as <name ref="CrickFrancis">Crick</name> and <name ref="KochChristof">Koch</name>
                  put it (84). We may not have the technology to map NCC so precisely right now, but
                  in principle it certainly seems possible. </p>
               <p>Even if it were possible, however, this might not make the hard problem disappear.
                  Just because a particular group of neurons fires when I see a red tomato does not
                  explain why the tomato appears to me in the way that it does, and not in some
                  other way or in no way at all. In some respects this is a disciplinary issue;
                  neuroscientists tend to be more interested in finding NCC than in pausing over the
                  precise relationship between N and C; many philosophers, meanwhile, have insisted
                  that if we ignore the philosophical issue of how we get from N to C we ignore the
                  very thing that is interesting about consciousness, namely that it has about it a
                  first-person, “what it is like” quality. Here are two quick examples of the
                  philosophical issues that an NCC program tends to ignore. <name ref="CrickFrancis"
                     >Crick</name> and <name ref="KochChristof">Koch</name> hold to a theory they
                  call “explicit neuronal representation” in order to explain why subjective
                  experience is private. Mental representations, they think, can’t be adequately
                  communicated in language. But representationalism is a hotly debated topic within
                  philosophy of mind, and it entails other metaphysical and epistemological
                  positions (about the nature of the content of mental states, for example); <name
                     ref="CrickFrancis">Crick</name> and <name ref="KochChristof">Koch</name> can’t
                  just have “representation” for free. In a similar manner, they propose that
                  “meaning” (our recognizing a certain face, say, as belonging to a loved one) is
                  the result of networks of association spread throughout the cortical system. But
                  association and meaning are also loaded terms; again, <name ref="CrickFrancis"
                     >Crick</name> and <name ref="KochChristof">Koch</name> can’t simply help
                  themselves to these concepts without discussing the philosophical positions they
                  entail.</p>
               <p>From a certain perspective, then, the NCC program seems both philosophically
                  unsophisticated and methodologically uninterested in the first-person quality of
                  phenomenal experience. In his famous article “Epiphenomenal Qualia,” <name
                     ref="JacksonFrank">Frank Jackson</name> formulates these objections with
                  somewhat greater precision by calling attention to the qualitative dimensions of
                  experience—what have become known in the literature as “qualia.” <name
                     ref="JacksonFrank">Jackson</name>’s argument depends on a thought experiment.
                  He asks us to imagine Mary, a neuroscientist who knows everything there is to know
                  about the science of vision. In particular, Mary knows exactly what happens in the
                  visual cortex when it encounters the different wavelengths that produce the
                  experience of color. However, for perverse and unexplained reasons, Mary has spent
                  her entire life in a black-and-white room. So Mary knows everything there is to
                  know about color, but she has never <emph>seen</emph> color. Then, one day, Mary
                  leaves her black-and-white room and encounters color (for some reason it is almost
                  always red in these examples) for the first time. The question is how we describe
                  what has happened to Mary. <name ref="JacksonFrank">Jackson</name> argues that at
                  the moment she sees red Mary learns something that she didn’t know before: she
                  learns what red <emph>is like</emph>—she experiences its qualitative character.
                  But Mary already knew everything that there was to know about the physical facts
                  of color. So the physical facts must not be all the facts.<note place="foot"

                  what it is like to be Mary <emph>can</emph> be described through reference to
                  neural correlates. But <name ref="JacksonFrank">Jackson</name> isn’t interested in
                  Mary’s internal life; he is interested in what it is like to see red. And what it
                  is like to see red, he thinks, cannot be captured by even a complete knowledge of
                  the physical facts. He thinks that qualia, uniquely, cannot be explained by

                  want to keep the focus on the broader point that ties all the positions in group
                     (<hi>b</hi>) together, which is simply that the NCC program misses both how
                  important and how hard the hard problem is. That is, the NCC program doesn’t
                  appreciate just what is involved, theoretically, in trying to link the physical to
                  the mental; and it doesn’t appreciate just what is involved, subjectively, in our
                  phenomenal experience, namely the fact that it is <emph>like something</emph> to
                  be in a particular mental state. Each of the contenders in group (<hi>b</hi>)
                  tries to account more adequately for both of these things.</p>

                     level="m">British Romanticism and the Science of Mind </title>has done a great
                  deal to make neurological history important for Romantic studies. Through careful
                  archival work and impressive scholarship, <name ref="RichardsonAlan"
                     >Richardson</name> reveals the importance of a number of brain scientists of
                  the period, including F. J. Gall, Charles Bell, Erasmus Darwin, and Sir William
                  Lawrence. In many ways, he argues, the early nineteenth century saw the birth of
                  what we now call cognitive science. <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>
                  shows that Romantic-era writers were much more deeply read in this material than
                  has been previously assumed, and that many of them felt compelled to
                  respond—negatively, positively, ambivalently—to the development of new brain-based
                  psychologies. </p>
               <p>Despite its unassuming stance, however, <name ref="RichardsonAlan"
                     >Richardson</name>’s book aims to do more than simply recover a neglected
                  influence on Romantic-era culture. The polemical thrust of his book—understated
                  but nevertheless present—is that the entire “German swerve” of Romantic studies
                  has been misguided. Our traditional intellectual histories of the period
                  (encouraged by Coleridge, DeQuincey, and Carlyle) typically move from Hume to Kant
                  to post-Kantian German Romanticism and idealism; we read Romantic literary
                  production in light of these continental developments. Even scholarship that has
                  resisted this procedure—either through deconstructive criticism of the symbol or
                  materialist criticism of the German Ideology—has moved within the orbit of
                  post-Kantian Continental philosophy. Perhaps we now substitute non-identity for
                  the logic of identity postulated by an earlier generation of Romantic humanists,
                  but we continue to take our bearings from the questions and concerns that surfaced
                  in Kant’s wake. In consequence, the dualism of subject and object comes to
                  displace mind-body dualism as the chief philosophical problem, and it becomes
                  difficult to disentangle questions of consciousness from questions of
                     self-consciousness.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="13"> Again, there is a
                     complicated intellectual history that I must gloss over here, but Kant’s

                        >Wissenschaftslehre</title> (1797) are the key moments in this transition

               </p>
               <p><name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>’s procedure, by contrast, is to stay
                  closer to home by examining the (predominantly) British empirical tradition that
                  continued chugging along in Hume’s wake.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="14">
                     As <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> notes, there are Continental
                     connections as well: Herder, Diderot, Gall, and Spurzheim, among others.
                  </note> In his narration, the associationist paradigm derived from Locke
                  eventually ran aground with Hartley and Priestley, who conceived of the brain as
                  passive. But a new emphasis on the brain as an active participant in experience
                  developed in the post-associationist empirical tradition. Biologically rather than
                  mechanically inclined, Bell, Gall, Lawrence, and others emphasized the brain’s
                  plasticity rather than simply, like Hartley, treating it as a passive receptacle
                  for impressions.<note place="foot" n="15" resp="editors"><name

                     Press, 2001) 6.</note> Thus, <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>
                  suggests that Coleridge’s extended diatribe against Hartley in the <title
                     level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> is a clever sleight-of-hand. By lumping
                  all empirical work on the brain under the banner of associationism, Coleridge is
                  able to dispense with the whole lot and then turn his attention to Schelling’s
                  idealism. But <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> argues that this
                  ignores what is really going on in British brain science during the time that
                  Coleridge is writing, and in the process it transposes the mind-body problem into
                  a much more abstract and fuzzier subject-object problem. The apparatus of
                  self-consciousness, identity, and non-identity (and their eventual deconstruction)
                  follow in turn. </p>
               <p>In asking us to resist this German swerve, <name ref="RichardsonAlan"
                     >Richardson</name>’s work is bracing and—its professed modesty
                  notwithstanding—revolutionary. If he is right, we need to rethink Romanticism’s
                  privileged relationship with Continental philosophy and its various obsessions,
                  turns, and counter-turns. And even if <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>
                  is not entirely right, the historical yield of his method is obvious. My question,
                  however, is a bit different: what is gained <emph>conceptually</emph> by relating
                  Romantic literary culture to the culture of Romantic-era brain science? To answer
                  this question we need to get a clear grasp of how Bell and Lawrence and the other
                  Romantic brain scientists relate phenomenal consciousness to its neural substrate.
                  And unfortunately this is far from clear.</p>
               <p>I suspect that this is simply a limitation of the historical material <name
                     ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> is working with. All of the writers that
                  he treats were anti-dualist, were intensely interested in neurology, and with the
                  exception of Bell all were attacked as “materialists.” If they were alive today,
                  all of them would have held to NCC. But as I have been emphasizing, NCC does not
                  address the philosophical question of the relationship between phenomenal
                  consciousness and its neural substrate. Lawrence, Darwin, Bell, and the others
                  seem not to have posed the hard problem to themselves; apparently, they were
                  content with the extraordinary neurological discoveries they were making, and with
                  the physicalism (tempered in some cases with religious orthodoxy) that those
                  discoveries seemed to indicate. And, of course, who can blame them? </p>
               <p>The difficult methodological issue for literary studies, however, is how we use
                  this material. How can we think through the relationship between a brain-based
                  psychology that accepts NCC and the Romantic literary production that arose
                  alongside it? <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>, it seems to me,
                  largely avoids this question—or rather, he gives it an answer roughly analogous to
                  the empirical one that the NCC program itself pursues. Just as NCC either ignores
                  or dismisses the hard problem, so, lacking a conceptual account of how N relates
                  to C, <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> treats his literary texts as
                  simple outgrowths or results of the contextual material he brings to bear upon
                  them. As a result his book must for the most part settle for tracing paths of
                  influence between various brain scientists and Romantic writers. Some of these
                  influences are tighter than others, and all are interesting. But the payoff is
                  limited; because the question of how phenomenal experience is possible <emph>at
                     all</emph> never comes up, <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> is
                  unable to produce a “reading” of the literary artifacts he discusses and must
                  settle instead for contextualizing them. A revealing moment appears in the chapter
                  on Coleridge: “it seems appropriate to consider,” <name ref="RichardsonAlan"
                     >Richardson</name> writes, <quote>whether Coleridge’s concerns with mind-body
                     interaction, unconscious cognition, and volition … seep into the text of “Kubla
                     Khan.” The result would be not another interpretation of the poem, but rather a
                     supplement to the work of contextualization… (57).</quote> One can of course
                  sympathize with the desire to avoid adding to the huge bibliography of “Kubla
                  Khan” commentary. And yet what this passage suggests is that any treatment of the
                  literary object’s novelty or uniqueness (however attenuated and hedged) will not
                  appear here. Indeed, <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> names the site
                  of that novelty (“interpretation”) only to tell us that this is not his goal.</p>
               <p>What <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>’s book has helped me to
                  understand, then, is that the relationship of N to C that occupies the
                  consciousness literature is a tight analogue of the relationship of context to
                  text. That second relationship is of course the continuing and eternal <emph>bête
                     noir</emph> of literary studies—it is our own version of the hard problem. Like
                  partisans of NCC, <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> (and many
                  historically-minded scholars of Romanticism writing today) favors context to the
                  virtual exclusion of text. Now I don’t pretend here to be making a point of which
                     <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> is unaware. My point rather is
                  that in avoiding the philosophical issues at stake in brain-based psychologies,
                     <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>’s book contributes perhaps
                  inadvertently to a continuing split between empirically-inclined historical
                  “contextualization” and theoretically-inclined textual “interpretation.” Despite
                  his resistance to Romanticism’s “German swerve,” then, the implication of <name
                     ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>’s book is that when it comes to literary
                  criticism, interpretive or philosophical questions only emerge within the context
                  of Continental theory, with its apparatus of self-consciousness and subject/object
                  dialectics. The work of historical contextualization, meanwhile, falls into the
                  (largely British) domain of the mind-body problem. I hope I have demonstrated that
                  this is incorrect; as the explosion in consciousness literature has demonstrated,
                  the mind-body problem remains a matter not solely of neurological explanation but
                  also of philosophical interpretation. </p>

                     where emergence theory had the longest life. He doesn’t discuss consciousness
                     itself, except to write in a footnote that “Consciousness, it seems, is the
                     last refuge of an Emergentist” (91). </note> Until the advent of quantum
                  mechanics, however, emergence seemed like a highly plausible explanation for a
                  variety of phenomena. </p>
               <p>According to emergence theory, some properties “emerge” from a physical substrate
                  in a way that cannot be explained from the perspective of that substrate (eg. from
                  the perspective of physics). Furthermore, these emergent properties cannot be
                  reduced to the properties of their physical substrate. In a familiar though
                  imprecise analogy, neither bees nor ants possess intelligence, and yet a bee-hive
                  or an ant colony could be said to possess intelligence; somehow intelligence
                  “emerges” from the way in which each individual ant or bee goes about its
                     task.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="18"> Such analogies proliferate in

                        Software</title> (New York: Scribner, 2001). </note> Consciousness,
                  accordingly, is sometimes said to be an emergent property in that it arises from a
                  physical substrate (the brain) and yet cannot be reduced to the brain, nor fully
                  predicted by the sciences of the brain. The issue of <emph>prediction</emph> is
                  important here: for a property to be emergent, no amount of knowledge about the
                  substrate will enable us to predict facts about the emergent property.
                  Consciousness (to stick with this example) emerges from lower-level systems, but
                  however much we might learn about those systems we will not be able to say what
                  consciousness looks like before it actually arrives on the scene. </p>
               <p>In a slightly more technical idiom, emergence proposes that higher-level mental
                  properties are <emph>determined by</emph> and <emph>dependent upon</emph> lower
                  level properties—yet are not reducible to the lower-level properties. The delicate
                  balancing act required here is particularly tricky when it comes to the idea that
                  emergent properties must be not only unpredictable but <emph>novel</emph>. Of
                  course, objects can have properties that their parts do not have; a watch, for
                  example, tells time, while a random heap of springs and gears does not. The
                  novelty required for a property to be emergent must be of a different order than
                  this. At the same time, how can a property be truly novel and yet determined by
                  its physical substrate? This will require both that the arrangement of parts
                  brings something new into existence <emph>and</emph> that nothing new is actually
                  added to the mix from the outside. (Thus the soul is not emergent in classical
                  theological accounts because it is added to the body.) In this sense emergent
                  properties must supervene on their physical substrate—but it must be supervenience
                  such that C is determined by N but not identical to it.<note place="foot"

               <p>As an idea, “emergence” lends itself to analogical extrapolation. Though the

                  chemical laws in such a way as to make mentality an emergent property. More
                  recently, emergence theory has found new life in the cultural zone. In his essay
                  “A Forming Hand: Creativity and Destruction from Romanticism to Emergence Theory,”
                     <name ref="LiuAlan">Alan Liu</name> notes the presence of emergentist thinking
                  in current models of information theory, management theory, ideas about artistic
                  autopoesis, complexity, and self-organization, and especially in notions of
                  “creative destruction” prominent in the business world. One of the goals of his
                  essay is to critique the one-size-fits-all picture of emergence that these various
                  cultural domains offer. <name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name> zeroes in particularly on
                  their relentless anti-historical bias: “[w]estern cognitive,

                  writes, “celebrate their cause as a way to swear allegiance to democracy without
                  seeming also to swear to any old-fashioned individualism, nationalism, or

                  “distribution of inspiration along a whole chain of temporal transmission” (11),
                  this alternate mode of creativity is sprinkled liberally over broad patches of the
                     <name ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name> that we usually don’t read. For
                     <name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name> its “local spirit” becomes a Romantic
                  anticipation of emergence, a picture of lower-level agency that does its thing
                  without any inkling of a larger project: “There is agency, nothing but agency… but
                  no one at the control stick that would be identified as <emph>the</emph> agent.
                  Agency is a cascade of local agencies,” he writes (18). In this respect the
                  amorality of emergence does seem to capture something of our contemporary world
                  situation, in which things can go terribly wrong and there is no one around to
                  blame, just a cascade of local agencies going about their very limited
                     business.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="23">Within emergence theory,

                     law is not reducible to the laws governing the lower levels. Moreover, emergent
                     properties exhibit so-called downward causation, that is, they cause change
                     that cannot be predicted at the lower levels. So, for example, mental
                     properties, if they are emergent, would have causal powers that could not be
                     predicted according to the laws that govern the physical substrate of those
                     properties. This seems to violate what is known as “the causal closure of the

               <p><name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name> is however also verging on a philosophical point,
                  which he makes somewhat casually a bit later in the essay. For emergence theory,
                  he writes, “[t]here is no transcendental manager of choices named ‘consciousness’
                  that sits above local choices” (30). Now this is true if we are dualists and think
                  of consciousness as some additional thing over and above its material substrate.
                  But it is <emph>not</emph> true if we think of consciousness itself as emergent
                  (or, for that matter, if one holds to at least some of the positions that I
                  gathered under category (<hi>b</hi>) above). Any non-reductive physicalism will
                  try hard to accommodate both the cascade of local choices that make up our
                  neurological reality and the first-person, phenomenal experience that makes up
                  what we call “consciousness.” Thus in <name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name>’s dismissal
                  of consciousness—as though any talk of consciousness is inevitably dualist—I find
                  a surprising similarity to <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name>’s approach
                  (surprising because they are quite different kinds of critics). Both give little
                  attention to the <emph>philosophical </emph>issues surrounding consciousness,
                  because both in their different ways are intent upon moving from neurological
                  wiring to cultural product. For <name ref="RichardsonAlan">Richardson</name> that
                  means moving from Romantic theories of the mind/brain to the historical contexts
                  of Romantic literature; for <name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name>, it means moving from
                  emergent computer programs to contemporary management theory. Neither is terribly
                  interested in pausing along the way to consider the mind-body problem. Both seem
                  to assume that our only options are dualism or some version of position
                     (<hi>a</hi>); they ignore those responses I’ve gathered under headings
                     (<hi>b</hi>) and (<hi>c</hi>)—even though <name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name> is for
                  his part talking about emergence theory. </p>
               <p><name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name>’s description of emergence as amoral is important
                  for his larger project of identifying elective affinities between emergence theory
                  and the business culture of postmodernity, with its command to innovate
                  ceaselessly. But if we shift our attention to philosophical versions of emergence
                  a rather different picture appears. <name ref="AlexanderSamuel">Alexander</name>
                  and <name ref="BroadC.D.(CharlieDunbar)">Broad</name>, for instance, both
                  elaborated metaphysical systems in which the world was a basically meaning-full
                  place; emergence became a way to be a physicalist (“there is only one fundamental
                  kind of stuff,” writes <name ref="BroadC.D.(CharlieDunbar)">Broad</name> [77])
                  without committing oneself to a picture of the universe as fundamentally amoral
                  and directionless. And it is in the context of this elaboration that <name
                     ref="AlexanderSamuel">Alexander</name> in 1920 has recourse to a resonant
                  phrase: <quote>The existence of emergent qualities thus described is something to
                     be noted, as some would say, under the compulsion of brute empirical fact, or,
                     as I should prefer to say in less harsh terms, to be accepted with the ‘natural
                     piety’ of the investigator. It admits no explanation.<note place="foot"

                  got the phrase not from “My heart leaps up” itself but from the “Intimations” Ode.
                  In the 1815 edition of his <title level="m">Poems</title>
                  <name ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name> made the final three lines of “My

                     It is also tempting to speculate that the association of natural piety with
                     emergence comes from the George Eliot / G. H. Lewes relationship. Lewes in fact
                     coined the term “emergent.” </note>
               </p>
               <p>I say this is the “most intriguing” possibility because it allows us to push the

                     ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name>, specifically the 1815 <title

                  wants at that particular juncture” (151). <name ref="MillJohnStuart">Mill</name>
                  then relates that by 1830 he had begun writing what would become the <title
                     level="m">System of Logic</title>, eventually published in 1843. In his
                  description of that work, <name ref="MillJohnStuart">Mill</name> revisits his
                  crisis in a more intellectual vein. In particular, he describes how he turned his
                  attention to what he called the “Composition of Forces”: <quote>On examining,
                     accordingly, what the mind does when it applies the principle of the
                     Composition of Forces, I found that it performs a simple act of addition. It
                     adds the separate effect of the one force to the separate effect of the other,
                     and puts down the sum of these separate effects as the joint effect. But is
                     this a legitimate process? In dynamics, and in all the mathematical branches of
                     physics, it is; but in some other cases, as in chemistry, it is not; and I then
                     recollected that something not unlike this was pointed out as one of the
                     distinctions between chemical and mechanical phenomena, in the introduction to
                     that favorite of my boyhood, Thomson's <title level="m">System of

                           popularized John Dalton’s atomic theory. Thomson claimed (probably
                           incorrectly) that Dalton arrived at the theory through an analysis of
                           nitrous oxide. Humphry Davy was of course the Romantic-era chemist most
                           associated with nitrous oxide; on Coleridge’s connection to Davy’s

               <p>With <name ref="MillJohnStuart">Mill</name>, in other words, we have an emotional
                  crisis solved in part by reading <name ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name>,
                  and, running parallel to that, an intellectual crisis solved in part by reading a
                  chemistry textbook. What the chemistry textbook gave <name ref="MillJohnStuart"
                     >Mill</name> was the first intimation of emergence theory. Is it too much to
                  suppose that <name ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name> might have given him
                  a similar intimation? To be sure, chemistry and poetry seem tightly related in
                     <name ref="MillJohnStuart">Mill</name>’s account. Inspired by <name
                     ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name>’s own self-description in the
                  “Preface” to the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, <name
                     ref="MillJohnStuart">Mill</name> ascribes <name ref="WordsworthWilliam"
                     >Wordsworth</name>’s effectiveness as a spiritual guide to something almost
                  chemical in the writing itself: “What made <name ref="WordsworthWilliam"
                     >Wordsworth</name>'s poems a medicine for my state of mind, was that they
                  expressed, not mere outward beauty, but states of feeling, and of thought coloured
                  by feeling, under the excitement of beauty” (151). If we want to picture this
                  familiar <name ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name>ian effect, we could do
                  worse than imagine the invisible chemical bonds (“states of feeling”) by which
                  atoms (“mere outward beauty”) stick together. We might remember too that for the
                  emergentists these bonds were the result of fundamental chemical forces—proof that
                  chemistry was its own special science. </p>
               <p>What makes the connection between chemistry and poetry more than simply an
                  interesting possibility, however, is that the poem that <name ref="MillJohnStuart"
                     >Mill</name> singles out for treatment in this section of the <title level="m"
                     >Autobiography</title> is none other than the “Intimations Ode” in its 1815
                  edition—the edition, remember, with the epigraph from “My heart leaps up”:
                     <quote>At the conclusion of the Poems came the famous “Ode,” falsely called
                     Platonic, "Intimations of Immortality:" in which, along with more than his
                     usual sweetness of melody and rhythm, and along with the two passages of grand
                     imagery but bad philosophy so often quoted, I found that [<name
                        ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name>] too had had similar experience to
                     mine; that he also had felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of
                     life was not lasting; but that he had sought for compensation, and found it, in
                     the way in which he was now teaching me to find it. (153)</quote> What <name
                     ref="MillJohnStuart">Mill</name> zeroes in on here is not the poem’s dualism
                  (dismissed as “bad philosophy”) but rather its description of the “compensation”
                  that comes after dualism has been abandoned. To see what that compensation is we
                  need look no further than the “chemical causes” that would become the foundation
                  of the emergentist tradition. </p>

               <p>This is a reading of the “Ode,” then, that takes the epigraph seriously: <quote><lg>
                        <l>The Child is father of the Man;</l>
                        <l>And I could wish my days to be</l>
                        <l>Bound each to each by natural piety</l>
                     </lg></quote> Central to emergence theory is the idea that reality exists in
                  increasingly complex layers, each of which has its special science: physics, then
                  chemistry, then biology. Accordingly, to say that the man is father to the child
                  is to assert a biological relationship—and presumably to open the door to vitalist
                  or dualist speculations about the origins of life. To abandon the mysteries of the
                  paternal relationship altogether, however, is to commit oneself to mere mechanical
                  causation in a meaningless universe—and <name ref="MillJohnStuart">Mill</name> had
                  already been through <emph>that</emph> spiritual crisis. By contrast, to say as
                  the poem does that the child is father to the man not only reverses the usual
                  claims about paternity but actually asserts a fundamental law such that manhood
                  emerges out of childhood in a way that has to be accepted with natural piety
                  because, as <name ref="AlexanderSamuel">Alexander</name> was to put it, it is not
                  susceptible to another explanation. Emergence allows <name ref="MillJohnStuart"
                     >Mill</name> both enchantment and physicalism. In this reading of the “Ode” and
                  its epigraph, which I am suggesting was <name ref="MillJohnStuart">Mill</name>’s
                  reading, natural piety is the appropriate attitude to take toward the fundamental
                  laws that are not susceptible to further explanation. The power of this
                  emergence/natural piety complex is demonstrated, in <name ref="MillJohnStuart"
                     >Mill</name>’s account, by his discovery of emergent laws <emph>and</emph> by
                  his own personal spiritual recovery.</p>
               <p><name ref="McLaughlinBrianP.">Brian McLaughlin</name> argues that empirically we
                  don’t need emergence: there simply <emph>are</emph> no fundamental chemical forces
                  that have to be accepted with natural piety. But even setting aside such empirical
                  considerations, most philosophers are liable to be suspicious of natural
                  piety—just as cultural critics, for analogous reasons, are liable to be suspicious
                  of it. For natural piety seems to recommend that we just give up. Philosophers who
                  will continue to seek a metaphysical solution to the mind-body problem won’t like
                  this, nor will cultural critics who call us to ever more vigilant forms of
                  critique. Furthermore, the quasi-religious language of natural piety, especially
                  as it gets linked up to literature itself in <name ref="MillJohnStuart"
                     >Mill</name>’s reaction to <name ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name>,
                  will elicit objections. If <name ref="AlexanderSamuel">Alexander</name> and <name

                  historicist interlocutors? </p>

                  onto what he calls “Romantic philosophy.” Natural piety

                  “re-domiciliate man in a world that had become alien to him.” Rather, it is
                  consonant with a physicalist/naturalist solution to the mind-body problem. </p>
               <p>Left intellectuals, trained by several generations of theorists suspicious of

                  examination, though, such nervousness depends on an ambiguity in the notion of
                  nature itself. Keeping the focus on the mind-body problem rather than letting it
                  run off in various post-Kantian directions, my suggestion is that the British
                  Emergentist interest in natural piety might help us recover <emph>in a

                  deconstruction as its point of departure.</p>
               <p>I want to side with <name ref="BloomHarold">Bloom</name> in this debate. I think
                  he glimpses something that <name ref="ManningPeter">Manning</name> does not, and
                  that it is the same thing that <name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name> glimpses when he
                  discusses the phenomenon of local agency in Book 2 of <title level="m">The
                     Prelude</title>. We can describe this thing as the “relation of man and
                  nature,” but this time in a way much closer to <name
                     ref="BroadC.D.(CharlieDunbar)">Broad</name>’s mind-body physicalism (“the mind
                  and its place in nature”) than to <name ref="ManningPeter">Manning</name>’s
                  invocation of subject-object dialectics. What <name ref="BloomHarold">Bloom</name>
                  and <name ref="LiuAlan">Liu</name> and <name ref="BroadC.D.(CharlieDunbar)"
                     >Broad</name> are all verging upon is the way that subjectivity emerges out of
                  the everyday and mundane material that nature offers up. These are descriptions,
                  in short, of the mind’s place in nature. </p>
               <p>If this sort of naturalism or physicalism is not to simply fetishize nature,
                  though, we need to give it a little more theoretical heft. Recall that when he
                  first describes the attitude of natural piety, <name ref="AlexanderSamuel"
                     >Alexander</name> remarks that emergent laws could be “noted under the
                  compulsion of brute empirical fact, or, as I should prefer to say in less harsh
                  terms, to be accepted with the ‘natural piety’ of the investigator.” The
                  distinction between “brute empirical fact” and the “natural piety” of the
                  investigator catches one’s attention immediately, and it is tempting to read this
                  revision in ideological terms, such that “natural piety” becomes the way to soften
                  and ameliorate what is nevertheless a brute assertion. We might further note that
                  so understood, this revision nicely glosses one common reading of Romanticism
                  itself, as a conservative reaction to the modernity represented by a tradition of
                  scientific reasoning extending back to Bacon and Newton. </p>
               <p>Once again, though, things look different if we come at natural piety from the
                  perspective of emergence. If the emergence of one set of properties from lower
                  level properties is the result of a basic law, and therefore doesn’t require
                  another law to explain it, it is certainly possible to put this idea in brute
                  terms. So understood, it would seem a long way from the fuzziness of natural
                  piety. Thus <name ref="McGinnColin">Colin McGinn</name>: “It is implausible to
                  take these correlations [between neurons and conscious experience] as ultimate and
                  inexplicable facts, as simply brute. And we do not want to acknowledge radical
                  emergence of the conscious with respect to the cerebral; that is too much like
                  accepting miracles <emph>de re</emph>.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="37">

                     353. </note> Here <name ref="McGinnColin">McGinn</name> dismisses natural piety
                  by linking it to belief in miracles, which seems about as far from brute empirical
                  reality as possible. <name ref="AlexanderSamuel">Alexander</name>, though, would
                  refuse to accept this distinction between the brute and the miraculous. The same
                  goes for <name ref="CraneTim">Tim Crane</name>, who argues that the natural piety
                  of the emergentists is worth attending to because “[t]he availability of the
                  emergentist position encourages us to look with suspicion on the idea that there
                     <emph>must</emph> nonetheless be a philosophical account” of the correlation
                  between body and mind. On this account, natural piety makes it possible to feel
                  that we don’t <emph>have</emph> to answer the mind-body problem. This, argues
                     <name ref="CraneTim">Crane</name>, is the epistemological attitude that
                  emergence recommends to naturalism.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="38"> See
                        <name ref="CraneTim">Crane</name>, “The Significance of Emergence,” 22. To
                     avoid confusion, I need to distinguish the attitude of natural piety from
                     position (<hi>a</hi>), for example the NCC program. Partisans of (<hi>a</hi>)
                     think we don’t have to solve the mind-body problem because it isn’t a problem;
                     partisans of natural piety think that the mind-body problem <emph>is a</emph>
                     <emph>problem</emph>; what they question is the drive to <emph>solve</emph> it.

               <p>Working from a very different theoretical archive, <name ref="FrançoisAnne-Lise"
                     >Anne-Lise François</name> reaches an analogous conclusion in her use of <name
                     ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name>ian natural piety to critique
                  biotechnology. If nature is conceptualized as simply brute, she notes, then it
                  begs for completion. Lately, of course, that completion has come in the form of
                  genetic tinkering: Bt corn, salmon that grow six times faster than normal,
                  silk-producing goats. One need not subscribe to some reified discourse of the
                  natural in order to want to resist this tinkering, which as <name
                     ref="FrançoisAnne-Lise">François</name> points out is done so often in the name
                  simply of undifferentiated “possibility,” the proliferation of “options” that
                  characterizes late capitalism, or even out of sheer boredom. Yet how does one
                  offer such resistance without fetishizing nature, falling back into a series of
                  oppositions (progressive/conservative, urban/rural, artificial/natural) that have
                  their own problematic histories? For an answer she also turns to natural piety,
                  which she nicely describes as “the precarious basis for an otherwise unjustifiable
                  choice in favor of already existing beings.”<note place="foot" n="39"

                  possible to take <name ref="AlexanderSamuel">Alexander</name> at his word and view
                  brute priority and natural piety as really two descriptions of the same thing.
                  Moreover with the example of biotechnology in mind I believe we can accept his
                  implication that natural piety is to be “preferred” precisely because the bare
                  assertion of brute priority is generally not enough to get us to leave something
                  alone. Quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>To say the least, this convergence of Derridean critique and analytic philosophy
                  of mind around a shared reading of natural piety is striking. In the context of a
                  technologically-driven imperative to outperform nature, a restless dissatisfaction
                  with the given and consequent desire to squeeze more out of it, natural piety
                  could take on a new life as a post-ideological ethic. “The challenge for the
                  critique of biotechnology,” <name ref="FrançoisAnne-Lise">François</name>
                  concludes, “is to find ways of presenting incompletion as a mode of satisfied
                  knowledge, and indeterminateness as consummate temporal experience, not simply
                  deficient and as yet unachieved cognition” (68). Perhaps it has taken the biotech
                  revolution to reveal the thread of naturalism in <name ref="WordsworthWilliam"
                     >Wordsworth</name>ian natural piety. I have been arguing, though, that this
                  thread was there all along, in the way in which the emergentist tradition took up
                     <name ref="WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</name>ian natural piety as an approach
                  to the mind-body problem. “This [emergentist] way of treating the mind-body
                  problem,” writes <name ref="CraneTim">Tim Crane</name>, assumes “that we should
                  not say <emph>a priori</emph> when we should take the facts of nature to require
                  further explanation” (23). In my judgment, coming at this attitude of
                  epistemological modesty through the history of emergentism and the mind-body
                  problem insulates natural piety from charges of ideological bad faith more
                  securely than a Derridean approach can hope to do. As inspiring as I find <name
                     ref="FrançoisAnne-Lise">François</name>’ essay, it seems to me that she is
                  walking a very thin line, and that the naturalism she recommends could be rendered
                  more robustly through an engagement with the mind-body problem. </p>

               <head>Conclusion</head>
               <p>I don’t want to be taken as arguing that emergence/natural piety, “properly
                  understood,” is actually progressive. The point, rather, is to move away from the
                  language of progressive and conservative altogether. And rather than
                  mystificatory, I would argue that emergence/natural piety is the very opposite: it
                     <emph>deflates</emph> the language of progressive and conservative because it
                  deflates the oppositions (mind/nature, subject/object) in which that particular
                  political debate is embedded, and returns us to the more defined—if no less
                  mysterious—terrain of the mind-body problem. From this perspective, natural
                  piety’s commitments are broadly empirical and scientific, Anglo rather than
                  Germanic. Here is <name ref="BroadC.D.(CharlieDunbar)">Broad</name>: <quote>There
                     is nothing, so far as I can see, mysterious or unscientific about a
                     trans-ordinal law [his word for a potentially emergent law]….A trans-ordinal
                     law is as good a law as any other; and, once it has been discovered, it can be
                     used like any other to suggest experiments, to make predictions, and to give us
                     practical control over external objects (79). </quote> This is hardly the
                  language of anti-science. But then <name ref="BroadC.D.(CharlieDunbar)"
                     >Broad</name> goes on: <quote>The only peculiarity of it is that we must wait
                     till we meet with an actual instance of an object of the higher order before we
                     can discover such a law; and that we cannot possibly deduce it beforehand from
                     any combination of laws which we have discovered by observing aggregates of a
                     lower order. (79)</quote> “We must wait” seems, these days, about all we could
                  ask. It is after all with <name ref="BroadC.D.(CharlieDunbar)">Broad</name>’s
                  basically deflationary posture in mind that <name ref="CraneTim">Tim Crane</name>
                  remarks that “there is more to be said for the attitude of ‘natural piety’ than is
                  often recognized in recent philosophy of mind.” So to, I would propose, for recent
                  business “innovations,” for recent “advances” in genetic engineering, for recent
                  global military adventures—all of which, as Francois’ analysis helps us to see,
                  rush in deductively and are thus the very opposite of the epistemically-modest
                  empiricism of natural piety that <name ref="BroadC.D.(CharlieDunbar)">Broad</name>
                  recommends.</p>
               <p>And so to, I am arguing, for recent literary study. One virtue of emergence theory
                  is that it forces us to concentrate on the murky and unclear relationship between
                  a novel property and its material determinants. Indeed, the emergentist attempt to
                  describe how C is determined by and dependent upon N, and yet is also something
                  over and above it, is a fascinating analogue of the ever-present discussion in
                  literary studies about the relationship between the literary object and the
                  various cultural forces that determine it. Like non-reductive physicalists, I
                  suspect, most of us want it both ways: we want to be able to dissolve the literary
                  object back into its social, cultural, and historical conditions, but we also
                  want, embarrassingly, to hold onto the novelty or uniqueness of the object
                     itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="41">For a related description of
                     this embarrassment, see <name ref="GiganteDenise">Denise Gigante</name>’s
                     suggestive remarks on vitalism in “Zeitgeist,” <title level="j">European
                        Romantic Review</title> 18.2 (2007) 265-72.</note> Its appearance on the
                  scene, we would like to think, was not <emph>entirely</emph> predictable. And we
                  would like to think that it has something to say to us.</p>
               <p>My claim has been that philosophical discussions of consciousness have something
                  to teach literary studies about its own hard problem. And I have suggested that
                  emergence, as one approach to the hard problem of consciousness, has important
                  roots in the Romantic period itself. So understood, emergence and its recommended
                  posture of natural piety is a theory of non-intervention—“we must wait”—and,
                  because of this, an appreciation of the difficulty and importance of the mind-body
                  problem. </p>
