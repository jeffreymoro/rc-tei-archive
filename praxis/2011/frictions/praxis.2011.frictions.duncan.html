               <p>What was Walter Scott thinking when he wrote <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>? The last but one of the Waverley novels breaks the decorum of “the classical form
                  of the historical novel,” first of all, with its setting. Constantinople, the end
                  of the eleventh century: far outside the developmental continuum through which the
                  “classical form of the historical novel,” according to Lukács, should render its “concrete
                  prehistory of the present” (269). Scott’s readers would have understood the Byzantine
                  Empire as doubly cut off from the path to modernity—by the schism between the Greek
                  and Roman churches, which made Byzantium the decadent shadow of a more vigorous western
                  civilization, and then by the Ottoman Conquest of 1453. The cast of characters conforms
                  less to a set of historical types than to one of those fantastic oriental taxonomies
                  we read about in Borges. Its specimens include Greeks, Turks, Normans, Varangians,
                  Moors, Scythians, a homicidally irascible warrior-princess, a philosopher nicknamed
                  “the Elephant,” a real elephant, a tiger, a mechanical lion, and a giant orangutan
                  named Sylvan. Scott bedevils the historical novel—his signature genre—with an alien
                  history and alien races and species.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Scott composed <em>Count Robert of Paris </em>in fits and starts between December 1830 and September 1831. He was harassed by ill
                     health, including a serious stroke, and by disagreements with his publisher, Robert
                     Cadell, and his executor and son-in-law, John Gibson Lockhart. Just over one year
                     later he was dead. Critics have not hesitated to diagnose the excesses and irregularities
                     of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> as symptoms of encroaching apoplexy—the cloudy effusion of Scott’s dotage, the decline
                     and fall of the Author of <em>Waverley</em>.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See, e.g., Hobsbaum: “Everyone who has not read Count Robert of Paris . . . knows
                              it to be unreadable” (153).</span></div>
                     </div> Much of the incoherence of the published novel is due to Cadell and Lockhart, who
                     cut and rewrote Scott’s manuscript as it went to press. J. H. Alexander’s new restoration
                     of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> for the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels allows us to read it, at last, in
                     something like the form the author intended.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> Among the passages published for the first time is an epilogue in which the ailing
                     Scott reflects on the experimental character of what he thought might be “the last
                     of my fictitious compositions” (<em>Count Robert of Paris</em> 362). The quest for “novelty at whatever rate” has driven him outside the usual ground
                     of historical fiction, “domestic nature,” to “lay his scene in distant countries,
                     among stranger nations, whose manners are imagined for the purpose of the story—nay,
                     whose powers are extended beyond those of human nature” (362). Invention crosses a
                     geographical and racial limit at which the “manners” that are governed by human nature
                     turn into “powers” that exceed it. As examples of romances that go beyond human nature
                     Scott cites Robert Paltock’s <em>The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins</em> (1751), a tale of a sailor shipwrecked on an island of flying people, and “a late
                     novel, also, by the name of Frankenstein, which turns upon a daring invention, . .
                     . the discovery of a mode by which one human being is feigned to be capable of creating
                     another” (363).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Of the two prototypes, it is clearly <em>Frankenstein</em> that grips Scott’s imagination. He had written one of the few appreciative reviews
                  of <em>Frankenstein</em>, for <em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</em> in 1818; the present reference may have been prompted by advertisements for the forthcoming
                  <em>Bentley’s Standard Novels</em> edition, revised by Mary Shelley, published one month after he completed <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>, in October 1831. On Scott’s own authority, it seems, we are to read <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> not so much as a historical novel than as a work of anthropological science fiction.
                  Here at the foundation of both genres in British Romanticism, with <em>Waverley</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em>, the link between them is revealed to be genetic as well as analogical.</p>
               <p>The name of that link, “man,” identifies the philosophical question posed in <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>. It marks the work’s historical station not just at the end of Scott’s career but
                  at the end of the philosophical project of Enlightenment, and specifically of the
                  historical and anthropological turn that project had taken in eighteenth-century Scotland.
                  In 1739 David Hume had given the project a name: “the science of MAN” (Hume 42). “There
                  is no question of importance, whose decision is not compriz’d in the science of man,”
                  Hume wrote: “In pretending to explain the principles of human nature, we in effect
                  propose a compleat system of the sciences built on a foundation almost entirely new,
                  and the only one upon which they can stand with any security” (43). The science of
                  man would also supply a foundation for that modern, post-metaphysical upstart among
                  literary genres, the novel. Hume’s contemporary Henry Fielding justified the “new
                  province of writing” with the claim that it could provide a complete, authentic representation
                  of “<em>Human Nature</em>” (Fielding 30, 68). The philosophical prestige attached to human nature would outweigh
                  such defects as the novel’s lack of a classical genealogy, its identification with
                  a mass market and with women readers, and so on. Reinforced by developments in the
                  technology of fictional realism, human nature would remain the guarantee of an otherwise
                  suspect genre for at least a generation after Charles Darwin’s decisive restructuring
                  of a post-Enlightenment human science in <em>The Descent of Man</em> (1871).</p>
               <p>By the last third of the eighteenth century, meanwhile, Scottish philosophers had
                  elected history as the discipline best equipped to realize the science of man, in
                  conjectural histories of society, of manners and institutions, and of the arts and
                  sciences, as well as of particular nations. It was the attempt to totalize these inquiries,
                  to write the history of man as a species, which laid bare a fault-line in the category’s
                  foundation. “The Human Species is in every view an interesting subject,” affirmed
                  Lord Kames, in the preface to his <em>Sketches of the History of Man</em>; however, “there is still wanting a history of the species, in its progress from
                  the savage state to its highest civilization and improvement” (Home I: 1). “The subject
                  of this volume is the <em>History of Man</em>,” wrote Lord Monboddo, introducing the fourth volume of <em>Antient Metaphysics</em>, “by which I mean, not what is commonly called History, that is the History of Nations
                  and Empires, but the History of the Species Man” (Burnett 1795: 1). These best-known
                  of Scottish essays in the history of man are notorious for their disruption of the
                  category they invoke: Kames for his contention that mankind consists of different
                  species, branded with physiological as well as linguistic difference; Monboddo for
                  his insistence that the mysterious great ape, the Orang-Outang, is man in his natural
                  state, lacking only the artificial acquirement of speech. For these accounts, it seems,
                  “man” signifies at once too much and too little.</p>
               <p>Kames’s and Monboddo’s cues are taken up with a vengeance in <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>. In Scott’s Constantinople—pullulating with different sects, nations, races, species—the
                  boundaries between race and species, and between human and non-human species, melt
                  and blur. The main figure for this boundary-flux is Sylvan, the Orang-Outang, who
                  (among other accomplishments) speaks his own “unintelligible” language and understands
                  Anglo-Saxon. Sylvan’s role has been well noted by the few critics who have discussed
                  <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>. Graham McMaster reads the orangutan as an extreme declension of the noble savage,
                  in a symbolic antithesis between nature and art (214-15), while Clare Simmons reads
                  him as the “Romantic symbol of a loss of belief in human nature” (21). Their accounts
                  frame “nature” as primarily a moral rather than a biological category in the novel.
                  The newly restored text makes clear as never before, however, Scott’s pervasive play
                  with forms of biological difference, including sexual as well as racial and species
                  difference, in this most bizarre of all his works. Sylvan is only the most conspicuous
                  figure in a horde of prodigies and monsters which overwhelms the traditional boundaries
                  of “man.” Like <em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> opens to scrutiny the “specifically anthropological discourse of man” which underwrote,
                  according to Maureen McLane, the newly-won autonomy of “literature” in British Romanticism
                  as a distinctively human praxis (10-13, 84-108).</p>
               <p>Key to what McLane calls the “ideological biologization of species difference” in
                  <em>Frankenstein</em> (107), played out through a Malthusian discourse of territory and population, is
                  that novel’s speculative reach beyond a national geography. Victor Frankenstein travels
                  beyond the habitable limits of Europe, to an alpine glacier and the Arctic Ocean,
                  while the monster proposes the settlement of his new race in the deserts of South
                  America. This sublime planetary range accommodates Shelley’s radical speculation on
                  the potentiality for other races, other species, to challenge human dominion and human
                  uniqueness. The <em>mise-en-scène</em> of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>, while less spectacularly that of an early nineteenth century world-horizon, marks
                  an analogous abandonment of the geography of national history as well as of that history’s
                  philosophical foundation, a unified human nature. Scott’s Constantinople instantiates
                  a new kind of setting for a new kind of historical romance: the cosmopolis, or world-city,
                  as conjectural arena for a post-Enlightenment world history—the natural history of
                  man.</p>

                  <p>Recent scholarship has focused on the national contexts of Scott’s work, in the legacies
                     of Scottish Enlightenment moral philosophy and historiography, in British Romanticism,
                     and in the early nineteenth-century rise of Scottish fiction.

                     </div> This emphasis has fortified a traditional preference for the novels that take their
                     subject matter from Scottish history, especially the great series of novels on the
                     modernization of Scotland, from <em>Waverley</em> (1814) to the third series of <em>Tales of My Landlord</em> (1819; with the supplement of <em>Redgauntlet</em>, 1824). The romances after <em>Ivanhoe</em> (1820), with their miscellaneous British, European and Asiatic settings, remain comparatively
                     neglected. An intermittent but decisive widening of scope across Scott’s career, from
                     the philosophical domain of national history to that of world history, remains largely
                     unexamined. Forecast as early as Scott’s second novel <em>Guy Mannering</em> (1816), with its Gypsies and off-stage Indian episodes, that shift of scope is fully
                     established in <em>Ivanhoe</em>, in which dispossessed Saxons, Norman warlords, Jews, returning Crusaders and their
                     Moorish slaves contend in the ancient forests of twelfth-century England; it is further
                     developed in <em>The Talisman</em> (1825), a tale of the Crusaders in Palestine,<em> </em>and <em>The Surgeon’s Daughter</em> (1827), partially set in South India on the eve of the second Mysore War. The critical
                     attention recently paid to Scott’s Oriental fictions has tended to frame them within
                     the geopolitical horizon of British Empire, whether in proleptic analogy (<em>Ivanhoe</em>, <em>The Talisman</em>) or historical actuality (<em>Guy Mannering</em>, <em>The Surgeon’s Daughter</em>).

                     </div> The case for reading <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> within this national and imperial field of historical-geographical reference is harder
                     to sustain. Far from being part of British imperial history, Constantinople was “a
                     seat of universal empire” (<em>Count Robert</em> 4)—and a rival universal empire, involving a rival conception of universal empire,
                     at that.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The next section of this essay will consider the symbolic status of the world city,
                  a new and vexed topos in Great Britain by the 1820s. But before we inquire what Scott
                  meant by setting his novel in eleventh-century Constantinople, let us ask: Why Paris?
                  Why should he have highlighted Paris, not Constantinople,<em> </em>in the title of a romance of the late Byzantine Empire? Fifteen years after Waterloo,
                  Paris might have ceded geopolitical primacy to London: but it could still lay claim
                  to being capital city of the ascendant domain that Pascale Casanova has called the
                  “world republic of letters.” From the late seventeenth century onwards, according
                  to Casanova, Paris established itself as the western capital of “international literary
                  space” in its first modern formation, the Enlightenment republic of letters, with
                  the French language as its universal medium (11, 67-73). In its ideology as well as
                  its practical diffusion beyond France the republic of letters was universal, cosmopolitan,
                  pre-nationalist (87). It was in a reaction against the cosmopolitan dominance of French
                  that a second developmental stage of world literary space took shape at the end of
                  the eighteenth century: the proliferation of distinctively national literatures, which
                  Casanova calls “the Herder effect,” otherwise known as Romanticism (75-79).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Casanova perfunctorily acknowledges the eighteenth-century rise of a rival British
                     literary empire and pays next to no attention to Scotland. Nevertheless her analysis
                     frames Scotland as a highly interesting case, one which we may extrapolate through
                     Tom Nairn’s influential account of Scotland’s anomalous relation to the historical
                     pathways of modernization and nationalism in his book <em>The Break-up of Britain</em>. Scotland’s project of cultural modernization, the Scottish Enlightenment, depended
                     on the establishment of what Murray Pittock has called a “separate public sphere”
                     of letters and science in the Lowland university towns (13). Distance from the seat
                     of government (after the 1707 Act of Union) made possible Scotland’s modern entry
                     into “world literary space,” even as Anglo-British assimilation provided ideological
                     cover. Rather than exemplifying the binary antagonism between core and periphery analyzed
                     in the second part of Casanova’s study, Scottish literature made itself modern in
                     a triangulation with rival centers, London and Paris. While the Scottish literati
                     harnessed English as the linguistic vehicle of Enlightenment, they sought to integrate
                     their philosophical projects with the European republic of letters of which Paris

                  <p>Scott’s fiction did not promote a separatist Scottish national destiny according to
                     the Herderian model. Rather than the Anglo-British absorption with which he has often
                     been charged, though, Scott extended the Enlightenment project of an integration of
                     Scottish literature within the larger domain of European literature, the “world republic
                     of letters”—although (to be sure) that domain was very different in 1830 from what
                     it had been before 1800, or from what it had been, for that matter, in 1814 or 1819.
                     This integration took place largely through the medium of French translation, as recent
                     scholarship on Scott’s European reception has shown. French versions of the Waverley
                     novels, by Auguste-Jean-Baptiste Defauconpret, provided the texts for their diffusion
                     into other national literatures, and foreign authors who adapted Scott’s example,
                     such as Manzoni and Pushkin, read him in that language.

                     </div> The many operatic versions of Scott, including Donizetti’s <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, were based on French stage versions adapted from Defauconpret rather than on Scott’s
                     originals. Scott helped create the conditions for this massive French-mediated reception
                     across world literary space by actively engaging continental, especially French, literary
                     traditions in his novels; in his new book on the European historical novel, Richard
                     Maxwell makes a convincing case for the genre’s articulation along a Franco-Scottish
                     axis, from Mme de Lafayette and Prévost through Scott to Hugo and Dumas. Scott, in
                     short, belonged to French literature, and thence to the world republic of letters,
                     quite as much as he did to Scottish and British traditions.</p>

               <p>Meanwhile, late-Enlightenment Paris incubated the most extreme developments of that
                  general project of the republic of letters: the Science of Man. It was in Paris, more
                  definitively than in London or Edinburgh, that formulations of the natural history
                  of man exposed the deep trouble with man as a universal category, as what had been
                  the putatively unified project of Enlightenment (unified in its theoretical articulations
                  rather than in practice) splintered into competing systems, disciplines and ideologies.
                  By the time Scott began work on <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> in 1830, the trouble had blown up into scandal. The eccentric conjectures of Kames
                  and Monboddo had been overtaken by more comprehensive and radical theories emanating
                  from the world capital of Enlightenment, where materialist declensions of the science
                  of man accompanied the revolutionary reframing of man as a universal political subject.
                  Amid a rising tide of morphological speculation on the origins of life and the transmutation
                  of species, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck cited the orangutan as a human prototype—not just
                  a type of natural man, but a figure for man’s animal genealogy.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Although it was not translated into English until the twentieth century, the arguments
                     of Lamarck’s <em>Philosophie zoologique</em> (1809) were well known in British scientific circles, above all in Edinburgh, which
                     was the center for advanced physiological thought in Britain until the founding of
                     the University of London (on Scottish principles) in the late 1820s. In the decade
                     after Waterloo (the era of the ascendancy of the Waverley novels) Scottish medical
                     graduates flocked to Paris, where they imbibed the controversial philosophical anatomy
                     of Lamarck, Xavier Bichat and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and brought the new science back
                     with them to Edinburgh. As James Secord has shown, “the earliest favorable reaction
                     to Lamarck in a British scientific periodical” appeared in an anonymous article in
                     the <em>Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal</em> in 1826. This was the period when the young Charles Darwin was studying at Edinburgh;
                     both Darwin’s mentor, Richard Edmond Grant, and Robert Jameson, the Regius Professor
                     of Natural History, have been identified as the author of the article. Grant, a far
                     more radical figure than Jameson, was appointed in 1828 to the new chair of Natural
                     History at London, where his Lamarckian enthusiasm stoked the fires of French philosophical
                     anatomy and democratic politics in the age of Reform.

                     </div> However, Secord makes a persuasive case that Jameson, not Grant, wrote the article.
                     Jameson belonged to the moderate Tory Edinburgh establishment (Scott knew him); his
                     even-handed comments on Lamarck elsewhere, and his journal’s attentiveness to the
                     latest scientific developments in France and Germany, indicate the presence of “a
                     wider circle of Scottish naturalists interested in evolution” (15-17). Secord suggests
                     that it was the tolerance for Lamarckian transformationism in respectable Edinburgh—rather
                     than its vogue in radical London—that provoked Charles Lyell’s high-profile refutation
                     in the second volume of <em>Principles of Geology</em>, published just one month after <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> in January 1832. Lyell ridicules the “progressive scheme” promoted by Lamarck, whereby
                     “the orang-outang . . . is made slowly to attain the attributes and dignity of man”
                     (193). <em>Principles of Geology</em> proposed an influential solution to the late-Enlightenment crisis of world history
                     as the history of man: that of a detour around the history of man, that minefield
                     of radical and infidel speculation, altogether. Translating the discourse of history
                     from the human sciences onto the world considered as a physical system (as in James
                     Hutton’s <em>Theory of the Earth</em>), Lyell proposed a history of the earth from which human origins were sedulously
                     excluded (a strategy that Darwin would imitate in the <em>Origin of Species</em>).

                     source of an absolutist and then revolutionary cosmopolitanism against which local,
                     organic forms of national identification could be mobilized (e.g., in Spain).

                     well as of corrosive new demographic and ideological forces—had superseded the old-regime
                     cosmopolitanism of the republic of letters.

                     </div> So Scott’s title means what it says: the Constantinople of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> situates a fantasia on the multinational, heterodox world city, the decadent capital
                     of the Enlightenment human sciences. Now, <em>circa</em> 1830, that discursive domain is falling apart, its relation to historical futurity
                     cast in doubt. If the progressive claims of Enlightenment had been discredited by
                     the terrorist meltdown of the French Revolution and its Napoleonic sequel, now a second
                     French Revolution threatens the restoration of the old regimes prescribed at the Congress
                     of Vienna. Revolution—with its claim on a political reinvention of the human—has re-entered
                     modernity to establish itself as a normal rather than a singular event. Meanwhile
                     Catholic Emancipation has legitimated a domestic heterodoxy at home in Britain, and
                     Reform, specter of a homegrown revolution, lowers on the horizon. The world city accommodates
                     not an “end of history” (see Christensen) but its disintegration.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The opening paragraphs of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> reflect upon the decadence of artificially restored empires. Scott compares Constantine’s
                     New Rome with “a new graft . . . taken from an old tree,” bound by an organic fatality
                     to resume an internal chronology of decline (<em>Count Robert</em> 3-4). The world-city is overflowing with heterogeneous creeds, nations, races, and
                     species, while alien hosts (Crusaders, Moors, Turks, Scythians) besiege it from without.
                     The mix of competing monotheisms overlays strange heresies (including, in a canceled
                     episode, Manicheans, 367-77) and Pagan survivals, such as the “brutal worship of Apis
                     and Cybele,” decayed from a state religion into popular superstition (89). More than
                     once, Scott compares Byzantine court ceremony with the “court of Pekin” (7, 147),
                     drawn into the geopolitical horizon of British knowledge through the embassies of
                     Lord Macartney (1792-94) and Lord Amherst (1816).

               <p>One effect of this monstrous distention of world space is a diffusion or fragmentation
                  of historical time, in which we lose any sense of a unitary direction along which
                  history might be unfolding. <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> thwarts readers’ expectations that the western Crusaders, for instance, might represent
                  a romantic futurity—associated with individualist virtues of honour and courage—that
                  will supersede the orientalized decadence of the Byzantines, according to the “clash
                  of civilizations” and “nature versus art” schemata that some critics have detected
                  in the novel (e.g. McMaster). Such an historical destiny is not made apparent in <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>, in which the Emperor Alexius successfully manages the Crusaders and diverts the
                  threat they represent. (Scott’s informed readers would have known, of course, about
                  the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade as well as the Ottoman conquest,
                  but the novel refrains from harping on these future catastrophes.) The eponymous Count
                  Robert and his warrior-bride Brenhilda, formidable and glamorous on their first appearance,
                  prove worse than useless in the novel’s plot. Brenhilda’s valour culminates in a grotesque
                  Amazonian duel with the historian Anna Comnena, in which she succeeds only in endangering
                  her own pregnancy. Count Robert, despite an outburst of action-hero alacrity in the
                  middle of the story, accomplishes nothing towards the resolution of the various predicaments
                  he crashes into. He does not even keep his promise to rescue the noble captive Ursel;
                  that task is taken care of by the Emperor, in one of Scott’s virtuoso essays in anticlimax.
                  Byzantine policy triumphs over Crusader prowess, however much the Western narrator
                  might profess contempt for the former and admiration for the latter. The Emperor’s
                  disavowed virtuosity consists above all in rhetoric, a crafty linguistic excess, aligned
                  with the supervening practice of the Author of <em>Waverley</em>. The narrator’s mockery of the “fair historian” Anna Comnena, sealed with a formal
                  parody of her <em>Alexiad</em> in the fourth chapter, frames the open secret of their stylistic affinity. “Scott
                  moves to become what he beholds,” notes Jerome McGann; since “[his] own style has
                  over the years grown increasingly elaborate and formulaic[,] [t]o pastiche Comnena’s
                  prose . . . is to fashion a critical measure of his own” (124)—ornate, murky, “Byzantine”
                  indeed.</p>
               <p>Any sense of a governing historical progress or developmental direction is exploded
                  into a multitude of competing paths. The world-city opens up for the imagination alternative
                  modes and directions besides the progressive model of Enlightenment conjectural history,
                  supposed to structure particular national destinies. Scott’s opening rendition of
                  the <em>translatio imperii</em>, as a civilizational grafting that reiterates an inexorable process of decay instead
                  of a renovation, has already been mentioned. Later, we learn how the Anglo-Saxon rebels
                  who sought refuge in the greenwood after the Norman Conquest “made a step backwards
                  in civilisation, and became more like their remote ancestors of German descent, than
                  they were to their more immediate and civilized predecessors. . . . Old superstitions
                  had begun to revive among them,” drained however “of the sincere belief which was
                  entertained by their heathen ancestors” (<em>Count Robert</em> 209). Scott reimagines Robin Hood and his band—mythic figures from his own <em>Ivanhoe</em>—as inauthentic and degenerate. At the same time these “Foresters,” natural Malthusians,
                  regulate their population by chaste practices of “moderation and self-denial” (210).
                  It appears that those who regress from civilization to the woods, as a consequence
                  of world-historical defeat, are better able to constitute a virtuous organic community
                  than those who have not yet left the woods.</p>
               <p>Volume Two of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> closes with a striking instance of what the narrator calls “retrograde evolution”
                  (255). The Crusaders have crossed the Bosphorus to the Asian shore on their way to
                  Jerusalem, after swearing an oath “never to turn back upon the sacred journey.” When
                  they learn that Count Robert and his bride are in trouble back in Constantinople,
                  they must figure out a way to rescue them without breaking their oath. “Are we such
                  bad horsemen, or are our steeds so awkward, that we cannot rein them back from this
                  to the landing-place at Scutari?” one of them suggests: “We can get them on shipboard
                  in the same retrograde manner, and when we arrive in Europe, where our vow binds us
                  no longer, the Count and Countess of Paris are rescued” (253). The inhabitants of
                  Scutari are duly treated to the spectacle of a column of knights riding their horses
                  backwards onto the transport barges.</p>

               <p>The Crusaders’ “retrograde evolution” is a grotesquely literal acting-out of a developmental
                  dynamic or potential that pulls at the various histories, destinies and identities
                  entangled in <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>. History is not bound to move forward—whatever forward might mean; it might fall
                  backwards, or slide sideways, or go off in some other, unheard-of direction. It is
                  not only progress that is at stake, more than ever discredited by its Lamarckian application
                  to an evolutionary account of natural history. Scott’s Constantinople accommodates
                  an imaginary breakup of the monogenetic developmentalism that (this novel lets us
                  see) has underpinned the national history addressed in the great sequence of his Scottish
                  Waverley novels. “Monogenesis” designates the orthodox anthropological principle that
                  all humans are descended from a common origin and thus comprise a single race or species.
                  The principle governs the ideology of unified development, or a shared single history,
                  which a particular people or nation, such as Scotland, must join on the path to modernity.</p>
               <p>In those key reflections on his art, the prefatory chapter to<em>Waverley</em> and the dedicatory epistle to <em>Ivanhoe</em>, Scott cites a universal human nature, constant across all differences of time and
                  place, as the philosophical basis for the kind of novel he is writing: <span class="quote">‘Considering the disadvantages inseparable from this part of my subject, I must be

                     of black letter or wire-wove and hot-pressed, that I have venturously essayed to read
                     a chapter to the public. (<em>Waverley</em> 5-6)’</span> In observing the sameness of “the passions . . . in all stages of society,” the historical
                  novel advertises itself as a faithful edition of “the great book of Nature.” The gap
                  between past and present in <em>Waverley</em>—“sixty years since”—becomes a gulf of six centuries, rather more difficult to navigate,
                  in <em>Ivanhoe</em>: <br/> <span class="quote">‘What I have applied to language, is still more justly applicable to sentiments and
                     manners. The passions, the sources from which these must spring in all their modifications,
                     are generally the same in all ranks and conditions, all countries and ages; and it
                     follows, as a matter of course, that the opinions, habits of thinking, and actions,
                     however influenced by the peculiar state of society, must still, upon the whole, bear
                     a strong resemblance to each other. Our ancestors were not more distinct from us,
                     surely, than Jews are from Christians[.] (<em>Ivanhoe</em> 19-20)’</span> The story that follows turns the proposition into a profoundly uncomfortable question:
                  How distinct are Jews from Christians? In drawing an equivalence between the diachronic
                  difference between ourselves and our ancestors and the synchronic difference between
                  Jews and Christians, Scott alludes to the scriptural resolution of that equivalence,
                  whereby an archaic Jewish dispensation is redeemed into an enlightened Christian one.
                  Ethically speaking, however—that is, viewed with an enlightened disregard for dogma—Rebecca
                  the Jewess turns out to be more chivalrous and a better Christian than any of the
                  Christian knights in <em>Ivanhoe</em>. She speaks more eloquently than anyone for a humane futurity. She is more human
                  than “our ancestors.” All the same she is exiled from the proto-national community,

                  <p>The sublime widening of historical distance in <em>Ivanhoe</em>, and that novel’s disintegration of “England” into a welter of alien ethnicities
                     and castes, look forward to the more radical experiment of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>, which opens up a “polygenetic” potentiality of evolutionary trajectories and forms,
                     enabled by its setting of a world-city severed both from western religious orthodoxy
                     and from the developmental path to modernity. Polygenesis, the heterodox doctrine
                     that humankind consists of different races or species with separate origins, had been
                     broached in Scotland by Kames in his <em>Sketches of the History of Man</em>. Addressing the question “whether there are different races of men, or whether all
                     men are of one race without any difference but what proceeds from climate or other
                     external cause,” Kames concluded that “there are different species of men as well
                     as of dogs” (Home I: 3, 20). Species differentiation occurred, along with linguistic
                     differentiation, as “an immediate change of bodily constitution” after the fall of
                     the Tower of Babel (I: 76). Polygenetic speculation was becoming increasingly current
                     in advanced scientific thought by the late 1820s and 1830s, undermining what had been
                     a monogenetic orthodoxy, until it informed an ascendant racial science in mid-nineteenth
                     century Britain and the USA. (The most notorious polygenetic thesis, <em>The Races of Men: A Fragment</em> (1850), would issue from a Scottish pen—that of Robert Knox, the radical anatomist
                     tainted by the Burke and Hare scandal in 1828-29, classmate of Robert E. Grant and
                     one of Scott’s <em>bêtes noires</em>. The actual terms, monogenesis and polygenesis, would not be formulated until the
                     1860s.

                     of constant interrogation. Count Robert, Hereward the Varangian, and Anna Comnena
                     dispute whether or not the Normans and Franks are the same people (<em>Count Robert</em> 142-43). Alexius lectures Brenhilda on the clash of civilizations memorialized in
                     the <em>Iliad</em>: “the offences of Paris were those of a dissolute Asiatic; the courage which avenged
                     them was that of the Greek Empire” (195). The character of his own Greek Empire, more
                     dissolute and Asiatic than heroic, belies this racialized distinction.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Most striking is the novel’s set of limit cases of human racial difference. The first
                  of these is instantiated (predictably) by Africans, reduced to slavery and subject
                  to a not-always-specified physical deformation. (Mutes and eunuchs seem to share the
                  same kind of disability.) The philosopher Agelastes holds forth hypocritically on
                  the separate status of “the race of Ham” as justification for their enslavement (128).
                  His slave Diogenes rebukes as “childish” Hereward’s suspicion that he might be the
                  devil, and ironizes the signs of his own difference: <span class="quote">‘“Thou objectest sorely to my complexion,” said the negro; “how knowest thou that

                     yet thou knowest that this is by no means owing to any habitual colour of the heavens
                     themselves . . . How canst thou tell, but what the difference of my colour from thine
                     own may be owing to some circumstance of a similar nature—not real of itself, but

                  Christianity has acquired a biological, embodied cast, so that heterodoxy is expressed
                  as a physical deformity: the Orthodox Patriarch complains that, whereas the Greek
                  cross exhibits “limbs of the same length,” in the Latin cross an “irregular and most
                  damnable error prolongs the nether limb of that most holy emblem” (84).</p>

                     that in Constantinople “the race of the Greeks was no longer to be seen, even in its
                     native country, unmixed, or in absolute purity; on the contrary, there were features
                     which argued a different descent” (125). The reflection takes a nightmarish turn: <span class="quote">‘A party of heathen Scythians, presented the deformed features of the daemons whom
                        they were said to worship—that is, having flat noses with expanded nostrils, which
                        seemed to admit the sight to their very brain; faces which extended rather in breadth
                        than length, with strange unintellectual eyes placed in the extremity; figures short
                        and dwarfish, yet garnished with legs and arms of astonishing sinewy strength, disproportioned

                     infernal spirits, and the Huns were the offspring of this execrable conjunction” (qtd.
                     in <em>Count Robert</em> 525). The allusion infects the novel’s anthropology with its conjecture of monstrous
                     descent.

                     of philosophical history than fables of miscegenation with devils. In admitting Orang-Outangs
                     to fully human status as “a barbarous nation, which has not yet learned the use of
                     speech,” Monboddo contradicted his principal source, Buffon, who insisted that the
                     creature was “nothing but a real brute, endowed with the external mark of humanity,
                     but deprived of thought, and of every faculty which properly constitutes the human
                     species” (Burnett I: 270-312 (270); Buffon X: 37). Buffon acknowledges however that
                     this verdict relies on faith in a “divine spirit” which has endowed humanity with
                     reason and language—since physical evidence alone would compel us to regard the orangutan
                     “as a variety of the human species” (X: 27).

                     </div> Evicting the divine spirit, Lamarck claimed the Orang-Outang as not just a human relative
                     but a human ancestor. This liminal being enjoyed a vogue in Romantic fiction, with
                     versions by Peacock, Hogg, and Poe, as well as Scott himself; more thoroughly than
                     its precursors, <em>Count Robert of Paris</em> exploits the categorical confusion and instability marked by the Orang-Outang in early
                     nineteenth-century natural philosophy, rather than endorsing any particular scientific
                     theory (McMaster 212; Simmons 25). Where various characters mistake Sylvan for the
                     devil or a knight transformed by witchcraft, the narrator is carefully equivocal.
                     “The creature . . . it would have been rash to have termed it a man,” he calls it
                     (<em>Count Robert</em> 170): “the tremendous creature, so like, yet so very unlike to the human form . .
                     . the creature in question, whose appearance seemed to the Count of Paris so very
                     problematical, was a specimen of that gigantic species of ape—if it is not indeed
                     some animal more nearly allied to ourselves—to which, I believe, naturalists have
                     given the name of Ourang Outang” (171). A dozen years earlier, Scott had alluded to
                     the enigmatic status of the orangutan in his depiction of pre-modern human communities
                     in <em>Rob Roy</em>—not to suggest that the Highlanders are literally a sort of Caledonian apeman, or
                     even a separate race, but rather to conjure the possibility of a separate developmental
                     path that the novel begins to imagine (if only optatively) for them, in a departure
                     from the monogenetic British history invoked in <em>Waverley</em>. Moderns and primitives coexist within an imperial world order which sustains itself
                     upon the perpetuation of radical forms of difference.

                  McMaster contends that the Orang-Outang belongs to a conjectural-historical chain
                  of versions of “natural man” in the novel, along with Hereward the Forester (whose
                  physical beauty, extolled in the opening episode, has something grotesque about it)
                  and Count Robert himself (McMaster 214-15). On the other side of the species barrier,
                  Simmons shows how the Emperor’s menagerie of non-human beings—elephant, giraffe, tiger,
                  clockwork lion—involves the orangutan in a satirical “confusion between beasts, man-beasts,
                  and man-made beasts” (Simmons 27). To these we should add the human monsters in the
                  novel that are marked by another sort of biological difference, namely sexual difference.
                  The Countess Brenhilda is persistently characterized as “[s]omething between man and
                  woman” (<em>Count Robert</em> 180), thanks to the “fantastic appearance of her half-masculine garb” (133). It turns
                  out that the warrior-woman is pregnant, even as she takes up arms in the novel’s bizarre
                  climax. Biology trumps habit: Brenhilda faints before she can engage battle. The duel
                  confirms the status of her opponent, Anna Comnena, as a complementary freak, the bluestocking.
                  Early on we are told that intellectual activity has unsexed Anna: “she had somewhat
                  lost the charms of her person as she became enriched in her mind” (37). “A woman who
                  is pitiless, is a worse monster than one who is unsexed,” the Empress Irene (herself
                  something of a monster) upbraids her daughter (284).</p>

                     Agelastes is surprised by the sudden intrusion of a figure resembling “the Satan of
                     Christian mythology, or a satyr of the heathen age” (270). This turns out to be Sylvan,
                     the Orang-Outang. Monboddo had accepted satyrs, along with mermaids, men with tails,
                     dog-headed men, and men with eyes in their breasts, as legitimate varieties of humankind
                     alongside the orangutan, although Scott is alluding to a more modest conjecture that
                     ancient accounts of satyrs might have been based on travellers’ tales of great apes
                     (Burnett 1784: III: 254-64).

                     </div> Sylvan’s role as satyr will be confirmed at his last appearance in the novel, as closing
                     act to the tragi-comical sequence of combats. More consequential is his role here
                     (not for the first time) as the devil. Agelastes has just been scoffing at “the Christian
                     Satan,” whose “goatish figure and limbs, with grotesque features,” in violation of
                     the scriptural principle of monogenesis, represent a bad theology as well as bad aesthetics
                     and bad biology (<em>Count Robert</em> 270). Sylvan proceeds to throttle Agelastes, an event interpreted by the onlookers
                     as “the judgment of Heaven.” Certainly this is a startlingly abrupt explosion of poetic
                     justice. Agelastes is the worst of the book’s villains, a seditious freethinker, just
                     the sort of rogue who would be promoting evolutionary, polygenetic and other materialist
                     speculations for subversive political ends in Scott’s day. Yet Sylvan, conjured up
                     by Agelastes’ denunciation of the Christian Satan, realizes a euhemeristic demystification
                     of that improbable demon, in keeping with the demystification of the heathen satyr:
                     he is himself the grotesque hybrid that Agelastes ridicules. Scott reinscribes the
                     heterodoxy that is ostensibly being punished, in the form of a complicated joke. The
                     orangutan may not be the devil—all the same, the devil may be nothing more than an
                     orangutan.</p>

                  <p>Whenever he shows up in <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>, Sylvan provokes strange textual disturbances. His intervention in the tale sets
                     off figural mutations and slippages which trace a lateral or retrograde motion—an
                     associative logic not of science, of an empirically verifiable scheme of cause and
                     effect, but of something like dreamwork, of metaphor and metamorphosis: a logic of
                     romance. Consider the Orang-Outang’s second irruption into the novel, which leads
                     to the recasting of Hereward, a soldier in the imperial guard, as a “Forester,” a
                     virtuous version of the “man of the woods.” A beautiful young lady rushes onto the
                     scene with the Orang-Outang in pursuit. After chasing him away Hereward recognizes
                     his long-lost love, Bertha, who recognizes Hereward in turn by the scar of a boar’s
                     tusk on his brow. We find ourselves rapt into a suddenly intensified zone or atmosphere
                     of romance, charged with allusions not just to the <em>Odyssey</em> but (as Simmons points out) to <em>The Faerie Queene</em>, in which the chivalrous forester Sir Satyrane defends virgins from giants and wild
                     men. “Have I but dreamed of that monstrous ogre?” Bertha asks. Hereward’s reassurance,
                     “That hideous thing exists,” gives the cue for the recognition scene and—true to the
                     Odyssean analogue—a retrograde narrative plunge to his youthful encounter with another
                     “hideous animal” or “monster,” the wild boar (208). The recognition scene generates,
                     in turn, the back-story of the Foresters, the Saxon insurgents who “made a step backwards
                     in civilization” and returned to the woods.</p>
                  <p>The regressive, oneiric, metamorphic logic of romance is sustained most powerfully
                     in the <em>outré</em> sequence, midway through the novel, in which Sylvan makes his first appearance. On
                     this occasion the orangutan closes rather than initiates the series of figural mutations.
                     Invited to dinner at the imperial palace, Count Robert is startled by the ramping
                     of the Emperor’s mechanical lion. He smashes its skull with a blow of his fist—clockwork
                     cogs and springs litter the floor. After the banquet, Robert wakes up (he has been
                     drugged) to find himself in an underground dungeon, where he is menaced by a tiger—a
                     real tiger, this time, not a mechanical one. Once again he reacts by smashing its
                     skull. Scott’s description renders the tiger, despite its reality, more like an effect
                     in a magic-lantern show—“two balls of red light”—than a flesh-and-blood animal: “he
                     gazed eagerly around, but could discern nothing, except two balls of red light which
                     shone from the darkness with a self-emitted brilliancy, like the eyes of a wild animal
                     while it glares upon its prey” (161). This apparition generates the voice of a fellow
                     prisoner, invisible in the darkness, who informs Robert that <em>his</em> eyeballs have been put out with red-hot irons. The mutilation of eyes or tongues
                     (or, less explicitly, genitals), in a metonymic chain of disfigurements that recurs
                     across the novel, marks the victim’s removal from fully human status. Deprived of
                     the organs of speech or vision, he is reduced to a mere body, to “bare life,” the
                     condition of a beast or slave. (The prisoner’s name, “Ursel,” also recalls “bear,”
                     the anthropomorphic beast of the woods that historically precedes the theriomorphic
                     man of the woods, the Enlightenment orangutan.) So at last the grotesque semi-human
                     captive, Sylvan, makes his appearance, babbling strange sounds that—in the absence
                     of his tribe—may or may not constitute a language.</p>
                  <div class="wrapper">
                     <p>What logic moves this strange narrative sequence, with its delirious transitions and
                        transformations, its cryptic series of antitheses? Mechanical animal versus living
                        animal; animal eyes without body versus a human body without eyes; the man bereft
                        of the endowment of humanity (vision) versus the animal that possesses it (language).
                        These symbolic oppositions recapitulate the historical set of conjectures about the
                        essential distinction between humans and animals which informed the Enlightenment
                        project of the “science of man”: from the Cartesian account of the animal as machine,
                        through the empiricist abstraction of a vision-based cognition, to the Romantic investment
                        in language as the uniquely human property.

                  <p>The set of conjectures resurfaces, recombined, near the end of the novel. The captive
                     Ursel turns out not to have been blinded after all. Released from prison, high on
                     a terrace overlooking the city, he experiences a return of vision that is scarcely
                     less traumatic than an actual blinding: <span class="quote">‘His eyeballs had been long untrained by that daily exercise, which teaches us the
                        habit of correcting the scenes as they appear to our sight, by our actual knowledge
                        of the truth as it exists in nature. His idea of distance was so confused, that it
                        seemed as if all the spires, turrets and minarets which he beheld, were crowded forward
                        upon his eyeballs, and almost touching them. With a shriek of horror, Ursel turned
                        himself to the further side[.] (295)’</span> This particular instance of “retrograde evolution”—from blindness to a sight that
                     bears the violent effect of blindness—does not so much look forward (for example,
                     to the urban agoraphobia of the view from Todgers’s in Dickens’s <em>Martin Chuzzlewit</em>) as back: to the Platonic allegory of enlightenment as emergence from a cave. Scott’s
                     formulation however is radically empiricist rather than platonic; it recalls the conjecture
                     on the reality of pigment with which the slave Diogenes taunts his interlocutors,
                     quoted earlier. If the operation of the senses is plastic rather than fixed, subject
                     to conditioning, neither is it the case that “our actual knowledge of the truth as
                     it exists in nature” precedes any sensory input. Cognition and physical organization,
                     rather, shape one another in a process of experimental “correction.”</p>
                  <p>Shortly afterwards the narrator recurs to this moment, in the reaction of the conspirator
                     Nicephorus Briennius to the reversal of his plans: <span class="quote">‘The pardoned Caesar . . . found it as difficult to reconcile himself to the reality
                        of his situation as Ursel to the face of nature, after having been long deprived of
                        enjoying it; so much do the dizziness and confusion of ideas, occasioned by moral
                        and physical causes of surprise and terror, resemble each other in their effects on
                        the understanding. (322)’</span> Nicephorus suffers what is more explicitly a narrative vertigo, as he discovers himself
                     to be a character in a plot when he had imagined himself to be the author of it. His
                     “dizziness and confusion” mirror the dizziness and confusion that perturb readers
                     of <em>Count Robert of Paris</em>. Only, as readers of a novel, we are apt to experience that perturbation—the regression
                     from a conditioned blindness to a vision that is itself blinding—as sublime effects
                     of an aesthetic enjoyment, rather than as sensory distress.</p>
                  <div class="wrapper">
                     <p>Scott’s late romance does not attempt to pacify the turmoil afflicting the “science
                        of man” <em>circa</em> 1830 into any fixed knowledge. We are not to look in these pages for a determination,
                        even an allegorical one, of the taxonomic status of man as a race or species. “In
                        our culture,” writes Giorgio Agamben, “man has always been thought of as the articulation
                        and conjunction of a body and soul, of a living thing and a <em>logos</em>, of a natural (or animal) element and a supernatural or social or divine element.
                        We must learn instead,” he adds, “to think of man as what results from the incongruity
                        of these two elements, and investigate not the metaphysical mystery of conjunction,
                        but rather the practical and political mystery of separation” (16). Scott’s novel,
                        through the techniques peculiar to fiction, begins that work of disarticulation. The
                        uncanny underground apparition of “two balls of red light,” at once juxtaposed with
                        and detached from the prisoner who believes he has been blinded, constitutes the reflective
                        core of <em>Count Robert of Paris </em>—the figure for vision, metonymically dislodged, as mark of the reader’s gaze. Here,
                        disoriented from a daylight logic of cause and effect, flung deepest into a delirium
                        of romantic adventure, we catch a glimpse of ourselves: neither as human countenances
                        nor organic bodies but as dislocated perceptual fragments embedded in a meaning-generating
                        apparatus, the literary work. What we are seeing is the reflection of our own vision,
                        bloodshot with passionate amazement and with the sheer effort to see—reading in the
                        dark.
