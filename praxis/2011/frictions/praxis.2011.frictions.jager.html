                  <p>Talk of consciousness has largely disappeared from Romantic studies and, indeed, from
                     literary scholarship more generally. As a symbol of this disappearance we might look
                     to Harold Bloom’s edited volume <em>Romanticism and Consciousness</em> (1970). While the volume was officially dedicated to the proposition that to talk
                     about Romanticism simply <em>was</em> to talk about consciousness, its inclusion of Paul de Man’s essay “The Intentional
                     Structure of the Romantic Image” (written in 1960) in fact marked the beginning of
                     the end of the association between Romanticism and consciousness. Some years later <span class="name">de Man</span> could retrospectively mark his own deconstructive turn as a swerve, however imperfect,
                     from consciousness-talk. Writing in 1983, looking back on his landmark 1969 essay
                     “The Rhetoric of Temporality,” <span class="name">de Man</span> remarked that the essay was “still uncomfortably intertwined with the thematic vocabulary
                     of consciousness … that was current at the time, but it signals a turn that, at least
                     for me, has proven to be productive.”

                              of course, was to substitute language—allegory, specifically—for the subject-object
                              dialectic that had dominated post-Kantian idealism; the implication is that with this

                     and J. Hillis Miller), and also in Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy’s <em>Literary Absolute</em> (1978).</p>

                  <p>Meanwhile, the historicism that has dominated Romantic studies for the past-quarter
                     century has likewise had little patience with consciousness talk. Inspired by Marx
                     and Engels’s <em>German Ideology</em>, it has tended to identify consciousness with “false consciousness.” There is a complicated
                     intellectual history here that would have to be traced in some detail. Perhaps we
                     can simply note, first, that some of the foundational texts for this turn date, like

                  <p>And yet, as sometimes happens in academic discourse, the preoccupations that disappeared
                     in one quarter have popped up in another. As consciousness-talk was disappearing from
                     literary study (especially from versions of literary study that referenced Continental
                     philosophy), it was re-emerging in neuroscience and philosophy of mind. Under the
                     influence of behaviorism, Anglo-American philosophy had gone through its own skepticism
                     about consciousness in the early years of the twentieth century, but the demise of
                     behaviorism after the middle of the century and the rise of what we now know as cognitive
                     science has resulted in a rich, varied, and completely unresolved conversation about
                     the mind’s relationship to the brain and how that relationship might produce conscious
                     experience. Thus Jerry Fodor, from a recent essay in the <em>London Review of Books</em>: <span class="quote">‘Consciousness is all the rage just now. It boasts new journals of its very own, from
                        which learned articles overflow. Neuropsychologists snap its picture (in colour) with
                        fMRI machines, and probe with needles for its seat in the brain. At all seasons, and
                        on many continents, interdisciplinary conferences about consciousness draw together
                        bizarre motleys that include philosophers, psychologists, phenomenologists, brain
                        scientists, MDs, computer scientists, the Dalai Lama, novelists, neurologists, graphic
                        artists, priests, gurus and (always) people who used to do physics. Institutes of
                        consciousness studies are bountifully subsidised. Meticulous distinctions are drawn
                        between the merely conscious and the consciously available; and between each of these
                        and the preconscious, the unconscious, the subconscious, the informationally encapsulated
                        and the introspectable. There is no end of consciousness gossip on Tuesdays in the
                        science section of the <em>New York Times</em>. Periodically, Nobel laureates pronounce on the connections between consciousness
                        and evolution, quantum mechanics, information theory, complexity theory, chaos theory
                        and the activity of neural nets. Everybody gives lectures about consciousness to everybody
                        else. But for all that, nothing has been ascertained with respect to the problem that
                        everybody worries about most: what philosophers have come to call ‘the hard problem’.
                        The hard problem is this: it is widely supposed that the world is made entirely of
                        mere matter, but how could mere matter be conscious? How, in particular, could a couple
                        of pounds of grey tissue have experiences?

               <p>It may seem that talking about consciousness will re-open the very Pandora’s Box of
                  dualism that literary scholars have spent the last 40 years trying to close. One might
                  posit, moreover, that the Romantic writers themselves were anti-dualist (something
                  not always appreciated by their later admirers) and thus that talking about consciousness
                  again would be like turning back the clock. And yet a substantial number of cognitive
                  scientists and philosophers of mind writing today agree that consciousness-talk and
                  physicalism are not, in principle, mutually exclusive. Indeed, as Fodor’s comments
                  suggest, this is precisely the issue around which a good deal of the current conversation
                  circles: whether one can both be a physicalist <em>and</em> grant the legitimacy of our phenomenal experiences. The fact is that we have conscious
                  experiences (C); the perplexing question is how those experiences relate to a neural
                  substrate (N).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As Fodor indicates, how we get from N to C has become known in philosophy of mind
                     as the “hard problem.”

                     </div> And although the hard problem has gotten a lot of attention lately, its roots go back
                     to the beginning of modern philosophy. Descartes worried about the causal interaction
                     between brain and mind and eventually settled on the pineal gland as the place where
                     they came together, though this didn’t convince some of his contemporaries. With the
                     famous analogy of the mill in his <em>Monadology</em>, meanwhile, Leibniz suggested that materialism couldn’t account for perception. By
                     1866 Thomas Huxley had posed the hard problem in a recognizably modern form: “[H]ow
                     it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result
                     of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin
                     when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.” In 1985 Thomas Nagel reiterated the point: “The strange
                     truth seems to be that certain complex, biologically generated physical systems, of
                     which each of us is an example, have rich nonphysical properties.” This happens, Nagel
                     continued, “in some way that we do not now understand.”

                     tend to use the terms interchangeably; we might speak about a character—Prufrock,
                     for instance—as being overly conscious, by which we mean excessively self-aware. This
                     is essentially the same state that Coleridge calls “Dejection,” and that Wordsworth
                     analyzes in the opening 200 lines of <em>The Prelude</em>. A more accurate title for Bloom’s volume would have been <em>Romanticism and Self-Consciousness</em>. When philosophers and cognitive scientists speak of consciousness, by contrast,
                     they mean something more basic. Here is John Searle’s definition: “those states of
                     sentience or feeling or awareness that begin when you wake up from a dreamless sleep
                     and continue on throughout the day until you fall asleep again, or otherwise become
                     unconscious. Dreams are also a form of consciousness.”

                  <p>Consciousness in this strict sense is sometimes referred to as “phenomenal consciousness”
                     because it seems to have phenomenal qualities: there is a redness to the red rose
                     that I see in my garden; there is a painness to the pain I feel when its thorn pricks
                     my finger. There is <em>something that it is like for me</em> to see or feel these things. In his classic 1974 article “What Is It Like to Be a
                     Bat?” Thomas Nagel helped to put this subjective character of experience at the center
                     of the reviving consciousness conversation. According to Nagel, we can safely assume
                     that bats have experiences; but bats are neurologically different enough from humans
                     that we can also assume that their experiences are quite different. So what is it
                     like to be a bat, then? Nagel argues that there is no way we could know, because the
                     facts of experience are only accessible from one point of view: in this case, the
                     bat’s. If this is right, then there is no way that an objective physical description—of
                     the way that sonar works, for example—could capture the subjective character of the
                     experience that sonar delivers.

                              noting that this phrase is not intended to name a metaphorical relationship but rather
                              to mark the specificity of a first-person phenomenal experience. A reader might nonetheless
                              wonder about the largely unexamined appeal to “likeness” in the philosophical literature
                              on consciousness.</span></div>

                  <p>Now it might be that the notion of consciousness in this sense isn’t very interesting
                     for literary studies; its focus on first-person phenomenal experience would seem to
                     require attention of the sort that disappeared from literary study with the collapse
                     of phenomenology. Thinking in terms of <em>self</em>-consciousness and its deconstruction, by contrast, allows us to bring culture and
                     history and biography into the mix and this is where most of the action has been for
                     literary studies.

                              aspires to describe what it feels like to be conscious; think of a Henry James novel,
                              or the modernist experiments of Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, and others. Arguably, this is
                              true as well of earlier writers and techniques: free indirect style, for example,
                              or the movements of thought characteristic of the Greater Romantic Lyric. We could
                              surely go back further. </span></div>
                     </div> It is commonly asserted, for example, that the Romantic period witnessed an unprecedented
                     level of historical self-consciousness. The gamble of this essay, however, is that
                     students of literature and culture have something to learn from the challenges involved
                     in grappling with the “hard problem” of consciousness rather than simply overleaping
                     it on the way to issue of self-consciousness. Having now distinguished consciousness
                     from self-consciousness a little more fully, I turn in sections two and three to the
                     position often described as “neural correlates of consciousness” (NCC), a position
                     that tends to avoid strictly philosophical considerations. I will suggest that Alan
                     Richardson’s recent work on Romantic-era brain science overlaps with the NCC position.
                     In section four I turn to <em>emergence theory</em>, a variant of position (<span class="hi">c</span>) with important Romantic-era roots; in section five I consider Alan Liu’s recent
                     writings about emergence. In sections six and seven I distinguish my position from
                     Liu’s by identifying “natural piety” as the characteristic attitude of emergence theory,
                     and I extrapolate natural piety’s importance for thinking about the relationship between
                     Romantic culture and mind-body questions. At stake is a Romantic physicalism that
                     can only be recovered, I argue, when literary study turns its attention to the mind-body
                     problem and the question of phenomenal consciousness that makes that problem so hard.</p>

                     philosophers) are getting to work solving it. They are busy searching for what they
                     call the “Neural Correlates of Consciousness” (NCC). It should be noted that everybody
                     thinking about the mind-body problem takes it for granted that conscious states and
                     neuronal states correlate in some way. The question is whether an accurate description
                     of that correlation is all that is required to explain consciousness. The NCC proponents
                     are betting that the answer is “yes.” If we map the NCC, their thinking goes, we will
                     either get consciousness along the way (which will indicate that the hard problem
                     wasn’t such a hard problem after all) or we’ll discover that we don’t really need
                     a theory of consciousness at all (which will indicate that the hard problem was a
                     pseudo-problem). The late Francis Crick and his colleague Christof Koch have been
                     among the most prominent exponents of this approach, arguing for example that identifying
                     neural correlates could make the hard problem “appear in an entirely new light. It

                     </div> For an NCC program to succeed, all that would be needed would be to locate exactly
                     where and how a particular group of neurons fires when I see red, or prick my finger
                     with a needle, or smell my coffee in the morning: “locating the neurons in the cerebral
                     cortex that correlate best with consciousness, and figuring out how they link to neurons
                     elsewhere in the brain,” as Crick and Koch put it (84). We may not have the technology
                     to map NCC so precisely right now, but in principle it certainly seems possible.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Even if it were possible, however, this might not make the hard problem disappear.
                  Just because a particular group of neurons fires when I see a red tomato does not
                  explain why the tomato appears to me in the way that it does, and not in some other
                  way or in no way at all. In some respects this is a disciplinary issue; neuroscientists
                  tend to be more interested in finding NCC than in pausing over the precise relationship
                  between N and C; many philosophers, meanwhile, have insisted that if we ignore the
                  philosophical issue of how we get from N to C we ignore the very thing that is interesting
                  about consciousness, namely that it has about it a first-person, “what it is like”
                  quality. Here are two quick examples of the philosophical issues that an NCC program
                  tends to ignore. Crick and Koch hold to a theory they call “explicit neuronal representation”
                  in order to explain why subjective experience is private. Mental representations,
                  they think, can’t be adequately communicated in language. But representationalism
                  is a hotly debated topic within philosophy of mind, and it entails other metaphysical
                  and epistemological positions (about the nature of the content of mental states, for
                  example); Crick and Koch can’t just have “representation” for free. In a similar manner,
                  they propose that “meaning” (our recognizing a certain face, say, as belonging to
                  a loved one) is the result of networks of association spread throughout the cortical
                  system. But association and meaning are also loaded terms; again, Crick and Koch can’t
                  simply help themselves to these concepts without discussing the philosophical positions
                  they entail.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>From a certain perspective, then, the NCC program seems both philosophically unsophisticated
                     and methodologically uninterested in the first-person quality of phenomenal experience.
                     In his famous article “Epiphenomenal Qualia,” Frank Jackson formulates these objections
                     with somewhat greater precision by calling attention to the qualitative dimensions
                     of experience—what have become known in the literature as “qualia.” Jackson’s argument
                     depends on a thought experiment. He asks us to imagine Mary, a neuroscientist who
                     knows everything there is to know about the science of vision. In particular, Mary
                     knows exactly what happens in the visual cortex when it encounters the different wavelengths
                     that produce the experience of color. However, for perverse and unexplained reasons,
                     Mary has spent her entire life in a black-and-white room. So Mary knows everything
                     there is to know about color, but she has never <em>seen</em> color. Then, one day, Mary leaves her black-and-white room and encounters color (for
                     some reason it is almost always red in these examples) for the first time. The question
                     is how we describe what has happened to Mary. Jackson argues that at the moment she
                     sees red Mary learns something that she didn’t know before: she learns what red <em>is like</em>—she experiences its qualitative character. But Mary already knew everything that
                     there was to know about the physical facts of color. So the physical facts must not
                     be all the facts.

                  it is like to see red, he thinks, cannot be captured by even a complete knowledge

               <h2><span class="head">3. Richardson and Romantic Brain Science</span></h2>
               <p>Alan Richardson’s pathbreaking 2001 book <em>British Romanticism and the Science of Mind </em>has done a great deal to make neurological history important for Romantic studies.
                  Through careful archival work and impressive scholarship, Richardson reveals the importance
                  of a number of brain scientists of the period, including F. J. Gall, Charles Bell,
                  Erasmus Darwin, and Sir William Lawrence. In many ways, he argues, the early nineteenth
                  century saw the birth of what we now call cognitive science. Richardson shows that
                  Romantic-era writers were much more deeply read in this material than has been previously
                  assumed, and that many of them felt compelled to respond—negatively, positively, ambivalently—to
                  the development of new brain-based psychologies.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Despite its unassuming stance, however, Richardson’s book aims to do more than simply
                     recover a neglected influence on Romantic-era culture. The polemical thrust of his
                     book—understated but nevertheless present—is that the entire “German swerve” of Romantic
                     studies has been misguided. Our traditional intellectual histories of the period (encouraged
                     by Coleridge, DeQuincey, and Carlyle) typically move from Hume to Kant to post-Kantian
                     German Romanticism and idealism; we read Romantic literary production in light of
                     these continental developments. Even scholarship that has resisted this procedure—either
                     through deconstructive criticism of the symbol or materialist criticism of the German
                     Ideology—has moved within the orbit of post-Kantian Continental philosophy. Perhaps
                     we now substitute non-identity for the logic of identity postulated by an earlier
                     generation of Romantic humanists, but we continue to take our bearings from the questions
                     and concerns that surfaced in Kant’s wake. In consequence, the dualism of subject
                     and object comes to displace mind-body dualism as the chief philosophical problem,
                     and it becomes difficult to disentangle questions of consciousness from questions
                     of self-consciousness.

                     </div> Thus, Richardson suggests that Coleridge’s extended diatribe against Hartley in the <em>Biographia Literaria</em> is a clever sleight-of-hand. By lumping all empirical work on the brain under the
                     banner of associationism, Coleridge is able to dispense with the whole lot and then
                     turn his attention to Schelling’s idealism. But Richardson argues that this ignores
                     what is really going on in British brain science during the time that Coleridge is
                     writing, and in the process it transposes the mind-body problem into a much more abstract
                     and fuzzier subject-object problem. The apparatus of self-consciousness, identity,
                     and non-identity (and their eventual deconstruction) follow in turn.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In asking us to resist this German swerve, Richardson’s work is bracing and—its professed
                  modesty notwithstanding—revolutionary. If he is right, we need to rethink Romanticism’s
                  privileged relationship with Continental philosophy and its various obsessions, turns,
                  and counter-turns. And even if Richardson is not entirely right, the historical yield
                  of his method is obvious. My question, however, is a bit different: what is gained
                  <em>conceptually</em> by relating Romantic literary culture to the culture of Romantic-era brain science?
                  To answer this question we need to get a clear grasp of how Bell and Lawrence and
                  the other Romantic brain scientists relate phenomenal consciousness to its neural
                  substrate. And unfortunately this is far from clear.</p>
               <p>I suspect that this is simply a limitation of the historical material Richardson is
                  working with. All of the writers that he treats were anti-dualist, were intensely
                  interested in neurology, and with the exception of Bell all were attacked as “materialists.”
                  If they were alive today, all of them would have held to NCC. But as I have been emphasizing,
                  NCC does not address the philosophical question of the relationship between phenomenal
                  consciousness and its neural substrate. Lawrence, Darwin, Bell, and the others seem
                  not to have posed the hard problem to themselves; apparently, they were content with
                  the extraordinary neurological discoveries they were making, and with the physicalism
                  (tempered in some cases with religious orthodoxy) that those discoveries seemed to
                  indicate. And, of course, who can blame them? </p>
               <p>The difficult methodological issue for literary studies, however, is how we use this
                  material. How can we think through the relationship between a brain-based psychology
                  that accepts NCC and the Romantic literary production that arose alongside it? Richardson,
                  it seems to me, largely avoids this question—or rather, he gives it an answer roughly
                  analogous to the empirical one that the NCC program itself pursues. Just as NCC either
                  ignores or dismisses the hard problem, so, lacking a conceptual account of how N relates
                  to C, Richardson treats his literary texts as simple outgrowths or results of the
                  contextual material he brings to bear upon them. As a result his book must for the
                  most part settle for tracing paths of influence between various brain scientists and
                  Romantic writers. Some of these influences are tighter than others, and all are interesting.
                  But the payoff is limited; because the question of how phenomenal experience is possible
                  <em>at all</em> never comes up, Richardson is unable to produce a “reading” of the literary artifacts
                  he discusses and must settle instead for contextualizing them. A revealing moment
                  appears in the chapter on Coleridge: “it seems appropriate to consider,” Richardson
                  writes, <span class="quote">‘whether Coleridge’s concerns with mind-body interaction, unconscious cognition, and
                     volition … seep into the text of “Kubla Khan.” The result would be not another interpretation
                     of the poem, but rather a supplement to the work of contextualization… (57).’</span> One can of course sympathize with the desire to avoid adding to the huge bibliography
                  of “Kubla Khan” commentary. And yet what this passage suggests is that any treatment
                  of the literary object’s novelty or uniqueness (however attenuated and hedged) will
                  not appear here. Indeed, Richardson names the site of that novelty (“interpretation”)
                  only to tell us that this is not his goal.</p>
               <p>What Richardson’s book has helped me to understand, then, is that the relationship
                  of N to C that occupies the consciousness literature is a tight analogue of the relationship
                  of context to text. That second relationship is of course the continuing and eternal
                  <em>bête noir</em> of literary studies—it is our own version of the hard problem. Like partisans of
                  NCC, Richardson (and many historically-minded scholars of Romanticism writing today)
                  favors context to the virtual exclusion of text. Now I don’t pretend here to be making
                  a point of which Richardson is unaware. My point rather is that in avoiding the philosophical
                  issues at stake in brain-based psychologies, Richardson’s book contributes perhaps
                  inadvertently to a continuing split between empirically-inclined historical “contextualization”
                  and theoretically-inclined textual “interpretation.” Despite his resistance to Romanticism’s
                  “German swerve,” then, the implication of Richardson’s book is that when it comes
                  to literary criticism, interpretive or philosophical questions only emerge within
                  the context of Continental theory, with its apparatus of self-consciousness and subject/object
                  dialectics. The work of historical contextualization, meanwhile, falls into the (largely
                  British) domain of the mind-body problem. I hope I have demonstrated that this is
                  incorrect; as the explosion in consciousness literature has demonstrated, the mind-body
                  problem remains a matter not solely of neurological explanation but also of philosophical
                  interpretation.</p>

                  <p><em>Emergence theory</em> is the example of (<span class="hi">c1</span>) that I will consider here. Emergentism flourished in Britain between 1850 and 1925.
                     John Stuart Mill’s <em>System of Logic</em> (1843) is generally cited as its founding text; other famous emergentist works are
                     George Henry Lewes’ <em>Problems of Life and Mind</em> (1875), Samuel Alexander’s <em>Space, Time, and Deity</em> (1920) and C. D. Broad’s <em>The Mind and Its Place in Nature</em> (1925). Many other intellectual giants of the period, including A. N. Whitehead, William
                     James, Arthur Lovejoy, and Henri Bergson espoused versions of emergentism. In his
                     thorough overview of the British Emergentists, Brian McLaughlin argues that the advent
                     of quantum mechanics in the late 1920s signaled the end of the emergentist tradition.
                     In particular, quantum mechanical explanations of chemical bonding in terms of electro-magnetism
                     made emergentist explanations of chemical laws irrelevant.

                              is concerned exclusively with discussions of emergence in chemistry, which is where
                              emergence theory had the longest life. He doesn’t discuss consciousness itself, except
                              to write in a footnote that “Consciousness, it seems, is the last refuge of an Emergentist”

                  <p>According to emergence theory, some properties “emerge” from a physical substrate
                     in a way that cannot be explained from the perspective of that substrate (eg. from
                     the perspective of physics). Furthermore, these emergent properties cannot be reduced
                     to the properties of their physical substrate. In a familiar though imprecise analogy,
                     neither bees nor ants possess intelligence, and yet a bee-hive or an ant colony could
                     be said to possess intelligence; somehow intelligence “emerges” from the way in which
                     each individual ant or bee goes about its task.

                     </div> Consciousness, accordingly, is sometimes said to be an emergent property in that it
                     arises from a physical substrate (the brain) and yet cannot be reduced to the brain,
                     nor fully predicted by the sciences of the brain. The issue of <em>prediction</em> is important here: for a property to be emergent, no amount of knowledge about the
                     substrate will enable us to predict facts about the emergent property. Consciousness
                     (to stick with this example) emerges from lower-level systems, but however much we
                     might learn about those systems we will not be able to say what consciousness looks
                     like before it actually arrives on the scene.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In a slightly more technical idiom, emergence proposes that higher-level mental properties
                     are <em>determined by</em> and <em>dependent upon</em> lower level properties—yet are not reducible to the lower-level properties. The delicate
                     balancing act required here is particularly tricky when it comes to the idea that
                     emergent properties must be not only unpredictable but <em>novel</em>. Of course, objects can have properties that their parts do not have; a watch, for
                     example, tells time, while a random heap of springs and gears does not. The novelty
                     required for a property to be emergent must be of a different order than this. At
                     the same time, how can a property be truly novel and yet determined by its physical
                     substrate? This will require both that the arrangement of parts brings something new
                     into existence <em>and</em> that nothing new is actually added to the mix from the outside. (Thus the soul is
                     not emergent in classical theological accounts because it is added to the body.) In
                     this sense emergent properties must supervene on their physical substrate—but it must
                     be supervenience such that C is determined by N but not identical to it.

                     us a good deal about what we need from an adequate physicalist solution to the mind-body

                  <p>As an idea, “emergence” lends itself to analogical extrapolation. Though the British
                     Emergentists focused particularly on chemistry, Broad and Alexander at least were
                     willing to extend their notion of fundamental chemical laws in such a way as to make
                     mentality an emergent property. More recently, emergence theory has found new life
                     in the cultural zone. In his essay “A Forming Hand: Creativity and Destruction from
                     Romanticism to Emergence Theory,” Alan Liu notes the presence of emergentist thinking
                     in current models of information theory, management theory, ideas about artistic autopoesis,
                     complexity, and self-organization, and especially in notions of “creative destruction”
                     prominent in the business world. One of the goals of his essay is to critique the
                     one-size-fits-all picture of emergence that these various cultural domains offer.
                     Liu zeroes in particularly on their relentless anti-historical bias: “[w]estern cognitive,
                     artificial-intelligence, new-media, business, and other theories of emergence,” he

                     the “forming hand” passage of Book 2: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                        </div>
                     </blockquote> Characterized by what Liu calls a “distribution of inspiration along a whole chain
                     of temporal transmission” (11), this alternate mode of creativity is sprinkled liberally
                     over broad patches of the Wordsworth that we usually don’t read. For Liu its “local
                     spirit” becomes a Romantic anticipation of emergence, a picture of lower-level agency
                     that does its thing without any inkling of a larger project: “There is agency, nothing
                     but agency… but no one at the control stick that would be identified as <em>the</em> agent. Agency is a cascade of local agencies,” he writes (18). In this respect the
                     amorality of emergence does seem to capture something of our contemporary world situation,
                     in which things can go terribly wrong and there is no one around to blame, just a
                     cascade of local agencies going about their very limited business.

                              governing the lower levels. Moreover, emergent properties exhibit so-called downward
                              causation, that is, they cause change that cannot be predicted at the lower levels.
                              So, for example, mental properties, if they are emergent, would have causal powers
                              that could not be predicted according to the laws that govern the physical substrate
                              of those properties. This seems to violate what is known as “the causal closure of

               <p>Liu is however also verging on a philosophical point, which he makes somewhat casually
                  a bit later in the essay. For emergence theory, he writes, “[t]here is no transcendental
                  manager of choices named ‘consciousness’ that sits above local choices” (30). Now
                  this is true if we are dualists and think of consciousness as some additional thing
                  over and above its material substrate. But it is <em>not</em> true if we think of consciousness itself as emergent (or, for that matter, if one
                  holds to at least some of the positions that I gathered under category (<span class="hi">b</span>) above). Any non-reductive physicalism will try hard to accommodate both the cascade
                  of local choices that make up our neurological reality and the first-person, phenomenal
                  experience that makes up what we call “consciousness.” Thus in Liu’s dismissal of
                  consciousness—as though any talk of consciousness is inevitably dualist—I find a surprising
                  similarity to Richardson’s approach (surprising because they are quite different kinds
                  of critics). Both give little attention to the <em>philosophical </em>issues surrounding consciousness, because both in their different ways are intent
                  upon moving from neurological wiring to cultural product. For Richardson that means
                  moving from Romantic theories of the mind/brain to the historical contexts of Romantic
                  literature; for Liu, it means moving from emergent computer programs to contemporary
                  management theory. Neither is terribly interested in pausing along the way to consider
                  the mind-body problem. Both seem to assume that our only options are dualism or some
                  version of position (<span class="hi">a</span>); they ignore those responses I’ve gathered under headings (<span class="hi">b</span>) and (<span class="hi">c</span>)—even though Liu is for his part talking about emergence theory.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Liu’s description of emergence as amoral is important for his larger project of identifying
                     elective affinities between emergence theory and the business culture of postmodernity,
                     with its command to innovate ceaselessly. But if we shift our attention to philosophical
                     versions of emergence a rather different picture appears. Alexander and Broad, for
                     instance, both elaborated metaphysical systems in which the world was a basically
                     meaning-full place; emergence became a way to be a physicalist (“there is only one
                     fundamental kind of stuff,” writes Broad [77]) without committing oneself to a picture
                     of the universe as fundamentally amoral and directionless. And it is in the context
                     of this elaboration that Alexander in 1920 has recourse to a resonant phrase: <span class="quote">‘The existence of emergent qualities thus described is something to be noted, as some
                        would say, under the compulsion of brute empirical fact, or, as I should prefer to
                        say in less harsh terms, to be accepted with the ‘natural piety’ of the investigator.

                              the history of “natural piety” verges variously upon atheism, pantheism, natural theology,

                     from the “Intimations” Ode. In the 1815 edition of his <em>Poems</em> Wordsworth made the final three lines of “My heart leaps up” the epigraph to the Ode.

                     links Wordsworth to emergence theory is John Stuart Mill. In Chapter 5 of his <em>Autobiography</em> (1873), Mill described an intellectual and spiritual crisis: “[M]y heart sank within
                     me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down. … I seemed to
                     have nothing left to live for.”

                     </div> As is well known, in the autumn of 1828 Mill worked his way out of this crisis with
                     the help of Wordsworth, specifically the 1815 <em>Poems</em>, which “proved to be the precise thing for my mental wants at that particular juncture”
                     (151). Mill then relates that by 1830 he had begun writing what would become the <em>System of Logic</em>, eventually published in 1843. In his description of that work, Mill revisits his
                     crisis in a more intellectual vein. In particular, he describes how he turned his
                     attention to what he called the “Composition of Forces”: <span class="quote">‘On examining, accordingly, what the mind does when it applies the principle of the
                        Composition of Forces, I found that it performs a simple act of addition. It adds
                        the separate effect of the one force to the separate effect of the other, and puts
                        down the sum of these separate effects as the joint effect. But is this a legitimate
                        process? In dynamics, and in all the mathematical branches of physics, it is; but
                        in some other cases, as in chemistry, it is not; and I then recollected that something
                        not unlike this was pointed out as one of the distinctions between chemical and mechanical
                        phenomena, in the introduction to that favorite of my boyhood, Thomson's <em>System of Chemistry</em>.

                                 claimed (probably incorrectly) that Dalton arrived at the theory through an analysis
                                 of nitrous oxide. Humphry Davy was of course the Romantic-era chemist most associated

               <p>With Mill, in other words, we have an emotional crisis solved in part by reading Wordsworth,
                  and, running parallel to that, an intellectual crisis solved in part by reading a
                  chemistry textbook. What the chemistry textbook gave Mill was the first intimation
                  of emergence theory. Is it too much to suppose that Wordsworth might have given him
                  a similar intimation? To be sure, chemistry and poetry seem tightly related in Mill’s
                  account. Inspired by Wordsworth’s own self-description in the “Preface” to the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, Mill ascribes Wordsworth’s effectiveness as a spiritual guide to something almost
                  chemical in the writing itself: “What made Wordsworth's poems a medicine for my state
                  of mind, was that they expressed, not mere outward beauty, but states of feeling,
                  and of thought coloured by feeling, under the excitement of beauty” (151). If we want
                  to picture this familiar Wordsworthian effect, we could do worse than imagine the
                  invisible chemical bonds (“states of feeling”) by which atoms (“mere outward beauty”)
                  stick together. We might remember too that for the emergentists these bonds were the
                  result of fundamental chemical forces—proof that chemistry was its own special science.</p>
               <p>What makes the connection between chemistry and poetry more than simply an interesting
                  possibility, however, is that the poem that Mill singles out for treatment in this
                  section of the <em>Autobiography</em> is none other than the “Intimations Ode” in its 1815 edition—the edition, remember,
                  with the epigraph from “My heart leaps up”: <span class="quote">‘At the conclusion of the Poems came the famous “Ode,” falsely called Platonic, "Intimations
                     of Immortality:" in which, along with more than his usual sweetness of melody and
                     rhythm, and along with the two passages of grand imagery but bad philosophy so often
                     quoted, I found that [Wordsworth] too had had similar experience to mine; that he
                     also had felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of life was not lasting;
                     but that he had sought for compensation, and found it, in the way in which he was
                     now teaching me to find it. (153)’</span> What Mill zeroes in on here is not the poem’s dualism (dismissed as “bad philosophy”)
                  but rather its description of the “compensation” that comes after dualism has been
                  abandoned. To see what that compensation is we need look no further than the “chemical

               <p>This is a reading of the “Ode,” then, that takes the epigraph seriously: </p>

               <p> Central to emergence theory is the idea that reality exists in increasingly complex
                  layers, each of which has its special science: physics, then chemistry, then biology.
                  Accordingly, to say that the man is father to the child is to assert a biological
                  relationship—and presumably to open the door to vitalist or dualist speculations about
                  the origins of life. To abandon the mysteries of the paternal relationship altogether,
                  however, is to commit oneself to mere mechanical causation in a meaningless universe—and
                  Mill had already been through <em>that</em> spiritual crisis. By contrast, to say as the poem does that the child is father to
                  the man not only reverses the usual claims about paternity but actually asserts a
                  fundamental law such that manhood emerges out of childhood in a way that has to be
                  accepted with natural piety because, as Alexander was to put it, it is not susceptible
                  to another explanation. Emergence allows Mill both enchantment and physicalism. In
                  this reading of the “Ode” and its epigraph, which I am suggesting was Mill’s reading,
                  natural piety is the appropriate attitude to take toward the fundamental laws that
                  are not susceptible to further explanation. The power of this emergence/natural piety
                  complex is demonstrated, in Mill’s account, by his discovery of emergent laws <em>and</em> by his own personal spiritual recovery.</p>
               <p>Brian McLaughlin argues that empirically we don’t need emergence: there simply <em>are</em> no fundamental chemical forces that have to be accepted with natural piety. But even
                  setting aside such empirical considerations, most philosophers are liable to be suspicious
                  of natural piety—just as cultural critics, for analogous reasons, are liable to be
                  suspicious of it. For natural piety seems to recommend that we just give up. Philosophers
                  who will continue to seek a metaphysical solution to the mind-body problem won’t like
                  this, nor will cultural critics who call us to ever more vigilant forms of critique.
                  Furthermore, the quasi-religious language of natural piety, especially as it gets
                  linked up to literature itself in Mill’s reaction to Wordsworth, will elicit objections.
                  If Alexander and Broad were elaborating the metaphysics of Romanticism, then hasn’t
                  that metaphysics already been subjected to stringent critique in the debate between
                  Romantic humanism and its deconstructive and historicist interlocutors?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Here, though, I would insist upon the distinction I made near the beginning of this
                     essay between consciousness and self-consciousness. C. D. Broad, the last and probably
                     greatest exponent of the British Emergentist tradition, quoted Alexander’s invocation
                     of natural piety approvingly, but he titled his 1925 book <em>The Mind and Its Place in Nature</em>.

                              differences which cannot be explained, even in part, but must simply be swallowed
                              whole with that philosophic jam which Professor Alexander calls ‘natural piety’.”
                              See C. D. Broad, The Mind and Its Place in Nature (Paterson, NJ: Littlefield, Adams,
                              and Co., 1960), 55.</span></div>
                     </div> There is thus a crucial difference between Broad’s (Romantic) project and the project
                     of a Romantic humanist such as M. H. Abrams, who writes for example in 1965 that “[t]he
                     central enterprise common to many post-Kantian German philosophers and poets, as well
                     as to Coleridge and Wordsworth, was to join together the ‘subject’ and the ‘object’
                     that modern intellection had put asunder, and thus to revivify a dead nature, restore
                     its concreteness, significance, and human values, and re-domiciliate man in a world
                     which had become alien to him.”

                     </div> Both Broad and Abrams are writing about the relationship between the human subject
                     and the material world. But the crucial difference is that Broad is interested in
                     the mind-body problem and Abrams is interested in the subject-object problem, and
                     the result of that difference is that when Broad considers the mind and its place
                     in nature he can simply avoid the spiritual and ideological weight that Abrams loads
                     up onto what he calls “Romantic philosophy.” Natural piety understood through the
                     lens of British emergentism is not an attempt to “re-domiciliate man in a world that
                     had become alien to him.” Rather, it is consonant with a physicalist/naturalist solution
                     to the mind-body problem.</p>

               <p>Left intellectuals, trained by several generations of theorists suspicious of “naturalization,”
                  get nervous whenever anything is labeled “natural.” Upon examination, though, such
                  nervousness depends on an ambiguity in the notion of nature itself. Keeping the focus
                  on the mind-body problem rather than letting it run off in various post-Kantian directions,
                  my suggestion is that the British Emergentist interest in natural piety might help
                  us recover <em>in a theoretically interesting way</em> the important strand of naturalism—that is, physicalism—that runs through Wordsworthian
                  Romanticism but that we lose sight of when we lose sight of the mind-body problem.</p>

                  <p>Picking up on Wordsworth’s own language, Harold Bloom many years ago called natural
                     piety a “binding agent,” and once again the chemical metaphor seems appropriate to
                     the history of emergetism. Bloom goes on, speaking of the “Intimations Ode”: “Wordsworth’s
                     poem is concerned, not with a history of conceptualization, but with the flowing <em>given</em> of our sensuous experience.”

                     the constant relation of man and nature, affirming at the outset the continuity that

                     </div> What drives this line of thought—to reiterate my point—is a notion of critique that
                     takes the subject/object dialectic (Manning’s “relation of man and nature”) and its
                     deconstruction as its point of departure.</p>
               </div>
               <p>I want to side with Bloom in this debate. I think he glimpses something that Manning
                  does not, and that it is the same thing that Liu glimpses when he discusses the phenomenon
                  of local agency in Book 2 of <em>The Prelude</em>. We can describe this thing as the “relation of man and nature,” but this time in
                  a way much closer to Broad’s mind-body physicalism (“the mind and its place in nature”)
                  than to Manning’s invocation of subject-object dialectics. What Bloom and Liu and
                  Broad are all verging upon is the way that subjectivity emerges out of the everyday
                  and mundane material that nature offers up. These are descriptions, in short, of the
                  mind’s place in nature.</p>
               <p>If this sort of naturalism or physicalism is not to simply fetishize nature, though,
                  we need to give it a little more theoretical heft. Recall that when he first describes
                  the attitude of natural piety, Alexander remarks that emergent laws could be “noted
                  under the compulsion of brute empirical fact, or, as I should prefer to say in less
                  harsh terms, to be accepted with the ‘natural piety’ of the investigator.” The distinction
                  between “brute empirical fact” and the “natural piety” of the investigator catches
                  one’s attention immediately, and it is tempting to read this revision in ideological
                  terms, such that “natural piety” becomes the way to soften and ameliorate what is
                  nevertheless a brute assertion. We might further note that so understood, this revision
                  nicely glosses one common reading of Romanticism itself, as a conservative reaction
                  to the modernity represented by a tradition of scientific reasoning extending back
                  to Bacon and Newton. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Once again, though, things look different if we come at natural piety from the perspective
                     of emergence. If the emergence of one set of properties from lower level properties
                     is the result of a basic law, and therefore doesn’t require another law to explain
                     it, it is certainly possible to put this idea in brute terms. So understood, it would
                     seem a long way from the fuzziness of natural piety. Thus Colin McGinn: “It is implausible
                     to take these correlations [between neurons and conscious experience] as ultimate
                     and inexplicable facts, as simply brute. And we do not want to acknowledge radical
                     emergence of the conscious with respect to the cerebral; that is too much like accepting
                     miracles <em>de re</em>.”

                     </div> Here McGinn dismisses natural piety by linking it to belief in miracles, which seems
                     about as far from brute empirical reality as possible. Alexander, though, would refuse
                     to accept this distinction between the brute and the miraculous. The same goes for
                     Tim Crane, who argues that the natural piety of the emergentists is worth attending
                     to because “[t]he availability of the emergentist position encourages us to look with
                     suspicion on the idea that there <em>must</em> nonetheless be a philosophical account” of the correlation between body and mind.
                     On this account, natural piety makes it possible to feel that we don’t <em>have</em> to answer the mind-body problem. This, argues Crane, is the epistemological attitude
                     that emergence recommends to naturalism.

                  <p>Working from a very different theoretical archive, Anne-Lise François reaches an analogous
                     conclusion in her use of Wordsworthian natural piety to critique biotechnology. If
                     nature is conceptualized as simply brute, she notes, then it begs for completion.
                     Lately, of course, that completion has come in the form of genetic tinkering: Bt corn,
                     salmon that grow six times faster than normal, silk-producing goats. One need not
                     subscribe to some reified discourse of the natural in order to want to resist this
                     tinkering, which as François points out is done so often in the name simply of undifferentiated
                     “possibility,” the proliferation of “options” that characterizes late capitalism,
                     or even out of sheer boredom. Yet how does one offer such resistance without fetishizing
                     nature, falling back into a series of oppositions (progressive/conservative, urban/rural,
                     artificial/natural) that have their own problematic histories? For an answer she also
                     turns to natural piety, which she nicely describes as “the precarious basis for an
                     otherwise unjustifiable choice in favor of already existing beings.”

                     Alexander also gives voice: “on the one hand,” writes François, the given is “a trope
                     for brute priority, for the intractable that precedes and escapes human decision;
                     on the other, [it is] the name for decision itself, the incalculable, unforeseeable

                     to Alexander. Thus, helped by François, I think at this point it becomes possible
                     to take Alexander at his word and view brute priority and natural piety as really
                     two descriptions of the same thing. Moreover with the example of biotechnology in
                     mind I believe we can accept his implication that natural piety is to be “preferred”
                     precisely because the bare assertion of brute priority is generally not enough to
                     get us to leave something alone. Quite the contrary.</p>
               </div>
               <p>To say the least, this convergence of Derridean critique and analytic philosophy of
                  mind around a shared reading of natural piety is striking. In the context of a technologically-driven
                  imperative to outperform nature, a restless dissatisfaction with the given and consequent
                  desire to squeeze more out of it, natural piety could take on a new life as a post-ideological
                  ethic. “The challenge for the critique of biotechnology,” François concludes, “is
                  to find ways of presenting incompletion as a mode of satisfied knowledge, and indeterminateness
                  as consummate temporal experience, not simply deficient and as yet unachieved cognition”
                  (68). Perhaps it has taken the biotech revolution to reveal the thread of naturalism
                  in Wordsworthian natural piety. I have been arguing, though, that this thread was
                  there all along, in the way in which the emergentist tradition took up Wordsworthian
                  natural piety as an approach to the mind-body problem. “This [emergentist] way of
                  treating the mind-body problem,” writes Tim Crane, assumes “that we should not say
                  <em>a priori</em> when we should take the facts of nature to require further explanation” (23). In
                  my judgment, coming at this attitude of epistemological modesty through the history
                  of emergentism and the mind-body problem insulates natural piety from charges of ideological
                  bad faith more securely than a Derridean approach can hope to do. As inspiring as
                  I find François’ essay, it seems to me that she is walking a very thin line, and that
                  the naturalism she recommends could be rendered more robustly through an engagement
                  with the mind-body problem.</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.9">
               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>I don’t want to be taken as arguing that emergence/natural piety, “properly understood,”
                  is actually progressive. The point, rather, is to move away from the language of progressive
                  and conservative altogether. And rather than mystificatory, I would argue that emergence/natural
                  piety is the very opposite: it <em>deflates</em> the language of progressive and conservative because it deflates the oppositions
                  (mind/nature, subject/object) in which that particular political debate is embedded,
                  and returns us to the more defined—if no less mysterious—terrain of the mind-body
                  problem. From this perspective, natural piety’s commitments are broadly empirical
                  and scientific, Anglo rather than Germanic. Here is Broad: <span class="quote">‘There is nothing, so far as I can see, mysterious or unscientific about a trans-ordinal
                     law [his word for a potentially emergent law]….A trans-ordinal law is as good a law
                     as any other; and, once it has been discovered, it can be used like any other to suggest
                     experiments, to make predictions, and to give us practical control over external objects
                     (79). ’</span> This is hardly the language of anti-science. But then Broad goes on: <span class="quote">‘The only peculiarity of it is that we must wait till we meet with an actual instance
                     of an object of the higher order before we can discover such a law; and that we cannot
                     possibly deduce it beforehand from any combination of laws which we have discovered
                     by observing aggregates of a lower order. (79)’</span> “We must wait” seems, these days, about all we could ask. It is after all with Broad’s
                  basically deflationary posture in mind that Tim Crane remarks that “there is more
                  to be said for the attitude of ‘natural piety’ than is often recognized in recent
                  philosophy of mind.” So to, I would propose, for recent business “innovations,” for
                  recent “advances” in genetic engineering, for recent global military adventures—all
                  of which, as Francois’ analysis helps us to see, rush in deductively and are thus
                  the very opposite of the epistemically-modest empiricism of natural piety that Broad
                  recommends.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>And so to, I am arguing, for recent literary study. One virtue of emergence theory
                     is that it forces us to concentrate on the murky and unclear relationship between
                     a novel property and its material determinants. Indeed, the emergentist attempt to
                     describe how C is determined by and dependent upon N, and yet is also something over
                     and above it, is a fascinating analogue of the ever-present discussion in literary
                     studies about the relationship between the literary object and the various cultural
                     forces that determine it. Like non-reductive physicalists, I suspect, most of us want
                     it both ways: we want to be able to dissolve the literary object back into its social,
                     cultural, and historical conditions, but we also want, embarrassingly, to hold onto
                     the novelty or uniqueness of the object itself.

               <p>My claim has been that philosophical discussions of consciousness have something to
                  teach literary studies about its own hard problem. And I have suggested that emergence,
                  as one approach to the hard problem of consciousness, has important roots in the Romantic
                  period itself. So understood, emergence and its recommended posture of natural piety
                  is a theory of non-intervention—“we must wait”—and, because of this, an appreciation
                  of the difficulty and importance of the mind-body problem. </p><br/><div><span class="hi">Acknowledgements</span></div>
