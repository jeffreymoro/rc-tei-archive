               <p class="noCount">Throughout this article the title of the main poem under discussion, <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em>, has been abbreviated to <em>FB</em>, and within the poem the titles of the four books are abbreviated to <em>Sp</em> (<em>Spring</em>), <em>S</em> (<em>Summer</em>), <em>A</em> (<em>Autumn</em>), and <em>W</em> (<em>Winter</em>). In order to cite line numbers, which were not included in the early editions of
                  Bloomfield’s poems, I have used the modern reprint of the poem in John Goodridge and
                  John Lucas’s <em>Robert Bloomfield: Selected Poems</em> (1998). <em>1805</em> and <em>1827</em> refer to two early editions of Bloomfield’s poems (see Works Cited), which incorporated
                  the important introductory essay by Capel Lofft and other editorial apparatus not
                  reproduced in Goodridge and Lucas’s 1998 edition. All the numbered references to Bloomfield’s
                  letters are taken from the <em>Romantic Circles</em> online edition edited by Tim Fulford and Lynda Pratt (2009).</p>

                  <p>Robert Bloomfield’s <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> is a troubled and troubling poem. Initially a spectacular success, neglected for many
                     decades, and now rightly reinstated within the expanded canon of Romantic literature,
                     Bloomfield’s masterpiece still poses interpretive challenges for even the most sympathetic
                     critic of laboring-class poetry. The aim of this essay is to propose a substantial
                     revision to some of the critical orthodoxies, both past and present, upon which the
                     reputation and value of the poem continue to rest. Specifically, I want to liberate
                     the poem from the generic confines of “rural,” “pastoral,” and “georgic” writing,
                     and relocate its most powerful effects in the quite different aesthetic modes of allegory
                     and fantasy. If this critical step seems at first to be simply illogical and even
                     impertinent (the poem’s subtitle is, after all, 
                     “A Rural Poem”
                     ),

                     </div> my intention is to show that the prevailing pastoralization (indeed, pasteurization)
                     of the poem reveals a curious critical tendency to evade or minimize the poem’s striking
                     evocations of violence, terror, and guilt. Such evasive readings of the poem carry
                     twin risks: firstly, of reinforcing the original Bloomfield “myth” in which his poetic
                     identity is defined predominantly by rural rather than urban culture, and in which
                     the ruptures and dislocations experienced by moving from the country to the city do
                     not threaten the coherence of the text

                              and enabled him to transfer his mental life to those fields and woodlands where he
                              had been most happy” (Unwin 91). Derek Roper describes FB as “quiet and pleasant”
                              (65). John Lucas calls the poem’s depiction of rural life “pre-lapsarian” (62), though
                              Lucas, like most current commentators on the poem, sees the poem’s nostalgia as only

                     </div>; and secondly, of losing the opportunity to use the most disturbed and disturbing
                     textual moments of the poem as portals onto Bloomfield’s conflicted imaginative condition.
                     Focusing on the poem’s episodes and tropes of violence, terror, and guilt is also,
                     I hope to show, an as yet undervalued way to locate a proto-Romantic subjectivity
                     in <em>FB</em>. By probing the metaphorical means by which the poem dramatizes, negotiates, and
                     confronts a variety of terrors, we can open <em>FB</em> up to a new set of critical perspectives in which both personal and cultural compulsions
                     work simultaneously to explore the poet’s troubled past and anxious present. If <em>FB</em> remains, in the last instance, a “rural” poem, it represents rural life and culture
                     through a distorting lens which reflects and magnifies the twin terrors of psychic
                     and political repression. In Bloomfield’s brilliant coinage, <em>FB</em> is his “boyage,” a voyage of self-discovery into the painful emotional territory of
                     separation, loss, and anxious success.

                     </div> The value of the poem, in my mind, lies not only—or even primarily—in its evocation
                     of rural culture, but in the intriguing imaginative resources which Bloomfield deploys
                     to both recognize and contain what we can surmise to be unresolved personal anxieties.

                              of writing and knowledge” in which the “inner” self was constituted as both a “sacred
                              place and a site of danger” (15). For Felicity Nussbaum, such writing was an opportunity
                              to “experiment with interdiscourses and the corresponding subject positions to breach
                              the uncertainties of identity” (37).</span></div>
                     </div> By taking a necessarily speculative psycho-biographical approach to these issues,
                     I hope to show that <em>FB</em> is a darker, deeper, and more troubled poem than has yet been appreciated.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>There is ample evidence in Bloomfield’s letters to support a psycho-biographical approach
                              to his writing. One of the best examples is his account of “the two years that I was
                              breeding with Giles” (letter 16, to George Bloomfield, 8 September 1799). Literary
                              creativity and parental anxieties are fused into a trope of uncertain and insecure
                              depth which crystallizes into an apt verbal slip: “ . . . by the time I was brought
                              to Bed with my Boy, my wife was breeding another;! We some times see a ball of wax
                              with so small a portion of the buoyant quality that it knows not whither to sink or

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>It is odd that <em>FB</em> has proved so resistant to allegorical readings, especially when we consider that
                  the poem was published at the end of an unprecedented politicized decade in which
                  the English countryside became a fiercely contested symbolic prize (Janowitz 152-61).
                  As the “revolution debate” of the early 1790s expanded into a national ideological
                  struggle for the hearts and minds of the British people, competing visions of the
                  “land” proliferated in both print and visual culture: at the radical extreme, Spence’s
                  “people’s farm” and Paine’s agrarian justice; at the other extreme, Hannah More’s
                  self-help village politics and the culture of “contentment”; somewhere in between,
                  <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>’ lost souls and wanderers, victims of Pitt’s militarism and high taxation, and Gillray’s
                  wry images of the King as Farmer George. Any attempt, therefore, to locate the “rural”
                  in a space outside of this supercharged ideological matrix, either in an uncontaminated
                  generic zone, or in the “Romantic” imagination, is a lost cause. Indeed, the quest
                  to find “pure” or detoxified images of rural life was and remains an act of fantasy,
                  wish fulfillment, and withdrawal which by negation and denial betrays its conflicted
                  and terrorized origins. The key Romantic text in this context is probably Coleridge’s
                  <em>Fears in Solitude</em> (1798), a poem whose title alone reveals a great deal about the Romantic paradox
                  of retreat and internalization: the deeper Coleridge retreats into heath, heart, and
                  home, the more the phantoms of Jacobin violence continue to haunt him.</p>
               <p>Yet the repressive hypothesis remains a useful if incomplete way to plot the emergence
                  of Romantic literary subjectivity. In a period where freedom of expression was constantly
                  under attack and “all privacy was subject to invasion” by the state (Barrell, <em>Spirit</em> 247), the switch from “public” to “private” literary discourse served the twin purposes
                  of avoiding prosecution and constructing a secure model of the ego which could resist
                  further encroachments by a tyrannical State apparatus. The creative risk of this willingly
                  or unwillingly adopted strategy was the ever-present danger of uncontrollable sublimation:
                  it was one thing to intentionally allegorize contemporary politics, for example in
                  John Thelwall’s radical satires, and quite another to imaginatively collude with dominant
                  ideology by generating compelling fantasies and stereotypes of oppressive power. The
                  test case for the latter, compromised aesthetic position is the De Quincey of John
                  Barrell’s tour de force psycho-biographical study, <em>The Infection of Thomas De Quincey</em> (1991). For Barrell, De Quincey’s autobiographical imagination is plagued (or sustained)
                  by a continuous reenactment of a childhood tragedy (the death of his sister Elizabeth),
                  the pain of which De Quincey can only psychically discharge by repeatedly scapegoating
                  and demonizing the lower classes and imperial subjects. De Quincey’s subjectivity
                  is for Barrell both a deeply personal and intensely public discourse, a screen onto
                  which the intertwined and mutually displacing terrors of private and public history
                  are projected, and in which “each aggravates the other in an ascending spiral of fear
                  and of violence” (Barrell 21)</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I have borrowed Barrell’s title for this essay as I see no reason why a similar investigative
                     methodology cannot be applied to Bloomfield in order to help us “retrace the paths
                     of wild obscurity” in <em>FB</em> (<em>Sp</em> 6). As with Barrell’s De Quincey, I want to use a model of Bloomfield’s creative behavior
                     in which a “myth of his own childhood” is “rewritten” as “narratives of trauma and
                     narratives of reparation” (Barrell 22). Though we can only speculate about the precise
                     biographical details behind this “myth,” I want to use the textual evidence of Bloomfield’s
                     poems and letters to propose that <em>FB</em> is wracked with insecurities or “psychic wounds” (Barrell 22) which emanate from Bloomfield’s
                     past and which become amplified in the echo-chamber of the politically turbulent 1790s.
                     Of course, <em>FB</em> is a concealed or surrogate autobiographical poem, but from the outset this generic
                     ambiguity has not deterred critics from simply peeling off Giles’s mask and conflating
                     the hero with the poet. Indeed, it is unlikely that the poem would have made the impact
                     it did without Capel Lofft’s prefatory essay, a seminal document which crafted an
                     image of Bloomfield the peasant poet and which rooted the poem’s value in its supposedly
                     authentic rendition of Bloomfield’s early life on his uncle’s farm. But even if we
                     regard the poem, correctly, as “semi”-autobiographical (White, <em>Romanticism and the Poetry of Community</em> 12), it is striking that no critic has yet felt the need to interpret the darker aspects
                     of the poem within this “semi”-autobiographical framework. Lofft may have had the
                     painful examples of Duck and Burns in mind when he declared that <em>FB</em> conveyed the “sweetness and ease” of its author (<em>1805</em> 126)

                     to an over-simplified estimation of his poetic strengths and procedures. Bloomfield’s

                     forward, I want to speculate that it also reawakened and reconfigured unresolved anxieties
                     about separation, change, and dependency. The violent and disturbing episodes of <em>FB</em> reflect both the strength of these feelings and the counter-revolutionary political
                     mood of the late 1790s: far from retreating into the idyllic past, Bloomfield’s poem
                     provides an intriguing psychopathology of laboring-class poetry in the Romantic period.

                     or strenuous attempt to present Giles as a free-born Englishmen, runs the risk of
                     backfiring: when it is read as a continuation of the previous line (“no more; / No
                     stripes, no tyranny”) there is a lingering sense that (like the stereotypical slave)
                     Giles’s docile body would not even feel these lashes.

                              Bloomfield cited this motto and Lofft’s introduction as examples of editorial imposition.
                              In the preface to the 1809 edition of his poems, Bloomfield recalls that the first

                     imaginative transcription of Bloomfield’s own experience. The fact that Giles is “fatherless”
                     seems to accord with the young Bloomfield (whose father died of smallpox when the
                     poet was less than one-year old), so this leads us to consider that Giles could be
                     a version of Bloomfield working on his uncle Austin’s farm at Sapiston. But if this
                     is the case, how do we interpret the reference to a lingering threat of “tyranny”?
                     If tyranny does not emanate from his “generous Master” (<em>Sp</em> 47)—a possible reference to his Uncle Austin—can we find another source? One of the
                     attractions (and weaknesses) of a psycho-biographical approach is that it enables
                     us to make connections between circumstantial textual “clues” and the writer’s personal
                     experience without recourse to “hard” biographical evidence. One way to think about
                     the negatively asserted “tyranny” of the vignette is therefore as a dual protest:
                     the alienated condition of rural labor is a generalized expression of the personal
                     dislocation which Bloomfield may have felt when he was displaced from his home to
                     become a “farmer’s boy.”

                              that “boy” in this context was a term of derision which poked fun at the docile country
                              yokel, or at the very least that it was a sentimental stereotype of conformity and
                              social mobility. It is certainly the case that a well-known ballad called The Farmer’s

                     is that a “semi”-autographical reading of the poem must take into account the possibility
                     that Bloomfield had unresolved feelings about separation, loss, and success, and that
                     these feelings are worked through imaginatively in hyperbolic figurations of familial
                     catastrophe, dispossession, and guilt.</p>

                  <p>In order to test this hypothesis, we can turn to the poem’s most sensational episode,
                     the slaughter of the lambs at the end of <em>Spring</em>. Following scenes in which Giles has had to stake out dead crows and milk some “lazy”
                     cows, his final task of this first section of the poem is to shepherd his flock, a
                     job which, at least initially, seems like a pastoral reward for the harsher and less
                     fulfilling labors which have preceded it. Not only is this pastoral mainstay the narrator’s
                     “darling theme” (<em>Sp</em> 283), it is also clear that the lambs are the epitome of pastoral comfort, “Indulg’d”
                     in a life of “ease” and “play” (<em>Sp</em> 291-2). But an ominous shadow soon falls over their innocent bliss, as they are also
                     described as “happy tenants, prisoners of a day” (<em>Sp</em> 291) who inhabit “bright inclosures circling round their home” (<em>Sp</em> 286). This is another example of the oxymoronic darkening of tone which first appeared
                     in Giles’s “happy servitude.” The language of confinement alerts us to the fact that
                     there is more than one kind of “indulgence” at work here, as both the lambs and the
                     reader are being lulled into a false sense of security. No amount of “spotless innocence,
                     and infant mirth” (<em>Sp</em> 317) can protect the lambs from the descending knife of the “murd’ing Butcher” (<em>Sp</em> 346):

                     events. In 1798, the year in which Bloomfield finished the poem, the Irish rebellion
                     saw over 20,000 Irish killed, most of whom were peasants. But the trope of slaughtered
                     innocence was also the standard textual fare of Romantic atrocity scenes, and such
                     bloody vignettes abounded in anti-slavery, anti-war, and anti-Jacobin writing (Haywood <span class="foreign">passim</span>). In 1797, for example, William Cobbett (writing as “Peter Porcupine”) published
                     his macabre <em>The Bloody Buoy</em>, also known as <em>Annals of Blood</em>, a catalogue of graphically detailed Jacobin outrages (Haywood, chapter 2). This
                     work was popular, and it is not beyond the bounds of speculation to consider that
                     if Bloomfield knew the work, he may have been infected by its compulsion to expose
                     the desecrated victims of political terror, even though Bloomfield’s “fleeces drench’d
                     in gore” are emblems of English, not French, tyranny (<em>Sp</em> 350). But political contextualization is still only a partial allegorical reading
                     of the scene, as it does not explain Giles’s seemingly guilty role in the massacre,
                     and Giles’s own feelings remain obscure. As in the rest of the poem, his interiority
                     is inconsistently represented, and it is often insubstantial and transient—“he felt
                     no more.”

                     break from labor, the combined effect of the diction (“guilt,” “peace,” “conscience”)
                     surely gives these lines a darker hue when the preceding slaughter is recalled. It
                     is as if the narrator’s absolution comes only at the cost of narrative amnesia. But
                     another important pointer towards an allegorized, psycho-biographical reading of the

                     deed” (<em>Sp</em> 342). This intense maternal grief enables an interpretation of the scene in which
                     the traumatic act of separation from the mother is both registered and contained by
                     displacing its agency onto a hyperbolically violent third party (in Barrell’s terms,

                     emotions of love and resentment. This reading of the scene then permits us to deepen
                     and broaden the significance of the most “shocking” object in the episode, that emblem
                     of destroyed innocence, the gory fleece. Once we see the fleece as a key player in
                     a psycho-biographical drama of loss and separation, at least four avenues of critical
                     exploration are opened up: first, we can compare the scene to one of its key intertexts,
                     the sheep-shearing ritual in Thomson’s <em>The Seasons</em>; second, we can take a fresh look at the way Bloomfield revisits the scene at the
                     end of <em>FB</em>, clearly in an attempt to produce a “narrative of reparation”; third, we can investigate
                     the function of the image of the fleece in Bloomfield’s curious elegy to his mother,
                     the poem 
                     “To a Spindle”
                     ; and fourth, we can use the idea of sartorial transformation to shed new light on
                     a whole subset of poetical tropes which cluster around the themes of adoption and
                     failed guardianship.</p>

                     these reservations aside for now, Bloomfield clearly organized <em>FB</em> as an imitation of <em>The Seasons</em>. Beginning with Lofft and Nathan Drake, there has been a tendency to bolster Bloomfield’s
                     reputation by showing that at times he is capable of bettering Thomson, either through
                     the use of greater realism or through his skill in utilizing and modifying the conventions
                     of the georgic.

                              in light of the fact that when Charles Dilly rejected FB he “exhorted” Bloomfield
                              “not to waste his time, and neglect his employment, in making vain attempts, and in

                     relation to his poetical master. <em>The Seasons</em> was more than just an inspiring text; it also provided aspiring laboring-class poets
                     with two powerful but contradictory narratives of cultural development and progress.
                     On the one hand, the decline from a pastoral golden age into urban decadence and corruption;
                     on the other, the georgic myth of industrious progress from barbarism to civilization.

                     </div> For the polite reader of the poem, these competing models of national culture undoubtedly
                     offered differing ideological rewards and challenges, but the impact on the rural
                     laboring-class poet was potentially much more personal and deep-seated, as these two
                     narratives defined the conflicted poetic identity of the “humble” writer whose value
                     derived precisely from those “simple” origins. Critics have noted that Bloomfield
                     both benefited and suffered from the existing sentimental stereotype of the “humble”
                     laboring-class poet which predominated in his editors’ and patrons’ eulogies (McEathron, 
                     “Wordsworth”
                      6), but Bloomfield’s story was not only written by his benefactors and patrons: it
                     was already woven into the generic logic of the eighteenth-century georgic. Thomson’s
                     assertion that those who “fret in guilt / And guilty cities” can never know “the life
                     / Led by primeval ages uncorrupt” (Thomson, <em>A</em> 1348-9) not only prefigured Romantic rhetoric, it also constructed a primitivist discourse
                     of value which, particularly for the laboring-class poet, was both a literary conceit
                     and a dominant biographical construction. But if the alleged 1784 conception of <em>FB</em> fits this pastoral paradigm neatly (Bloomfield leaves the “guilty city” for the “uncorrupted”
                     sanctity of the farm), the converse narrative of georgic progress relocates the poem’s
                     genesis in Bloomfield’s workroom, a site of industry and virtuous artisan labor.</p>

                     industriousness. The sentimental structure of the scene is the inverse of <em>FB</em>, as the “loud complaints” (Thomson, <em>S</em> 391) of the “harmless race” (Thomson, <em>S</em> 388) of corralled sheep express an awareness that their fate stands (literally) on
                     a knife-edge; the sheep are “wondering what this wild / Outrageous tumult means” and
                     they remain—in a haunting phrase—“Inly disturbed” (Thomson, <em>S</em> 390-1), a sharp contrast to the “dumb uncomplaining innocence” (Thomson, <em>S</em> 416) of their outward appearance. In order to reassure the sheep (and the reader),
                     the narrator intervenes:

                     benignly “borrowed” for the good of the national economy, making the fleece (however
                     unconvincingly) a redemptive symbol of virtuous commerce rather than violent expropriation.

                     </div> In <em>Autumn</em>, Thomson revisits the trope and condenses the georgic myth of industrious advancement
                     into a fable of sartorial progress, showing how Industry took the benighted savage,
                     “Tore from his limbs the blood-polluted fur, / And wrapped them in the woolly vestment
                     warm” (84-5).</p>

               <p>Placed next to Thomson’s virtuous and consoling fleece, the carnage of <em>FB</em> seems like a deliberate travesty, as if Bloomfield was keen to repudiate not only
                  the basic illusion of non-exploitative labor (which in John Dyer’s even more patriotic
                  sheep-shearing scene in <em>The Fleece</em> [1757] comprises “peaceful subjects” who “without murmur yield / Their yearly tribute”
                  [80]) but also Thomson’s compromise trope of mutual “borrowing.” In order to explain
                  why this metaphor was the target of such a violent repudiation, we can speculate about
                  Bloomfield’s radical, anti-capitalist political affiliations, but we can also recognize
                  that the “farmer’s boy” was precisely a “borrowed” asset, a “fatherless” and “poor”
                  boy farmed out to an uncle’s farm and later transplanted a second time to his brothers’
                  care in the “meridian,” the metropolis where he was again symbolically re-clothed.
                  In Thomsonian terms, Bloomfield’s slaughter scene collapses the stadial distinction
                  between the barbaric “blood-polluted fur” and the enlightened “woolly vestment warm”:
                  cathected indeed, Bloomfield exposes the instability of Thomson’s own rhetoric in
                  which paternalist swaddling is preceded by a violent disrobing. My proposition, therefore,
                  is that the massacre of the innocents in <em>FB</em> is simultaneously an anti-pastoral debunking and a displaced reenactment of what
                  I am speculating was a traumatic moment in Bloomfield’s young life when he was “torn”
                  away from the maternal “woolly vestment warm” and “borrowed” by his uncle “to pay
                  his annual care.” The gory fleece is <em>FB</em>’s central <span class="foreign">memento mori</span>, an emblem of annihilation and arrested development.</p>

                  <p>The poem’s need both to confront and discharge psychic terror is one way to understand
                     the fact that each of the four seasons of <em>FB</em> (and this is not apparent from the anodyne Thomsonian 
                     “Arguments”
                     ) is disturbed and disrupted by episodes which narrativize and allegorize emotions
                     of fear, resentment, and guilt. At the same time, these “digressions” attempt to find
                     a resolution to the anxieties they raise and return the poem to a condition of stability
                     and “peace.” The culmination of this cycle of rupture and resolution comes at the
                     end of the poem when Bloomfield returns to the haunting image of the bloody fleece.
                     There is a strong impression that the poem cannot be allowed to end until this problem
                     has been formally resolved,

                     the displaced hero finds new and more perfect parents, but in Bloomfield’s “narrative
                     of reparation” the closure is unstable and fraught with contradictions. Not only is
                     the restored mother “cheated into tenderness,” but the orphan has a split identity,
                     wearing “his predecessor’s skin” (<em>W</em> 357) and being “doom’d awhile disguis’d to range” (<em>W</em> 356-7)—an intriguing metaphor for the dilemma of the laboring-class poet who, as a

                              his first “gift” from the Duke of Grafton: “What a glorious thing is a present of
                              -------- to a man in distress! If hundreds should arise from my writings, I question
                              if hundreds will produce the exquisite sweetness of that --------” (1827, xx). The
                              blanking out of unsightly figures shows a lingering embarrassment, but we know that
                              Bloomfield received 5 guineas, albeit given to him “screwed up in a little bit of
                              paper” (letter 22, to his mother, 5 March 1800).</span></div>

                              according to his brother George, “you told me, you had resolved, not to go to Sapiston—till
                              independent” (letter 2, from George Bloomfield, 27 December 1789).</span></div>
                     </div> but this made the symbolic reunion of mother and “tribute” even more moving: “[he]
                     has review’d, with the feelings of a truly poetic and benevolent Mind, the haunts
                     of his youth” (<em>1805</em> xxi). For Lofft, restoring <em>FB</em> to its maternal “home” is the crowning glory of the poem’s pastoral virtues, as if
                     the poem is truly where it belongs, outside of the corrupting egotistical forces of
                     “guilty cities.” But the conversion of <em>FB</em> into an object of gift culture does not have to be seen in these sentimental and primitivist
                     terms; it can also be seen as a measure of Bloomfield’s having finally achieved a
                     measure of self-respect and independence.

                              awkward to give it even to my Mother without some kind of introductory letter” (letter
                              11, Robert Bloomfield to George Bloomfield, 7 November 1798). But there is no question
                              that Bloomfield saw FB as a means to give some material assistance to his mother:
                              “Dearest Mother—I trust I shall be abel to do you some Good, pleas God. If I can assist
                              you with some comforts my soul will rejoice” (letter 17, 3 October 1798). In the event,
                              the letter which accompanied the “gift” is quite neutral in tone: “I will not fail
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> According to Lewis Hyde, “It is when art acts as an agent of transformation that we
                     may correctly speak of it as a gift,” adding that “the transformation is not complete
                     until we have the power to give the gift on our own terms” (47). Intriguingly, Hyde
                     illustrates this point by alluding to the well-known folk-tale <em>The Elves and the Shoemaker</em>. This fable is not unrelated to Bloomfield’s situation: the story concerns a struggling
                     shoemaker who is rescued from pauperism by the magical intervention of two elves who
                     turn his unfinished shoes into “complete masterpieces.” The shoemaker becomes “thriving
                     and prosperous” by selling these shoes as if they were his own, at which point he
                     returns the compliment by making some clothes for the naked elves. But the unresolved
                     issue, which is not addressed by the text, is the fraudulent basis of the shoemaker’s
                     success—in essence, he has been deceiving his customers (Hunt 1: 140). With this fable
                     in mind, we may wonder if “duty and affection” are the only “tributes” contained within <em>FB</em>; perhaps Lofft unintentionally let slip one answer to this problem when he identified
                     the inspirational core of the poem as the “haunts” of Bloomfield’s youth.</p>

                     </div> This poem is particularly valuable for any critic working on Bloomfield’s biography,
                     yet its strange refusal to conform to generic expectations and provide an unambiguous
                     “tribute of duty and affection” has failed to attract any critical attention. As its
                     intriguing title indicates, the poem is characteristically full of displacements,
                     odd rhetorical shifts and tonal shocks. Moreover, it is significant that the most
                     compelling trope of the poem is not the concluding image of reunion but the mother’s
                     “half-finished” fleece. The textual route to this image is not straightforward and
                     involves a journey through several important biographical incidents and dates. Bloomfield’s
                     brief but highly revealing preface states that the poem was inspired by his mother’s
                     last visit to London in the summer of 1804,

                     </div> but beyond this bare fact we are told nothing about their relationship. Instead, the
                     preface paints a harrowing portrait of his mother’s last moments in which her usual
                     “patient resignation” gives way to two unstable forms of regressive behavior: first,
                     she develops “an ungovernable dread of ultimate want,” as if her life has been a complete
                     failure and she is pitched back into a primary condition of insecurity: “to meet Winter,
                     Old Age, and Poverty, was like meeting three giants” (65). Second, she becomes a compulsive
                     spinner. As the poem reveals, Bloomfield’s mother was by profession a “village school-mistress”
                     (line 36), but in the preface’s vignette she reverts to the customary occupation for
                     which, we are told, she was renowned, and which becomes an obsession in her last moments: <span class="quote">‘During the tearful paroxysms of her last depression, she spun with the utmost violence,
                        and with vehemence exclaimed, “<em>I must spin!</em>” A paralytic affection, struck her whole right side, while at work, and obliged her
                        to quit her spindle when only half filled, and she died within a fortnight. I have
                        that spindle now. (65)’</span> These are intriguing details, yet the final piece of information provided by the preface
                     is even more revealing for the purposes of this essay. Bloomfield returns to the topic
                     of his mother’s last visit to see him in London and notes that “she returned from
                     her visit to London, on Friday, the 29<sup>th</sup> of June, just to a day, 23 years after she brought me to London, which was also on
                     a Friday, in the year 1781.” No further comments are given, but the coincidence of
                     dates indicates that the poem functions, at one level, as a metaphorical or allegorical
                     revisiting of that formative moment in Bloomfield’s life when “she brought me to London.”
                     From the evidence of the preface, therefore, the mother’s “spindle” is not only a
                     quasi-religious “relic” (the first word of the poem) but also a fetish, an object
                     with the transcendental power to summon the ghosts of the past.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As the first line of the poem shows, Bloomfield’s relation to this fetish is conflicted:
                     “Relic! I will not bow to thee, nor worship!” Does this defiance represent Bloomfield’s
                     complex feelings about his mother? Or is it a protest directed at the generic expectations
                     of the elegy? If the latter, the line explodes the notion that (in Drake’s words)
                     “piety” and respectability seeped from the pores of Bloomfield’s poetry. Whatever
                     the answer, this is an unorthodox opening to an elegy, and it establishes a discordant
                     and edgy tone for the fragmented biographical narrative which follows. In the next
                     seven lines Bloomfield seems to affirm all the pastoral myths about his poetic origins
                     by stating that the spindle evokes those “sunny days, that ever haunt my dreams” (an
                     echo of the rosy phrase “the sunshine of my youth” used in 
                     “To My Old Oak Table”
                      [1803] to describe the inspiration for <em>FB</em>). But these are not the days on the Sapiston farm: the lines refer to the time preceding
                     this, “ere the farm received / My vagrant foot,” and even this tantalizing reference
                     to Honington is only superficially “sunny.” To begin with, the parental role in his
                     transfer to “the farm” is conspicuously deleted and replaced with the awkward passive
                     mood. Furthermore, to call himself a “vagrant” (6) is an almost comic misrepresentation
                     of the basic facts (which were in the public domain) of his involuntary removal to
                     Sapiston,

                     </div> a point that gains some credence from the punning association between the “vagrant
                     foot” and metrical feet. When line six is read to the end, a quite different interpretation
                     of events emerges from the ambiguous syntax: “ere the farm received / My vagrant foot,
                     and with its liberty”—only the possessive “s” of “its” prevents this line from implying
                     that his “liberty” was sacrificed, though ostensibly that word refers to the farm’s
                     new pastoral freedoms which “Had taught my heart to wander” (8). This mood of liberation
                     could therefore be a consolation for the pain of separation and the hardships of becoming
                     (and failing to remain) a “farmer’s boy.”

                     infant past from any parental interference—as if his mother’s death has indeed released
                     him from her sphere of influence—this does not mean that all is forgiven. Having dispensed
                     with his past, Bloomfield then calls on the spectral spindle to teach “a moral” to
                     “me and mine” (10). This “moral” takes the form of a reworking of those scenes in
                     the preface which described his mother’s dying moments. In the poetic re-imagining,
                     the two scenes of frantic spinning and terrified hallucinations are conflated, as
                     if the former is a deranged or superstitious attempt to erect a barrier between herself
                     and the three giants “grim and bold.” Not content to show that “terrors fill’d her
                     brain,— / Nor causeless terrors” (13-14), Bloomfield adds a final macabre touch, the
                     intervention of Death itself who “to her trembling hand and heart at once, / Cried
                     ‘Spin no more’” (20-21). The poem changes the preface’s description of her final seizure—described
                     as a “paralytic affection” (itself an intriguing phrase,

                     </div> and an echo of Lofft’s “tribute of duty and affection”)—into a more dramatic, sudden
                     demise. Death’s pronouncement “Spin no more” presumably answers the mother’s deranged
                     declaration “<em>I must spin!</em>” in the preface, but there is surely also a disturbing allusion to the famous curse
                     “Sleep no more” in Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em>: this echo gives the “utmost violence” of her words a much darker subtext. But if
                     imagining his mother as an infamous murderess is a shocking step for Bloomfield to
                     take, even unconsciously, the allusion could be one way, if an extreme one, to appease
                     his feelings of abandonment and betrayal. What his mother leaves on her spindle, significantly,
                     is an incomplete, “soft downy fleece” of the type that “she wound / Through all her
                     days, she who could spin so well” (22-3). This “half fill’d” and “half finish’d” fleece
                     (24) is yet another modulation of the trope of dysfunctional parental bonding which
                     recurs in <em>FB</em>.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The image of the incomplete fleece is central to the poem’s psychic and aesthetic

                     which the various strands of meaning are gathered. As if he is aware of this, Bloomfield
                     reflects on his own metaphor: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                        </div>
                     </blockquote> The first two lines of this generalization are unimpressively conventional, but in
                     line 28 there is a characteristic slippage. It seems that Bloomfield is remembering
                     a letter written to his brother George in September 1798 in which he refers self-effacingly
                     to his plans to publish <em>FB</em>: “very silly things are sometimes printed.” (letter 10, 16 September 1798.)

                     </div> The verbal echo implies that Bloomfield is now thinking of his own poetic identity.
                     With his mother’s memory safely contained in the twin symbols of the spindle and (more
                     importantly) the half-completed fleece, Bloomfield can now transfer the trope of spinning
                     to the production of his own lines of verse, though he makes this move initially under
                     the protection of self-deprecating allusions to “vain threads” and “sillier things.”

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Bloomfield may also have been remembering some lines from Dyer’s The Fleece: . . .
                              many, yet adhereTo the’ancient distaff, at the bosom fix’d,Casting the whirling spindle
                              as they walk . . . It yields their airy stuffs an apter thread. (3: 128)</span></div>
                     </div> He then uses the third, concluding section of the poem to restage the process of becoming
                     a poet: “Then, feeling as I do, resistlessly, / The bias set upon my soul for verse”
                     (27-8). With this autobiographical re-enactment in place, the final, redemptive modulation
                     of the fleece image provides an appropriately beneficent and pacific conclusion to
                     this allegorized life story. Looking ahead to his own death, he asks God to accept
                     his “purity / Of thought and texture” (32-3) and convert a “poor fragment” (31) into
                     a “snowy innocence” (35).</p>

               <p>The textual evidence adduced so far allows us to surmise that unresolved feelings
                  about filial separation lie behind Bloomfield’s affinity with the orphaned lambs of
                  <em>FB</em> who are “doom’d awhile disguis’d to range” (<em>W</em> 355) in borrowed fleeces, so that the “unsuspecting dam” (<em>W</em> 359) would be “cheated into tenderness” (<em>W</em> 358). The trope of the “half finished” or “half fill’d” fleece provided a means to
                  condense the “torrent” of feelings about his early life (
                  “To My Old Oak Table,”
                  line 96) into a poetically flexible trope of loss and transformation. In psycho-biographical
                  terms, Bloomfield was “re-fleeced” three times. The first major break was the move
                  to Sapiston, the place where he became a farmer’s boy and “reliev’d his Mother of
                  any other expence than only of finding him a few things to wear; and this was more
                  than she well knew how to” (<em>1805</em> v). The second transformation was his arrival in London in 1781, a journey predicated
                  on the promise of his brother Nathaniel “to clothe him” (<em>1805</em> v). The third metamorphosis was the publication of <em>FB</em>, the moment when Bloomfield became a poet and acquired a set of parental substitutes
                  in the guise of patrons and supporters. Each of these rites of passage can be seen
                  as a return of the repressed which generated new and often extreme imaginings of those
                  core emotions of insecurity, guilt, fear, and terror.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The initial wrench from Honington to Sapiston seems to have been either too painful
                     or “obscure” to imagine directly. It is curious that even in his poem 
                     “On Revisiting the Place of my Nativity”
                      (dated 30 May 1800, and published initially in the third edition [May 1800] of <em>FB</em>) there are no details about his parents, his home, or, for that matter, the village
                     (121-2).

                              to George in May 1800, gives a few jumbled details of the coach journey, and the fact
                              that Bloomfield confuses the outward and return legs of the visit seems an indication
                              of mixed feelings: “I have wrote the latter part of my letter backward.”</span></div>
                     </div> After expressing the conventional sentiment that absence has given “Ideal sweetness
                     to my distant home” there is no further mention of this “home.” Perhaps Bloomfield
                     was disconcerted by the response of local people to his celebrity: <span class="quote">‘I conceited that I saw the workmen and neighbours look at me as an idle fellow. I
                        had nothing to do but to read, look at them, and their country and concerns. They
                        did not seem to know how to estimate me. (<em>1827</em> xx)’</span> This is the classic dilemma of the laboring-class poet whose social mobility is regarded
                     with suspicion or bewilderment by the class and community from which he or she originated.
                     As an adopted son of polite culture, Bloomfield had embarked on that perilous voyage
                     of dependency and commercial success which had afflicted the lives and the sanity
                     of some of his plebeian predecessors, notably Stephen Duck.

                     </div> But unlike Duck, Bloomfield was not transported straight from the fields to the mansions
                     of patronage. By 1798, when he completed <em>FB</em>, Bloomfield had lived and worked in London for seventeen years, absorbing and negotiating
                     metropolitan culture in a period of intense political and cultural upheaval.

                              in relation to Bloomfield. See, for example, Landry and Christmas. For the purposes
                              of this essay, I have assumed that Bloomfield absorbed the “spirit of despotism” of
                              the 1790s via whichever cultural and political forces he encountered; the available
                              evidence from letters and other sources make this a reasonable assumption.</span></div>

                     supplied by George Bloomfield (letter 20, before 1 March 1800). We can only speculate
                     about this thinness of detail: it may be explained by the need to conceal radical
                     political affiliations,

                              to the extent that the moment functions like a mock-allusion to radical allegory.
                              When he is milking cows in Spring, Giles’s “tatter’d” hat “purloins a coat of hair”
                              (202) from the cow’s side and becomes “A mottled ensign of his harmless trade, / An
                              unambitious, peaceable cockade” (Sp 203-4). The tone of these two lines is slippery:

                     Bloomfield was essentially and definitively a pastoral poet. He may have lived in
                     the city, but his real creative, spiritual, and moral home was in the Suffolk countryside.
                     The pasteurization of Bloomfield was both a marketing ploy and a way of domesticating
                     Bloomfield so that his patrons could be freed from any guilt about inflating his expectations;
                     laboring-class poets must not be encouraged to “rise into a line that is beyond their
                     reach.”

                     </div> but the humor releases some genuine tensions about the awkward transition from rural
                     to urban culture. The most telling detail is the wonderful literalization of insecurity,
                     the moment when the boy “slipt up” on the pavement (and the joke becomes even more
                     poignant when we remember that Bloomfield had come to London to be apprenticed as
                     a shoemaker). But there is more than one type of “slippage” here. When Bloomfield
                     used the preface to the 1809 edition of his poems to correct inaccuracies in Lofft’s
                     preface, the only incident which he revised in any detail was this “anecdote” of rustic
                     gaucherie. In the corrected narrative, he has prepared for the “change I was going
                     to experience” by wearing his best, Sunday clothes, “such as they were.” Symbolically,
                     he sold his smock frock (the standard dress of the country laborer) for a shilling,
                     and recalls “slily washing my best hat in the horsepond, to give it a gloss fit to
                     appear in the meridian of London.” Clearly, Bloomfield wanted to make his entry into
                     London a more empowering if still comic scene, a moment which emphasized aspiration
                     rather than ineptitude or incongruity.

                              he was hard at work composing FB). The letter makes clear that Bloomfield feels some
                              guilt about the fact that he cannot “help” his mother, but he explains his dilemma
                              in terms of “successions and changes amongst us” and pinpoints his arrival in London
                              as a key moment: “I have read your letters with pleasure, when you have been under
                              the pressure of ill health or bad prospects, the natural though painful conclusion
                              is, I cant help you; you I believe often think over those things, you know the difficulty

                     </div> He also recalls “riding backwards on the coach” and being amazed that all the coaches
                     “stood for hire!” (<em>1827</em> x-xi). These details, which Bloomfield dismisses as “surely trifling anecdotes,” are
                     all important adjustments to Lofft’s version of this rite of passage: the conspicuous
                     dressing up recalls the orphaned lamb “doom’d awhile disguis’d to range”; the literal
                     backwardness on the coach expresses the formidable scale of the journey ahead of him;
                     and the naivety about commercial society anticipates the transition to artisan labor
                     and the free market. Far more was at stake, therefore, in Bloomfield’s rewriting of
                     this initiation scene, than a simple change of clothes. The Sunday-suited Bloomfield
                     was a declaration of independence, an affirmation of the right to dress (and address)
                     himself, and a means to distance himself from his alter ego Giles, who ploughs his
                     field single-handedly “Till dirt adhesive loads his clouted shoes” (<em>Sp</em> 82).</p>

                  <p>But the slaughtered lambs of <em>Spring</em> are only the most spectacular example of Bloomfield’s allegorical dramatization of
                     terror. The anthropomorphic conventions of georgic enabled Bloomfield to displace
                     onto animals a discourse of human rights and a whole battery of violent effects which
                     seem to evoke the climate of terror in the 1790s. But while some of these moments
                     in the poem have been analyzed by critics in this way, the possibility that the same
                     violent tropes might serve both a political and psycho-biographical agenda has yet
                     to be considered. For example, no serious critical attention has been given to one
                     of the earliest examples of terror in the poem, the shooting and staking out of crows
                     (<em>Sp</em> 103-24). Yet this incident contains powerful allegorical possibilities: an exposure
                     of the brutality of the Black Acts, a condemnation of capital punishment, an anti-hunting
                     scene, or even an anti-war allegory.

                              “reflection,” however, the reader will recall the “blood-stain’d” lambs of Spring.</span></div>
                     </div> The passage is structured as a georgic demonstration of the best way to prevent “the
                     wary plunderers” (<em>Sp</em> 107) consuming the newly sown seed:

                     </blockquote> There are a number of ways to interpret this passage: on the one hand, there is a
                     confrontation between civilization and primitive nature; on the other hand, the “wings
                     stretcht forth” clearly evoke sacrificial victims and the Crucifixion. The role of
                     Giles is also not entirely clear, as the hunter figure is not Giles but a generic
                     “sculking gunner.” Only after the passage ends are we told that “This task had Giles,
                     in fields remote from home” (<em>Sp</em> 125). As there is no information about Giles’s feelings, it is not easy to know if
                     he is just indifferent, or if he is a reluctant collaborator in this slaughter. Interestingly,
                     the next day he is given a similar “care,” this time to deter “prowling Reynard” (<em>Sp</em> 158, another “pilferer,” and the first of numerous murderous predators in the poem)
                     by stringing up dead hens: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                           <div class="l">High on the bough that nodded o’er his head,</div>

                        </div>
                     </blockquote> Like the crow-killing, this scene evokes a contemporary political landscape of terror:
                     in the troubles in Ireland, for example, victims were routinely tarred and “feather’d,”
                     but the latter trope could also evoke the mass executions of women or aristocrats
                     in France. The crow-slaying incidents also share a common theme: the severest punishment
                     is meted out to those who “plunder” and give nothing in return; or, put another way,
                     terror is a justified defense against an implacable external threat. But the most
                     intriguing interpretation is to read the scenes as an exploration of Bloomfield’s
                     “poetical welfare,”

                     </div> in which case we can posit that Bloomfield has internalized and redeployed the rhetoric
                     of terror in order to defend his own vocation (the rural poet) against the threat
                     of invasion and expropriation by “plunderers”—in psycho-biographical terms, this could
                     be anyone who steals his “seed” and ruins his “harvest.” If we assume that the laboring-class
                     poet is by definition a culturally insecure subject position,

                              He seems afraid of elevating nature, lest she should be afraid of him” (145). Coleridge
                              wrote to Southey in 1803 that “Blomfield [sic] is the Farmer’s Boy, not a Poet—in
                              the mind of the Public” (cited in McEathron,

                     </div> it is possible that these scenes function as fantasies of pre-emptive retaliation,
                     as if Bloomfield is attempting to expel all “threats” from the poetic landscape. This
                     interpretation gains weight from the fact that the crow-killing scene was almost certainly
                     the first part of <em>FB</em> to be written. In a letter to George written in September 1798, Bloomfield revealed: <span class="quote">‘The parts of the poem first composed, before any thought was entertained of going
                        through with the Seasons, were the morning scene in Spring, beginning “This task had <em>Giles</em>,” and the description of the lambs at play. And if it be lawful for an author to
                        tell his opinion, they have never lost an inch of ground in my estimation from that
                        day to this.

                        </div>’</span> Tellingly, this information also reveals that the other foundational scene of <em>FB</em> was the “lambs at play,” a euphemism for the scene of slaughter which concludes <em>Spring</em>. This information makes clear that the poem’s origins lay not in rural nostalgia
                     but in one of the georgic’s most disturbing conventions, the anthropomorphized slaughter
                     of animals. In psychic terms, the two scenes record Bloomfield’s failure to protect
                     his imaginative landscape from catastrophic violation.</p>
               </div>
               <p>There is also an intriguing coda to this analysis of the allegorical density of the
                  crow-slaying scene in <em>Spring</em>. The spectacle of the slaughtered birds prompted Lofft to spring paratextually to
                  their defense. In one of his editorial notes, he expressed his regret that Bloomfield
                  had not given a “stay of execution” to the birds. For Lofft (drawing on Bewick), the
                  crow is a “very beautiful and very sensible Bird” which deserves “not only mercy,
                  but <em>protection</em> and <em>encouragement</em>.” To prove his point, Lofft reveals that he has in his care two crows that were lamed
                  in a storm. Both birds have become domesticated, but one bird is yet more remarkable,
                  since although enjoying his natural liberty completely, he recognizes, even in his
                  flights at a distance from the house, his adoptive home, his human friends, and early
                  protectors. (<em>1805</em> 103)</p>
               <p>The camouflaged meaning in this anecdote is not difficult to uncover: the story of
                  Lofft’s tamed and grateful crow is clearly designed to extol the virtues of patronage
                  and enlightened “care.” Lofft’s re-allegorizing of Bloomfield’s scene functions itself
                  like a “sculking gun.” Not only does it attempt to intervene in the poem and regulate
                  the imaginative terrain; it also surreptitiously accuses Bloomfield of exceeding the
                  poetic “liberty” of his “adoptive home” and offending his “early protectors.” </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But even if Bloomfield had taken Lofft’s advice, it is doubtful that the “stay of
                     execution” would have lasted long. From its inception, <em>FB</em> gave Bloomfield the creative means to explore and confront fears and terrors, not
                     to avoid or repress them. The poem is structured like a series of seismic tremors
                     followed by a temporary periods of “pastoral” calm. To some extent this pattern follows
                     the model of Thomson, but the much shorter length of <em>FB</em> makes the eruptions of painful and disturbing material into the text more intense
                     and disruptive. One way in which the poem tries to keep control of these ructions
                     is, as already noted, by displacing them onto animals (Perkins 105-6), but as we have
                     seen, the anthropomorphizing imagination which is released by this maneuver quickly
                     exceeds its original georgic purpose. Consider, for example, the fate of “Poor, patient
                     Ball” (<em>S</em> 207), the docile workhorse whose lost tail implies emasculation. His “short-clipt
                     remnant of a tail” has reduced him to “A moving mockery, a useless name” (<em>S</em> 210-11) who is defenseless against blood-sucking flies. An allegorized psycho-biographical
                     reading of this image could suggest an attempt to vent feelings of abjection, disempowerment,
                     and dependency: a series of displacements could take us from “poor” Ball to Giles
                     the “Gibeonite” (<em>Sp</em> 223) to Bloomfield’s more elevated insecurities about status. This chain of association
                     also links to that other, more spectacular “moving mockery” of the poem, the withering
                     account of the decline in the quality of Giles’s locally produced cheese, a decline
                     explained in terms of the dominance of the London market. As the cheese is transported
                     to the “ever-craving mart” of the “huge Metropolis” (<em>Sp</em> 237-8)—the same route, of course, undertaken by Bloomfield in 1781—it is met by “derision
                     and reproach” (<em>Sp</em> 253). The cheese is so hard and dry that it resembles unflattering wooden objects,
                     a “post” (<em>Sp</em> 256), or “the oaken shelf whereon ’tis laid” (<em>Sp</em> 259); and in a final stab of unpalatable phallic humor, it is “Too big to swallow,
                     and too hard to bite” (<em>Sp</em> 262). This brilliant, satirical imagining of commodification displaces the social
                     impotence of rural labor onto the desiccated, devitalized products of that labor which
                     are “mockeries” of masculine prowess and dignity. The importance of this phallic and
                     totemic motif for Bloomfield can be seen in the fact that problematic and over-determined
                     wooden objects are the focus of his two most autobiographical poems 
                     “To a Spindle”
                      and 
                     “To my Old Oak Table.”
                      The motif also reappears in the aptly entitled 
                     “The Broken Crutch,”
                      a poem which, as the title suggests, expresses the frustrated rebelliousness of the
                     rural lower classes.

                  <p>The same disdain for servility and docility can be seen in the strange episode of
                     the two cruelly treated horses in <em>Winter</em> (154-213). This anecdote is meant to prove the virtues of “duty” and obedient labor,
                     but the argument relies on a brutal comparison between rural and urban exploitation.
                     Whereas “Short-sighted Dobbin” (<em>W</em> 159) suffers mere drudgery and cannot see (understandably) that “Thy chains were freedom,
                     and thy toils repose” (<em>W</em> 162), his urban counterpart the post-horse is callously and horrifically mistreated:
                     “His piece-meal murderers wear his life away” (<em>W</em> 198). Though an anthropomorphic reading of this scene reinforces the perceived “anti-urban”
                     bias of the poem (Lawson 88), the advantages of rural labor are hardly legion, as
                     Dobbin still “wear[s] the clinking chain” (<em>W</em> 158).

                     of Bloomfield’s own relation to his formative years in the metropolis. Bloomfield’s
                     urban identity is almost entirely suppressed in his poetry, as if he could only imagine
                     himself as the rural poet of his own legend, but one way to interpret <em>FB</em>’s disturbances is in terms of his anxious and self-questioning urban self—the autodidact
                     poet, the artisan and the father—forcing its way into the text in various disguises.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Take, for example, the poem’s most sustained full-frontal assault on modernity: this
                     is the passage at the end of <em>Summer</em> which makes a Cobbett-like attack on the gentrification of farming. The first point
                     to note about this tirade is that it focuses on the changed role of the farmer: formerly
                     a “good old Master” who shook his workers’ hands, he is now a collaborator with the
                     “new grandeur” (<em>S</em> 348). In one sense, then, the farmer resembles a compromised patron who has sold his
                     soul to “Bold innovations” (<em>S</em> 384) that “bear no peace beneath their showy dress” (<em>S</em> 385). The sartorial metaphor signifies the farmer’s betrayal of his roots and responsibilities,
                     but behind the farmer is the more general paradigm of social mobility, that anxious
                     move from “humble industry” (<em>S</em> 354) to the “hated face” of “refinement” (<em>S</em> 338). The awkward allegorical question raised by this interjection, therefore, is
                     the extent to which the successful laboring-class poet—who by definition will almost
                     certainly become socially or culturally mobile—can retain an authentic self-identity
                     without selling out to “tyrant customs” (<em>S</em> 335). Bloomfield’s solution to the problem (which, as he was writing the poem, could
                     only be in anticipation) is twofold: to avoid self-incrimination, he displaces the
                     offense onto the farmer; he also polarizes bourgeois “refinement” and “humble” rural
                     life, leaving nothing in between, but in order to do this he has to invent an anonymous
                     and ghostly “mourner” for the lost organic society. This figure acts as a useful pseudo-autobiographical
                     device, enabling Bloomfield to present the most militant “rural” version of himself
                     in the poem: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">Can my sons share from this paternal hand</div>
                           <div class="l">The profits with the labours of the land?</div>
                           <div class="l">. . . </div>
                           <div class="l">Where’s the small farm to suit my scanty means? (<em>S</em> 357-8, 360)</div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> Clearly, this cannot be the actual Bloomfield of 1798, who had lived in London for
                     seventeen years. What seems to be the poem’s most autobiographical intervention is,
                     significantly, an adopted voice, albeit a more elevated persona than the inarticulate
                     Giles: “Let labour have its due; then peace is mine” (<em>S</em> 399). Perhaps this is Bloomfield’s fantasy of the person he might have become if he
                     had stayed in the countryside, but the statement of solidarity with rural labour relies
                     on the effacing of the real, “refined” Bloomfield whose quest for peace was a complex
                     social, intellectual, and cultural affair.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Indeed, Bloomfield’s quest to find existential “peace” by confronting the demons of
                     his imagination explains the presence of three seemingly gratuitous episodes in the
                     poem: the mad girl Ann, the marooned Giles (both in <em>Autumn</em>), and the poem’s climactic scene of terror, the apparition in <em>Winter</em>. Perhaps based on similar figures in Cowper and Goldsmith, Ann (originally named
                     Poll) is the most troubled figure in the poem: “her peace was gone” (<em>A</em> 115) and “Terror and Joy alternate rul’d her hours” (<em>A</em> 121). She could be a fallen woman, though there is less evidence for this than in
                     Wordsworth’s 
                     “The Thorn.”
                      What is clear is that she has suffered arrested development and has become an exile
                     from normal social life. As a “lost child” mourned by her “afflicted parents” (<em>A</em> 128), she is the poem’s most spectacular orphan, detached not only from family life
                     but also from rural culture: “Inverted customs yield her sullen joy”(<em>A</em> 130). Ann is a travesty of the organic community, preferring to sleep with pigs than
                     in the “cot’s warm walls” (<em>A</em> 137). She is a blot on the rural landscape, a constant reminder of social and psychological
                     breakdown. But having raised a ghost who threatens the stability of pastoral conventions,
                     Bloomfield has to rebuild those same defenses: his antidote to the mad Ann is to invoke
                     a sentimental stereotype of the humble cottage which restores the Burkean virtues
                     of family life: “Inestimable sweets of social peace!” (<em>A</em> 176). With this reassurance in place, the poet is able to learn the correct lesson
                     from Ann’s tragic story, “Let peace ne’er leave me, nor my heart grow cold” (<em>A</em> 179).

                              laid Ann’s ghost to rest, claiming that he had met her on a visit to Honington in
                              1800 and “found her greatly recovered, and sensible of her past calamity” (cited in
                              Goodridge and Lucas’s 1998 edition, 132n.).</span></div>

               <p>But the peace does not last long, as the very next scene is also about isolation,
                  abandonment and deep inner suffering. When Giles is given an extremely lonely job
                  guarding the crops against birds, his misery is made keener when his friends fail
                  to come and visit him. This neglect deepens the gloomy mood of alienation and entrapment:
                  “If fields are prisons, where is Liberty?” (<em>A</em> 226). Moreover, the narrator insists, a broken promise is worse than no promise at
                  all. The breakdown of sociability leaves Giles with one option, to seek consolation
                  in the nostalgic past: </p>

               <p> As the retreat into the consolations of “past joys” collapses, the normally compliant
                  Giles becomes a figure of seething discontent and resentment. It is hard not to see
                  this scene as yet further circumstantial evidence of a “rankling injury” of neglect
                  and abandonment under which Bloomfield labored.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But the culmination of the poem’s engagement with terror is the appearance of the
                     “grisly Spectre” in <em>Winter</em>. This scene is preceded by several violent incidents, notably the “piece-meal” murder
                     of the post-horse and the treacherous nocturnal raids of the mastiff—“A pattern of
                     fidelity by day, / By night a murderer, lurking for his prey” (<em>W</em> 223-4). The mastiff’s victims are “peaceful sheep” (<em>W</em> 226) and their “reeking blood” (<em>W</em> 228) evokes the slaughter at the end of <em>Spring</em>, as if the “reeking” legacy of that scene has to be resolved before <em>FB</em> can end. This closure is sought through several restagings of the problem of failed
                     guardianship. The tone is set by the change of the mastiff from a “midnight Chieftain
                     . . . / Beneath whose guardianship all hearts rejoice” (<em>W</em> 214-15) into a creature which “will from the path of duty err” (<em>W</em> 222). This pattern of lost trust is repeated in the next episode in the poem, in which
                     Giles has to protect his “little flock” against such “nightly terrors” as the mastiff
                     (<em>W</em> 239-40). As Giles wanders through the moonlit fields, his “loos’d imagination” (<em>W</em> 265) compares the nocturnal clouds to a “beauteous ’semblance of a Flock at rest”
                     (<em>W</em> 260), but this sublimation of the poem’s central symbol of “spotless” innocence is
                     actually a guilty indulgence: “neglected Duty calls; / At once from plains of light
                     to earth he falls” (<em>W</em> 267-8). Recalled from poetry to pastoral duty, Giles finds himself in a “narrow lane”
                     (<em>W</em> 269) which is uncannily both familiar and strange. Temporarily disorientated by his
                     flight of poetic fancy, Giles suddenly finds himself face to face with a “grisly Spectre,
                     cloth’d in silver grey” (<em>W</em> 273). Giles’s response to the apparition is interesting: rather than fleeing, he shows
                     a determination to face down the ghost and prove that it is nothing less than another
                     figment of his imagination. Before he can exorcise the phantom, however, he has to
                     absolve himself of guilt: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">’Tis not my crimes thou com’st here to reprove;</div>
                           <div class="l">No murders stain my soul, no perjur’d love: (<em>W</em> 283-4)</div>

                     </blockquote> With his “conscious Innocence” (<em>W</em> 312) in place, Giles identifies the “motionless deformity” (<em>W</em> 292) of the shape as nothing more than an optical illusion, the visual tricks played
                     by bright moonlight on an “aged” ash tree. Far from being a threat, the tree is actually
                     a symbol of order and reparation: “Its perfect lineaments at once appear, / Its crown
                     of shiv’ring ivy whispering peace” (<em>W</em> 306-7). This symbolic reversal is not only a victory over stereotypical rustic superstition,

These are the “blest guardians” (<em>W</em> 317) who will “tranquillize his breast” (<em>W</em> 319) and fulfill the promise of <em>Summer</em> when, temporarily, “Peace o’er his slumbers wave[d] her guardian wing” (<em>S</em> 109).

                     to sooth my pain with poetry, to exert myself forcibly, and to conquer by a <span class="foreign">coup de main</span>, the imaginary evils that beset me, for imaginary they certainly were in a great

                     a lost ass’s foal for a phantom. The poem was published in Bloomfield’s second collection <em>Rural Tales, Ballads and Songs</em> (1802), and an introductory note states that the incident is a local legend and “is

                     continuing “imaginary evils,” a darker, richer, and multilayered text emerges.</p>
               </div>
               <p>
                  “The Fakenham Ghost”
                  is much more than a lightweight piece of Suffolk literary lore. Its plot conspicuously
                  reworks the two major episodes which conclude <em>FB</em>, an encounter between a terrified rustic and a specter and a healing act of animal
                  adoption. In the reconfigured psychic landscape of trauma and reparation of the later
                  poem, there are three important changes of setting and personae. First, the role of
                  Giles is replaced by “an ancient Dame” (5); second, the “Monster” is not a tree but
                  an “<em>Ass’s Foal</em>” which has “lost its Dam” (61); third, the location is Euston Park not Sapiston.
                  These revisions can yield all kinds of fascinating psycho-biographical results. For
                  example, if we see the “ancient Dame” as a surrogate mother figure—and as the introductory
                  note makes clear, Bloomfield’s mother is one of the keepers of the tale—then it is
                  possible to conclude that the poem is a form of symbolic castigation. As “darker fears
                  / Came o’er her troubled mind” (21-2) she “own’d her sins, and down she knelt” (39).
                  The “trotting ghost” (31) which stalks her is not only her own conscience but Bloomfield’s
                  “troubled mind” pursuing its psychic prey (with the slightly comic word “trotting”
                  connoting the ballad meter which is serving as the instrument of the pursuit). The
                  comic resolution of the plot is of course one way to discharge all this painful material,
                  and there could be a hint of self-mockery in the transformation of the “imp of sin”
                  (65) into an orphaned ass’s foal. The adoption of this “shaggy stranger” (67) by the
                  Dame is in some ways a more satisfactory resolution than the end of <em>FB</em>, as the mother is actually human, but on the other hand the assimilation remains
                  a “joke” (76) and the “favourite” is still called a “Ghost” (73).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The relocation of the action to Euston Park is also interesting, as it signifies Grafton’s
                     new role as Bloomfield’s patron. If, at some unconscious level, Bloomfield is the
                     “shaggy stranger,” then it is ultimately Grafton who “kept the joke alive” (76). But
                     there is another ghost haunting this landscape. Buried away in Bloomfield’s memory
                     is another diabolical trespasser in Fakenham Wood. In one of the 
                     “Anecdotes and Observations”
                      which were published in the second volume of <em>Remains</em>, Bloomfield recalls being told that the young Thomas Paine and his sister once wandered
                     into these same woods.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note61" id="Note61_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> As Bloomfield notes wryly, “I had the misfortune to be born only six miles from the
                     birthplace of Tom Paine!! This, to some ears would be horrible” (<em>Remains</em> 2: 345; see also letter 354, 31 May-1 June 1821). As if to guard against any suggestion
                     of Painite sympathies, Bloomfield states that he heard about the incident in a roundabout
                     way: the story came from his friend Dr. Walker who was returning from Egypt (where
                     he had just given “vaccine inoculation” to troops) when he met Paine in Paris. Apparently,
                     Paine and his sister went into the wood to collect nuts, without telling their parents.
                     They became lost (“wandered out of their knowledge”), so Tom climbed a tree to “see
                     his way out of the wood” but fell and narrowly avoided serious injury. Walker (as
                     reported by Bloomfield) remarks “that there are many thousands who will probably exclaim:
                     ‘What a pity that he had not broke his neck!’” but in Paris the response was different.
                     One of Walker’s interlocutors remarks that “The guardian angel of Liberty was near
                     thee, Thomas.” In this highly mediated episode, Fakenham Wood becomes nothing less
                     that the site of a revolutionary <span class="foreign">deus ex machina</span> and the place where Britain’s homegrown “imp of sin” found deliverance. The other
                     “joke” of the poem is therefore its satirical allegorization of counter-revolutionary
                     hysteria and the pacification of Jacobinism, and it is worth noting that 1802 was
                     the year when invasion fears and loyalist mobilization reached their peak. Hence the
                     poem’s ending could contain a covert allusion to ongoing political repression: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                     that 
                     “The Fakenham Ghost”
                      is a highly spun fable of terror and salvation in which the symbolic aim is to reunify
                     the body politic and inoculate the poet and the reader against the Pain(e) of the
                     traumatic loss of the mother (country).</p>

                  <p>Yet this incursion of a suppressed revolutionary narrative into a seemingly artless
                     ballad shows that Bloomfield’s “rural” themes remained infected with the discourse
                     of terror and the burdens of a troubled consciousness. It is revealing that Paine’s
                     “fall” entered 
                     “The Fakenham Ghost”
                      through the agency of a physician who administered “vaccine inoculation” to the army,
                     as if immunization symbolized both a medical and ideological barrier against contamination.

                     it banishes painful memories of loss and achieves a perfect victory “unstain’d with
                     gore” (36), the ideal theme for “the glory of the pastoral reed” (36).

                     </div> The common thread which runs through nearly all of Bloomfield’s post-<em>FB</em> poems is the family romance: the loss and recovery of actual or surrogate family members.
                     Looked at superficially, there is nothing surprising about finding this traditional
                     theme in collections of rural verse with titles such as <em>Wild Flowers</em> (1806) and <em>May Day with the Muses</em> (1822), but for Bloomfield the family romance was an aesthetic and psychic space in
                     which he could revisit and re-stage his “boyage” from childhood separation to the
                     ambiguous rewards of patronage. The most symptomatic text in this context is probably 
                     “The Broken Crutch”
                      (1806),

                     </div> a poem which seems to strenuously undermine itself. The story shows the humiliation
                     of a “plebeian” man who mistakenly tries to defend the honor of his niece against
                     a landowner he mistakenly perceives to be predatory: the “broken crutch” of the title
                     is a symbol of emasculation which converts popular protest into another “joke” and
                     idealizes the paternalist virtues of the niece’s suitor. Yet this victory (“unstain’d
                     with gore”) sits uneasily with an angry interjection in which the poet denounces the
                     “murderous axe” of enclosure (57-78), leaving the reader unsure about the poem’s loyalties.
                     Similarly, it is hard to know if Sir Ambrose Higham, the patron of <em>May Day with the Muses</em>, is a figure of unconditional praise (which seems to be the prevailing critical opinion)
                     or “sculking” resentments. Given that Bloomfield wrote this last collection of poems
                     in poverty and “a wretched state of health,”

                     does full justice to the unique “mental pains” of the plebeian author, and which avoids
                     or complements the critical imperative to prove or disprove explicit ideological affiliations.
                     Laboring-class writing is by definition a radical culture issue; the question which
                     remains is precisely how we configure and value the full creative range and depth
                     of such writing, and the extent to which we are prepared to confront some of our own

               “A Poem,”
               but Bloomfield was not in control of the shaping of the poem’s image.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               He was not gifted with imagination, but his memory shielded him from uncongenial surroundings,
               and enabled him to transfer his mental life to those fields and woodlands where he
               had been most happy” (Unwin 91). Derek Roper describes <em>FB</em> as “quiet and pleasant” (65). John Lucas calls the poem’s depiction of rural life
               “pre-lapsarian” (62), though Lucas, like most current commentators on the poem, sees
               the poem’s nostalgia as only partially successful in fending off pressing literary
               and social anxieties. My approach aims to probe much further into this “darker” side

               of writing and knowledge” in which the “inner” self was constituted as both a “sacred
               place and a site of danger” (15). For Felicity Nussbaum, such writing was an opportunity
               to “experiment with interdiscourses and the corresponding subject positions to breach
               the uncertainties of identity” (37).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">There is ample evidence in Bloomfield’s letters to support a psycho-biographical approach
               to his writing. One of the best examples is his account of “the two years that I was
               breeding with Giles” (letter 16, to George Bloomfield, 8 September 1799). Literary
               creativity and parental anxieties are fused into a trope of uncertain and insecure
               depth which crystallizes into an apt verbal slip: “ . . . by the time I was brought
               to Bed with my Boy, my wife was breeding another;! We some times see a ball of wax
               with so small a portion of the buoyant quality that it knows not whither to sink or
               swim; if you put your finger on it when at the surface, it will dive deep and be a
               long time in rising again; so it was with my Boy Charles, he dived me into some debts
               this time twelvemonth, from which I am not yet free, but I have great hopes I shall
               be free by the end of November.” In Jonathan Lawson’s citation of this letter the
               key word “buoyant” is spelt “boyant,” a slip which is full of ironies. Lawson is the
               only critic to see the importance of this letter, noting that it clearly “stirred
               terror as well as joy” and showed a side of Bloomfield which was “hidden away by his
               editors and biographers” (23). See also Bloomfield’s barbed comment that “Gentlemen,
               ’tis true, seldom enter alleys, or see the domestic habits of those nests of human
               wretchedness” (<em>Remains</em> 2: 71-2). The poems, however, do enter such psychic “alleys.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Barrell subtitles his book 
               “A Psychopathology of Imperialism”
               to convey the point that the excessive orientalist imagery in De Quincey’s writing
               should not be interpreted as simple racism but as a psychic attempt to displace and
               resolve anxieties arising from the emotional damage inflicted on him by childhood
               trauma. Similarly, I want to suggest that we can find insights into the working-class
               writer’s troubled experience of social and cultural mobility by locating what Barrell
               calls tropes of “trauma” and “reparation” rather than looking for a direct transcription
               of life into text.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">The phrase “he felt no more” also echoes the poem’s motto, “A shepherd’s boy, he seeks
               no better name” (the first line of Alexander Pope’s pastoral poem <em>Summer</em>). Interestingly, Bloomfield cited this motto and Lofft’s introduction as examples
               of editorial imposition. In the preface to the 1809 edition of his poems, Bloomfield
               recalls that the first knowledge of the poem’s publication came when his brother Nathaniel
               saw in a bookseller’s window “a book called The Farmer’s Boy, with a motto. I told
               him I supposed it must be mine, but I knew nothing of the motto” (<em>1827</em> xix). Bloomfield also told Lofft that, “I had not seen the poem, and consequently
               not the preface” until he visited the Duke of Grafton (letter 23, to Capel Lofft,
               5 March 1800); see also the 
               “Authorial Note”
               (1801) cited in Goodridge and Lucas’s 2007 edition (22).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12.. </span><span class="noteBody">The whole question of exactly what was connoted by the word “farmer’s boy” and its
               various derivatives is certainly worth more attention, as it is more than possible
               that “boy” in this context was a term of derision which poked fun at the docile country
               yokel, or at the very least that it was a sentimental stereotype of conformity and
               social mobility. It is certainly the case that a well-known ballad called <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> or <em>The Lucky Farmer’s Boy</em> was in circulation by the early nineteenth century, though I have yet to determine
               if it precedes Bloomfield’s poem (many versions of the ballad can be found in the
               <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/ballads/ballads.htm">online Bodleian Library Broadside Ballads collection</a>). In the ballad, a fatherless boy begs for work at a farm and after being taken in
               becomes a model worker and eventually marries the farmer’s daughter. See also the
               Cheap Repository Tract <em>The Good Militia Man; or, the Man that is Worth a Host, Being a New Song by Honest
                  Dan the Plough-boy turned Sailor</em> (1796), in which “Dan” is a model of conformity; and <em>Young Lubin was a Shepherd Boy</em> (1794), in which the hapless hero drowns on the eve of his wedding. Also of note
               are <em>The Village Boy</em> (1780); and <em>The Wounded Farmer’s Son</em> (1795). Lofft reported that on Austin’s farm the young Bloomfield was treated fairly
               like “all the Servant Boys” (<em>1805</em> xvii).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">It is hard to imagine how Nathan Drake could conclude that this scene “breathe[s]
               the utmost tenderness and sweetness” (457-8), but the failure to confront the full
               impact of this gruesome slaughter has persisted to the present day. Bridget Keegan
               notes correctly that a “potent symbol of pastoralism is slaughtered” in this scene,
               but she is reluctant to probe further; though she ponders “what other feelings, besides
               pity for the lambs, does this unsettling scene provoke?” her answer is that “the angry
               tone of these lines is atypical of Bloomfield” and she explains the “unsettling” violence
               as a “profound protest against the exploitation of nature” (
               “Lambs,”
               pars 31, 33). In a more recent assessment, Keegan explains the scene in terms of ecological
               “sustainability” (<em>Labouring-Class</em> 21-3). See also White, who attributes the scene’s anger to Bloomfield’s rage at the
               carnivorous appetites of the “the metropolitan rich” (<em>Romanticism and the Poetry of Community</em> 19).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               vain attempts, and in particular in treading on the ground which Thomson had sanctified”

               his first “gift” from the Duke of Grafton: “What a glorious thing is a present of
               -------- to a man in distress! If hundreds should arise from my writings, I question
               if hundreds will produce the exquisite sweetness of that --------” (<em>1827</em>, xx). The blanking out of unsightly figures shows a lingering embarrassment, but
               we know that Bloomfield received 5 guineas, albeit given to him “screwed up in a little
               bit of paper” (letter 22, to his mother, 5 March 1800).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note26_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               my soul will rejoice” (letter 17, 3 October 1798). In the event, the letter which
               accompanied the “gift” is quite neutral in tone: “I will not fail to tell you further

               of this essay, I have assumed that Bloomfield absorbed the “spirit of despotism” of
               the 1790s via whichever cultural and political forces he encountered; the available

               the poem this possibility is presented through denial and pacification, to the extent
               that the moment functions like a mock-allusion to radical allegory. When he is milking
               cows in <em>Spring</em>, Giles’s “tatter’d” hat “purloins a coat of hair” (202) from the cow’s side and becomes
               “A mottled ensign of his harmless trade, / An unambitious, peaceable cockade” (<em>Sp</em> 203-4). The tone of these two lines is slippery: what seems like a gratuitous reinforcement
               of pastoral’s counter-revolutionary credentials could equally, in my mind, consign
               Giles to docility and political inefficacy. In other words he becomes—for a brief
               moment—the kind of conservative stereotype perpetuated in Hannah More’s tracts. The
               other point to note about the scene is that it is yet another reworking of the trope
               of the expropriated fleece in which a natural resource is (peaceably in this instance)

         <div class="note" id="Note42"><span class="noteLabel">42. </span><span class="noteBody">Anderson 393-5. Anderson’s review of the poem gives a useful insight into the perils
               of patronage. In response to a long letter from a reader which praises <em>FB</em> and its author, “a simple farmer’s boy” (391), Anderson states that he read “this
               little poem in manuscript with much satisfaction” but also with uneasiness about the
               wisdom of bringing Bloomfield “forward to public notice” (393). He states that patronage
               can be the “severest cruelty” if it leads lower-class poets into “an uninterrupted
               struggle” to “rise into a line that is beyond their reach.” But he is reassured that
               the “characteristic features” of <em>FB</em> are “innocence and beneficence” and “native simplicity” and that these qualities
               are a reflection of Bloomfield’s sensible decision not to aspire socially and intellectually
               beyond “domestic comforts” and those “few congenial souls” (polite friends) “in whose
               conversation he may feel himself fortified in his natural propensities rather than
               deranged” (394-5). Nathan Drake also reassured budding patrons who “from their opulence
               and taste are disposed to patronise and foster the efforts of rising genius” that
               they would find a “peculiar gratification” in the fact that both <em>FB</em> and its author were thoroughly respectable “in a moral light” (479). The image of
               the pasteurized Bloomfield quickly congealed into a species of hagiography, completely
               suppressing the less settling aspects of his “poetical welfare.” The <em>Gentleman’s Magazine</em> called him “the best of husbands, an indulgent father and quiet neighbour, and particularly
               affectionate to his mother” (70 (1800): 1181), and Robert Southey applauded “one whose
               talents were of no common standard, and whose character was in all respects exemplary”
               (163). But the apotheosis of this tendency was probably Joseph Weston’s gushing defense
               of Bloomfield’s integrity in <em>Remains</em>. For Weston, Bloomfield is a paragon of English poetical virtue, exuding “sweetness,
               simplicity and feeling,” producing “pictures . . . drawn directly from nature” which
               are “<em>always</em> just and true, like the reflections of a polished mirror” and uncontaminated by the
               “infestation of impure motivation or poetical conduct.” Hence “everything is simple
               and unaffected, purely pastoral and truly English” like the poet himself who eschewed
               all “phantoms of foreign extraction” (<em>Remains</em> 1: vii, ix, x).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note42_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               changes amongst us” and pinpoints his arrival in London as a key moment: “I have read
               your letters with pleasure, when you have been under the pressure of ill health or
               bad prospects, the natural though painful conclusion is, I cant help you; you I believe

               in the Horse-pond and sold my smock for a shilling to Sam Shelver’s boy, and set off

               my old neighbours and things just as they were; fixing the memory thus, brings in
               a strong point of view the quick successions and changes amongst us; for if I had
