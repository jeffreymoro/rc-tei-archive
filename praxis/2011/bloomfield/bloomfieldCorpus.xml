               <p>This enthusiastic comment from the poet Robert Bloomfield to his older brother
               reflects one of the more varied and vigorous letter-writing sensibilities of the
               Romantic period, one that has hitherto been neglected, but is now gloriously
               showcased by the new online collection of the letters of Bloomfield and his circle,
               to which the present collection of essays forms a companion volume.<note resp="editors" place="foot">
                     <title level="m">The Letters of Robert Bloomfield and his Circle</title>. Ed. Tim
                  Fulford and Lynda Pratt. <title level="s">Romantic Circles Electronic
                     Editions,</title> 2009. (http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/bloomfield_letters).
                  These letters are cited throughout the present collection of essays in short form,
                  by their letter number and, as appropriate, by their author, recipient and date.
               </note> Unlike many other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century laboring-class poets,
               Robert Bloomfield was able to sustain and develop his publishing career. While none
               of his subsequent publications received the acclaim of his debut poem, <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> (1800), after his initial success Bloomfield
               rightfully considered himself a professional author for the remainder of his life.
               His letters, made available to a modern audience for the first time with this online
               edition, document one artist’s struggles (and sometimes his victories) to share his
               unique voice and vision. Even though Bloomfield’s published legacy is rich and
               varied, the publication of his extant letters, as well as additional letters to and
               about him, reveals new and exciting insights into Bloomfield the artist and the man.
               Bloomfield in his letters demonstrates his active and thoughtful engagement with the
               London literary scene, with the broader literary culture of his day, and with his
               fellow laboring-class poets. The letters also provide a fascinating historical
               resource for those interested in the lives of the members of an extended
               laboring-class family, as they negotiated the new forms of mobility available to them
               in the early nineteenth-century, both geographic and intellectual.</p>
               <p>Although some of Bloomfield’s correspondence was made available in Joseph Weston’s
               1824 <title level="m">Remains</title>, and some in W. W. Hart's <title level="m">Selections of the Correspondence of Robert Bloomfield</title> (London, 1870;
               reprinted Redhill, Surrey, 1968), Tim Fulford and Lynda Pratt’s electronic edition
               offers a comprehensive and easily-searchable resource for anyone wishing to know more
               about Bloomfield and his personal and literary milieu. The letters and complementary
               texts offer insight into the poet’s larger literary concerns as well as his more
               quotidian activities. They include reflections on his creative process as well as
               detailed accounts of his personal finances. In short, the letters enable modern
               readers to better understand what made Bloomfield one of the best-selling poets of
               the early Romantic period, and they offer a compelling argument about the
               intellectual value of the recovery and study of laboring-class literary culture in
               general. The essays included in this collection highlight and draw attention to
               aspects of Bloomfield's literary production that would likely not be possible without
               the full access to his letters that this edition provides. As Tim Fulford notes in
               his introduction to the letters, Bloomfield's significance to the Romantic period has
               only recently begun to be reevaluated, and the following essays further the project
               of enriching our understanding of the poet's significance within a wide range of
               contexts. </p>
               <p>One particular epistolary exchange, highlighted in four of the essays, illustrates
               how the correspondence enables us to rethink Bloomfield’s consequence to literary
               history. This is the series of letters between Bloomfield and T. J. Lloyd Baker, one
               of the poet’s many “friends” throughout his career. Bloomfield had enjoyed a long
               relationship with Lloyd Baker, his wife Mary, and his wife’s family, the Sharps,
               including joining them on the trip along the Wye that formed the basis of
               Bloomfield’s ambitious long poem. (Among the more noteworthy members of the Sharp
               family was Mary's uncle, the celebrated abolitionist Granville Sharp, another
               interesting connection for the poet.) The exchange of 1821 is exemplary of the
               tensions between the public and the private, the personal and the professional that
               were particularly fraught for poets of laboring-class origins. Bloomfield had to
               negotiate these tensions throughout his career, and, as this series of letters
               reveal, his patience had begun to fray. </p>
               <p>While Bloomfield was burdened throughout his life with significant difficulties, he
               did not fit many of the stereotypes often associated with the cult of “natural
               genius” that affected the reception of so many other poets with plebeian origins,
               including early tragic death and chronic mental or physical illness, although as
               Peter Denney suggests, common ideas about original genius gave Bloomfield a potential
               justification for refusing to air any political opinions. But like other poets of his
               class (most notably John Clare), because Bloomfield’s first major poem was
               “semi”-autobiographical (as Ian Haywood discusses), much of the initial interest in
               the work was based as much upon curiosity about the author as appreciation for the
               work. And polite readers had certain expectations about what laboring-class poets
               should and should not say—both publicly and privately. These expectations are
               transparent in Lloyd Baker’s letter, which castigates Bloomfield for holding
               political and religious views that could be considered “radical.” Bloomfield’s
               rightfully indignant response helps to reveal some of the shifts in the poet’s
               understanding of what expectations could be legitimately imposed upon him. A similar
               transformation of patron-poet relations is evident in the study of earlier
               laboring-class poets, including Ann Yearsley and James Woodhouse. While Lloyd Baker’s
               letters demonstrate the late survival of the old patronage system well into the
               Romantic period, Bloomfield’s responses indicate just how far the poet’s sense of his
               professional identity—and his personal rights—had altered in the twenty years since
               his debut publication. These four letters touch on civil and creative liberties,
               family relations, the right to privacy in politics and religion. They challenge the
               more irenic presentation of the good-natured and well-behaved shoemaker poet that has
               perhaps made Bloomfield less enticing to modern critics who (like the poet’s
               contemporary audience) seem more drawn to writers whose lives embody more thrilling
               catastrophe or controversy. </p>
               <p>The essays in this companion collection elaborate upon the themes encapsulated in the
               letters discussed above<hi/>and make a strong case for why Bloomfield continues
               to be worthy of study. They also suggest how much more remains to be said about this
               prolific poet. Tim Fulford’s essay, which opens the collection, demonstrates that
               contrary to most caricatures of the isolated Romantic genius, Bloomfield’s letters
               show his intense sociability. Fulford highlights some of the key themes and motifs
               from 426 letters available in the edition. He challenges the view of Bloomfield as a
               strictly “rural” figure, elaborating upon his engagement in urban—and more
                  significantly—<emph>suburban</emph> life. Nevertheless, the letters reveal too
               Bloomfield’s dedication to keeping alive village traditions important to himself and
               his family, and provide a degree of lively ethnographic detail of various popular
               customs, festivals, and pastimes. Bloomfield engages in nature-tourism like fellow
               early Romantics such as Coleridge, but his letters describing his clerical toils
               anticipate Victorian scenes such as those Dickens depicts in <title level="m">Great
                  Expectations.</title> Regardless of the subject matter, as Fulford demonstrates,
               “[t]he abiding theme of Bloomfield’s correspondence is the control of his own words.”
               While Bloomfield was as besieged as any laboring-class poet by various patrons
               throughout his career, his letters show his skill in negotiating a variety of
               difficult social and financial transactions. His perspicacity, intelligence, and
               commitment to his art are continually underscored in his correspondence.</p>
               <p>Following Fulford, Ian Haywood offers what may be the riskiest and most
               iconoclastic—but also the most provocative and productive—reading of Bloomfield to
               date. While other critics have hinted at some of the potentially darker elements in
               Bloomfield’s work, Haywood uses a psycho-biographical approach to uncover the
               underside of the more congenial and complacent public image that Bloomfield (or at
               least his patrons) wanted to project. Focusing in particular upon the remarkable
               passage describing the slaughter of the lambs in <title level="m">The Farmer’s
                  Boy</title>, Haywood argues that this dramatic primal scene provides a key into a
               persistent pattern of mental anguish and psychic struggle that the pastoral façade of
               much of Bloomfield’s writing would seem to disguise. Like Fulford, Haywood asks us to
               look beyond a conventional reading of the rurality of <title level="m">The Farmer’s
                  Boy</title> and to see in the georgic moments of violence evocations of
               contemporary events such as the 1798 Irish rebellion. Haywood integrates information
               from the letters into his reading of the poem to reveal degrees of ambivalence,
               anxiety, and guilt heretofore largely ignored in Bloomfield’s writing, offering
               insight into the possible shadow side of the seeming bucolic bliss ostensibly
               celebrated in the text.</p>
               <p>While Haywood looks to possible political allegories embedded in the scenes of animal
               slaughter, Peter Denney’s essay takes up the question of Bloomfield’s politics and
               explores this dimension explicitly. Bloomfield’s avowed refusal to discuss politics
               or religion in his poetry sets up an immediate roadblock for such an analysis, but by
               framing his discussion of any political dimension of Bloomfield’s writing within the
               parameters of cultural expectations surrounding “natural” or “original” genius,
               Denney is able to complicate productively our understanding of Bloomfield’s own
               nuanced sense of his relationship to the pressing social questions of his day. </p>
               <p>Finally, Bridget Keegan focuses on some of the literary texts made available along
               with the letters in the Fulford and Pratt online edition, namely Bloomfield’s writing
               for children. These seemingly “simple” works also embed a degree of social and
               political complexity that the other contributors have similarly highlighted in their
               essays. For example, while the moralistic plot of <title level="m">Little Davy’s New
                  Hat</title> might seem yet another fairy tale of virtuous poverty rewarded,
               Bloomfield incorporates concrete details evoking the famines of the 1790s. And the
               charming letters of <title level="m">The Bird and Insects’ Post Office</title> evince
               the same ambivalence about violence toward animals that Haywood draws attention to in
                  <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>. Keegan aims to show that Bloomfield’s
               efforts in the genre of children’s literature are of a piece with his other
               writing—both published and personal. </p>
               <p>Far from providing the definitive reading of the letters and new materials made
               available in this edition, these essays attempt to further enrich the critical
               discussion of Bloomfield’s significance, modeling the variety of ways in which his
               work might be approached and the wealth of possible future readings that are possible
               through access to this larger body of his writing. Having, together with Simon White,
               edited and published the first modern collection of critical essays on Bloomfield in
               2006, we are delighted to see how much these letters have added to current knowledge
               of this important poet, and fully anticipate that the letters and the critical
               conversation they have begun to inspire here will lead to future work and inspire
               other scholars of the period to investigate Bloomfield’s rich <emph>oeuvre</emph>,
               one that is becoming increasingly central to the discussion of the Romantic cultural
               and social environment.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">The editors would like to acknowledge the generous assistance of Jill
               Havlat and Krystal Kirwan who helped with the final preparation of these essays for

               Graduate School at Creighton University, for a small grant to help in the production

               <p>The publication of Bloomfield’s collected letters gives us for the first time a
               chance to see him as a writer of intimate prose—prose in which he reveals his inner
               feelings and deepest desires, prose in which he comes to understand what he stands
               for, as a poet and as a man. Bloomfield’s letters, spanning the thirty and more years
               of his adult life, let us chart his progress from London shoemaker, living in an East
               End slum, through the best-selling poet of the early 1800s, to the impoverished
               villager living in obscure retirement. But they also show the development of a mind
               full of penetrating observation of himself, his acquaintances, and the world around
               him, and the emergence of a character endowed with generous humor, quiet
               determination, and exceptional sensitivity. These qualities made Bloomfield a
               wonderful correspondent: he never concealed himself from the person to whom he was
               writing, always offering them intimacy and thoughtfulness (resembling Keats in this)
               and always registering the nuances of events with a playful perceptiveness that
               escapes most. As a consequence, he was a fascinating social commentator (although
               social commentary is not the chief element of his letters), a perspicuous critic of
               other poets, and a forthright maintainer of his beliefs about writing against the
               interference of patrons, well-meaning or brow-beating. </p>
               <p> Many themes emerge from the letters: I shall concentrate in what follows on
               illustrating those which most sharply change our understanding of the writer, of his
               times, and of the business of being a laboring-class poet. </p>
               <p>First, then, the letters reveal with a new vividness what remains obscure in
               Bloomfield’s verse: that he was not a farmhand living in one of Britain’s thousands
               of villages. Despite his self-characterization in his poems as “Giles” the “farmer’s
               boy,” Bloomfield was, when he wrote, a Londoner working in one of the capital’s
               hundreds of cramped workshops. He was, in fact, a member of the wave after wave of
               immigrants that, in the late eighteenth century, flowed from the country to work in
               London’s burgeoning trades and industries, exchanging a boyhood spent herding animals
               and tending crops for an adolescence manufacturing items for the expanding consumer
                  market.<note resp="editors" place="foot">On this immigration,
                  see Hitchcock. </note> The change in circumstances this move produced is revealed
               by his first surviving letter of 1788, in which he invites a Suffolk friend to visit
               him: <quote>[W]hen you are at my lodging you must expect such treatment as is in my
                  power to give, and when we are out you must have no objection to dine at a decent
                  Cook-shop, where there is good choice, and if you dont like porter we can get good
                  ale, in short, London is like other great places, allmost any thing may be had for
                  money and when we are out, whatever the expence may be for living or for seeing
                  the public buildings, &amp;c, my scheme is, that each bear his own charges, you
                  know how George and others of our trade live, but George have the honour of living
                  in a street, but I cannot Get into a street from my lodgings without going through
                  some such crook of a hole as between your near-barn and the hay-house, but take
                  notice you are not to lodge in such a place as this, you have boath had the
                  small-pox and I think I remember that your sister Judith have had it too, here is
                  a letter enclosed from my sister to Judith and I hope to see you all soon, I hope
                  it will not be thought disrespectful for me to mention only you and your brother,
                  the reason is, I could not procure a suitable accomodation for any woman whatever,
                  a single man have no chance to do it half so well as my sister have, if you all
                  come (as I hope you will) you and your brother must lodge near me, and the street
                  where your sister will live, lead into Berkley Square, just by where my sister
                  live, and we are about three miles apart, so you will have a good chance to see
                  the town in going backwards and forwards, I shall be allways with you and we must
                  be very particular and not be out late of night, nor frequent any low lived
                  places, and as long as we do so, there is no danger to be feard, if you consider
                  the whole expense I belive it will be found a cheap way of seeing London. (letter
                  1, 11 April 1788)</quote> Bloomfield’s description reminds us of Blake’s “London,”
               or Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Prelude</title> description of “Private courts, /
               Gloomy as coffins, and unsightly lanes / Thrilled by some female vendor’s scream,
               belike / The very shrillest of all London cries” (1805, 7: 196-9). East End poverty,
               cramped living conditions, endemic disease, “low lived places”: Bloomfield was
               writing from experience as one of the new class of “mechanics” about which Wordsworth
               spoke in his preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, one of the nascent
               proletariat, in Marxist terms. It was this class that Wordsworth diagnosed as having
               acquired debased cravings for stimulation as a means of escape from their repetitive
               labor and that Marxists saw as being dosed with the opiates of popular religion and
               mass culture. Yet Bloomfield belies the Wordsworthian and the Marxist analysis: he
               suggests that, for first-generation migrants from country to city, it was not novel
               forms of urban entertainment, but the recollection and celebration of village
               community and customs, that was the goal. This is shown by a letter which he wrote in
               1806 about his first encounter with Italian opera: <quote>
                     <ab>The Scenery is truly
                     delightfull. The dancing wonderfull, and the whole, setting probability and
                     nature (allmost) out of the question, is a high treat, Yet I think more like
                     Mince-pie and made-dishes than substancial food. I am too great a novice in
                     Music to judge, I could only be surprize’d and astonished. I sat <del rend="strikethrough">alone</del>, in the
                     Pit, totally unknowing and unknown. Some Gentlemen behind me were extolling the
                     singular beauty of a Lady of easy Virtue who sat a few seats above us, and I
                     excercised my judgment too, (for when you <del rend="strikethrough">gave</del> sent me the ticket no
                     restriction was laid as to which way I should look,) and have to tell you that
                     of any <emph>essentials</emph> of beauty she had not a spark, not an atom! so
                     much for difference of opinion. I do not believe that men agree in this any
                     more than in their palates at Table, or their notions of what is beautifull in
                     a landscape.</ab>
                     <lb/>
                     <ab>I cannot help observing the great difference between an illdresst and a
                     well-dresst mob, and I must indeed be unfeeling and ungenerous not to
                     acknowledge it. In our National Theatres I have often sided so far with the
                     Patricians as to wish the Plebeans at the Devel, not because they were such,
                     (that I leave to those who are weak enough, that is, proud enough,) but merely
                     because they would not be quiet.</ab>
                     <lb/>
                     <ab>I observed, according to the best of my calculation, that the petticoats of
                     the women were about ten inches longer than those of the men, one of <del rend="strikethrough">them</del> the
                     former in particular I should have been glad to have accommodated with the loan
                     of a pair of pantaloons which I had left at home, and yet it is more than a
                     hundred to one if they had pleased her;—I do not wonder in the least that
                     Gentlemen, and ladies too, should frequent a place where they can hear the
                     finest Music, and see the most surprizing agility and grace, but I am now
                     convinced, <del rend="strikethrough">too</del> that the former have an additional incentive; the exhibition of
                     female beauty in a manner, and in a way which no other place in England will
                     warrant, and by my Soul, I think this is as <emph>natural</emph> a feeling as
                     any one there excited, “and further this deponent saith not.”</ab>
                     <lb/>
                     <ab>I have had the pleasure of witnessing the best Scenery and Dancing, and the
                     worst Lightning, in England. I saw Narcissus drown himself, (and, by the buy
                     that same Narcissus was worth going three miles to see,) I saw a very jolly and
                     delectable looking Venus, and a number of other young things whose motions
                     indicated that they felt the want of wings and were very angry indeed because
                     they had them not. They plagued poor little Cupid in a most barbarous manner,
                     because he fell asleep after whetting his arrows, on what?—on a
                     Grindstone!</ab>
                     <lb/>
                     <ab>Upon the whole I frankly own that I think I should have relish’d this show
                     much more if it had not happen’d that I had seen the preceeding, week the

               </p>
               <p>Bloomfield’s village—whether the village encountered in the opera-house or that of
               his own writing—is not the agricultural world seen by a laborer who works in it: it
               is, rather, a new country—the country seen from exile by an urbanite who has
               nostalgic desires to reconstitute, in memory and on paper, the rural community he
               associates with childhood. It is family and village togetherness, imagined as
               innocent by comparison with the experienced world of urban sophistication, that
               Bloomfield seeks—as Wordsworth himself did. This suggests that it was not, as
               Wordsworth thought, urban life and labor that destroyed respect for the values and
               taste of the older, rural world. Rather, urban exile from the country produced an
               intense idealization of the rural just as Wordsworth’s continental exile did. Exile,
               rather than city life per se, stimulated the major Romantic themes of idealization of
               the rural and fear for its loss. For Bloomfield, as for Wordsworth, it was the
               recollection of rural society and morality that he had, in practice, left behind that
               gave him a standard against which to judge the novel culture available in London’s
               metropolitan and cosmopolitan milieu. </p>
               <p>But he had not left it completely behind: in the early 1800s, the letters show, the
               urban and rural poor were not discrete, mutually unknowing populations. Bloomfield’s
               letters reveal the constant interchange between city and country-dwellers:
               Bloomfield’s family was typical in having some siblings who worked in the city while
               others remained in the home village—typical too in the frequent interchange between
               them. Letters carried news, invitations, and banknotes; parcels carried pheasants,
               leather-samples, and cheese. The foodstuffs traveled in both directions, Bloomfield
               taking advantage of his position in Europe’s largest commercial center to send to
               Suffolk better rural produce than could be found locally: “I send my Mother a piece
               of cheese such as she could not get at Honington if she had money” he wrote on 30
               November 1801 (letter 70), enclosing a Leicester cheese far superior to that of
               Suffolk (the best milk being sent out of Suffolk to supply London’s market).<note resp="editors" place="foot">See the passage in <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>, “Spring” 231-68.</note>
               </p>
               <p>People went back and forth too: Bloomfield returned to Suffolk to visit; his
               brothers, drawn to London’s commercial magnet, came to make their fortunes from music
               and from inventions, themselves returning. The laboring-classes, on the evidence of
               Bloomfield’s family, were simply not rigidly divided between shrinking rural and
               expanding urban populations: it was normal for families from the home counties to
               spend some of their lives in London, some back in the country, as did his brother
               George who grew up in Honington, worked as a shoemaker in London, and moved back to
               Suffolk, or his brother Nat, who moved from Suffolk to London, or Isaac, who lived in
               Suffolk but came to London to sell his musical settings of Robert’s poems, or Robert
               himself, who moved out of London to a Bedfordshire village in 1811. His sister Bet,
               meanwhile, emigrated to America. The Bloomfield family is revealed in Robert’s
               letters as being on the move to a degree that would have been extraordinary fifty
               years earlier, but nevertheless strenuously keeping in touch using the literacy with
               which their mother, a village schooldame, had endowed them. The causes of their
               peripatetic life illustrate the changes in rural society brought about by the
               combination of increased population, the development of “improved” capitalist
               agriculture, economic recessions, and a more centralized market economy. Brothers
               George and Isaac both had many children and found it impossible to provide for them
               from the proceeds of shoemaking. London, and the opportunity of selling poems and
               tunes there, offered the prospect of a way out of poverty.</p>
               <p>Bloomfield’s letters show<hi/>his most abiding concern to have been the creation
               and preservation, in a more and more hostile social and political climate, of village
               and family rootedness. While he still enjoyed royalties from his poems, he used this
               income to try to recreate rural community from the distance of London. Thus he sent
               his London-reared daughter Hannah to Suffolk to give her experience of village life.
               Hannah was charged with retrieving the very rocks and stones Bloomfield remembered by
               their local names, so strong was his desire to have a bit of his boyhood about him:

               Bloomfield was excited when she witnessed the harvest-home festival that was
               customary in the area and which he had celebrated in his poem “The Horkey,” even
               preserving Suffolk dialect in an effort “to tell the rising race of mankind” of the
               customs “going fast out of use”<note resp="editors" place="foot">From the “Advertisement” to “The Horkey. A Provincial Ballad” in <title level="m">Wild Flowers</title> 31-32.</note> that, in his boyhood, ritualized the

                  </quote> Bloomfield’s letter on the subject is full of quiet satisfaction at
               rural life experienced vicariously at the consequent reunion of his family: <quote>My
                  eldest Daughter has just return’d from an eight weeks residence in Suffolk at the

                  present at the “Horkey” and with many of the persons who figured there thirty
                  years ago when I was 13 years old. There is a fund of gossip cut out for me during
                  the winter coming. She return’d on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, the next day you
                  may recollect is sacred to our <emph>Leather Saint,</emph> and is besides her
                  birthday. It was a high holiday in London as a Jubilee, and to crown it all my
                  brother’s family postponed on her account the celebration of a Christning. Thus,
                  by having a family meeting we beat all the Doctors for we killd more than two
                  birds with one stone. (letter 245, 31 October 1809)</quote> Here rural, trade, and
               family celebrations coincide: in Honington Hannah participates in the horkey; in
               London Robert celebrates St. Crispin’s day with other cordwainers; also in London
               brother Nat’s family bring the Bloomfields together for a party. The reality behind
               such rural poems as “The Horkey,” is a family straddling city and country and
               occupying the social habitus of each.</p>
               <p> It was a brief moment. Dispersed across town and village, the Bloomfields were
               rarely able to, in his words, “kill more than two birds with one stone.” The letters
               show Bloomfield instead, like Wordsworth, attempting to repossess his rural childhood
               home. He did this by using the wealth poetry brought him to buy the cottage his
               mother had rented, letting his relatives live there. This scheme made little economic
               sense: what drove Bloomfield was the emotional pull of his home village and his need
               for a family togetherness he had lost when sent away to London as a youth. This need
               was not met: after his mother’s death Bloomfield found, predictably, that the house
               made him an absentee landlord, embroiled in legal disputes with once-friendly
               neighbors over rights to the garden and charged with ever-mounting repair bills while
               his resident relatives seemed ungrateful or begged for more financial help.
               Eventually, as relations soured under the pressure of the financial strain Bloomfield
               suffered after his booksellers’ bankruptcy, he felt reluctant to revisit the place:
               he could no longer sustain its image as a symbol of boyhood and familial community;
               it now spoke of his relatives’ expectation that he, having made money, would provide
               for them, of his own sadness that they were now his clients rather than his peers,
               and of his disappointment that he could no longer afford to maintain it.</p>
               <p> If Bloomfield could not return to Honington, he could get as near as was possible
               given the necessity of being in London to attend to his publications. Almost the
               first thing he did when the poetry began to sell was to quit the crowded East End,
               retire from shoemaking, and become one of a social class that mushroomed in this
               period—a suburbanite. The suburbs as we know them today were a phenomenon of the
               early nineteenth century, producing a tamed and domesticated simulacrum of the
               remembered countryside, leisure-time idylls of green in miniature garden-plots that
               were both retired and accessible from the city, where the suburbanites worked. The
               outlook of the growing class of people who lived like this—the clerks who, like
               Charles Lamb and Dickens’s Wemmick, worked in the increasing number of counting
               houses, offices, and chambers of the imperial and governmental city—found expression
               in a new kind of verse, ornamental and decorative, that eschewed the full-blown
               classicism of the epic and the large-scale loco-description of the georgic (both
               styles associated with the landowning gentry and aristocracy). The suburban was
               pretty, sentimental, bejeweled, representing the democratization of taste in a class
               that read magazines and novels rather than Latin and Greek poetry.</p>
               <p> Bloomfield was not Keats or Leigh Hunt, two poets whose early writing, Nicholas Roe
                  shows,<note resp="editors" place="foot">In his <title level="m">John Keats and the Culture of Dissent</title> 214-17.</note> was criticized as
               the suburban work of writers who had never known the real countryside. He avoided
               excessive ornamentation, garden settings, and tricked-out diction—all facets of Leigh
               Hunt’s verse that aroused the ire of traditionalist critics. Nevertheless, his
               letters reveal that he set out to choose a home that relocated the idealized virtues
               and pleasures of the country in miniature at the edge of the city. His cottage next
               to the Shepherd and Shepherdess Inn on the City Road, was situated at commercial
               London’s margin, where workhouses and almshouses ran out into smallholdings, gardens,
               and fields. Bloomfield cultivated the garden there, and ensured his family learnt to
               do so too, as a letter from his daughter Mary to her older sister reveals: “the first
               thing I have to tell you,” she wrote, “is of the garden, our lobernam will not blow
               so much as we thought it would, we have got two mugs full of butterflowers, and we
               have some beans coming up, this is holiday work and many people are crowding by our
               gate” (letter 163, 3 June 1805). She returned to the subject a week later, “You
               wanted to know about the garden. I first tell you the beans are growing very high, a
               good deal of your sweet Williams is dead, and your nut tree is very well, we are
               going to have a crop of scarlet beans over the grass plat, my father’s thistle will
               not thrive; Charlesis Cherry tree grows very well, shot<note resp="editors" place="foot">The family nickname for Bloomfield’s youngest
                  daughter Charlotte.</note> has got a nut tree and some butter flowers” (letter
               166, 10 June 1805).</p>
               <p> Bloomfield’s position on the margin gave him a double knowledge that neither East
               Enders nor Suffolk villagers possessed—a double knowledge that helped make his poetry
               unique. He used this double knowledge not just to drive his yearning to articulate a
               rural world he knew to be fragile, but also to demand realism about country and city.
               It allowed him to achieve a conscious recollection of country customs in plain,
               rustic language, before these customs were submerged by urban fashions and capitalist
               agriculture. In a letter of 2 September 1802, for instance, he criticized affected
               diction and uncolloquial word order in poetry (much like Wordsworth in the Preface to
                  <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>), extending his argument to cover
               pictorial representations of the rustic: <quote>Something of this kind may be traced
                  in some pictures which I have occasionally seen, which indeed relates more to the
                  foregoing wrong adaptation of words, than to compound epithets—A scene extremely
                  rustic, the Death of the Fox in a Cottage-yard would you there expect to see up
                  against the wall what in London are called Bird-bottles for the sparrows to build
                  in? Country people know sparrows too well; the same picture has the error of
                  chimney pots to the cottage, which I never saw in reality; these are London and
                  Country ideas mixed. (letter 94, 2 September 1802)</quote> Had Bloomfield not, as
               a youth, read the magazines available in the shoemakers’ workshop (but unlikely to
               have come his way on a Suffolk farm) he would not have learnt to compose verse at
               all. He was, in fact, in the rare position of being able to benefit from both city
               and country: his rural tales benefited from his knowledge of contemporary taste as
               set out in town-based periodicals as well as from the authenticity that stemmed from
               his early upbringing on the land.</p>
               <p> Bloomfield’s suburban cottage was, nonetheless, a retreat from the city proper. In
               moving to London’s fringe, he was retiring from business—from the trade of shoemaking
               and from the incessant visitors who, keen to view the phenomenon of a laboring-class
               poet, had troubled him in his cheap lodgings. From the edge of London, he could
               supervise his works through the press and call on his literary acquaintances, without
               becoming a celebrity and having to appear on demand for any gentleman who wished to
               satisfy his curiosity and advise him what to read. The suburbs for Bloomfield—and
               here he was proleptic of the phenomenon Dickens fictionalized in Wemmick—were a daily
               retreat from an urban intercourse from which he could not altogether withdraw, an
               intercourse he found inimical not just for its crowdedness (although certainly for
               that) but also for the demeaning of human relationships by the pressures of
               market-driven work-discipline. Matters came to a head when the Duke of Grafton, his
               Suffolk patron, found him a job in the busy Seal Office, sealing legal contracts and
               charters (in a form of tax collection). Bloomfield’s letter on the subject (to his
               brother George, 29 February 1803)—a cry of desperation—reads as if written by the
               narrator of Blake’s “London” imprisoned by “each chartered street,” for it highlights
               the mental toll taken by the binding of self to bureaucratic and commercial
               institutions—the lack of privacy and self-command, the need to prepare a public face,
               the slavery to the new discipline of clock-time and office-hours, the reduction of
               human interaction to overworked clerk and demanding client: <quote>On Friday, the day
                  after the Holidays, I expected a busy day at the Seal Office; and so I found it
                  with a vengeance. I had eat no breakfast, and the Mob of Lawyers made me perfectly
                  savage: at One o’clock we shut the Office, but shut in between 40 and 50 people,
                  and did not get through the Work for 3 quarters of an hour after one. I then grew
                  faint, and knew if I walkd home to the City Road that my Wind and indigestion
                  would get the upper hand of my Stomach, and should eat no dinner; so I put into
                  the Cook’s in Salsbury Court and eat heartily. by this time there was no time to
                  go home and then to Temple Bar again by 4; so I sulkd away the time in St George’s
                  Fields, and then took another 3 hours’ Mobbing at the Office, having seald during
                  the day nearly 1100 Writs! by far the busiest day (if Mr A<note resp="editors" place="foot">Mr. Allen, Bloomfield’s boss at the Seal

                  Returnd to my sick house, tired and insufferably disgusted. At home I found a

                  there by some fool or other that “Bloomfield the poet has been recently appointed
                  to a <emph>handsome</emph> situation in the Seal Office in the Temple, thus he has

               celebrity and having his private feelings and actions tattled about in the London and
               Suffolk newspapers and his name used by quack doctors in their advertisements. </p>
               <p> Beyond the suburbs lay solace in the hills. When depressed by the city’s demands,
               Bloomfield took to making solitary walking tours, refreshing himself with a leisured
               consumption of nature in which he was, for a few days, his own master, his time and
               space his own. These tours were a reaction against his lack of a stable place in
               which independence, self-respect, and rural community could be sustained, when even
               the suburban retreat on the City Road became prey to the pressure of business and
               when his boyhood home in Honington seemed polluted by disputes with family and
               patron. So Bloomfield went to Dover and to Dorking, recording his trips in intimate
               and informal letters that bear comparison with Coleridge’s descriptions of his 1802
               walking tour in the Lakes and with Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals. They represent,
               that is to say, a new kind of tour-journalism reflecting a new social practice: the
               pedestrian tour was the creation of a class of writers (Romantics, as they were later
               called) who, dissociating themselves from gentleman and women tourists for reasons of
               poverty and politics, eschewed the horse and carriage and asserted their liberty and
               independence as solitary wanderers in nature.<note resp="editors" place="foot">On the pedestrian tour and its social and political valency,
                  see Jarvis.</note> Like Wordsworth, Bloomfield was an urbanite visiting
               countryside places he felt emotionally connected to by virtue of his rural upbringing
               but in which he had no present-day social or economic place. Like Coleridge, he was
               self-conscious of this anomalous status and was ready to record the funny side of
               being out of place wherever he visited. As such he was an unwitting pioneer of a
               practice of nature recreation and nature writing that became, and remains, one of the
               main pursuits of Britain’s suburban masses—a practice of countryside rambling that
               still has its dedicated organizations and magazines. The description he made of his
               Surrey tour in 1803, for instance, has the features we have come to see as familiar
               to the genre—unexpected adventures, hill country, romantic views, and assertions
               about nature’s restorative powers: <quote>
                     <ab>Having been harrassd by too much
                     thinking and too many trivial engagements, and an employment that I shall never
                     like, I determined that I would respire one mouthfull of real country air if
                     possible and I know at the same time that pollution of smoke reaches ten miles
                     round the Metropolis. I had heard much of Leithe Hills and of Box Hill in the
                     neighbourhood of Dorking. This was the time to see them. I started from the
                     Spread Eagle, GraceChurch Stt. At 3 in the afternoon of Monday and soon rode
                     away from the gay Bonnets and red faces that made a perfect current towards
                     Greenwich. The road is like all others within ten miles of town, much too
                     spruce and too full of inhabitants for my fancy. Epsom is a pretty little town
                     and the country round it open and flat; but 3 or four miles beyond it assumes a
                     quite different aspect, becoming more hilly than I had ever before seen.
                     Remember that I am no Welshman, therefore to me these Hills are Cader Idris’s
                     and Snowdens.—</ab>

                     of poetry has many stages. I supt and insured a lodging for two nights at the 3
                     Tons where the Coach put up, and on Tuesday morning set off with a
                     determination to reach Leith Hill; but though I had a good map of the County in
                     my pocket I took the wrong rout, and as the place of my destination was about 6
                     miles and my attention and inclination drawn to other and nearer objects I made
                     for the top of a Hill which is planted with about 8 or ten Fir Trees which are
                     very conspicuous at a great distance; this Hill the inhabitants denominate with
                     no small share of pride “Dorking’s Glory.” It affords certainly a most
                     delightfull view on every side; here I could discover that had I kept on nearly

               to be Bloomfield’s dinner increasingly in later years. After <title level="m">Wild
                  Flowers </title>(1806) his output declined and sales of his publications tailed
               off. In 1812 his booksellers went bankrupt, depriving him of his income. Much money
               went to supporting relatives and as donations made by his wife to the prophetess
               Joanna Southcott. In 1811 he moved from the City Road to the Bedfordshire village of
               Shefford, seeking to reduce his expenses and to rediscover the placedness in village
               life that he recalled in his Suffolk youth—a placedness impossible for him to
               reconstitute in Suffolk because that place had become vitiated by disputes. Some of
               his early letters from Shefford revel in finding it there instead. In July 1814, for
               instance, he sent his daughter Hannah (2-3 July 1814) a description of the village
               celebration of Napoleon’s defeat that is a comic masterpiece, Dickensian in its

                  </quote> Here Bloomfield’s evocation plays
               upon the shared knowledge he and Hannah, his daughter and correspondent, have of the
               people involved. If there is an occasional touch of sentimentality, this is because
               Bloomfield has a lot invested in his own and his family’s incorporation in the rural
               community. As the comparisons with London’s Vauxhall Gardens suggest, metropolitan
               entertainment remains a reference point: the country is engaged with and judged
               against the city. The country festival—the social expression of that community—and
               his description—its literary realization—dramatize the incorporation of incomers from
               London: they show the Bloomfields are at home, accepted in the village where the
               traditions of rural Englishness still flourish. Quietly in play in the letter is a
               self-consciousness about national identity: to be English, Bloomfield suggests, is to
               appreciate and participate in such bucolic communal pleasures. Hogarth’s “March of
               the Guards to Finchley,” Hone’s <title level="m">Every Day Book</title>, and
               Cobbett’s <title level="m">Rural Rides</title> present a similar comic vision of
               national character, in which ale-drinking figures loom large. As a small farmer, Cobbett
               would organize traditional rural sports on the village green, seeking to renew
               traditional English customs in which all rural classes participated, as a

               <p>Things changed after 1815. The depressions experienced nationwide by a newly
               centralized economy left Bloomfield and his family dependent on charity and poor
               relief, as they did so many others. Their era of mobility ended by poverty, Shefford
               became a place that Bloomfield often could not afford to leave: he stayed there
               isolated by ill-health and depression. Likewise his brother George became trapped in
               Suffolk, as is revealed in a late autobiographical letter sent by George some years
               after Robert died (to W. Weston, circa 1830). George’s response to his pauperdom is
               Uriah Heepish humility towards the gentlemen who gave him charity. His anger at the
               poverty he movingly describes is displaced instead onto other would-be laboring-class
               writers who come to visit him: <quote>I actualy became a corrispondant of Sir C

                     Edward Bailey (Ned) Preston was a “Calligraphist” based in Barnwell, Cambridge,
                     whose work also took him to other places including Thetford. According to an
                     account of his life given to John Clare, following his time in the navy he had
                     lived “seven years” as a “planter” in the West Indies, before “losing all I
                     possesed [sic] in the tremendous hurricane of 1812.” A poet himself, Preston
                     wrote to and visited poets, including Bloomfield. Clare described him thus: “he
                     made me believe that he was a very great Poet and that he knew all the world
                     and that almost all the world knew him he had a vast quantity of M.S.S. he said
                     by him but had not published much at present . . .— he was for ever quoting
                     beautys from his own poetry and he knew all the living poets in England and
                     scotland as familiar as his own tongue—he was a living hoax—he had made two or
                     three visits to Bloomfield and talkd of him as familiar as if he had been his
                     neighbour half a life time he calld him ‘brother bob’” (123). </note> &amp;c

               failure of the traditional rural community, its local paternalism shrunk to an empty
               gesture. They are also symptoms of changed times, as was Robert’s own correspondence
               with the husband of his friend and admirer, the gentlewoman Mary Lloyd Baker with
               whom he had toured the Wye valley in 1807. Mary having died in 1812, Lloyd Baker
               remarried and spent a fortune on building a new country seat for himself. He
               reentered Bloomfield’s life in 1821, sending a banknote to a poet now impoverished by
               his bookseller’s bankruptcy, but also in order to police him ideologically so as to
               ensure he did not agitate his fellow poor villagers: <quote>

                        (1736-1812) was, by 1800, already a veteran campaigner for parliamentary
                        reform. Initially radicalized by the establishment efforts to exclude
                        newly-elected John Wilkes from parliament, Horne Tooke became an organizer
                        of societies dedicated to widening suffrage—including the Society for
                        Constitutional Information. He was arrested and charged with treason in 1794
                        when, in alliance with the London Corresponding Society, he attempted to
                        organize a radical convention. Acquitted, despite the bias of the judge, he
                        continued to argue for parliamentary reform, though in more moderate form.
                        Thomas Hardy (1752-1832), like Bloomfield a London shoemaker, was a
                        campaigner for parliamentary reform and the extension of the franchise. As
                        an organizer of the London Corresponding Society he, like Horne Tooke, was
                        tried for treason in 1794. Although acquitted, he lost his wife and unborn
                        child—both died in childbirth brought on prematurely by the stress of
                        fleeing from a pro-government mob. After his release from custody, Hardy
                        gave up politics and carried on his trade in Covent Garden.</note>—Yea, more

               <p> Letters of the Lloyd Baker kind are grim evidence of the ideological strife of
               post-war Britain: they place in stark illumination the repression by which the ruling
               classes maintained their grip on power, all the while fearing revolution. Bloomfield
               remembered the disinterested patronage of the old Duke of Grafton, Prime Minister in
               an earlier era, who had supported him as a fellow Suffolk man without ever expecting
               political or religious conformity to his views, or even public praise of his
               beneficence. He knew he was living through a reactionary era, in which the classes
               were polarized, and his public response was to create, in his final collection of
               poems <title level="m">May Day with the Muses</title> (1822), an ideal scenario in
               which, to celebrate the traditional May Day festivities, a squire invites the
               villagers to recite poems about village life. The squire thus renews old customs and
               patronizes, in the best sense, rustics who are able to voice their rural experience
               as verse. Clearly, this is wish-fulfillment on Bloomfield’s part: not only does he
               imagine that to be a rural poet is to be a cherished villager and vice versa, but
               also that poetry is a face-to-face oral activity of a united community. The
               benevolent squire, moreover, respects tradition and exacts no political toll for his
               benevolence, which he in fact regards as his duty. Meanwhile, the individual poems
               that the villagers recite also tell of a traditional community in which authority is
               vested in a single figure who can therefore be addressed, appealed to, and even,
               potentially, rebuked and chastised face to face. In the earlier verse-tale “The
               Broken Crutch,” Bloomfield had contemplated the possibility of just such a rebuke,
               should the squire turn out to be abusing the innocence of a village girl. In the
               event, the squire’s intentions are pure: he marries her, and her uncle does not need
               to beat him. The ideal village, for Bloomfield, is self-policing: the squire respects
               his tenants and they him. This was an old-fashioned and forlorn hope, perhaps, in
               face of the capitalization of farming, but it was one to which the conservative
               Wordsworth, Southey, and Gilpin, also subscribed as did the radical Cobbett—a
               Romantic rural paternalism.</p>
               <p>Bloomfield’s only public political discourse was his poetry. His claim to Lloyd Baker
               that he had kept a vow to make no declarations of opinion was true. Not a political
               thinker, he refused to become involved in radical writing and publishing, not
               necessarily through lack of sympathy but because radicals’ forthright and frank
               avowals seemed to him too exclusive of doubt, difference, and ambiguity, too easily
               certain and too egotistic. Like Clare in “To a Fallen Elm,” he resented radical
               campaigners’ assumption that because they were of his class they necessarily spoke
               for him, and he suspected their motives might include self-promotion. Despite,
               therefore, his private conversations with Horne Tooke and Hardy, men tried for
               treason for their radical campaigning, he was sharply critical of Thomas Paine when
               Paine’s disciple and bookseller, Thomas Clio Rickman, presumed, in an over-familiar
               way, that he would be keen to have him sell his poems: <quote>All your writings are
                  so confoundedly violent, that I who have four years past made a determination to
                  be nutral in Politicks and Religion, have much ado to convince myself that you
                  ought to expect much assistance from such a cowardly fellow. And it is because I
                  differ in both the above particulars from the Author you first put into my hands,
                  that I do not feel myself acting a consistant part in spreading his opinions. Mr
                  P[aine] in my estimation is the vainest of all authors. My circle of friends have
                  long ago regreted that his great mind should decend so as to disgust his readers
                  by boasting of himself. Perhaps when he laments the falling off of America from
                  her purity of principle he is only lamenting the utterly unavoidable effects of a
                  growing population there, or elsewhere, I believe that if perfect Republicanism be
                  not a dream, its durability is. I am thus commiting myself to you compleatly; but
                  it is to show you that I cannot propagate doctrines which I do not profess either
                  to believe or to understand. <emph>I must and will</emph> be as

                  your writings and your manners. You will therefore not be offended or surprized

               <p>The abiding theme of Bloomfield’s correspondence is the control of his own words—the
               very issue that most plagued his admirer John Clare. Writing freed him from wage
               labor for sixteen hours per day as a shoemaker. In terms of time, life habits, and
               money it gave him a precarious independence as an agent on a newly capitalized
               popular publishing market. It also subjected him to the pressures of the market while
               at the same time he was not free from the expectations of the patrons who had helped
               get <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> published. His most hands-on patron was
               the Suffolk gentleman Capel Lofft, who expected, as the price for the advice and
               literary connections he made available to Bloomfield, to have his own views published
               in the form of prefaces and notes to the poems. These views embarrassed Bloomfield:
               Lofft included irrelevant and vain justifications of his own political conduct in the
               Preface to <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> and added ridiculously fulsome
               and insipid commentary in footnotes to <title level="m">Rural Tales. </title>The
               booksellers responded to public demand and sought the removal of these notes in the
               second edition; Lofft, insulted, insisted they remain. Bloomfield, caught between
               patron and market, tried in letter after letter to negotiate with both, while
               maintaining his own dignity. Ultimately, to his own anguish, he failed: Lofft chose
               to sulk, regarding himself as betrayed, and Bloomfield lost his first supporter,
               despite a willingness to compromise to a degree. But he would neither simply
               acquiesce to Lofft’s will nor toady to him: he retained his independence but at a
               cost that showed him forcefully that his writing was the subject of competition by
               others. Bloomfield was, his letters reveal, caught in what we now know was a
               transitional stage from the eighteenth-century norm of publishing under patronage,
               with subscribers funding the work, to the nineteenth-century convention of selling
               via publishers to a mass market. Caught between patrons’ and booksellers’ demands, he
               struggled to retain possession of his own writerly self, to avoid becoming alienated
               from his own dearest words. Even well-meaning patrons pressured him, assuming it
               their prerogative to intervene on his behalf (as they thought) without first asking
               him. Thus the wealthy patron Lord Buchan, whose salon Bloomfield had visited in 1802,
               sent in 1806 to Bloomfield’s publishers, a private letter Bloomfield had written to
               him after the visit, in which Bloomfield confesses his shyness in polite company and
               apologizes for breaking down into tears. Buchan requested the publishers to include
               it in <title level="m">Wild Flowers</title> along with Buchan’s own description of
               the occasion, so as to promote the sale. The private letter reveals Bloomfield’s
               insecurity about appearing before his social superiors: <quote>It may look strange
                  that one, who has been repeatedly honoured with your lordship’s conversation,
                  should have anything left to express by writing: But the sudden transition from
                  shade to sunshine, from obscurity to publicity, which have fallen to my lot, has
                  sometimes proved almost painful, and often perplexing to a great degree.
                  Condescension from superiors ought at least to inspire confidence sufficient to
                  meet their approbation in all its shapes and modifications; and, when it does not,
                  I am apt to suspect, that it deserves no such plausible name as modesty. It is a
                  dastardly child, the offspring of ignorance and fear. I feel and know, that in my
                  composition there is not an atom of what is called wit. My replies are the slow
                  suggestions of contemplation, and my “good things” mostly come half an hour too
                  late. I find this to be true in conversation with my equals, where restraint can
                  have no force. There is however, another enemy (though in some cases my dearest
                  friend) whose power is resistless, and whose visits are perpetually made known by
                  a rising of the stomack, and a redundance of water in the eyes. Subjects of
                  interest to the feelings are frequent in parties, such as I have lately had the
                  honour to join; when, independent of the subject being often above my reach, I
                  find this weakness, (if it be a weakness) stand in my way, and absolutely obstruct
                  any remark or reply whatever. (letter 75, 19 January 1802)</quote> When Bloomfield
               heard from the publishers of Buchan’s request to publish their private
               correspondence, he politely insisted on retaining control of his own words and on
               succeeding on his own merits, without the cachet provided by publishing letters of
               recommendation from the socially powerful. He would not risk appearing to be a
               creature of a Lord who had solicited for favor—an honorable decision which it
               required considerable temerity, considering the disparity in rank between Buchan and
               himself, to make: <quote>To adopt your plan, great and honourable as it is, would
                  involve consequences that I cannot explain. One of the most difficult tasks that
                  arises from my extraordinary situation, for such perhaps with great truth I may
                  call it, is so to act as not to wound the feelings of my good and voluntary
                  friends, nor to violate my own. The Letter I long ago addrest to your Lordship is
                  such perhaps as I ought not to be ashamed of, and such that no person would
                  believe me did I pretend to it. But though I feel the intended honour, I feel too,
                  other sensations that many perhaps could suppress: I feel that it would be a
                  violation of my notions of delicacy to print it now. My object has been to abide
                  by the most simple methods of acquiring reputation, the standing alone, as far as
                  my abilities go, and as far as it can be done in justice to my friends. Thus it

               almost impossible for the laboring-class writer to sustain. But Bloomfield was
               adamant, reserving his contempt for his elder brother George, on whom he had once
               depended, when George would not stand up for him but instead toadied to Capel Lofft:

               frequent and friendly correspondence between the brothers lapsed for seventeen years.
               Bloomfield wrote again only when he knew he was gravely ill. He had not been able to
               preserve his family intact in face of the social pressures that authorship produced. </p>
               <p>He found compensation—for some years—in the friendship of a gentle family of an
               unusual kind. The Sharp family was a philanthropic one, the best known of whom was
               Granville, the anti-slavery campaigner. It was, however, through the younger
               generation, a network of sisters and wives, that Bloomfield entered the extended
               circle. The married sister, Mary Lloyd Baker, wrote to him admiringly of his poetry
               and soon he was invited to the family’s houses in Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, and
               Northamptonshire. There he was delighted to find admiring female company that made no
               demands upon him. The Sharp women<note resp="editors" place="foot">Bloomfield’s principal friend was Mary Lloyd Baker, née Sharp (1778-1812),
                  whom he met in the company of her cousin Catherine Sharp (1770-1843) at her aunt’s
                  (Elizabeth Prowse, née Sharp) of Wicken Park, Northamptonshire. Daughter of the
                  surgeon William Sharp and niece of Granville Sharp the abolitionist, Mary
                  introduced Bloomfield to her extended family, allowing him to make visits to the
                  houses of family members at South Mimms, Northamptonshire and Fulham as well as
                  her own house at Uley in Gloucestershire.</note> neither sought to ride on the
               back of his writing nor to make him perform for them. In their company he relaxed,
               flirting and joking at their country houses. And since the women were not heads of
               the households they did not concern themselves with money and social authority as
               gentlemen did. Bloomfield was able to feel valued as part of sisterly and feminine
               world based on nature-love. The women appreciated poetry; they sketched; they toured
               the Wye valley, taking Bloomfield with them. In accessing the rural world through
               them, Bloomfield experienced it differently: it was not the countryside he met on his
               solitary pedestrian tours, nor the Suffolk village world of work and customs that he
               hoped to rediscover in Shefford, but a feminized world of beauty disinterestedly
               appreciated and shared at leisure. Bloomfield flourished in it, and was freed to
               exercise his talent for flirtatious humour, as a letter of 22 June 1804 reveals:

                     <ab>The micrometer you will see is scratch’d into squares so minute that
                     each square form’d by the intersections is but the <emph>ten thousandth
                        part</emph> of an inch. I hope you will not feel any disappointment as to
                     its convenience or powers for I know that my manner of speaking of what pleases
                     me, is apt to make others feel a blank. Yet I think your own good sense and
                     your admirable perseverance will enable you to appreciate its merits, and thus
                     I have no doubt as to the pleasure you may derive from so pleasing an insight
                     into nature with so little trouble.—You have three ranges of objects as part of
                     your purchase, but if I might direct your attention I could point out others,
                     as for example—take your <emph>pride</emph> (which, by reason that you had no
                     microscope when I was with you I could never see at all) and place it
                     consciously in a good light:—but as such objects to the naked eye are so
                     disgusting I doubt this would give you but little pleasure if you should place
                     the glass so as to find it—secondly you may endeavour with the small spring
                     tweezers to place your <emph>affectation</emph> in the focus of the magnifier
                     by which means you will at once determine the power of the instrument, as you
                     will then have an object absolutely never seen before. It may be put to another
                     use still, whenever any man shall approach you with a view of sharing your
                     affection and your heart you may immediately put all the best of his virtues
                     into the insect-box and when you have magnified them to your liking give him
                     your hand.— </ab>
                     <lb/>
                     <ab>The kindness of yourself and your most affectionate Mother to me, has left on
                     my mind those impressions and feelings which virtue and goodness will and must
                     for ever inspire, I love you both. May your hearts never know sorrow and, and
                     &amp;c &amp;c I was going to flourish, but had better only beg that you will
                     both believe me to be your most sincere and humble servant. (letter

                  </quote> The many letters to the Sharp sisters may prompt us to a
               new perspective on Bloomfield in particular and laboring-class poets in general—a
               perspective showing that he and they flourished in a feminized literary and social
               milieu that was itself growing rapidly, as female readers valued nature-writing and
               as more and more female poets popularized a kind of poetry that was not associated
               with the kind favored by ruling-class men—neither with classical genres, nor
               political satire, nor the representation of patrons’ country estates. Bloomfield, as
               revealed for the first time by his correspondence, was not simply a “peasant poet”
               chiefly valuable for his portrait of labor and for his symbolic position as the voice
               of the laboring classes. He was a varied—and often comic—writer of intimate prose and
               verse whose articulations of the struggles he faced are valuable not simply as
               symptoms of the dilemmas faced by laboring-class writers, or as illustrations of the
               social world he inhabited, but also—and principally—as sensitive, honest, innovative,
               and successful negotiations of the consequences, for one in his marginal position on
               the edge of both, of the changing relationship between country and city, and masters
               and markets.</p>

               <p>Robert Bloomfield twice wrote works explicitly for a juvenile audience. <title level="m">The History of Little Davy’s New Hat</title> was first published in 1815
               and had gone through three separate editions by 1824. <title level="m">The Bird and
                  Insects’ Post-Office, </title>which he was writing with his son Charles at the
               time of his death, was published posthumously in Bloomfield’s <title level="m">Remains</title> (1824). To my knowledge, only Jonathan Lawson’s critical
               biography (1980) has given these works any attention and then only of the briefest
               sort. Tim Fulford and Lynda Pratt’s online edition of Bloomfield’s correspondence
               amply demonstrates the poet’s devotion to his family and especially his children, and
               a discussion of these neglected pieces might provide a useful critical complement to
               the picture the letters present of Bloomfield the father as much as Bloomfield the
               author. Bloomfield’s letters reveal the poet’s intense attachments to his family, and
               his concern for their wellbeing at every level—physical, moral, and intellectual.
               Remembering his own pursuit of knowledge under difficulties, Bloomfield consistently
               demonstrates his commitment to his children’s education, making it a recurrent theme
               in his personal and published writings. He mentions in the prefaces to each of his
               two works for children that his own mother was a schoolmistress, and his son and
               coauthor, Charles, became a teacher. Education was an important family legacy.</p>
               <p> A re-examination of the works for children thus contributes to the project of
               demonstrating how Bloomfield fully participates in his Romantic cultural moment.
               While differing in style and in audience, these two texts are also very much of a
               piece with Bloomfield’s other core moral and artistic concerns. Although celebrating
               Bloomfield’s children’s books could be seen as inviting the risk of once again
               relegating Bloomfield to the status of naïf—a writer capable only of simple works and
               observations because of his laboring-class background—if we understand them in
               relation to the rest of Bloomfield’s achievements they appear less anomalous and less
               simplistic. For instance, at a superficial level, the story of Little Davy might seem
               to express the same wishful charitable social circumstances represented in <title level="m">May Day for the Muses</title>—where Sir Ambrose Higham decides to accept
               poems and songs instead of rent. However, for a children’s story the circumstances
               described in <title level="m">Little Davy</title> are socially complex and confront
               crucial contemporary political and economic crises. Bloomfield himself is alert to
               potential accusations of oversimplification. He writes in the preface to third
               edition of <title level="m">Little Davy</title>: “Perhaps the characters are too
               good—too perfect—for what we unfortunately see in real life; but that their poverty
               is not beyond truth, I am certain” (ix). </p>
               <p>As with much of Bloomfield’s writing for adults, what at first seems simple upon
               closer examination reveals the author’s larger awareness of broader cultural
               traditions and complicated social issues. Both of Bloomfield’s children’s works are
               unafraid to contend with life’s harsher realities even as they perform the typical
               moral function of children’s literature and extol the virtues of charity and kindness
               to the poor and to animals. More importantly, even in these works, Bloomfield is
               always an artist. Form and style matter as much as the content or lessons the stories
               contain. As he writes in the <title level="m">Remains</title>: “I never get hold of a
               child’s book but I feel an inclination to see how the story is told, be it ever so
               simple. If I can judge by my girls, the minds of children are much interested by such
               as are well written” (2: 120). Bloomfield knew that pure didacticism was unlikely to
               win readers, especially those readers he cared most about.</p>
               <p> But Bloomfield also knew that he was trying his hand at what was, in the early
               nineteenth century, a relatively new genre in England. While folktales and fairytales
               (genres which Bloomfield also engaged) are timeless, large-scale publishing
               specifically for children had only really begun in the mid-eighteenth century with
               John Newbery, whom Peter Hunt credits with beginning “the serious
                  <emph>business</emph> of publishing for children” (34). According to Hunt,
               “Newbery’s significance lay in developing the children’s side of his publishing
               business to such an extent that this class of book could be seen as worthy of the
               kind of artistic and financial investment reserved for adult books” (34-5). By the
               Romantic period, this business had developed into a very healthy market, with
               contributions from some of the most important authors of the age, such as Mary
               Wollstonecraft and William Godwin in the early part of the period and Charles Lamb in
               the later. Some of the most important publishers, such as Joseph Johnson, carried on
               Newbery’s legacy, bringing out children’s works by Wollstonecraft, Anna Barbauld,
               Sarah Trimmer, and Maria Edgeworth (Hunt 55).</p>
               <p> Writing these kinds of books was not something Bloomfield considered a frivolous
               endeavor, as he was well aware of the esteemed company he aspired to join. He did not
               see himself as another hack chapbook writer, but a professional children’s author. In
               finally signing his name to the third edition of <title level="m">Little Davy’s New
                  Hat</title>, Bloomfield writes: <quote>The longer I live, the more I am convinced
                  of the importance of children’s books. The feeling seems to be universal; and I
                  never talk with a man or woman of fifty years of age, without hearing, that what
                  they read in infancy, was very inferior to the juvenile publications of later
                  days. Reader, ask yourself if this is not the case; and remember the exalted names
                  of my betters, who have helped to turn, or, perhaps, have entirely turned the
                  scale in favour of your children and mine: and then, when you recollect the names
                  of Dr. Watts, M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> Barbauld, M<hi rend="sup">rs. </hi>Trimmer,
                     M<hi rend="sup">rs. </hi>Wakefield, Miss Edgeworth, and many others, allow me,
                  without any fear of shame, to sign myself, <ab rendition="#indent5">Respectfully,</ab>
                     <ab rendition="#indent5">Robert Bloomfield. (v-vi)</ab>
                  </quote> Bloomfield takes
               the pedagogic and artistic dimension of children’s literature seriously, seeing
               himself as part of a generation of authors improving the literary offerings available
               to young people. One can also speculate that he may have hoped to profit financially
               from his efforts in this genre, with its growing audience, especially at a time when
               the market for poetry was declining. In what follows, I will discuss the two works
               within the context of other children’s writing of the period as well as within
               Bloomfield’s broader literary concerns.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The History of Little Davy’s New Hat: Rural Social Relations and the Teaching
                  of Charity</head>
                  <p> In the introduction to his first work for children, Bloomfield mentions that he
                  wrote the tale in 1801 to try to teach children moral lessons, primarily kindness
                  to the poor; he notes that he was inspired in this pursuit of using imaginative
                  literature to promote morality based on his own childhood experience. One of
                  Newbery’s most significant publications, <title level="m">Goody Two Shoes</title>,
                  taught Bloomfield to abominate the fantasies of other stories such as <title level="m">The History of Jack the Giant Killer</title>. Bloomfield thus places
                  himself squarely in the camp of the more overtly moralistic “Goody” (an anonymous
                  story once widely suspected to have been the work of Oliver Goldsmith) despite the
                  fact that “Jack” was a tale approved of and enjoyed by such eighteenth-century
                  literary moralists as Samuel Johnson and Henry Fielding. </p>
                  <p> Little Davy’s parallels to Goody Two Shoes are fairly direct. Like little Margery
                  Meanwell, who is so poor she only has one shoe, Davy also lacks a critical item of
                  apparel (though, to be fair, one can imagine Margery had slightly greater
                  hardship). Also, in both cases the child’s distress is alleviated by a generous
                  nobleman. One might say that the prospect of benevolent aristocrats returning to a
                  sense of their feudalistic charitable obligations is probably as much of a fantasy
                  as killing Cornish and Welsh giants, but <title level="m">Little Davy</title> does
                  not indulge in a social-climbing fantasy to the extent that <title level="m">Goody
                     Two Shoes</title> does. In the latter story, virtue is rewarded, Cinderella
                  style, as Margery’s goodness eventually brings her marriage to a wealthy widower.
                  While <title level="m">Little Davy</title> does include a marriage, it is that of
                  the benevolent Miss Wideland, the wealthy farmer’s daughter, who is matched with
                  the equally generous Mr. Stanmore. </p>
                  <p> As noted above, the world of Little Davy is fairly complex. The Woodly family
                  includes Davy, his mother, ailing father, ailing grandfather, little sister Jane,
                  and absent older brother, Will, a soldier away at war in Jamaica. The wealthy
                  farmers, the Wideland family, are their most important neighbors, as is the
                  shopkeeper Mr. Soapgroat (to whom the family is indebted for their bread). Other
                  neighbors include Will’s fiancée Lydia, another wealthy neighbor, Mrs. Meadowly,
                  and her household staff as well as assorted neighborhood boys. Both Davy’s father
                  and grandfather attempt to earn a living making birch brooms. As both are ill (the
                  effects of malnutrition as one might guess from the pressing lack of food
                  highlighted in the story), they find it hard to keep up this trade, which was
                  probably not lucrative in the first place. Their house is falling down on one side
                  and Davy’s mother’s petticoats are tattered—sewn and re-sewn. Davy doesn’t go to
                  school but receives what education he can from his grandfather.</p>
                  <p> Food is a central element in the plot of the story. All other expenditures,
                  including that of the hat of the title, are subordinated to its purchase. As the
                  text later reveals, the war in which Will is fighting has created the conditions
                  for famine, and starvation appears always at the door in this text. In the
                  narrative’s first episode Davy heads to the Wideland farm to get milk for his
                  family and in his boyish frolics on the route home, he twice almost loses the
                  precious contents of the pitcher. Davy’s guilt about his narrow escapes
                  underscores the critical need for nourishment that drives the story, even as the
                  tale seems to emphasize the moral lesson of not loitering. </p>
                  <p> In the second episode, food again becomes a focus. Miss Wideland visits the
                  family and Davy’s three-year-old sister Jane accidentally breaks the family
                  teapot. Miss Wideland immediately sends Davy to the shop for a new one that she
                  will purchase for the family. The conversation then turns to the news of brother
                  Will in Jamaica, a “sad unhealthy place” (20) where Mr. Woodly had earlier lost a
                  brother due to the inhospitable climate. The war is not only responsible for
                  taking Will across the ocean, but in the conversation we learn that the war is
                  also responsible for the high cost of flour that forces the family to raid Davy’s
                  hat fund. Thus, the fairly recent memories of the historical reality of the famines
                  of the 1790s are written into what might seem a superficial story. Davy’s mother
                  notes in her conversation with Miss Wideland that with flour so dear, she cannot
                  even imagine eating meat. We learn too in this episode that because the father and
                  grandfather make brooms they are not eligible for as much parish support as they
                  might need to feed the family. Finally, we learn that old Mr. Woodly was once a
                  farmer himself, and that the house where the family resides belonged to another
                  farmer who is currently in the workhouse. In these details we see the limitations
                  of the poor laws and the hint of enclosure represented within this children’s
                  tale. The conversations among the adults place the tale squarely in its historical
                  and socio-economic moment. The family’s poverty is not mythic but has clear-cut
                  causes that Bloomfield explicitly includes and implicitly critiques.</p>
                  <p> The initial reason for Miss Woodly’s visit is that she has come with the gift of
                  a puppy, which she had rescued from drowning and was going to offer to the Woodly
                  family. She begins to regret it upon hearing the family cannot afford meat for
                  themselves let alone for a pet. However, it is agreed that Davy will come to the
                  Wideland farm every morning for milk—for the dog and for the family—and the
                  situation is resolved. As will be discussed below, part of the charitable universe
                  that both texts celebrate involves kindness to animals as an essential barometer
                  of the moral code the stories try to instill. Teaching children kindness and care
                  for animals, creatures lesser than themselves, inspires in them that same empathy
                  and awareness for suffering humans. Although equating the poor with animals is
                  potentially problematic for modern readers, it is clear that Bloomfield believes
                  that greater sympathy and fellow feeling would go a long way to allay
                  socially-created distress. Although his is not the revolutionary social critique
                  we might hope for, we should recollect the target audience and imagine that the
                  adults reading the story to their children might be alert to the factual economic
                  and political details included. There is no naïveté in the author’s understanding
                  of the causes of the problems he depicts, as the discussion in these two chapters
                  demonstrates.</p>
                  <p> During her visit, Miss Wideland invites Davy to go with her on a short journey
                  she must take in her chaise, asking him to assist her by opening the gates she
                  must pass through. Miss Wideland doesn’t simply give charity but tries to create
                  some opportunities for employment; thus, she is not only benevolent but also
                  enlightened. The only impediment is Davy’s going in public on this journey without
                  a hat, which is resolved when Miss Wideland digs up an old one, made of “cat-skin”
                  that used to belong to Abel the farmhand and which is so decrepit it must have the
                  earwigs knocked out of it before it is fit for use (more on earwigs below). </p>
                  <p> Hatlessness addressed, Davy is off on a journey that takes him out of his
                  knowledge (to use John Clare’s phrase). On their drive, Miss Wideland quizzes Davy
                  as to how he became hatless and learns that his last hat was lost while he and a
                  friend were nutting the previous fall (no doubt as part of the effort to add some
                  much needed protein to his family’s diet). We learn that while his friend was
                  beaten, Davy escaped corporal punishment, which his parents do not practice
                  (another coded message to adult readers). On their journey Davy sees many new
                  things, such as a boat. But Miss Wideland rapidly becomes more interested in Mr.
                  Stanmore, who meets their chaise. He is the nephew of Mrs. Meadowly, whom Miss
                  Wideland is visiting.</p>
                  <p> In the next chapter, Davy is handed over to the gossiping maid Betty who wishes
                  to learn all she can about Mr. Stanmore’s behavior. What is more likely to
                  interest today’s reader is the fact that Betty is also a lover of ballads and
                  sings one about war that she has recently purchased. She charges Davy to take it
                  back to his mother once Davy informs her that his mother also loves to sing. Davy
                  further receives sixpence from Mrs. Meadowly and Mr. Stanmore, as well as more
                  food to take home to his family from Betty. Returning to his family, Davy regales
                  them with tales of his adventure, and while everyone asks about his second-hand
                  cap, Davy holds on to the hope that he will soon have a new one. His father
                  believes that he will sell enough brooms at Brookside Fair in May. When Davy gives
                  the ballad that he has had from Betty to his mother, she begins to cry because it
                  is entitled “Soldier Will.” Fortunately, she does not stay to hear the ballad read
                  (it is quoted in full in the text) as it a tale of grave misfortune to the
                  eponymous hero. Grandfather Woodly is able to calm her by reading her chapters
                  from Job. Thus, Bloomfield offers us a vision of the variety of literary
                  influences present in a rural household, likely quite similar to what he might
                  have experienced growing up. While poor, the family is not without a sense of
                  traditional literary culture, both oral and written.</p>
                  <p> The family’s engagement with the arts is described again in Chapter 8, when the
                  family goes to church and we learn of Davy’s father’s talent in singing the
                  Psalms. Furthermore, as we discover in Chapter 9, in Davy’s conversations while
                  sitting at his grandfather’s sickbed, his grandfather had aspired to be a poet and
                  had written some verses on the death of a horse killed by a hive of bees. Davy is
                  thus surrounded by poetry of all kinds—popular, biblical, and original. Despite
                  the family’s need for food, they are still rich in various forms of culture.</p>
                  <p> In Chapter 9 we learn too of the broader social conditions and complexity of the
                  life of the Woodly family—again, with much historically significant information
                  woven into the details. As Davy’s father is preparing to go to the fair to sell his
                  wares, we are told that in the neighborhood there is only one “little farmer” left
                  in the area who has a cart that might be borrowed to transport the brooms. It may
                  be surmised that while the Wideland family might be generous, they have also been
                  involved in enclosure, although this possibility is only implied and not elaborated
                  upon. The story continues to follow the family from spring to summer, and as they
                  are successful at gleaning enough grain in the harvest to hold against the coming
                  winter, their prospects seem brighter. Miss Wideland and Mr. Stanmore marry, and
                  he takes over the Wideland family farm, offering to take Davy under his wing,
                  inviting him to live with him, and taking on the responsibility for clothing and
                  educating him.</p>
                  <p> Lydia too receives a letter from Will in Jamaica, and soon after we are informed
                  that the peace has been signed and thus that Lydia and the Woodlys may expect Will
                  home. Mrs. Stanmore confirms the news that Will is coming home, and that, as a
                  result of the peace (presumably the Treaty of Amiens of 1802), the price of corn
                  will likely fall. To top off all the happiness and joy, Davy’s father is finally
                  able to buy him a new hat. The explicit lesson here is one of patience in poverty,
                  as the final lines repeat: “If, therefore, any good boy should read this story,
                  and should have been very poor, and often disappointed, I earnestly advise him to
                  have patience, and to remember <title level="m">Little Davy’s New Hat</title>”
                  (94-5). The fact that problems big and small, personal and international, coexist
                  in the space of this seemingly simple story show Bloomfield’s social commitments
                  even within the unadorned morality required for children’s stories in this period.
                  Davy’s need for a hat exists within a wider spectrum of needs, including that for
                  basic sustenance, which is threatened by enclosure as well as international
                  crises.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Bird and Insects’ Post-Office: Teaching Love for Nature</head>
                  <p> Another of Bloomfield’s core social and ethical commitments emerges in his second
                  book for children: a love and respect for non-human creation. Richard Louv’s
                  recent book <title level="m">The Last Child in the Woods</title> makes an
                  impassioned (and scientifically supported) case for the developmental importance
                  of children encountering and experiencing nature. Louv’s study forms one of the
                  most popular recent works in the growing field of Environmental Education, also
                  known as Environmental Literacy, a burgeoning movement in the field of education,
                  complete with its own national organization in North America (the North American
                  Association of Environmental Education) designed to help teachers at all levels
                  instill awareness of and respect for the natural world in a generation of children
                  whose parents and grandparents will leave them with a destroyed planet. Such a
                  concern for educating children about nature and in nature is inherited from the
                  Romantics via Rousseau. “Let nature be your teacher,” expounds Wordsworth. But
                  such injunctions are not easy to carry out, especially if you are a child of the
                  early nineteenth century living in an urban or suburban area and perhaps compelled
                  to spend more of your time indoors working than outdoors roaming the Lake
                  District. This is the audience we can imagine that is implicitly being addressed
                  in Robert and Charles Bloomfield’s <title level="m">The Bird and Insects’
                     Post-Office</title>, one of the last works that the poet wrote.</p>
                  <p> Elsewhere in the <title level="m">Remains</title>, Bloomfield explicitly
                  discusses the importance of children learning a love for nature: “What a wide
                  difference may be seen between the manner of bringing up children, as to the
                  chance of seeing in their youth, what we call the beauties of Nature” (2: 68).
                  Bloomfield notes how at least his earlier service as a farmer’s boy gave him ample
                  subject matter for poetry. He then recollects the situation of one of the other
                  boys who worked with him in the London shoemaker’s garret. Jem was an orphan who
                  lived his entire life in London and his encounter with “nature” was limited to
                  helping collect maggots to be used for fishbait for those angling in the New
                  River. Happily for us, Bloomfield’s exposure on the farm was a bit more wide
                  ranging. One cannot help but imagine that Bloomfield might have had his old friend
                  Jem as much as his own children in mind when he was writing this last work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Bird and Insects’ Post-Office</title> is certainly useful to
                  bookend with Bloomfield’s first work, <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>.
                  Both texts concern themselves with how children can and should be educated about
                  nature and what nature will and should teach children. Both demonstrate an ethics
                  of stewardship toward nature, and both offer a portrayal of the beauties as much
                  as the realities of the natural world. As I have written elsewhere, in <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy </title>Bloomfield writes with exuberant pastoral
                  relish of the playful lambs, but he also provides grim georgic details of their
                  butchering as part of the cycle of life (and death) on a working farm. The young
                  Giles learns to sing along with the wild birds who serenade him as he trundles out
                  to the field to work, but some of that work involves killing the marauding crows
                  who steal the farmer’s grain and hanging up their corpses around the fields as a
                  warning to others (for more about this darker dimension of rural life, see Ian
                  Haywood’s essay in this collection). </p>
                  <p> Similarly, the inherent charm of talking birds and bugs is offset in other
                  passages such as the lengthy description, offered by the poor mother earwig,
                  regarding the massacre of her children: <quote>I had my family all about me, all
                     white, clean, and promising children, when pounce came down that bird they call
                     a woodpecker; when, thrusting his huge beak under the bark where we lay, down
                     went our whole sheltering roof! and my children, poor things, running, as they
                     thought, from danger, were devoured as fast as the destroyer could open his
                     beak and shut it. (2: 140)</quote> The earwig writes this letter to her aunt as
                  she starves to death for fear of venturing out of hiding, as she is “surrounded by
                  woodpeckers, jackdaws, magpies and other devouring creatures” (2: 140-1). While
                  this situation might push the limits of a reader’s ability to suspend disbelief,
                  the earwig remains philosophical and her final thoughts remind us that the purpose
                  of such writing is not realism but morality. Even though she is trapped, starving
                  in her tree, with delicious ripening fruit in full view, she observes that
                  “perhaps, if I could know the situation of some larger creatures—I mean
                  particularly such as would tread me to death if I crossed their path—they may have
                  complaints to make, as well as I” (2: 141). She consoles herself with the thought
                  that perhaps the fruit would not be as tasty as it looked. The earwig’s
                  resignation is a lesson to children about putting one’s wants into perspective and
                  about the relative nature of suffering.</p>
                  <p> In using the animals as a vehicle to convey human moral values, Bloomfield is
                  placing himself in direct relation to a classical tradition dating back to the
                  most celebrated writer of animal stories, Aesop, whose <title level="m">Fables</title> he explicitly mentions. In the Preface to <title level="m">Bird
                     and Insects’ Post-Office, </title>Bloomfield describes a controversy, fanned by
                  “some French author” about the advisability of using the fiction of a talking
                  animal as a vehicle to teach children, because this might delude children into
                  believing that animals could “in reality” talk—or in this case, even more
                  preposterously—write. Here Bloomfield responds as an experienced parent, observing
                  that most children are clever enough to understand the difference between reality
                  and make-believe. He describes how children, when playing with a pet, will often
                  imagine, by looking at the animal’s reaction and expression, what it might say if
                  it could speak, all the while knowing that it does not talk as humans do.</p>
                  <p> This empathy is a critical characteristic that Bloomfield strives to develop in
                  the letters that follow, as he himself imagines in what style each of the birds
                  and insects he describes might write, based upon his observations of “their
                  well-known habits and pursuits” (2: 126). Bloomfield’s prefatory remarks are
                  comparable to those of many Romantic-period children’s writers, such as Sarah
                  Trimmer, who writes in the introduction to her <title level="m">The History of
                     Robins</title> (first published as <title level="m">Fabulous Histories</title>
                  in 1786) that “The book should be taken ‘not as containing the real conversation
                  of birds, (for that is impossible we should ever understand) but as a series of
                  fables intended to convey moral instructions applicable to themselves’” (quoted in
                  Hunt 72). As Hunt observes, Trimmer, like many others in the period, understood
                  that “children’s affinity and fascination with animals could be exploited to
                  deliver homilies on man’s duty toward them” (72). Hunt provides an inventory of
                  the proliferation of animal “biographies” that abounded during the late eighteenth
                  and early nineteenth century, including one of the most popular, the tale of Cock
                  Robin, which helped introduce children to the concept of death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Bird and Insects’ Post-Office </title>provides powerful
                  commentary on how we should treat the rest of creation. Perhaps the most dramatic
                  example of this comes in letter 12, written from the Pigeon to the Partridge,
                  vividly describing the “sport” of trap shooting. Explaining why he has not written
                  back, the Pigeon details how “we are subject to more than the random gun-shot in
                  the field, for we are sometimes taken out of our house a hundred at a time, and
                  put into a large basket to be placed in a meadow or a spare plat of ground suiting
                  the purpose, there to be murdered at leisure” (2: 158). The pigeon explains how
                  when the lid of the basket is lifted, they all fly out to escape and are then
                  fired upon. The pigeon is outraged that this is known as a sport, and Bloomfield
                  himself is compelled to add his own footnote descrying the wanton savagery of this
                  pastime, noting that he was so disgusted by what he saw, he wished that the hunter
                  could have suffered some of what he had inflicted while participating in this
                  “cowardly practice” (2: 158). The pigeon concludes his letter by telling his
                  friend the partridge that he would prefer to be torn apart by a hawk, who though
                  he “stands for no law, nor no season, but eats us when he is hungry. . . . He is the
                  perfect gentleman compared to these ‘Lords of Creation,’ as I am told they call
                  themselves” (2: 159).</p>
                  <p> An earlier letter, letter 6, from the Wild Duck to the Tame Duck, also criticizes
                  hunting practices, here the use of decoys. While the Wild Duck extols the virtues
                  of his lifestyle to his tame cousin, he notes that “every station of our
                  duck-lives is subject to some disadvantages and some calamities. Thus, with all
                  our wildness, we are not secure: for we are taken sometimes by hundreds, in a kind
                  of trap, which is called a decoy” (2: 143). Bloomfield once again annotates this
                  passage to provide us with a brief history of the drained fenland known as Bedford
                  Level and to verify the astounding number of ducks taken from this area. While
                  this wild duck has narrowly escaped capture, he notes that he has a good sense of
                  what happened to his brother ducks who were less fortunate, and he condemns the
                  insatiable demand for ducks among that “very large assemblage of fellow creatures
                  to those, who catch us” (2: 145). As is evident in his writing as far back as
                     <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>, Bloomfield does not object
                  unilaterally to killing animals. He objects to the excessiveness of the trap
                  shooting and duck hunting, which is not for animal husbandry or to meet human
                  nutritional needs. Rather, it is killing for the sake of killing. The letters
                  demonstrate that death is a part of nature as much as life, but that we should
                  recognize and condemn death when it is clearly <emph>un</emph>natural.</p>
                  <p> The lessons that the book provides are not all grim. Humans are depicted not only
                  as violent and greedy creatures but as a bit stupid as well, as is evident in the
                  second letter, “From a Young Garden Spider to Her Mother,” which tells of how one
                  of the “striders” (as they call people) captured the newly born spiders in the
                  bottom of a glass bottle, little suspecting that they would use their web-building
                  powers to escape. She writes triumphantly: “I shall never forget how the great
                  booby stared when he saw us all climbing up our rope ladders” (2: 134). This
                  reflection leads the little spider to meditate upon whether humans ever try to
                  imprison one another and how, thus suggesting a more modest lesson about our need
                  to respect fellow creatures in their freedom.</p>
                  <p> Another theme that runs through the collection is how each creature believes his
                  or her way of life to be the best. This argumentative device helps Bloomfield and
                  his son find a vehicle for describing the creature’s way of life in some detail.
                  For example, the first two letters provide the correspondence between a magpie and
                  a farmyard sparrow. The magpie, the only creature to appear more than once in the
                  letter series, officiously advises the sparrow to leave the farmyard and fly free.
                  He pompously extols his own powers as a singer. The sparrow, in response, is
                  rightfully offended, mocks the magpie’s “singing,” and warns the magpie away from
                  the farmyard and from stealing her eggs, thus teaching readers that the magpie has
                  a harsh voice and eats any food it can get its hands on. Magpies are one of the
                  few bird species that can recognize itself in a mirror, perhaps accounting for the
                  rather conceited tone Bloomfield gives “Mag” in his letter. The Tame Duck, in the
                  seventh letter, instead of sympathizing with the fate of the hunted Wild Duck,
                  devotes most of her message to belittling the hen’s ridiculous lifestyle. In
                  letter 9, the Dunghill Cock criticizes the chaffinches for stealing the barley
                  from the farmyard. Overall in the letters one bird’s habits are described by
                  another in largely negative terms. </p>
                  <p> Charles Bloomfield’s contributions to the collection are all written in verse
                  (Robert’s are all in prose) but they treat similar topics. Letter 10, “The
                  Bluebottle Fly to the Grasshopper,” describes the fly as doubly threatened, first
                  by a human and then a spider, whereas letter 11, “The Glow-Worm to the Humble
                  Bee,” offers a warning to the bee about how humans are preparing to steal the
                  honey from the hive. The glowworm is compelled to turn to a written correspondence
                  because when it tried to tell the bee in person, the bee was too busy to listen.
                  The collection of letters, albeit unfinished, ends with a poem by Charles: “On
                  Hearing a Cuckoo at Midnight.”</p>
                  <p> As we know from poems such as <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> and
                     <title level="m">The Banks of Wye</title>, Bloomfield was a powerful painter of
                  the natural world. Yet the natural world presented in these pieces is
                  circumscribed. Why, one might wonder, only birds and insects? Why not other
                  animals, such as sheep or cows or foxes or badgers? The answer may lie in the fact
                  that these are creatures that any child might encounter in a city, suburban area,
                  or the country. They are creatures that Bloomfield’s old colleague, Jem, might
                  have had a hope of encountering. These are not mythical or magical beasts that
                  would promote the kinds of superstitious beliefs that Bloomfield worked in other
                  poems to dispel (see, for example, another animal poem, “The Fakenham Ghost”), and
                  which he notes in the parental preface to <title level="m">Little Davy </title>is
                  reason for the book to be consigned to the fire. Bloomfield’s goal is to reach and
                  inspire as many children as he can, not just his own.</p>
                  <p> Bloomfield’s works for children, while certainly not his masterpieces, are
                  important to understanding the author’s sense of his vocation. Bloomfield did not
                  conceive of himself only as an author who wrote a certain kind of rural poetry,
                  nor even as only a poet. He actively engaged with a variety of poetical and
                  non-poetical genres. And while conventions of Romantic-period children’s
                  literature demanded heavy didacticism, Bloomfield’s moralizing never strays from
                  the kinds of ethical and social commitments he expresses in other works. The need
                  to remember—and to live by—our responsibilities to others in our human and animal
                  communities is a thread that extends throughout Bloomfield’s career.</p>

                  <p>The tendency to associate the value of a particular literary work with the
                  personal probity of its author had characterized the polite reception of
                  laboring-class poetry ever since Oxford professor Joseph Spence wrote his
                  influential account of Stephen Duck in the early eighteenth century. Emphasizing
                  his industriousness, contentment, and piety, Spence praised the way that Duck
                  displayed “so many Merits, and so much Humility join’d together,” evincing, for
                  example, a preference for the religious and moral writings of Addison rather than
                  the low burlesques of street literature (27). From Stephen Duck to John Clare, the
                  laboring-class poet was expected by the polite to conform to a model of exemplary
                  private virtue, diligent, dutiful, and suitably distanced from what were perceived
                  to be the vulgar elements of collective plebeian life.<note place="foot" resp="author">For the polite reception of plebeian poetry in these terms, see
                     Christmas 48-49.</note> But this image acquired a new urgency with the growth
                  of popular radicalism in the late eighteenth century, and especially amidst the
                  counter-revolutionary climate that witnessed, with the publication of <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> in 1800, the transformation of Robert
                  Bloomfield from anonymous shoemaker to literary celebrity. </p>
                  <p>Indeed, shortly after Bloomfield’s death in 1823, the editor of his <title level="m">Remains</title>, his friend Joseph Weston, sought to establish the
                  poet’s posthumous reputation by commending not only the excellence of his verse,
                  but also the spotlessness of his character. And it was precisely to counter
                  damaging rumors concerning his allegedly irregular religious beliefs, at a time
                  when such beliefs were regarded as potential accessories of insurrection, that
                  Weston set about to defend the poet’s personal morality. “The virtues . . . of
                  this excellent man,” proclaimed Weston, “did not protect him from the shafts of
                  calumny; on a point too, which . . . must have wounded his sensitive heart, for it
                  chilled the affection of his earliest friends. The world will learn with
                  astonishment, that Bloomfield has been traduced on the subject of religion!—Robert
                  Bloomfield!—whose life was one pure and gentle stream of overflowing kindness;—in
                  whose meek and quiet spirit there was ‘<emph>indeed</emph> no guile;’ whose
                  conversations and writings were ever filled with incentives to piety” (1: xx-xxi). </p>
                  <p>As several contributors to this issue point out, among those friends most troubled
                  by rumors of Bloomfield’s dangerous religious and political views was T. J. Lloyd
                  Baker. In a series of letters of 1821, Lloyd Baker demanded that the poet, then
                  experiencing severe poverty and ill health, clarify his beliefs for the peace of
                  mind of his supporters. The letters implied that Bloomfield’s wife’s devotion to
                  the provincial servant-prophetess, Joanna Southcott, had somehow rubbed off on the
                  poet, leading him to forgo church attendance, as if religious heterodoxy were a
                  natural stepping stone to infidelity. Worse still, Lloyd Baker had heard rumors
                  that Bloomfield had got into the habit of reading radical periodical publications,
                  which aimed to overthrow the established government. And from these “two
                  circumstances,” Lloyd Baker concluded, “the idea” had spread that Bloomfield had
                  “imbibed Deistical &amp; Republican principles”—beliefs “frequently united in the
                  same persons” (letter 351, 23 May 1821). Such rumors had apparently led many of
                  Bloomfield’s polite friends—and it was only the friendship of the affluent that
                  Lloyd Baker thought it was worthwhile preserving—to withdraw their support,
                  respect, and financial aid. But although professing to write with the intention of
                  restoring the goodwill of his polite friends, this was conditional on an
                  appropriately conservative response, and Lloyd Baker later conceded that it would
                  be “highly wrong in any person . . . to associate with, &amp; to give countenance
                  to a man” desirous of undermining the “Church or Government of this country”
                  (letter 353, 29 May 1821). Understandably, Bloomfield was offended by the letter,
                  not least because none of these supposed friends were presently providing any
                  financial assistance whatsoever. He was also clearly incensed at the assumption
                  that his personal life was the proper object of surveillance by people of a
                  superior social class, a feeling that had plagued him throughout his literary
                  career, whether he was regarded as a “curiosity” or, as in this instance, a
                  “dangerous man” (letter 351). But perhaps what infuriated Bloomfield most of all
                  was the fact that the letters forced him to compromise his independence by
                  explicating his views on two subjects, religion and politics, which, in the year
                  he first entered the polite literary scene, he had resolved not to discuss either
                  in his intimate letters or in his public writings.</p>
                  <p>This essay takes as its point of departure Bloomfield’s repeated and strenuous
                  claim in his correspondence that he saw himself as a poet, not a politician. It
                  should be stressed that this was a position Bloomfield maintained to people of all
                  political persuasions: radical, liberal, and conservative. As he wrote in 1804 to
                  the bookseller, poet and republican, Thomas Clio Rickman, “I . . . have four years
                  past made a determination to be nutral in Politicks and Religion . . . <emph>I
                     must and will</emph> be as <emph>private</emph> a Man as pastoral poetry will
                  permit me to be, or subjects that involve not creeds and systems of which all the
                  world knows I have had small means of judging” (letter 129, 29 May 1804). Such a
                  comment apparently endorsed the age-old dictum that those engaged in manual work
                  did not possess the leisure necessary for formulating accurate political
                  judgments, an idea endlessly repeated in loyalist propaganda from the 1790s
                  onward. “How can we expect to receive pure instruction,” asked one clergyman, “if
                  we . . . draw our notions of national policy from the lips of a labourer or
                  mechanic?” (Hurdis 41). But Bloomfield had a deep respect for the intellectual
                  capacity of rural and urban workers, and he was contemptuous of the tendency of
                  the rich and polite to denigrate the experiences, expressions, and aspirations of
                  laboring people. “I have heard more sense and truth in a tap-room, than I have
                  sometimes heard in better company; and there is nothing more striking to me . . .
                  than that <emph>total</emph> ignorance of the <emph>manner of living</emph> among
                  the poor . . . of what they talk, and of what they think! Nothing to me has
                  appeared more strange or more disgusting, than finding amongst those ranks, raised
                  above the mechanic and labourer, such a mean opinion of the poor!” (<title level="m">Remains</title> 2: 71-72). Furthermore, as this comment attests,
                  Bloomfield did express strong beliefs on a range of social and economic questions,
                  though these did not fit neatly into the polarized political culture
                  characteristic of the post-revolutionary period. </p>
                  <p>All this seems to support the view that Bloomfield pandered to the conservative
                  impulses of the polite reading public by disingenuously representing himself as an
                  exclusively pastoral poet, as unconcerned with political subjects as the rural
                  laboring people he idealized in his poetry (Sales 18-22). And it is true that
                  throughout Bloomfield’s career, both detractors and sympathizers often described
                  him simply as “the Farmer’s Boy.” For William Hazlitt, for example, this
                  appellation aptly reflected the fact that “his Muse has something not only rustic,
                  but menial in her aspect . . . Bloomfield never gets beyond his own experience;
                  and that is somewhat confined” (145). But Bloomfield’s poetry has recently been
                  shown to disclose a complex engagement with contemporary political debate, drawing
                  eclectically on the wide variety of radical discourses to which he had been
                  exposed during his long association with urban artisan culture (Christmas 27-48;
                  White 10-25, 132-42). Even so, the distinction Bloomfield made between poetry and
                  politics deserves to be taken seriously, for his correspondence reveals this to be
                  more than just a marketing ploy, and it sheds much light on the difficulties faced
                  by plebeian autodidacts during this era of political agitation and reaction. While
                  for obvious reasons this particular laboring-class poet clearly felt more
                  comfortable commenting on political subjects in his private letters than in his
                  literary publications, it is of enormous interest, I think, that his letters
                  nevertheless communicate a general desire to find in poetry a space apart from
                  divisive political debate, even when it might have been safe to admit
                  otherwise.</p>
                  <p>Before examining these issues, it is important to recall that the concept of
                  natural genius flourished in polite society at the same time as the political
                  horizons of plebeians were broadening, a development initiated by the Wilkes
                  affair and then massively escalated by the British response to the French
                     Revolution.<note place="foot" resp="author">For an unrivalled account of
                     this long view of the development of popular radicalism, see Clark
                     141-57.</note> The rehabilitation of Shakespeare and the cult of Ossian,
                  together with a new degree of emphasis on the primitivism of “peasant” poetry, all
                  occurred against a background of polite anxiety about the increasing political
                  activity of laboring people. In the 1770s, for example, the author of <title level="m">The Minstrel</title> lamented that “All ranks are run mad with
                  politics”; and Elizabeth Montagu—patron of plebeian poetry and author of an
                  important essay on original genius—despaired that “Treason was talked in every
                  Alehouse, and sung in every street” (Forbes 1: 158; Blunt 2: 76). Unlike these
                  debating, ballad-singing plebeian patriots, the embodiment of original genius was
                  imagined as a quiet individual, whose strong sensibility and powerful imagination
                  ideally found succor in domestic and natural spaces, away from the tumult of
                  collective popular leisure or public political action. To quote one aesthetician,
                  such a person conceived poetry as a “sanctuary from which the noise and folly of
                  mankind are excluded,” a “refuge from the numerous perplexities of human life”
                  (Duff 363). In this context, given that every laboring-class poet had to identify
                  as a natural genius in order to satisfy polite taste, secure patronage, and
                  therefore get into print, this theory provided a potential vehicle for drawing
                  upwardly aspiring artisans away from the expanding sphere of popular radicalism.
                  The significance of this is reinforced by the fact that not only did many plebeian
                  reformers have literary aspirations, but, besides politics, poetry was the primary
                  means by which artisans could satisfy their intellectual ambitions.<note place="foot" resp="author">Perhaps the most intriguing example of the literary
                     aspirations of plebeian political activists is the case of the London
                     Corresponding Society member Richard “Citizen” Lee, as described by Mee
                     151-66.</note> Well before the shoemaker Allen Davenport embarked on his career
                  as a Spencean and Chartist radical, for example, he was fantasizing about cutting
                  a figure in the world of literature, seeking to climb “Mount Parnassus” and
                  envisioning himself as a “little rustic bard” (5).</p>
                  <p>To a large extent, Bloomfield genuinely embraced the idea of natural genius and
                  gained much confidence from its privileging of feeling, inspiration, and
                  simplicity over learning and artifice. Plebeian autodidacts characteristically
                  experienced great discouragement in their literary endeavors as they confronted
                  the aesthetic standards and other invisible boundaries that had formerly policed
                  access to polite culture. As Davenport wrote, reading the poetry of Pope operated
                  to all but “extinguish every spark of my poetic genius. I felt ashamed of my own,
                  as I now thought, wretched doggerel” (15-16). Likewise, in the year before
                  Bloomfield would be buoyed up by the overwhelmingly positive reception of his
                  first published poem, he remarked of the supreme arbiter of neoclassical taste
                  that “Dr. Johnson . . . is a ‘Thwackum’ amongst criticks; I allways look at him
                  and his abilities with a mixture of reverence and anger” (letter 16, 8 September -
                  6 October 1799). This anger was at least partly informed by Bloomfield’s rejection
                  of the assumption that the republic of letters was the exclusive preserve of
                  classically educated men of leisure, a notion evidenced by Johnson’s condescending
                  dismissal of an earlier shoemaker poet James Woodhouse: “better . . . furnish the
                  man with good implements for his trade, than raise subscriptions for his poems. He
                  may make an excellent shoemaker, but can never make a good poet” (Boswell
                  444).</p>
                  <p>By contrast, while Wordsworth had in some measure simply placed the authority of
                  men of leisure on a different footing, Bloomfield was greatly encouraged by the
                  polite Romantic poet’s attempt “to come near,” if not actually speak, “the
                  language of Men” (letter 94, 2 September 1804). After reading <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in 1801, he wrote excitedly to his brother, George,
                  “if there is no poetry in them I will give up my pretension to feeling and Nature.
                  I can trust you I think to be struck with them, first with the extreem simplicity,
                  and then for what I before mentioned, NATURE” (letter 52, 19 April 1801). The
                  potentially leveling implications of this conception of poetry were not lost on
                  Bloomfield, and, in his first address to the public, his preface to <title level="m">Rural Tales</title>, he declared “I feel peculiarly gratified in
                  finding that a poor man in England may assert the dignity of Virtue, and speak of
                  the imperishable beauties of Nature, and be heard, and heard, perhaps, with
                  greater attention for his being poor” (iv). In this sense, Bloomfield found the
                  theory of natural genius immensely attractive, for it popularized an aesthetic
                  which enabled him to circumvent at least some of the obstacles to polite literary
                  culture.</p>
                  <p>But if the idea of natural genius permitted plebeian poets to enter the republic
                  of letters, it did so under terms that emphatically excluded their participation
                  in the public sphere of politics. In an early issue of the official journal of the
                  London Corresponding Society, a contributor argued that it was “once the
                  distinguished office of poetry to awaken and cherish [the] heroic virtues,” before
                  suggesting that, like liberty, such a function no longer prevailed in the present
                  “degenerate age” (<title level="j">Moral and Political Magazine</title> 1 [1796]:
                  26). And one of the aims of the journal was to reclaim for an artisan occupational
                  group the public purpose of poetry against what was perceived to be its
                  increasingly private range of concerns. For most commentators, however, the
                  qualities attributed to the natural genius—enthusiasm, imagination, simplicity,
                  sensibility, impetuosity, and wildness—remained a source of enormous value in the
                  context of poetic production. It was just that these qualities were conceived as
                  thoroughly incompatible with the more overtly rational skills thought necessary
                  for effective participation in political debate (Barrell 11-13). </p>
                  <p>Most famously, in a critique of the sentimental language of Edmund Burke, Mary
                  Wollstonecraft asserted that the natural genius was a figure too impulsive and too
                  controlled by the imagination to qualify for citizenship. Although Wollstonecraft
                  admired the “genuine enthusiasm of genius,” she consigned it to the “infancy of
                  civilization” for, in modern Britain, liberty was possible precisely because
                  “reason” had clipped the “wing of fancy” and the “youth” had become a “man” (28).
                  Small wonder, then, that Thomas Paine decided to pursue a course of self-education
                  in natural and social philosophy, noting that “I had some turn . . . for poetry;
                  but this I rather repressed than encouraged, as leading too much into the field of
                  imagination” (49). Nor is it surprising that John Thelwall would justify his
                  literary endeavors to a reading public still largely hostile to his former career
                  as a radical orator on the grounds that his proven failure in politics would mean
                  probable success in poetry. With a heavy dose of irony, Thelwall announced that
                  “since he has proved so bad a politician as to plunge himself and his family in
                  ruin . . . it ought to be regarded as an argument <foreign>a priori</foreign> in
                  favour of his poetical talent: that species of imprudence . . . having always been
                  considered as a distinguishing characteristic of those whom Apollo and the Muse
                  inspire” (xliv). To put it simply, what were thought to be assets in poetry
                  acquired a largely pejorative connotation when carried over to the sphere of
                  politics. This was particularly true for the prototypical plebeian poet, who was
                  routinely represented as a child of nature, a figure unassisted by civilization,
                  and therefore implicitly deficient in such mature, masculine attributes as reason,
                  self-command, and foresight.<note place="foot" resp="author">For an
                     excellent analysis of the way in which the “Child of Nature” trope restricted

                     247-59.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Accordingly, the <title level="j">British Critic</title> began its review of
                  Bloomfield’s second publication, <title level="m">Rural Tales</title>, with an
                  acknowledgement that the periodical’s focus had shifted from a serious to a
                  trivial, if still gratifying, subject. “We are pleasingly called away from our
                  abstruser studies, by these productions of a genuine Child of Nature”; and the
                  review concluded by praising this “original genius” as the “genuine inspiration of
                  a mind, whose thoughts and feelings turn naturally to poetry” (<title level="j">British Critic</title> 19 [1802]: 338). Similarly infantilizing was the
                  conclusion of another critic that “if we behold in Thomson an elegant scholar
                  adorning the simple beauties of nature from the stores of a cultivated mind, we
                  see in Robert Bloomfield, a simple farmer’s boy, painting such scenes as no poet
                  need be ashamed” (Anderson 3: 391). The implication is that a laborer could be a
                  poet but not a poet and a scholar, a distinction which ensured that laboring-class
                  poetry was regarded as a relatively superficial, even childish, pursuit, permitted
                  to please but not to please and instruct. As Charles Lamb very bluntly put it, “I
                  have had the felicity of hearing George Dyer read out one book of ‘The Farmer’s
                  Boy.’ I thought it rather childish. No doubt there is originality in it . . . but
                  no <emph>selection</emph>” (1: 162).</p>
                  <p>Bloomfield was surprised at receiving such a positive response from the
                  conservative press, primarily because his patron, Capel Lofft, was a prominent
                  radical figure and a member of the polite reform association, the Society for
                  Constitutional Information. In fact, Lofft had used the preface to <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> to express a number of political views, much
                  to the poet’s frustration. In a letter to his brother George, Bloomfield wrote of
                  the <title level="j">British Critic</title> and the <title level="j">Anti-Jacobin
                     Review</title> in the context of their admiration for <title level="m">Rural
                     Tales</title>, “they are <emph>avowd</emph> partizans on the side of existing
                  Systems, and existing abuses, and . . . I may think <emph>myself</emph> well off
                  to have escaped their lash” (letter 83, 3 May 1802). But the representation of the
                  plebeian poet as a natural genius found a congenial home in conservative culture,
                  undoubtedly because it enabled a talented and aspiring laborer to be celebrated
                  for possessing qualities which disqualified him from participating in the public
                  realm of politics. </p>
                  <p>In its review of <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>, for example, the
                     <title level="j">British Critic</title> drew from the preface of the poem to
                  emphasize the fact that Bloomfield had conscientiously avoided a “combination
                  among . . . journeymen shoemakers,” projecting an image of a sensitive individual,
                  opposed to collective artisan activity (15 [1800]: 602). Yet, like most shoemaker
                  poets, Bloomfield remained proud of his artisan heritage, and he greatly admired
                  the socialized forms of knowledge generated in the workshop, an environment which
                  played a formative role in nurturing his intellectual and poetic endeavors.<note place="foot" resp="author">The public orientation of much shoemaker
                     poetry, along with its expression of craft pride, often defied the model of
                     natural genius, as revealed by Keegan 195-217.</note> “In our trade,” he wrote,
                  “when any one reads the newspapers or a book, by the neighbourly custom of sitting
                  all in one room . . . we have nothing to do, but to discuss the subject.
                     <emph>Community</emph>, is perhaps the point, to which those who say that
                  ‘shoemakers are politicians,’ might trace the solution of their wonder” (<title level="m">Remains</title> 2: 91-92). Equally significant, he added, this custom
                  not only fostered the acquisition of political knowledge, but also intellectual
                  reflection of all sorts, again underscoring his belief in the dignity of the “talk
                  of the tap-room.” If the <title level="j">British Critic</title> sought to
                  distance Bloomfield from what was perceived as a vulgar and dangerous artisan
                  milieu, however, it simultaneously denied his ability to join the ranks of the
                  polite and to write poetry of a public or political character. “The writer’s
                  observations will not be found to have been very extensive . . . and he appears to
                  have attended to many minute circumstances, which would probably have escaped a
                  loftier mind” (<title level="j">British Critic</title> 15 [1800]: 602). Similarly,
                  the poem had “various errors and defects,” as if to confirm that Bloomfield
                  possessed genius, but not the authoritative rationality of the man of taste;
                  nevertheless, such blemishes, the review suggested, were outweighed by the
                  expression of “poetical feeling” and “warm and vigorous imagination,” with the
                  accompanying implication that <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> should be
                  read for its sentimental rather than its intellectual content (<title level="j">British Critic</title> 15 [1800]: 601). And this appeal to sensibility enabled
                  the <title level="j">British Critic</title> to subsequently disregard as an
                  irrelevance those “melancholy” “reflections” on the harvest home, which indicated
                  that the “author [had] received some impressions, probably at the
                  debating-society, of a questionable kind” (15 [1800]: 604).</p>
                  <p>But the idea of natural genius could also serve a decidedly radical purpose, and
                  George Dyer, for one, claimed to delight in those very “questionable” reflections
                  on the harvest home, which did, indeed, highlight the injustice and degeneracy of
                  contemporary society.<note place="foot" resp="author">This is not
                     surprising, given that Dyer had recently written a pamphlet, frequently quoted
                     in the plebeian radical press, which listed many of the same developments that
                     Bloomfield identified in the harvest home passage as causes of the oppression
                     of the poor: “the reduction of small farms . . . the extravagant appearance and
                     profits of farmers” and “the extravagancies and luxuries of individuals”
                     (103).</note> A friend of Wordsworth, Dyer combined the identities of poet and
                  political activist during the 1790s, publishing several radical pamphlets and
                  actively participating in the democratic reform movement.<note place="foot" resp="author">For an account of Dyer’s literary and political activities and
                     preoccupations during the 1790s, see Roe 19-42.</note> Through Capel Lofft, he
                  met and became friends with Bloomfield, whom he introduced into his polite
                  literary circles in the early 1800s. Of <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>,
                  Dyer described in a letter to Lofft how “it recalled to my mind those ages and
                  those countries in which the Poet and the Shepherd were more naturally united . .
                  . . Your Shepherd’s Boy with the poetical character that he undoubtedly possesses,
                  requires indeed no other name; poetry is more immediately the language of nature .
                  . . I can truly say I have been charmed with his Seasons, and that my heart echoes
                  back every thing said by you in the preface” (letter 51, 19 April 1801). This
                  conception of poetry as a literary form that had been debased by the advance of
                  commercial refinement constituted a cultural version of the age-old condemnation
                  of luxury, which became a staple of radical argument in the post-revolutionary
                  period. To quote Thelwall, “let us . . . labour to abolish luxury. . . . Let us .
                  . . persuade mankind to discard those tinsel ornaments and ridiculous
                  superfluities, which enfeeble our minds, and entail voluptuous diseases on the
                  affluent, while diseases of a more calamitous description overwhelm the oppressed
                  orders of society from the scarcity resulting from this extravagance” (Claeys 67).
                  In the process of increasing social inequality, so the logic ran, luxury corrupted
                  the taste of the polite, leading to the predominance of a form of literature
                  governed by the shallow imperatives of fashion. But if the theory of natural
                  genius could be hitched to a radical political argument, Dyer implicitly imagined
                  its embodiment, Bloomfield, as a pre-political subject, a “Shepherd’s Boy,” as
                  deficient in the mature, masculine virtue of reason as he was free from the
                  modern, feminine vice of sensuality.</p>
                  <p>And yet the image of the natural genius was also invoked in radical polemic as a
                  herald of revolutionary ardor, whose lack of exposure to polite learning and other
                  sorts of cultural refinement provided the basis for an authentic critique of the
                  subservience of the literary establishment to an aristocratic political system. In
                  an untitled poem he contributed to the <title level="j">Moral and Political
                     Magazine</title>, for example, Dyer proclaimed that the “poet’s untaught lays”
                  were essential to the extension of “Justice,” part of a “purer song” of “Freedom”
                  which served “Virtue’s cause” (1 [1796]: 95). The iconic figure in this respect,
                  of course, was Burns. Indeed, the “ploughboy poet” was celebrated in the same
                  magazine as an oppressed genius, whose neglect exemplified the prejudice of polite
                  culture and its associated refusal to encourage talent in and diffuse knowledge
                  among laboring people (<title level="j">Moral and Political Magazine</title> 2
                  [1797]: 48).<note place="foot" resp="author">For the contradictory image of
                     Burns in radical culture, see Janowitz 67-69.</note> But such an argument was
                  even more fraught with ambivalence. For it focused on the talent of the
                  “untaught,” “primitive” poet in order to justify an enlightenment belief in the
                  need to advance the improvement of laboring people, through the provision of
                  polite forms of knowledge no less than the support of plebeian varieties of
                  self-education, from reading groups to political associations.</p>
                  <p>In the biography of Bloomfield, written by his brother, George, and included in
                  the preface to <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>, it was noted that the
                  poet’s literary ambitions were fostered by a range of cultural institutions
                  available to artisan men in late eighteenth-century London, including newspapers,
                  periodicals, dissenting meeting houses, and debating societies.<note place="foot" resp="author">For some reflections on the kind of ideas Bloomfield
                     encountered in these institutions, see Lucas 58-61.</note> But in a footnote,
                  Lofft glossed the present state of one of these institutions after the passing of
                  the Gagging Acts in the mid-1790s: “It is another of the Constitutional
                  Refinements of these times to have fettered, and as to every valuable purpose,
                  silenced, these Debating Societies. They were at least, to say the lowest of them,
                  far better amusements than drunkenness, gambling, or fighting. They were no
                  useless Schools to some of our very celebrated Speakers at the Bar and in
                  Parliament; and, what is of infinitely more importance, they contributed to the
                  diffusion of Political Knowledge and Public Sentiment” (Bloomfield, <title level="m">Farmer’s Boy</title> vii). In this way, Bloomfield was held up by
                  Lofft to support the radical and liberal notion that the present climate of
                  surveillance and censorship threatened to stifle the moral and intellectual
                  improvement of laboring people, thereby leading to the growth of those brutish,
                  vulgar pastimes which had long been considered by individuals of all political
                  persuasions to be a lamentable hallmark of plebeian culture.</p>
                  <p>On the issues of refinement, poetic liberty, and popular education, Bloomfield
                  clearly shared many of these radical views, though he maintained a far less
                  censorious attitude to the demotic culture of laboring people. He certainly
                  welcomed at least some of the effects of the French Revolution and subscribed to
                  the principle that the freedom of the press was a vital index of liberty,
                  presently under assault by the government. “I still think that the general system
                  of instruction, and the downfall of the feudal rights of families, with the
                  present religious toleration &amp;c are fruits of the revolution not to be
                  despised” he wrote to George, his most trusted correspondent during the early
                  stages of his career; and he then added “I should like to gossip with you face to
                  face . . . particularly on the subject of englands boast ‘the liberty of the
                  press’” (letter 133, 10 June 1804).<note place="foot" resp="author">Of
                     course, the notion of the freedom of the press as the “palladium of British
                     liberty” had a manifold range of political alignments and uses, as examined by
                     Keen 25-75.</note> But Bloomfield was a pragmatist rather than an ideologue,
                  neither embracing a utopian or party political program nor envisioning the reform
                  of parliament as the primary solution to social and economic injustice. </p>
                  <p>Something of his general outlook may be indicated by his letter to the minor poet,
                  Samuel Jackson Pratt. In Pratt’s protest poem <title level="m">Bread</title>, the
                  poverty that became so controversial during the famine years of 1795-1796 and
                  1800-1801 was represented not simply as the result of a series of bad harvests,
                  but as the consequence of an array of unjust human developments, including
                  enclosure, monopolization, the deregulation of the grain trade, and the
                  introduction of the gentleman farmer, leaving the poor “robb’d of each right that
                  God bestows on man” (14). After receiving an adulatory letter and copy of the poem
                  from Pratt, Bloomfield replied: <quote>Your letter and your Poem on so great and
                     so interesting a subject as <title level="a">Bread,</title> came to hand last
                     week. Highly flattering as such marks of respect must be to me, and much as
                     they may demand my best acknowledgements, the pleasure of seeing the Cottager
                     vindicated is more grateful still. To see one class of the community grow
                     immensely rich at the expence of an other, to me allways argued an inefficiency
                     in the Laws of this or any country where it happens. If as Goldsmith says, we
                     are hastning to the rottenness of refinement, and if such things cannot be
                     avoided, I see no just reason for starving and contemning the Labourers of the
                     Vinyard, or for keeping from them such degrees of information as they may be
                     capable of receiving . . . . You, Sir, go much deeper into the subject than I
                     am able to follow you; I could never satisfy myself, that, increase of
                     population and increase of individual comforts are not enemys and strangers to
                     each other. (letter 87, 28 May 1802)</quote> Such a position did not fit
                  comfortably within the dividing lines of contemporary political debate. Most
                  obviously, it combined the Malthusian notion that a growing population inevitably
                  led to a rise in inequality with the rough agrarian egalitarianism of Goldsmith,
                  which was based on the contrary belief that a large, increasing rural population
                  was absolutely essential to the health of the nation. To some extent, this was
                  characteristic of the way Bloomfield, perhaps drawing on his artisan heritage,
                  felt confident to assert an independence of viewpoint on social and economic
                  questions, even to people of a superior class. As he wrote to his mother, “Don’t
                  be alarm’d for my safety I am no politician . . . I am my own master yet, and mean
                  to remain so” (letter 42, 3 November 1800).</p>
                  <p>But the reference to Goldsmith is particularly revealing in light of Bloomfield’s
                  claim that the discussion of political issues was inappropriate in pastoral
                  poetry. For not only did <title level="m">The Deserted Village</title> directly
                  address such subjects, but Goldsmith’s poem became thoroughly politicized during
                  the 1790s and beyond, giving expression to the grievances of rural and urban
                  workers alike. Accordingly, it was extracted in a number of radical plebeian
                  periodicals, from <title level="j">Pig’s Meat</title> (1 [1795]: 33-36) to the
                     <title level="j">Moral and Political Magazine</title> (1 [1796]: 320), as well
                  as in later pamphlets on the condition of the rural laboring poor. In fact, in
                  1807, the author of one of these pamphlets argued, as Bloomfield everywhere
                  implied in his poetry, that a terrible decline in the condition of the rural
                  laboring poor had occurred “within the last half century,” and that, as a
                  consequence, rural leisure practices had to be respected and agricultural wages
                  had to be raised: “let the Peasant’s labour have its due” (Brewer 6, 14). On the
                  other hand, Bloomfield’s friend, the Devonshire poet, William Holloway, published
                  an anti-pastoral poem, <title level="m">The Peasants Fate</title>, in 1802, which
                  was lambasted in the conservative press, in part for borrowing its imagery and
                  subject matter from <title level="m">The Deserted Village</title>. To quote the
                     <title level="j">British Critic</title>, just as the author was “full of
                  particular discontent and <emph>universal benevolence</emph>,” so the poem lacked
                  feeling, failing to “raise it above flatness” (19 [1802]: 533-34). As evident in
                  an 1802 letter, Bloomfield followed the reviews of Holloway’s poetry, so he would
                  almost certainly have known that his friend was given short shrift for being one
                  of those writers who “profess to illuminate as well as to delight the public by
                  their poetical productions; and who think that questions of statistical and
                  political œconomy can be advantageously discussed in a series of descriptive
                  couplets” (<title level="j">Monthly Review</title> 40 [1803]: 98).<note place="foot" resp="author">The reviewer ridiculed the basic premise of <title level="m">The Peasants Fate</title>, as described in the poem’s preface:
                     “The drift of this little attempt is principally designed, (without adverting
                     to political argument,) to shadow forth the evils arising to the peasantry of
                     this country, from the system of engrossing small farms, and driving the
                     hereditary occupiers to the necessity of embracing a maritime or military life
                     for support, or being reduced to the most abject state of dependence, and
                     submitting to the galling hardship of becoming <emph>servants</emph> on the
                     spot where they once had been <emph>masters</emph>” (Holloway vi-vii). These
                     were also “evils” which Bloomfield criticized, directly or indirectly, in his
                     poetry and correspondence.</note> Paradoxically, therefore, while Bloomfield’s
                  political opinions were informed by his reading of the poetry of rural complaint,
                  he must have become acutely aware that he was writing at a time when pastoral
                  poetry had been reclassified as an index of personal feeling, even as it was being
                  increasingly politicized.</p>
                  <p>Bloomfield was conscious of the fact that, particularly given his laboring-class
                  status, his poetry would be expected to have a purely private function. In his
                  first attempt to get <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> published, he wrote
                  to an unidentified bookseller that he intended the manuscript simply as an attempt
                  to put the “little events of my boyage into metre” and to present the result as a
                  gift to his mother (letter 6, before 21 June 1798). And this was reiterated by
                  Lofft in his preface to the first published version of the poem, to show that the
                  “Author, with a spirit amiable at all times,” was motivated by “duty and
                  affection” rather than “Fame or Advantage” (Bloomfield, <title level="m">Farmer’s
                     Boy</title> xvi). But Lofft seemed to ascribe to the older view of poetry as a
                  suitable arena for addressing public issues, though he may well have had
                  reservations about a laboring-class poet claiming to instruct, as well as to
                  please, people of higher social standing. After Bloomfield had repeatedly
                  requested his patron to remove or relocate some footnotes and other paratextual
                  comments from future publications, for example, Lofft resorted to the language of
                  class privilege, “renouncing . . . all future correspondence &amp; conversation
                  with a clown who would so forget himself to me” (letter 197, 16 November 1806). </p>
                  <p>The quarrel began when Bloomfield, under pressure from acquaintances in the London
                  publishing scene, sought Lofft’s permission to omit from future editions some
                  radical remarks concerning the suppression of newspapers and debating societies.
                  “In his notes respecting Newspapers and Debating societies,” the poet later wrote
                  of his patron, “he had originally written and pertinaciously retained a downright
                  attack upon Government. . . . I still wish it was not there, for, I am not a
                  politician, nor never shall be” (letter 198, 19 November 1806).<note place="foot" resp="author">Bloomfield had also included a political gloss on
                     the harvest home passage in <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> in the
                     form of a paratextual quotation from the work of the naturalist on Cook’s
                     second voyage to the Pacific, which comprised a denunciation of luxury, with
                     distinct leveling connotations. But this was before, he declared, “I had
                     considered the consequence of introducing even the appearance of politics into
                     a Rural production (let my own private notions be what they may)” (letter 62,
                     29 October 1801).</note> For Bloomfield, however, the key principle at stake
                  was that such political remarks would take away from his work’s poetical
                  character. As he first explained to Lofft, without apparently pretending “to
                  dictate,” there was “a very general, if not universal opinion, that political
                  thoughts and references (however just in themselves) ought not to be seen . . .
                  where rural poetry only should be found” (letter 63, before 31 October 1801). Of
                  course, Bloomfield did write about rural subjects such as cruelty to animals in
                  ways which carried quite specific political connotations, as several critics have
                  recently identified (Christmas 27-48; White 10-25). But whatever he actually
                  believed about the relationship between politics and rural poetry, he was clearly
                  conscious that polite taste was predicated on the incompatibility of these two
                  discourses. At the same time, Bloomfield was also troubled by the fact that, in
                  the present climate of political polarization, Lofft’s radical sentiments would
                  inevitably cause controversy, alienating a large section of his polite readership.
                  In addition, he could hardly have failed to be incensed by the way in which the
                  polite political reformer was using his poem to demonstrate his credentials as a
                  disinterested citizen, while silencing the demands of his plebeian protégé. And in
                  this context, Bloomfield was quite right to think that the best method for
                  maintaining his cherished sense of independence was to avoid the topic of politics
                  altogether.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Bloomfield’s worst fear was realized in dramatic fashion in 1802 when the
                  prominent conservative politician William Windham cited the preface of <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> in parliament during a debate on the
                  Bull-Baiting Act. The speech was part of an attack on the movement to reform the
                  manners of the poor; and to this end, Windham recited the descriptions of
                  Bloomfield reading newspapers and attending debating societies, together with
                  Lofft’s radical remarks on these subjects, to illustrate the malign effects of
                  promoting the intellectual pursuits of laboring people. More specifically, he
                  maintained that giving the “lower orders a character of greater seriousness and
                  gravity” by restricting “what were termed idle sports and useless amusements”
                  fertilized the growth of Jacobinism and Methodism, political radicalism, and
                  religious enthusiasm (<title level="m">Parliamentary History</title> 36 [1820]:
                  833). Needless to say, after reading an account of the speech, Bloomfield was
                  angry at having been used as a pawn in a political conflict he had hoped to avoid,
                  which amply confirmed his prediction that “some publick notice would be taken of
                  Mr. Lofft’s reflections in the prefatory part of the Farmer’s Boy. The lot has
                  fallen to Mr. W” (letter 88, 30 May 1802).</p>
                  <p>But Bloomfield was even more enraged by Windham’s denigration of the intellectual
                  capacity of the laboring poor. Of the former Secretary at War, he communicated to
                  his brother “I think the poor people of England have very little cause to thank
                  him for his compliment on the score of their capabilities and pursuits. We might
                  as well be totally without minds, for he seems to doubt the propriety of exerting
                  them, or of making an <emph>inward</emph> store of pleasure for ourselves. So much
                  of this speech is the most unadulterated aristocracy that I have ever heard”; and
                  with characteristic wit, he then inquired “where is the wisdom of saying that the
                  little sons of a little Taylor should amuse themselves with <emph>athletic
                     exercises</emph>? If we happen to think a moral page a better object to admire
                  than the frizzled forehead of a bull, and like the ascending of a lark in
                  preference to the mounting of a bull-dog, what has Mr. W to do with it?” (letter
                  88). This distinction between inward pleasure and collective leisure seems to
                  suggest that Bloomfield saw himself as a model of self-improvement, whose literary
                  talents and endeavors elevated him above his fellow artisans and laborers. Yet,
                  even though Bloomfield demonstrated an ambivalent attitude to popular
                     culture,<note place="foot" resp="author">See, for example, letter 199:
                     “I cannot help observing the great difference between an illdresst and a
                     well-dresst mob, and I must indeed be unfeeling and ungenerous to acknowledge
                     it. In our National Theatres I have often sided so far with the Patricians as
                     to wish the Plebeans at the Devel, not because they were such, (that I leave to
                     those who are weak enough, that is, proud enough,) but merely because they
                     would not be quiet.”</note> he did not generally hold a pejorative view of
                  plebeian habits and recreations or sanction the polite movement to reform or
                  abolish the customs of laboring people.</p>
                  <p>In fact, Bloomfield conceived at least some of his poetry as an attempt to resist
                  this movement. Announcing his intention to avoid the “seriousness of a preacher,”
                  for example, he described his third publication, <title level="m">Wild
                     Flowers</title>, as a collection of “more . . . mirth . . . than many who know
                  me would expect, or than the severe will be inclined to approve” (x-xi). For
                  Windham, of course, the promotion of robust, manly pastimes and festivities was an
                  unabashed mode of social control, aimed at securing the contentment of the
                  laboring poor.<note place="foot" resp="author">To some extent, Windham’s
                     perception of laboring people as an army in reserve might well have added to
                     Bloomfield’s anger. For he expressed frequent opposition to war and, in 1803,
                     when an upsurge in chauvinism witnessed even radicals support the war with
                     France, he strongly criticized the mobilization of the militia: “The measures
                     persued by Government are such as to cause here the greatest consternation and
                     alarm. Great numbers are entering as Vollunteers without knowing I doubt, what
                     they have to trust to, or what will be their privilidges. . . . As to real
                     invasion we deem it less threatening than an appeal to the exercise of rights
                     by those of our own land. . . . I detest, I had allmost said scorn the
                     profession of Soldier” (letter 112, 31 July-[2 August] 1803).</note> In
                  response, Bloomfield wrote “the <emph>common people</emph> of his native country,
                  are a rough set no doubt, but I dislike the doctrine of keeping them in their
                  dirt. . . . how can we consistently praise the inestimable blessing of letters and
                  not wish to extend it? Or why should the great and the wealthy confine the
                  probable production of intellectual excellence to their own class, and exclude, by
                  withholding the polish, all that might amongst the poor by nature be intended to
                  be Newtons and Lockes?” (letter 88). And yet, as evident in his last poem, <title level="m">May Day with the Muses</title>, this progressive commitment to
                  democratizing the republic of letters, to spreading the “<emph>Empire of the
                     Mind</emph>,” as he called it, could and did coexist with a belief in the
                  dignity of the culture of laboring people.<note place="foot" resp="author">For an illuminating analysis of <title level="m">May Day with the
                        Muses</title> in these terms, see White 121-46.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Given these views, it is perhaps surprising that William Cobbett, who also
                  respected the intellectual abilities and recreational customs of the laboring
                  poor, would later condemn Bloomfield for turning conservative and writing against
                  the interests of his class of origin. The accusation came in the course of an
                  attempt to show that the virtues and talents formerly used to justify the
                  political authority of the patrician class were now only manifest in the populace,
                  with the result being that laborers had both the right and capacity to govern
                  themselves. Cobbett began by asserting that he was “willing to trust to the
                  talent, the justice and loyalty of the great mass of the people, and especially
                  that part of them, who raise the food, the raiment and the buildings, and who
                  fight the battles”; but he then cautioned that the “cause of the people has been
                  betrayed by hundreds of men . . . whom a love of ease and of the indulgence of
                  empty vanity have seduced into the service of bribing usurpers”; and among those
                  men he listed Bloomfield, “the Farmer’s-Boy author” who, so it was claimed, had
                  been “taken <emph>in tow</emph>, and pensioned for fear he should write for the
                  people” (<title level="j">Political Register</title> 34 [1819]: 980-81). The
                  allegation was remarkable not only for being untrue, but because Bloomfield had
                  largely made good on his resolution to avoid taking an explicit political position
                  in any of his public writings. To add insult to injury, Cobbett again pilloried
                  Bloomfield in a later work, arguing that if the poet “had placed no reliance on
                  the faithless Muses, his unfortunate . . . family would . . . have not been in a
                  state to solicit relief from charity. I remember that this loyal shoemaker was
                  flattered to the skies, and (ominous sign, if he had understood it) feasted at the
                  tables of some of the great. Have, I beseech you, no hope of this sort; and, if
                  you find it creeping towards your heart, drive it instantly away as the mortal foe
                  of your independence and your peace” (43-44). The assumption here was that to
                  participate in any form of polite culture, particularly one such as poetry which
                  privileged imagination over fact, was inevitably to weaken the resolve, distort
                  the mind, and so endorse the progress of refinement, with all its attendant evils
                  of luxury, corruption, and social inequality.<note place="foot" resp="author">For Cobbett’s privileging of fact over imagination, along with
                     his associated skepticism of polite culture, see Whale 141-47.</note> For
                  Cobbett, then, any decision Bloomfield might have made not to include politics in
                  his poetry was irrelevant, since poetic production was itself destructive of
                  political integrity, of industriousness, utility, and fairness. </p>
                  <p>To some extent, poetry did offer an attractive alternative to politics for many
                  plebeian autodidacts. In particular, it provided opportunities for personal
                  expression which enabled the laboring-class poet to feel a sense of freedom,
                  however partially or briefly, from the restraints on individual thought and
                  conduct characteristic of many areas of collective plebeian life, including, of
                  course, political organization. Perhaps this was why John Clare, who, like
                  Bloomfield, had strong political views, distrusted Cobbett for being a
                  propagandist with “no principles” and argued against “party matters” and the
                  “reform of mobs,” while claiming “I am no politician” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 560). And though Clare, again like Bloomfield, revered rural
                  popular culture, his solitary ways and literary ambitions were derided by his
                  neighbors, leading him to contend that “Scandal and Fame are cheaply purchased in
                  a Village the first is a nimble tongud gossip and the latter a credoulous and
                  ready believer who . . . believd any thing” (<title level="m">By Himself</title>
                  78). Bloomfield similarly felt that his literary celebrity alienated him from the
                  community at Shefford, and, when T. J. Lloyd Baker forced the poet to declare his
                  political hand amidst rumors of his dangerous radicalism, he denounced the
                  “slander” that circulated in “this vile little town” (letter 352, 25 May
                  1821).</p>
                  <p>But Bloomfield also had the disadvantage of writing in the three decades after the
                  French Revolution, when virtually every aspect of culture had become highly
                  politicized. Throughout his career, his work and public image were appropriated to
                  serve a political cause by people of a radical as well as a conservative
                  persuasion, and this must have reinforced the poet’s sense that politics was
                  utterly incompatible with the independence he so much wanted to preserve.
                  According to Bloomfield, even his fleeting encounters and birthplace were
                  scrutinized for their political implications. As he expressed to Lloyd Baker in a
                  brilliant attempt to highlight the unreasonableness, intrusiveness, and even
                  pettiness of his correspondent’s demands, not only had he kept company with
                  bastions of conservatism and radicalism alike, the Bishops Watson and Porteous no
                  less than the survivors of the treason trials, the polite reformer John Horne
                  Tooke and the plebeian dissident Thomas Hardy, but he had the “misfortune to be
                  born only six miles from the birthplace of Tom Paine!” (letter 354, 31 May-1 June
                  1821).</p>

                  <p>Robert Bloomfield’s <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> is a troubled and
                  troubling poem. Initially a spectacular success, neglected for many decades, and
                  now rightly reinstated within the expanded canon of Romantic literature,
                  Bloomfield’s masterpiece still poses interpretive challenges for even the most
                  sympathetic critic of laboring-class poetry. The aim of this essay is to propose a
                  substantial revision to some of the critical orthodoxies, both past and present,
                  upon which the reputation and value of the poem continue to rest. Specifically, I
                  want to liberate the poem from the generic confines of “rural,” “pastoral,” and
                  “georgic” writing, and relocate its most powerful effects in the quite different
                  aesthetic modes of allegory and fantasy. If this critical step seems at first to
                  be simply illogical and even impertinent (the poem’s subtitle is, after all,
                     <title level="a">A Rural Poem</title>),<note place="foot" resp="author">In Goodridge and Lucas’s 2007 edition, the original subtitle is simply given
                     as <title level="a">A Poem,</title> but Bloomfield was not in control of the
                     shaping of the poem’s image.</note> my intention is to show that the prevailing
                  pastoralization (indeed, pasteurization) of the poem reveals a curious critical
                  tendency to evade or minimize the poem’s striking evocations of violence, terror,
                  and guilt. Such evasive readings of the poem carry twin risks: firstly, of
                  reinforcing the original Bloomfield “myth” in which his poetic identity is defined
                  predominantly by rural rather than urban culture, and in which the ruptures and
                  dislocations experienced by moving from the country to the city do not threaten
                  the coherence of the text<note place="foot" resp="author">“The great city
                     can have made singularly little impression on this preoccupied shoemaker. He
                     was not gifted with imagination, but his memory shielded him from uncongenial
                     surroundings, and enabled him to transfer his mental life to those fields and
                     woodlands where he had been most happy” (Unwin 91). Derek Roper describes
                        <title level="m">FB</title> as “quiet and pleasant” (65). John Lucas calls
                     the poem’s depiction of rural life “pre-lapsarian” (62), though Lucas, like
                     most current commentators on the poem, sees the poem’s nostalgia as only
                     partially successful in fending off pressing literary and social anxieties. My
                     approach aims to probe much further into this “darker” side of
                     Bloomfield.</note>; and secondly, of losing the opportunity to use the most
                  disturbed and disturbing textual moments of the poem as portals onto Bloomfield’s
                  conflicted imaginative condition. Focusing on the poem’s episodes and tropes of
                  violence, terror, and guilt is also, I hope to show, an as yet undervalued way to
                  locate a proto-Romantic subjectivity in <title level="m">FB</title>. By probing
                  the metaphorical means by which the poem dramatizes, negotiates, and confronts a
                  variety of terrors, we can open <title level="m">FB</title> up to a new set of
                  critical perspectives in which both personal and cultural compulsions work
                  simultaneously to explore the poet’s troubled past and anxious present. If <title level="m">FB</title> remains, in the last instance, a “rural” poem, it
                  represents rural life and culture through a distorting lens which reflects and
                  magnifies the twin terrors of psychic and political repression. In Bloomfield’s
                  brilliant coinage, <title level="m">FB</title> is his “boyage,” a voyage of
                  self-discovery into the painful emotional territory of separation, loss, and
                  anxious success.<note place="foot" resp="author">Letter 6, to an
                     unidentified bookseller, possibly W. Bent, 21 June 1798.</note> The value of
                  the poem, in my mind, lies not only—or even primarily—in its evocation of rural
                  culture, but in the intriguing imaginative resources which Bloomfield deploys to
                  both recognize and contain what we can surmise to be unresolved personal
                     anxieties.<note place="foot" resp="author">According to Laura Marcus,
                     eighteenth-century life writing was “a destabilising form of writing and
                     knowledge” in which the “inner” self was constituted as both a “sacred place
                     and a site of danger” (15). For Felicity Nussbaum, such writing was an
                     opportunity to “experiment with interdiscourses and the corresponding subject
                     positions to breach the uncertainties of identity” (37).</note> By taking a
                  necessarily speculative psycho-biographical approach to these issues, I hope to
                  show that <title level="m">FB</title> is a darker, deeper, and more troubled poem
                  than has yet been appreciated.<note place="foot" resp="author">There is
                     ample evidence in Bloomfield’s letters to support a psycho-biographical
                     approach to his writing. One of the best examples is his account of “the two
                     years that I was breeding with Giles” (letter 16, to George Bloomfield, 8
                     September 1799). Literary creativity and parental anxieties are fused into a
                     trope of uncertain and insecure depth which crystallizes into an apt verbal
                     slip: “ . . . by the time I was brought to Bed with my Boy, my wife was
                     breeding another;! We some times see a ball of wax with so small a portion of
                     the buoyant quality that it knows not whither to sink or swim; if you put your
                     finger on it when at the surface, it will dive deep and be a long time in
                     rising again; so it was with my Boy Charles, he dived me into some debts this
                     time twelvemonth, from which I am not yet free, but I have great hopes I shall
                     be free by the end of November.” In Jonathan Lawson’s citation of this letter
                     the key word “buoyant” is spelt “boyant,” a slip which is full of ironies.
                     Lawson is the only critic to see the importance of this letter, noting that it
                     clearly “stirred terror as well as joy” and showed a side of Bloomfield which
                     was “hidden away by his editors and biographers” (23). See also Bloomfield’s
                     barbed comment that “Gentlemen, ’tis true, seldom enter alleys, or see the
                     domestic habits of those nests of human wretchedness” (<title level="m">Remains</title> 2: 71-2). The poems, however, do enter such psychic
                     “alleys.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is odd that <title level="m">FB</title> has proved so resistant to allegorical
                  readings, especially when we consider that the poem was published at the end of an
                  unprecedented politicized decade in which the English countryside became a
                  fiercely contested symbolic prize (Janowitz 152-61). As the “revolution debate” of
                  the early 1790s expanded into a national ideological struggle for the hearts and
                  minds of the British people, competing visions of the “land” proliferated in both
                  print and visual culture: at the radical extreme, Spence’s “people’s farm” and
                  Paine’s agrarian justice; at the other extreme, Hannah More’s self-help village
                  politics and the culture of “contentment”; somewhere in between, <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>’ lost souls and wanderers, victims of Pitt’s
                  militarism and high taxation, and Gillray’s wry images of the King as Farmer
                  George. Any attempt, therefore, to locate the “rural” in a space outside of this
                  supercharged ideological matrix, either in an uncontaminated generic zone, or in
                  the “Romantic” imagination, is a lost cause. Indeed, the quest to find “pure” or
                  detoxified images of rural life was and remains an act of fantasy, wish
                  fulfillment, and withdrawal which by negation and denial betrays its conflicted
                  and terrorized origins. The key Romantic text in this context is probably
                  Coleridge’s <title level="m">Fears in Solitude</title> (1798), a poem whose title
                  alone reveals a great deal about the Romantic paradox of retreat and
                  internalization: the deeper Coleridge retreats into heath, heart, and home, the
                  more the phantoms of Jacobin violence continue to haunt him.</p>
                  <p>Yet the repressive hypothesis remains a useful if incomplete way to plot the
                  emergence of Romantic literary subjectivity. In a period where freedom of
                  expression was constantly under attack and “all privacy was subject to invasion”
                  by the state (Barrell, <title level="m">Spirit</title> 247), the switch from
                  “public” to “private” literary discourse served the twin purposes of avoiding
                  prosecution and constructing a secure model of the ego which could resist further
                  encroachments by a tyrannical State apparatus. The creative risk of this willingly
                  or unwillingly adopted strategy was the ever-present danger of uncontrollable
                  sublimation: it was one thing to intentionally allegorize contemporary politics,
                  for example in John Thelwall’s radical satires, and quite another to imaginatively
                  collude with dominant ideology by generating compelling fantasies and stereotypes
                  of oppressive power. The test case for the latter, compromised aesthetic position
                  is the De Quincey of John Barrell’s tour de force psycho-biographical study,
                     <title level="m">The Infection of Thomas De Quincey</title> (1991). For
                  Barrell, De Quincey’s autobiographical imagination is plagued (or sustained) by a
                  continuous reenactment of a childhood tragedy (the death of his sister Elizabeth),
                  the pain of which De Quincey can only psychically discharge by repeatedly
                  scapegoating and demonizing the lower classes and imperial subjects. De Quincey’s
                  subjectivity is for Barrell both a deeply personal and intensely public discourse,
                  a screen onto which the intertwined and mutually displacing terrors of private and
                  public history are projected, and in which “each aggravates the other in an
                  ascending spiral of fear and of violence” (Barrell 21)</p>
                  <p>I have borrowed Barrell’s title for this essay as I see no reason why a similar
                  investigative methodology cannot be applied to Bloomfield in order to help us
                  “retrace the paths of wild obscurity” in <title level="m">FB</title> (<title level="m">Sp</title> 6). As with Barrell’s De Quincey, I want to use a model of
                  Bloomfield’s creative behavior in which a “myth of his own childhood” is
                  “rewritten” as “narratives of trauma and narratives of reparation” (Barrell 22).
                  Though we can only speculate about the precise biographical details behind this
                  “myth,” I want to use the textual evidence of Bloomfield’s poems and letters to
                  propose that <title level="m">FB</title> is wracked with insecurities or “psychic
                  wounds” (Barrell 22) which emanate from Bloomfield’s past and which become
                  amplified in the echo-chamber of the politically turbulent 1790s. Of course,
                     <title level="m">FB</title> is a concealed or surrogate autobiographical poem,
                  but from the outset this generic ambiguity has not deterred critics from simply
                  peeling off Giles’s mask and conflating the hero with the poet. Indeed, it is
                  unlikely that the poem would have made the impact it did without Capel Lofft’s
                  prefatory essay, a seminal document which crafted an image of Bloomfield the
                  peasant poet and which rooted the poem’s value in its supposedly authentic
                  rendition of Bloomfield’s early life on his uncle’s farm. But even if we regard
                  the poem, correctly, as “semi”-autobiographical (White, <title level="m">Romanticism and the Poetry of Community</title> 12), it is striking that no
                  critic has yet felt the need to interpret the darker aspects of the poem within
                  this “semi”-autobiographical framework. Lofft may have had the painful examples of
                  Duck and Burns in mind when he declared that <title level="m">FB</title> conveyed
                  the “sweetness and ease” of its author (<title level="m">1805</title> 126)<note place="foot" resp="author">Lofft cites Nathan Drake. See letter 25,
                     Nathan Drake to Capel Lofft, 9 March 1800.</note> but this placing of
                  Bloomfield on a moral, spiritual, and aesthetic pedestal has led to an
                  over-simplified estimation of his poetic strengths and procedures. Bloomfield’s
                  letters show clearly his ambivalent and often embittered feelings about his
                  dependency on patronage (and it would be astonishing if, as an intelligent urban
                  artisan, he did not have such a response),<note place="foot" resp="author">“My double capacity of poet and snobb somtimes plague me” (letter 50, to
                     George Bloomfield, 24 February 1801).</note> so there is no reason to assume
                  that this self-consciousness about his compromised social and cultural position is
                  not reflected, played out, and even (in the case of <title level="m">FB</title>)
                  anticipated in his poetry: <quote>

                     </quote> As much as Bloomfield’s success was a genuine literary, social, and
                  economic step forward, I want to speculate that it also reawakened and
                  reconfigured unresolved anxieties about separation, change, and dependency. The
                  violent and disturbing episodes of <title level="m">FB</title> reflect both the
                  strength of these feelings and the counter-revolutionary political mood of the
                  late 1790s: far from retreating into the idyllic past, Bloomfield’s poem provides
                  an intriguing psychopathology of laboring-class poetry in the Romantic
                     period.<note place="foot" resp="author">Barrell subtitles his book
                        <title level="a">A Psychopathology of Imperialism</title> to convey the
                     point that the excessive orientalist imagery in De Quincey’s writing should not
                     be interpreted as simple racism but as a psychic attempt to displace and
                     resolve anxieties arising from the emotional damage inflicted on him by
                     childhood trauma. Similarly, I want to suggest that we can find insights into
                     the working-class writer’s troubled experience of social and cultural mobility
                     by locating what Barrell calls tropes of “trauma” and “reparation” rather than
                     looking for a direct transcription of life into text. </note>

                  it convey sympathy for the socially disadvantaged, or skepticism at the acceptance
                  of (oxy)moronic “cheerful servitude”? Moreover, the comparison with slave-driving,
                  which seems a gratuitous or strenuous attempt to present Giles as a free-born
                  Englishmen, runs the risk of backfiring: when it is read as a continuation of the
                  previous line (“no more; / No stripes, no tyranny”) there is a lingering sense
                  that (like the stereotypical slave) Giles’s docile body would not even feel these
                     lashes.<note place="foot" resp="author">The phrase “he felt no more”
                     also echoes the poem’s motto, “A shepherd’s boy, he seeks no better name” (the
                     first line of Alexander Pope’s pastoral poem <title level="m">Summer</title>).
                     Interestingly, Bloomfield cited this motto and Lofft’s introduction as examples
                     of editorial imposition. In the preface to the 1809 edition of his poems,
                     Bloomfield recalls that the first knowledge of the poem’s publication came when
                     his brother Nathaniel saw in a bookseller’s window “a book called The Farmer’s
                     Boy, with a motto. I told him I supposed it must be mine, but I knew nothing of
                     the motto” (<title level="m">1827</title> xix). Bloomfield also told Lofft
                     that, “I had not seen the poem, and consequently not the preface” until he
                     visited the Duke of Grafton (letter 23, to Capel Lofft, 5 March 1800); see also
                     the <title level="a">Authorial Note</title> (1801) cited in Goodridge and
                     Lucas’s 2007 edition (22).</note> A further problem arises if we take the
                  passage at anything like face value as an imaginative transcription of
                  Bloomfield’s own experience. The fact that Giles is “fatherless” seems to accord
                  with the young Bloomfield (whose father died of smallpox when the poet was less
                  than one-year old), so this leads us to consider that Giles could be a version of
                  Bloomfield working on his uncle Austin’s farm at Sapiston. But if this is the
                  case, how do we interpret the reference to a lingering threat of “tyranny”? If
                  tyranny does not emanate from his “generous Master” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  47)—a possible reference to his Uncle Austin—can we find another source? One of
                  the attractions (and weaknesses) of a psycho-biographical approach is that it
                  enables us to make connections between circumstantial textual “clues” and the
                  writer’s personal experience without recourse to “hard” biographical evidence. One
                  way to think about the negatively asserted “tyranny” of the vignette is therefore
                  as a dual protest: the alienated condition of rural labor is a generalized
                  expression of the personal dislocation which Bloomfield may have felt when he was
                  displaced from his home to become a “farmer’s boy.”<note n="12" place="foot" resp="author">The whole question of exactly what was connoted by the word
                     “farmer’s boy” and its various derivatives is certainly worth more attention,
                     as it is more than possible that “boy” in this context was a term of derision
                     which poked fun at the docile country yokel, or at the very least that it was a
                     sentimental stereotype of conformity and social mobility. It is certainly the
                     case that a well-known ballad called <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>
                     or <title level="m">The Lucky Farmer’s Boy</title> was in circulation by the
                     early nineteenth century, though I have yet to determine if it precedes
                     Bloomfield’s poem (many versions of the ballad can be found in the <ref target="http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/ballads/ballads.htm">online Bodleian
                        Library Broadside Ballads collection</ref>). In the ballad, a fatherless boy
                     begs for work at a farm and after being taken in becomes a model worker and
                     eventually marries the farmer’s daughter. See also the Cheap Repository Tract
                        <title level="m">The Good Militia Man; or, the Man that is Worth a Host,
                        Being a New Song by Honest Dan the Plough-boy turned Sailor</title> (1796),
                     in which “Dan” is a model of conformity; and <title level="m">Young Lubin was a
                        Shepherd Boy</title> (1794), in which the hapless hero drowns on the eve of
                     his wedding. Also of note are <title level="m">The Village Boy</title> (1780);
                     and <title level="m">The Wounded Farmer’s Son</title> (1795). Lofft reported
                     that on Austin’s farm the young Bloomfield was treated fairly like “all the
                     Servant Boys” (<title level="m">1805</title> xvii).</note> This disruption
                  represents a “tyranny” in the sense that the displacement was an involuntary
                  separation: in Barrell’s terms (1991, 1-24), a “narrative of trauma.” My initial
                  proposition is that a “semi”-autographical reading of the poem must take into
                  account the possibility that Bloomfield had unresolved feelings about separation,
                  loss, and success, and that these feelings are worked through imaginatively in
                  hyperbolic figurations of familial catastrophe, dispossession, and guilt.</p>
                  <p>In order to test this hypothesis, we can turn to the poem’s most sensational
                  episode, the slaughter of the lambs at the end of <title level="m">Spring</title>.
                  Following scenes in which Giles has had to stake out dead crows and milk some
                  “lazy” cows, his final task of this first section of the poem is to shepherd his
                  flock, a job which, at least initially, seems like a pastoral reward for the
                  harsher and less fulfilling labors which have preceded it. Not only is this
                  pastoral mainstay the narrator’s “darling theme” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  283), it is also clear that the lambs are the epitome of pastoral comfort,
                  “Indulg’d” in a life of “ease” and “play” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 291-2). But
                  an ominous shadow soon falls over their innocent bliss, as they are also described
                  as “happy tenants, prisoners of a day” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 291) who
                  inhabit “bright inclosures circling round their home” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  286). This is another example of the oxymoronic darkening of tone which first
                  appeared in Giles’s “happy servitude.” The language of confinement alerts us to
                  the fact that there is more than one kind of “indulgence” at work here, as both
                  the lambs and the reader are being lulled into a false sense of security. No
                  amount of “spotless innocence, and infant mirth” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 317)
                  can protect the lambs from the descending knife of the “murd’ing Butcher” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 346): <quote>

                     </quote> The surprising aspect of this scene is not the anthropomorphic violence
                  but the implied treachery and collusion of Giles, no longer a caring shepherd but
                  a “messenger of blood.”<note place="foot" resp="author">It is hard to
                     imagine how Nathan Drake could conclude that this scene “breathe[s] the utmost
                     tenderness and sweetness” (457-8), but the failure to confront the full impact
                     of this gruesome slaughter has persisted to the present day. Bridget Keegan
                     notes correctly that a “potent symbol of pastoralism is slaughtered” in this
                     scene, but she is reluctant to probe further; though she ponders “what other
                     feelings, besides pity for the lambs, does this unsettling scene provoke?” her
                     answer is that “the angry tone of these lines is atypical of Bloomfield” and
                     she explains the “unsettling” violence as a “profound protest against the
                     exploitation of nature” (<title level="a">Lambs,</title> pars 31, 33). In a
                     more recent assessment, Keegan explains the scene in terms of ecological
                     “sustainability” (<title level="m">Labouring-Class</title> 21-3). See also
                     White, who attributes the scene’s anger to Bloomfield’s rage at the carnivorous
                     appetites of the “the metropolitan rich” (<title level="m">Romanticism and the
                        Poetry of Community</title> 19).</note> In a striking reversal of the
                  Christian values associated with the pastoral shepherd’s role, Giles becomes
                  nothing less than a collaborator with the Herod-like butcher who “Demands the
                  firstlings of his flock to die” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 347). The political
                  connotations of this massacre are made crystal clear: the slaughter of Giles’s
                  “gay companions” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 349) is compared to the undermining
                  of “life and liberty” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 348). </p>
                  <p>The full allegorical impact of this “shocking image” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  354) can be felt if we furnish the political allusion with some specific
                  historical events. In 1798, the year in which Bloomfield finished the poem, the
                  Irish rebellion saw over 20,000 Irish killed, most of whom were peasants. But the
                  trope of slaughtered innocence was also the standard textual fare of Romantic
                  atrocity scenes, and such bloody vignettes abounded in anti-slavery, anti-war, and
                  anti-Jacobin writing (Haywood <foreign>passim</foreign>). In 1797, for example,
                  William Cobbett (writing as “Peter Porcupine”) published his macabre <title level="m">The Bloody Buoy</title>, also known as <title level="m">Annals of
                     Blood</title>, a catalogue of graphically detailed Jacobin outrages (Haywood,
                  chapter 2). This work was popular, and it is not beyond the bounds of speculation
                  to consider that if Bloomfield knew the work, he may have been infected by its
                  compulsion to expose the desecrated victims of political terror, even though
                  Bloomfield’s “fleeces drench’d in gore” are emblems of English, not French,
                  tyranny (<title level="m">Sp</title> 350). But political contextualization is
                  still only a partial allegorical reading of the scene, as it does not explain
                  Giles’s seemingly guilty role in the massacre, and Giles’s own feelings remain
                  obscure. As in the rest of the poem, his interiority is inconsistently
                  represented, and it is often insubstantial and transient—“he felt no more.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Tim Burke has noted perceptively that, far
                     from being a representative of an organic community, Giles often works alone
                     and rarely participates in social gatherings: for Burke, <title level="m">FB</title> is the “most extended and most intense, exploration of
                     friendlessness” (3).</note> This vagueness shifts the responsibility for coping
                  with the “ideas foul” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 353) to the narrator, who
                  intervenes to bring the scene to a hasty close so that Giles (and the reader) can
                  put this carnage behind them and look ahead to the “universal joy” of summer
                     (<title level="m">Sp</title> 358).</p>
                  <p>However, the “shocking” impact of this bloodbath cannot be forgotten so easily,
                  and its reverberations trouble the poem throughout the next three sections. It is
                  only just over a hundred lines into <title level="m">Summer</title>, for example,
                  before we are told that Giles fell into a “delicious” sleep after a rewarding
                  day’s labor: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l rend="#indent2"> From sleep who could forbear,</l>
                           <l rend="#indent2"> With no more guilt than Giles, and no more care?</l>
                           <l rend="#indent2"> Peace o’er his slumbers waves her guardian wing,</l>
                           <l rend="#indent2"> Nor Conscience once disturbs him with a sting
                           (107-10)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Although the reference to “guilt” could be explained in georgic terms as
                  taking a break from labor, the combined effect of the diction (“guilt,” “peace,”
                  “conscience”) surely gives these lines a darker hue when the preceding slaughter
                  is recalled. It is as if the narrator’s absolution comes only at the cost of
                  narrative amnesia. But another important pointer towards an allegorized,
                  psycho-biographical reading of the slaughtered lambs scene is the presence of
                  those “frantic Ewes” who “mourn the savage deed” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  342). This intense maternal grief enables an interpretation of the scene in which
                  the traumatic act of separation from the mother is both registered and contained
                  by displacing its agency onto a hyperbolically violent third party (in Barrell’s
                  terms, “this, that, and the other”).<note place="foot" resp="author">Barrell uses this phrase for the title of his introductory section,
                     1-24.</note> The seemingly paradoxical component of this fantasy—the collusion
                  of Giles in the violence—can be explained as a means to manage the guilt generated
                  by the contradictory emotions of love and resentment. This reading of the scene
                  then permits us to deepen and broaden the significance of the most “shocking”
                  object in the episode, that emblem of destroyed innocence, the gory fleece. Once
                  we see the fleece as a key player in a psycho-biographical drama of loss and
                  separation, at least four avenues of critical exploration are opened up: first, we
                  can compare the scene to one of its key intertexts, the sheep-shearing ritual in
                  Thomson’s <title level="m">The Seasons</title>; second, we can take a fresh look
                  at the way Bloomfield revisits the scene at the end of <title level="m">FB</title>, clearly in an attempt to produce a “narrative of reparation”; third,
                  we can investigate the function of the image of the fleece in Bloomfield’s curious
                  elegy to his mother, the poem <title level="a">To a Spindle</title>; and fourth,
                  we can use the idea of sartorial transformation to shed new light on a whole
                  subset of poetical tropes which cluster around the themes of adoption and failed
                  guardianship.</p>

                  <p>Thomson’s <title level="m">The Seasons</title> is more than just an influence on
                     <title level="m">FB</title>,<note place="foot" resp="author">According
                     to George Bloomfield, Robert “spent all his leisure hours in reading the
                     Seasons, which he was now capable of reading. I never heard him give so much
                     praise to any Book as to that” (letter 20, before 1 March, 1800).</note> it is
                  also a major component in what I have called the Bloomfield “myth.” According to
                  Lofft, Bloomfield first conceived <title level="m">FB</title> in 1784 when, in
                  order to avoid a trade dispute in his London workplace, he returned to his Uncle
                  Austin’s farm in Sapiston: <quote> And here, with his mind glowing with the fine
                     Descriptions of rural scenery which he found in Thomson’s Seasons, he again
                     retrac’d the very fields where he first began to think. Here, free from the
                     smoke, the noise, the contention of the city, he imbibed that Love of rural
                     Simplicity and rural Innocence, which fitted him, in a great degree, to be the
                     writer of such a thing as “<title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>” (<title level="m">1805</title> xi-xii) </quote> Though the attractions of this fable
                  of rural origination are obvious,<note place="foot" resp="author">Lofft
                     wrote to George Bloomfield in November 1798: “It is truly a rural Poem, more so
                     than any with which I am acquainted in our language; except Allan Ramsay’s
                     Gentle Shepherd, and Burns’s Poems” (letter 15).</note> no critic has thought
                  to question why Bloomfield did not return to his real rather than his adopted
                     home,<note place="foot" resp="author">Note the grammatical slippages in
                     George Bloomfield’s account of this event: he told Lofft that Robert “came
                     home; and Mr Austin kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could
                     return to me” (letter 20, before 1 March 1800; <title level="m">1805</title>
                     xi).</note> and there is a further issue about the remaining fourteen years of
                  gestation during which the poem took shape in the shoemaker’s workshop in the City
                  of London. But leaving these reservations aside for now, Bloomfield clearly
                  organized <title level="m">FB</title> as an imitation of <title level="m">The
                     Seasons</title>. Beginning with Lofft and Nathan Drake, there has been a
                  tendency to bolster Bloomfield’s reputation by showing that at times he is capable
                  of bettering Thomson, either through the use of greater realism or through his
                  skill in utilizing and modifying the conventions of the georgic.<note place="foot" resp="author">Nathan Drake, for example, argued that the “minutiae
                     of the animal and vegetable creation” in <title level="m">FB</title> surpassed
                     Thomson (446). Such tributes may have been particularly gratifying in light of
                     the fact that when Charles Dilly rejected <title level="m">FB</title> he
                     “exhorted” Bloomfield “not to waste his time, and neglect his employment, in
                     making vain attempts, and in particular in treading on the ground which Thomson
                     had sanctified” (Obituary in <title level="j">The Monthly Magazine; Or, British
                        Register</title> 16 [1823]: 182-3).</note> But there are other and
                  potentially more probing ways to investigate Bloomfield’s relation to his poetical
                  master. <title level="m">The Seasons</title> was more than just an inspiring text;
                  it also provided aspiring laboring-class poets with two powerful but contradictory
                  narratives of cultural development and progress. On the one hand, the decline from
                  a pastoral golden age into urban decadence and corruption; on the other, the
                  georgic myth of industrious progress from barbarism to civilization.<note place="foot" resp="author">Kevis Goodman calls <title level="m">The
                        Seasons</title> “inchoate” and “amorphous” but I doubt this was how it was
                     read, particularly by aspirers such as Bloomfield (247).</note> For the polite
                  reader of the poem, these competing models of national culture undoubtedly offered
                  differing ideological rewards and challenges, but the impact on the rural
                  laboring-class poet was potentially much more personal and deep-seated, as these
                  two narratives defined the conflicted poetic identity of the “humble” writer whose
                  value derived precisely from those “simple” origins. Critics have noted that
                  Bloomfield both benefited and suffered from the existing sentimental stereotype of
                  the “humble” laboring-class poet which predominated in his editors’ and patrons’
                  eulogies (McEathron, <title level="a">Wordsworth</title> 6), but Bloomfield’s
                  story was not only written by his benefactors and patrons: it was already woven
                  into the generic logic of the eighteenth-century georgic. Thomson’s assertion that
                  those who “fret in guilt / And guilty cities” can never know “the life / Led by
                  primeval ages uncorrupt” (Thomson, <title level="m">A</title> 1348-9) not only
                  prefigured Romantic rhetoric, it also constructed a primitivist discourse of value
                  which, particularly for the laboring-class poet, was both a literary conceit and a
                  dominant biographical construction. But if the alleged 1784 conception of <title level="m">FB</title> fits this pastoral paradigm neatly (Bloomfield leaves the
                  “guilty city” for the “uncorrupted” sanctity of the farm), the converse narrative
                  of georgic progress relocates the poem’s genesis in Bloomfield’s workroom, a site
                  of industry and virtuous artisan labor.</p>
                  <p>It is in this context that I want to look at the anthropomorphic force (or
                     “farce”)<note place="foot" resp="author">This is John Goodridge’s
                     assessment of Thomson’s contradictory attempt to combine the harsh reality of
                     animal husbandry with a sentimental attachment to the animals (see Goodridge,
                        <title level="m">Rural Life</title> 56).</note> of Thomson’s sheep-shearing
                  scene (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 371-422), an episode which combines
                  elements of both pastoral innocence and georgic industriousness. The sentimental
                  structure of the scene is the inverse of <title level="m">FB</title>, as the “loud
                  complaints” (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 391) of the “harmless race”
                  (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 388) of corralled sheep express an awareness
                  that their fate stands (literally) on a knife-edge; the sheep are “wondering what
                  this wild / Outrageous tumult means” and they remain—in a haunting phrase—“Inly
                  disturbed” (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 390-1), a sharp contrast to the
                  “dumb uncomplaining innocence” (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 416) of their
                  outward appearance. In order to reassure the sheep (and the reader), the narrator
                  intervenes: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> What could have been an allegorized act of monarchical “horrid slaughter”
                  presided over by the “pastoral queen” and “shepherd-king” (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 401-2) is transformed into a charitable ministry of relief:
                  natural resources are benignly “borrowed” for the good of the national economy,
                  making the fleece (however unconvincingly) a redemptive symbol of virtuous
                  commerce rather than violent expropriation.<note place="foot" resp="author">As Goodridge notes, the word “borrowed” is “suggestive and duplicitous”
                        (<title level="m">Rural Life</title> 57).</note> In <title level="m">Autumn</title>, Thomson revisits the trope and condenses the georgic myth of
                  industrious advancement into a fable of sartorial progress, showing how Industry
                  took the benighted savage, “Tore from his limbs the blood-polluted fur, / And
                  wrapped them in the woolly vestment warm” (84-5).</p>
                  <p>Placed next to Thomson’s virtuous and consoling fleece, the carnage of <title level="m">FB</title> seems like a deliberate travesty, as if Bloomfield was
                  keen to repudiate not only the basic illusion of non-exploitative labor (which in
                  John Dyer’s even more patriotic sheep-shearing scene in <title level="m">The
                     Fleece</title> [1757] comprises “peaceful subjects” who “without murmur yield /
                  Their yearly tribute” [80]) but also Thomson’s compromise trope of mutual
                  “borrowing.” In order to explain why this metaphor was the target of such a
                  violent repudiation, we can speculate about Bloomfield’s radical, anti-capitalist
                  political affiliations, but we can also recognize that the “farmer’s boy” was
                  precisely a “borrowed” asset, a “fatherless” and “poor” boy farmed out to an
                  uncle’s farm and later transplanted a second time to his brothers’ care in the
                  “meridian,” the metropolis where he was again symbolically re-clothed. In
                  Thomsonian terms, Bloomfield’s slaughter scene collapses the stadial distinction
                  between the barbaric “blood-polluted fur” and the enlightened “woolly vestment
                  warm”: cathected indeed, Bloomfield exposes the instability of Thomson’s own
                  rhetoric in which paternalist swaddling is preceded by a violent disrobing. My
                  proposition, therefore, is that the massacre of the innocents in <title level="m">FB</title> is simultaneously an anti-pastoral debunking and a displaced
                  reenactment of what I am speculating was a traumatic moment in Bloomfield’s young
                  life when he was “torn” away from the maternal “woolly vestment warm” and
                  “borrowed” by his uncle “to pay his annual care.” The gory fleece is <title level="m">FB</title>’s central <foreign>memento mori</foreign>, an emblem of
                  annihilation and arrested development.</p>
                  <p>The poem’s need both to confront and discharge psychic terror is one way to
                  understand the fact that each of the four seasons of <title level="m">FB</title>
                  (and this is not apparent from the anodyne Thomsonian <title level="a">Arguments</title>) is disturbed and disrupted by episodes which narrativize
                  and allegorize emotions of fear, resentment, and guilt. At the same time, these
                  “digressions” attempt to find a resolution to the anxieties they raise and return
                  the poem to a condition of stability and “peace.” The culmination of this cycle of
                  rupture and resolution comes at the end of the poem when Bloomfield returns to the
                  haunting image of the bloody fleece. There is a strong impression that the poem
                  cannot be allowed to end until this problem has been formally resolved,<note place="foot" resp="author">William J. Christmas accepts that this scene
                     can be read allegorically but only in social terms as an “ideological
                     accommodation” and a “paternalistic model for social harmony” (<title level="m">Lab’ring Muses</title> 277).</note> and this raising of the aesthetic
                  stakes brings the maternal trope more fully into view. The closing scene
                  transforms the earlier slaughter into a fable of adoption or “borrowing.” The
                  massacred flock is reconfigured as a therapeutic moment of “maternal fondness”
                     (<title level="m">W</title> 352)<note place="foot" resp="author">The
                     word “maternal” may originally have been “paternal” (see Goodridge and Lucas’s
                     2007 edition).</note> in which an orphaned lamb is adopted by a new mother: by
                  borrowing the fleece of a dead lamb, the mother is “cheated” into thinking the
                  lamb is her own (<title level="m">W</title> 358). In Freudian terms, this
                  resolution could be seen as a family romance in which the displaced hero finds new
                  and more perfect parents, but in Bloomfield’s “narrative of reparation” the
                  closure is unstable and fraught with contradictions. Not only is the restored
                  mother “cheated into tenderness,” but the orphan has a split identity, wearing
                  “his predecessor’s skin” (<title level="m">W</title> 357) and being “doom’d awhile
                  disguis’d to range” (<title level="m">W</title> 356-7)—an intriguing metaphor for
                  the dilemma of the laboring-class poet who, as a cultural orphan, faces the choice
                  of adopting or adapting borrowed clothes.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                        <title level="m">1805</title> xvi-xvii. Compare Lofft's commments with
                     Bloomfield’s rapturous account of receiving his first “gift” from the Duke of
                     Grafton: “What a glorious thing is a present of -------- to a man in distress!
                     If hundreds should arise from my writings, I question if hundreds will produce
                     the exquisite sweetness of that --------” (<title level="m">1827</title>, xx).
                     The blanking out of unsightly figures shows a lingering embarrassment, but we
                     know that Bloomfield received 5 guineas, albeit given to him “screwed up in a
                     little bit of paper” (letter 22, to his mother, 5 March 1800).</note> In fact
                  Lofft revealed that Bloomfield had not visited Honington for twelve years,<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        <title level="m">1805</title> xxi. It seems that Bloomfield planned to return
                     to Sapiston in 1788 or 1789 but, according to his brother George, “you told me,
                     you had resolved, not to go to Sapiston—till independent” (letter 2, from
                     George Bloomfield, 27 December 1789).</note> but this made the symbolic reunion
                  of mother and “tribute” even more moving: “[he] has review’d, with the feelings of
                  a truly poetic and benevolent Mind, the haunts of his youth” (<title level="m">1805</title> xxi). For Lofft, restoring <title level="m">FB</title> to its
                  maternal “home” is the crowning glory of the poem’s pastoral virtues, as if the
                  poem is truly where it belongs, outside of the corrupting egotistical forces of
                  “guilty cities.” But the conversion of <title level="m">FB</title> into an object
                  of gift culture does not have to be seen in these sentimental and primitivist
                  terms; it can also be seen as a measure of Bloomfield’s having finally achieved a
                  measure of self-respect and independence.<note place="foot" resp="author">Bloomfield wrote to George in 1798 that the uncorrected manuscript of <title level="m">FB</title> “would look awkward to give it even to my Mother
                     without some kind of introductory letter” (letter 11, Robert Bloomfield to
                     George Bloomfield, 7 November 1798). But there is no question that Bloomfield
                     saw <title level="m">FB</title> as a means to give some material assistance to
                     his mother: “Dearest Mother—I trust I shall be abel to do you some Good, pleas
                     God. If I can assist you with some comforts my soul will rejoice” (letter 17, 3
                     October 1798). In the event, the letter which accompanied the “gift” is quite
                     neutral in tone: “I will not fail to tell you further of all that is in
                     agitation, as soon as I have Leisure, but I am rather pressed for time” (letter
                     22, 5 March 1800).</note> According to Lewis Hyde, “It is when art acts as an
                  agent of transformation that we may correctly speak of it as a gift,” adding that
                  “the transformation is not complete until we have the power to give the gift on
                  our own terms” (47). Intriguingly, Hyde illustrates this point by alluding to the
                  well-known folk-tale <title level="m">The Elves and the Shoemaker</title>. This
                  fable is not unrelated to Bloomfield’s situation: the story concerns a struggling
                  shoemaker who is rescued from pauperism by the magical intervention of two elves
                  who turn his unfinished shoes into “complete masterpieces.” The shoemaker becomes
                  “thriving and prosperous” by selling these shoes as if they were his own, at which
                  point he returns the compliment by making some clothes for the naked elves. But
                  the unresolved issue, which is not addressed by the text, is the fraudulent basis
                  of the shoemaker’s success—in essence, he has been deceiving his customers (Hunt
                  1: 140). With this fable in mind, we may wonder if “duty and affection” are the
                  only “tributes” contained within <title level="m">FB</title>; perhaps Lofft
                  unintentionally let slip one answer to this problem when he identified the
                  inspirational core of the poem as the “haunts” of Bloomfield’s youth.</p>
                  <p>But if the presentation of <title level="m">FB</title> as a “tribute” to his
                  mother provided Bloomfield with even a partial release from his complex feelings

                  particularly valuable for any critic working on Bloomfield’s biography, yet its
                  strange refusal to conform to generic expectations and provide an unambiguous
                  “tribute of duty and affection” has failed to attract any critical attention. As
                  its intriguing title indicates, the poem is characteristically full of
                  displacements, odd rhetorical shifts and tonal shocks. Moreover, it is significant
                  that the most compelling trope of the poem is not the concluding image of reunion
                  but the mother’s “half-finished” fleece. The textual route to this image is not
                  straightforward and involves a journey through several important biographical
                  incidents and dates. Bloomfield’s brief but highly revealing preface states that
                  the poem was inspired by his mother’s last visit to London in the summer of
                     1804,<note place="foot" resp="author">See letter 136, to his mother, 3
                     August 1804.</note> but beyond this bare fact we are told nothing about their
                  relationship. Instead, the preface paints a harrowing portrait of his mother’s
                  last moments in which her usual “patient resignation” gives way to two unstable
                  forms of regressive behavior: first, she develops “an ungovernable dread of
                  ultimate want,” as if her life has been a complete failure and she is pitched back
                  into a primary condition of insecurity: “to meet Winter, Old Age, and Poverty, was
                  like meeting three giants” (65). Second, she becomes a compulsive spinner. As the
                  poem reveals, Bloomfield’s mother was by profession a “village school-mistress”
                  (line 36), but in the preface’s vignette she reverts to the customary occupation
                  for which, we are told, she was renowned, and which becomes an obsession in her
                  last moments: <quote> During the tearful paroxysms of her last depression, she
                     spun with the utmost violence, and with vehemence exclaimed, “<emph>I must
                        spin!</emph>” A paralytic affection, struck her whole right side, while at
                     work, and obliged her to quit her spindle when only half filled, and she died
                     within a fortnight. I have that spindle now. (65) </quote> These are intriguing
                  details, yet the final piece of information provided by the preface is even more
                  revealing for the purposes of this essay. Bloomfield returns to the topic of his
                  mother’s last visit to see him in London and notes that “she returned from her
                  visit to London, on Friday, the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of June, just to a day,
                  23 years after she brought me to London, which was also on a Friday, in the year
                  1781.” No further comments are given, but the coincidence of dates indicates that
                  the poem functions, at one level, as a metaphorical or allegorical revisiting of
                  that formative moment in Bloomfield’s life when “she brought me to London.” From
                  the evidence of the preface, therefore, the mother’s “spindle” is not only a
                  quasi-religious “relic” (the first word of the poem) but also a fetish, an object
                  with the transcendental power to summon the ghosts of the past.</p>
                  <p>As the first line of the poem shows, Bloomfield’s relation to this fetish is
                  conflicted: “Relic! I will not bow to thee, nor worship!” Does this defiance
                  represent Bloomfield’s complex feelings about his mother? Or is it a protest
                  directed at the generic expectations of the elegy? If the latter, the line
                  explodes the notion that (in Drake’s words) “piety” and respectability seeped from
                  the pores of Bloomfield’s poetry. Whatever the answer, this is an unorthodox
                  opening to an elegy, and it establishes a discordant and edgy tone for the
                  fragmented biographical narrative which follows. In the next seven lines
                  Bloomfield seems to affirm all the pastoral myths about his poetic origins by
                  stating that the spindle evokes those “sunny days, that ever haunt my dreams” (an
                  echo of the rosy phrase “the sunshine of my youth” used in <title level="a">To My
                     Old Oak Table</title> [1803] to describe the inspiration for <title level="m">FB</title>). But these are not the days on the Sapiston farm: the lines refer
                  to the time preceding this, “ere the farm received / My vagrant foot,” and even
                  this tantalizing reference to Honington is only superficially “sunny.” To begin
                  with, the parental role in his transfer to “the farm” is conspicuously deleted and
                  replaced with the awkward passive mood. Furthermore, to call himself a “vagrant”
                  (6) is an almost comic misrepresentation of the basic facts (which were in the
                  public domain) of his involuntary removal to Sapiston,<note place="foot" resp="author">According to George Bloomfield, Uncle Austin “took the Author,
                     when very young, and kept him from motives of charity” (letter 12, George
                     Bloomfield to Capel Lofft, November 1798).</note> a point that gains some
                  credence from the punning association between the “vagrant foot” and metrical
                  feet. When line six is read to the end, a quite different interpretation of events
                  emerges from the ambiguous syntax: “ere the farm received / My vagrant foot, and
                  with its liberty”—only the possessive “s” of “its” prevents this line from
                  implying that his “liberty” was sacrificed, though ostensibly that word refers to
                  the farm’s new pastoral freedoms which “Had taught my heart to wander” (8). This
                  mood of liberation could therefore be a consolation for the pain of separation and
                  the hardships of becoming (and failing to remain) a “farmer’s boy.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Bloomfield was “so small of his age that Mr Austin
                     said he was not likely to be able to get his living by hard labour” (<title level="m">1805</title> v).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the waving of this spindle-wand seems to have magically cleansed
                  Bloomfield’s infant past from any parental interference—as if his mother’s death
                  has indeed released him from her sphere of influence—this does not mean that all
                  is forgiven. Having dispensed with his past, Bloomfield then calls on the spectral
                  spindle to teach “a moral” to “me and mine” (10). This “moral” takes the form of a
                  reworking of those scenes in the preface which described his mother’s dying
                  moments. In the poetic re-imagining, the two scenes of frantic spinning and
                  terrified hallucinations are conflated, as if the former is a deranged or
                  superstitious attempt to erect a barrier between herself and the three giants
                  “grim and bold.” Not content to show that “terrors fill’d her brain,— / Nor
                  causeless terrors” (13-14), Bloomfield adds a final macabre touch, the
                  intervention of Death itself who “to her trembling hand and heart at once, / Cried
                  ‘Spin no more’” (20-21). The poem changes the preface’s description of her final
                  seizure—described as a “paralytic affection” (itself an intriguing phrase,<note place="foot" resp="author">The phrase “paralytic affliction” is used to
                     describe his mother’s condition in letter 152, to Thomas Park, December 23
                     1804; the change from “affliction” to “affection” is revealing.</note> and an
                  echo of Lofft’s “tribute of duty and affection”)—into a more dramatic, sudden
                  demise. Death’s pronouncement “Spin no more” presumably answers the mother’s
                  deranged declaration “<emph>I must spin!</emph>” in the preface, but there is
                  surely also a disturbing allusion to the famous curse “Sleep no more” in
                  Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Macbeth</title>: this echo gives the “utmost
                  violence” of her words a much darker subtext. But if imagining his mother as an
                  infamous murderess is a shocking step for Bloomfield to take, even unconsciously,
                  the allusion could be one way, if an extreme one, to appease his feelings of
                  abandonment and betrayal. What his mother leaves on her spindle, significantly, is
                  an incomplete, “soft downy fleece” of the type that “she wound / Through all her
                  days, she who could spin so well” (22-3). This “half fill’d” and “half finish’d”
                  fleece (24) is yet another modulation of the trope of dysfunctional parental
                  bonding which recurs in <title level="m">FB</title>.</p>
                  <p>The image of the incomplete fleece is central to the poem’s psychic and aesthetic
                  success. Indeed, the image can be seen as the poem’s “spindle” or pivotal point
                  around which the various strands of meaning are gathered. As if he is aware of
                  this, Bloomfield reflects on his own metaphor: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l rend="#indent2"> Half finish’d? ’Tis the motto of the world:</l>
                           <l rend="#indent2"> We spin vain threads, and strive, and die</l>
                           <l rend="#indent2"> With sillier things than spindles on our hands.
                           (26-8)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> The first two lines of this generalization are unimpressively
                  conventional, but in line 28 there is a characteristic slippage. It seems that
                  Bloomfield is remembering a letter written to his brother George in September 1798
                  in which he refers self-effacingly to his plans to publish <title level="m">FB</title>: “very silly things are sometimes printed.” (letter 10, 16
                  September 1798.)<note place="foot" resp="author">Letter 10, 16 September
                     1798.</note> The verbal echo implies that Bloomfield is now thinking of his own
                  poetic identity. With his mother’s memory safely contained in the twin symbols of
                  the spindle and (more importantly) the half-completed fleece, Bloomfield can now
                  transfer the trope of spinning to the production of his own lines of verse, though
                  he makes this move initially under the protection of self-deprecating allusions to
                  “vain threads” and “sillier things.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Bloomfield may also have been remembering some lines from Dyer’s <title level="m">The Fleece</title>: <quote>

                     </note> He then uses the third, concluding section of the poem to
                  restage the process of becoming a poet: “Then, feeling as I do, resistlessly, /
                  The bias set upon my soul for verse” (27-8). With this autobiographical
                  re-enactment in place, the final, redemptive modulation of the fleece image
                  provides an appropriately beneficent and pacific conclusion to this allegorized
                  life story. Looking ahead to his own death, he asks God to accept his “purity / Of
                  thought and texture” (32-3) and convert a “poor fragment” (31) into a “snowy
                  innocence” (35).</p>

                  <p>The textual evidence adduced so far allows us to surmise that unresolved feelings
                  about filial separation lie behind Bloomfield’s affinity with the orphaned lambs
                  of <title level="m">FB</title> who are “doom’d awhile disguis’d to range” (<title level="m">W</title> 355) in borrowed fleeces, so that the “unsuspecting dam”
                     (<title level="m">W</title> 359) would be “cheated into tenderness” (<title level="m">W</title> 358). The trope of the “half finished” or “half fill’d”
                  fleece provided a means to condense the “torrent” of feelings about his early life
                     (<title level="a">To My Old Oak Table,</title> line 96) into a poetically
                  flexible trope of loss and transformation. In psycho-biographical terms,
                  Bloomfield was “re-fleeced” three times. The first major break was the move to
                  Sapiston, the place where he became a farmer’s boy and “reliev’d his Mother of any
                  other expence than only of finding him a few things to wear; and this was more
                  than she well knew how to” (<title level="m">1805</title> v). The second
                  transformation was his arrival in London in 1781, a journey predicated on the
                  promise of his brother Nathaniel “to clothe him” (<title level="m">1805</title>
                  v). The third metamorphosis was the publication of <title level="m">FB</title>,
                  the moment when Bloomfield became a poet and acquired a set of parental
                  substitutes in the guise of patrons and supporters. Each of these rites of passage
                  can be seen as a return of the repressed which generated new and often extreme
                  imaginings of those core emotions of insecurity, guilt, fear, and terror.</p>
                  <p>The initial wrench from Honington to Sapiston seems to have been either too
                  painful or “obscure” to imagine directly. It is curious that even in his poem
                     <title level="a">On Revisiting the Place of my Nativity</title> (dated 30 May
                  1800, and published initially in the third edition [May 1800] of <title level="m">FB</title>) there are no details about his parents, his home, or, for that
                  matter, the village (121-2).<note place="foot" resp="author">Interestingly,
                     there is no record of this visit in the letters. Only letter 29, written to
                     George in May 1800, gives a few jumbled details of the coach journey, and the
                     fact that Bloomfield confuses the outward and return legs of the visit seems an
                     indication of mixed feelings: “I have wrote the latter part of my letter
                     backward.”</note> After expressing the conventional sentiment that absence has
                  given “Ideal sweetness to my distant home” there is no further mention of this
                  “home.” Perhaps Bloomfield was disconcerted by the response of local people to his
                  celebrity: <quote>I conceited that I saw the workmen and neighbours look at me as
                     an idle fellow. I had nothing to do but to read, look at them, and their
                     country and concerns. They did not seem to know how to estimate me. (<title level="m">1827</title> xx)</quote> This is the classic dilemma of the
                  laboring-class poet whose social mobility is regarded with suspicion or
                  bewilderment by the class and community from which he or she originated. As an
                  adopted son of polite culture, Bloomfield had embarked on that perilous voyage of
                  dependency and commercial success which had afflicted the lives and the sanity of
                  some of his plebeian predecessors, notably Stephen Duck.<note place="foot" resp="author">Bloomfield soon came into conflict with Lofft about his intrusive
                     editorial role: see their correspondence in 1801 beginning with letter
                     58.</note> But unlike Duck, Bloomfield was not transported straight from the
                  fields to the mansions of patronage. By 1798, when he completed <title level="m">FB</title>, Bloomfield had lived and worked in London for seventeen years,
                  absorbing and negotiating metropolitan culture in a period of intense political
                  and cultural upheaval.<note place="foot" resp="author">The need to
                     acknowledge the effect of urban culture on laboring-class poets has been made
                     forcefully in relation to Stephen Duck, but is proving a harder nut to crack in
                     relation to Bloomfield. See, for example, Landry and Christmas. For the
                     purposes of this essay, I have assumed that Bloomfield absorbed the “spirit of
                     despotism” of the 1790s via whichever cultural and political forces he
                     encountered; the available evidence from letters and other sources make this a
                     reasonable assumption.</note> Unfortunately, we have only a few tantalizing yet
                  precious glimpses into Bloomfield’s life in the period, most of which appeared in
                  Lofft’s narrative, based on information supplied by George Bloomfield (letter 20,
                  before 1 March 1800). We can only speculate about this thinness of detail: it may
                  be explained by the need to conceal radical political affiliations,<note place="foot" resp="author">There is one moment in <title level="m">FB</title>
                     when Giles flashes up as a potential surrogate radical figure, but typically
                     for the poem this possibility is presented through denial and pacification, to
                     the extent that the moment functions like a mock-allusion to radical allegory.
                     When he is milking cows in <title level="m">Spring</title>, Giles’s “tatter’d”
                     hat “purloins a coat of hair” (202) from the cow’s side and becomes “A mottled
                     ensign of his harmless trade, / An unambitious, peaceable cockade” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 203-4). The tone of these two lines is slippery: what
                     seems like a gratuitous reinforcement of pastoral’s counter-revolutionary
                     credentials could equally, in my mind, consign Giles to docility and political
                     inefficacy. In other words he becomes—for a brief moment—the kind of
                     conservative stereotype perpetuated in Hannah More’s tracts. The other point to
                     note about the scene is that it is yet another reworking of the trope of the
                     expropriated fleece in which a natural resource is (peaceably in this instance)
                     “purloined”: the scene has the added function of attempting to allegorically
                     counterbalance the slaughtered lambs of <title level="m">Spring</title>.</note>
                  or—which is more likely—it tells us that for Lofft and other admirers and
                  promoters, Bloomfield was essentially and definitively a pastoral poet. He may
                  have lived in the city, but his real creative, spiritual, and moral home was in
                  the Suffolk countryside. The pasteurization of Bloomfield was both a marketing
                  ploy and a way of domesticating Bloomfield so that his patrons could be freed from
                  any guilt about inflating his expectations; laboring-class poets must not be
                  encouraged to “rise into a line that is beyond their reach.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Anderson 393-5. Anderson’s review of the poem gives
                     a useful insight into the perils of patronage. In response to a long letter
                     from a reader which praises <title level="m">FB</title> and its author, “a
                     simple farmer’s boy” (391), Anderson states that he read “this little poem in
                     manuscript with much satisfaction” but also with uneasiness about the wisdom of
                     bringing Bloomfield “forward to public notice” (393). He states that patronage
                     can be the “severest cruelty” if it leads lower-class poets into “an
                     uninterrupted struggle” to “rise into a line that is beyond their reach.” But
                     he is reassured that the “characteristic features” of <title level="m">FB</title> are “innocence and beneficence” and “native simplicity” and that
                     these qualities are a reflection of Bloomfield’s sensible decision not to
                     aspire socially and intellectually beyond “domestic comforts” and those “few
                     congenial souls” (polite friends) “in whose conversation he may feel himself
                     fortified in his natural propensities rather than deranged” (394-5). Nathan
                     Drake also reassured budding patrons who “from their opulence and taste are
                     disposed to patronise and foster the efforts of rising genius” that they would
                     find a “peculiar gratification” in the fact that both <title level="m">FB</title> and its author were thoroughly respectable “in a moral light”
                     (479). The image of the pasteurized Bloomfield quickly congealed into a species
                     of hagiography, completely suppressing the less settling aspects of his
                     “poetical welfare.” The <title level="j">Gentleman’s Magazine</title> called
                     him “the best of husbands, an indulgent father and quiet neighbour, and
                     particularly affectionate to his mother” (70 (1800): 1181), and Robert Southey
                     applauded “one whose talents were of no common standard, and whose character
                     was in all respects exemplary” (163). But the apotheosis of this tendency was
                     probably Joseph Weston’s gushing defense of Bloomfield’s integrity in <title level="m">Remains</title>. For Weston, Bloomfield is a paragon of English
                     poetical virtue, exuding “sweetness, simplicity and feeling,” producing
                     “pictures . . . drawn directly from nature” which are “<emph>always</emph> just
                     and true, like the reflections of a polished mirror” and uncontaminated by the
                     “infestation of impure motivation or poetical conduct.” Hence “everything is
                     simple and unaffected, purely pastoral and truly English” like the poet himself
                     who eschewed all “phantoms of foreign extraction” (<title level="m">Remains</title> 1: vii, ix, x).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Hence it is the rustic image of Bloomfield which is foregrounded in Lofft’s
                  account of “little Robert’s” arrival in London on 29 June 1781.<note place="foot" resp="author">The fact that this was only one year after the
                     devastation of the Gordon Riots has been overlooked by critics, but surely the
                     visible effects of this destruction would have been apparent, and could have
                     colored Bloomfield’s impressions of the great “meridian.”</note> When his
                  mother hands him over to his brother George, she charges George “<emph>as I valued
                     a Mother’s Blessing, to watch over him, to set good Examples for him, and never
                     to forget that he had lost his Father</emph>.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                     verbatim: see letter 20.</note> Lofft finds this moment of surrogate fathering
                  a “pathetic and successful Admonition,” even though it clearly reinforced
                  Bloomfield’s orphaned status. Revealingly, Bloomfield is wrongly dressed for the
                  occasion: the “little, fatherless boy” is “dress’d just as he came from keeping
                  Sheep, Hogs, &amp;—his shoes fill’d full of stumps in the heels. He looking about
                  him, slipt up—his nails were unus’d to a flat pavement.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                     (May 1800) as an act of “rhetorical emasculation” (White, <title level="m">Romanticism and the Poetry of Community</title> 90).</note> but the humor
                  releases some genuine tensions about the awkward transition from rural to urban
                  culture. The most telling detail is the wonderful literalization of insecurity,
                  the moment when the boy “slipt up” on the pavement (and the joke becomes even more
                  poignant when we remember that Bloomfield had come to London to be apprenticed as
                  a shoemaker). But there is more than one type of “slippage” here. When Bloomfield
                  used the preface to the 1809 edition of his poems to correct inaccuracies in
                  Lofft’s preface, the only incident which he revised in any detail was this
                  “anecdote” of rustic gaucherie. In the corrected narrative, he has prepared for
                  the “change I was going to experience” by wearing his best, Sunday clothes, “such
                  as they were.” Symbolically, he sold his smock frock (the standard dress of the
                  country laborer) for a shilling, and recalls “slily washing my best hat in the
                  horsepond, to give it a gloss fit to appear in the meridian of London.” Clearly,
                  Bloomfield wanted to make his entry into London a more empowering if still comic
                  scene, a moment which emphasized aspiration rather than ineptitude or
                     incongruity.<note place="foot" resp="author">See also a letter which
                     Bloomfield wrote to his mother in October 1797 (at which point he was hard at
                     work composing <title level="m">FB</title>). The letter makes clear that
                     Bloomfield feels some guilt about the fact that he cannot “help” his mother,
                     but he explains his dilemma in terms of “successions and changes amongst us”
                     and pinpoints his arrival in London as a key moment: “I have read your letters
                     with pleasure, when you have been under the pressure of ill health or bad
                     prospects, the natural though painful conclusion is, I cant help you; you I
                     believe often think over those things, you know the difficulty of keeping
                     afloat in the dirty stream of the world, and I think you know too the hearts of
                     us all, that the power, and not the will, is wanted.—It is sixteen years last
                     June since I washed my old hat in the Horse-pond and sold my smock for a
                     shilling to Sam Shelver’s boy, and set off to London to turn shoemaker, and I
                     always remark that though I am aquainted with the principle alterations and
                     deaths and changes, children grown to Men and Women since &amp;c, the first
                     thought that is, I mean whenever not thinking of other things my mind returns
                     to the country, for the first moment, it always presents the old picture. I see
                     my uncle master of the farm instead of my cousin, and can see in imagination my
                     old neighbours and things just as they were; fixing the memory thus, brings in
                     a strong point of view the quick successions and changes amongst us; for if I
                     had 16 years ago fixt my attention on a flourishing oak, or a whole grove of
                     oaks, the alteration might be disernable, but not striking” (letter 5, 22-[29]
                     October 1797).</note> He also recalls “riding backwards on the coach” and being
                  amazed that all the coaches “stood for hire!” (<title level="m">1827</title>
                  x-xi). These details, which Bloomfield dismisses as “surely trifling anecdotes,”
                  are all important adjustments to Lofft’s version of this rite of passage: the
                  conspicuous dressing up recalls the orphaned lamb “doom’d awhile disguis’d to
                  range”; the literal backwardness on the coach expresses the formidable scale of
                  the journey ahead of him; and the naivety about commercial society anticipates the
                  transition to artisan labor and the free market. Far more was at stake, therefore,
                  in Bloomfield’s rewriting of this initiation scene, than a simple change of
                  clothes. The Sunday-suited Bloomfield was a declaration of independence, an
                  affirmation of the right to dress (and address) himself, and a means to distance
                  himself from his alter ego Giles, who ploughs his field single-handedly “Till dirt
                  adhesive loads his clouted shoes” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 82).</p>

                  <p>But the slaughtered lambs of <title level="m">Spring</title> are only the most
                  spectacular example of Bloomfield’s allegorical dramatization of terror. The
                  anthropomorphic conventions of georgic enabled Bloomfield to displace onto animals
                  a discourse of human rights and a whole battery of violent effects which seem to
                  evoke the climate of terror in the 1790s. But while some of these moments in the
                  poem have been analyzed by critics in this way, the possibility that the same
                  violent tropes might serve both a political and psycho-biographical agenda has yet
                  to be considered. For example, no serious critical attention has been given to one
                  of the earliest examples of terror in the poem, the shooting and staking out of
                  crows (<title level="m">Sp</title> 103-24). Yet this incident contains powerful
                  allegorical possibilities: an exposure of the brutality of the Black Acts, a
                  condemnation of capital punishment, an anti-hunting scene, or even an anti-war
                     allegory.<note place="foot" resp="author">In <title level="m">Summer</title> there seems to be a clear anti-war message: <quote>

                     </quote> There are a number of ways to interpret this passage: on the one hand,
                  there is a confrontation between civilization and primitive nature; on the other
                  hand, the “wings stretcht forth” clearly evoke sacrificial victims and the
                  Crucifixion. The role of Giles is also not entirely clear, as the hunter figure is
                  not Giles but a generic “sculking gunner.” Only after the passage ends are we told
                  that “This task had Giles, in fields remote from home” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 125). As there is no information about Giles’s feelings, it is not
                  easy to know if he is just indifferent, or if he is a reluctant collaborator in
                  this slaughter. Interestingly, the next day he is given a similar “care,” this
                  time to deter “prowling Reynard” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 158, another
                  “pilferer,” and the first of numerous murderous predators in the poem) by
                  stringing up dead hens: <quote>

                     </quote> Like the crow-killing, this scene evokes a contemporary political
                  landscape of terror: in the troubles in Ireland, for example, victims were
                  routinely tarred and “feather’d,” but the latter trope could also evoke the mass
                  executions of women or aristocrats in France. The crow-slaying incidents also
                  share a common theme: the severest punishment is meted out to those who “plunder”
                  and give nothing in return; or, put another way, terror is a justified defense
                  against an implacable external threat. But the most intriguing interpretation is
                  to read the scenes as an exploration of Bloomfield’s “poetical welfare,”<note place="foot" resp="author">A phrase used in letter 16, to George
                     Bloomfield, 8 September-6 October 1799.</note> in which case we can posit that
                  Bloomfield has internalized and redeployed the rhetoric of terror in order to
                  defend his own vocation (the rural poet) against the threat of invasion and
                  expropriation by “plunderers”—in psycho-biographical terms, this could be anyone
                  who steals his “seed” and ruins his “harvest.” If we assume that the
                  laboring-class poet is by definition a culturally insecure subject position,<note place="foot" resp="author">For Hazlitt, Bloomfield’s Muse had “something
                     not only rustic, but menial in her aspect. He seems afraid of elevating nature,
                     lest she should be afraid of him” (145). Coleridge wrote to Southey in 1803
                     that “Blomfield [sic] is the Farmer’s Boy, not a Poet—in the mind of the
                     Public” (cited in McEathron, <title level="a">Wordsworth</title> 11).</note> it
                  is possible that these scenes function as fantasies of pre-emptive retaliation, as
                  if Bloomfield is attempting to expel all “threats” from the poetic landscape. This
                  interpretation gains weight from the fact that the crow-killing scene was almost
                  certainly the first part of <title level="m">FB</title> to be written. In a letter
                  to George written in September 1798, Bloomfield revealed: <quote>The parts of the
                     poem first composed, before any thought was entertained of going through with
                     the Seasons, were the morning scene in Spring, beginning “This task had
                        <emph>Giles</emph>,” and the description of the lambs at play. And if it be
                     lawful for an author to tell his opinion, they have never lost an inch of
                     ground in my estimation from that day to this.<note place="foot" resp="author">Letter 10, 16 September 1798.</note>
                     </quote> Tellingly, this information also reveals that the other foundational
                  scene of <title level="m">FB</title> was the “lambs at play,” a euphemism for the
                  scene of slaughter which concludes <title level="m">Spring</title>. This
                  information makes clear that the poem’s origins lay not in rural nostalgia but in
                  one of the georgic’s most disturbing conventions, the anthropomorphized slaughter
                  of animals. In psychic terms, the two scenes record Bloomfield’s failure to
                  protect his imaginative landscape from catastrophic violation.</p>
                  <p>There is also an intriguing coda to this analysis of the allegorical density of
                  the crow-slaying scene in <title level="m">Spring</title>. The spectacle of the
                  slaughtered birds prompted Lofft to spring paratextually to their defense. In one
                  of his editorial notes, he expressed his regret that Bloomfield had not given a
                  “stay of execution” to the birds. For Lofft (drawing on Bewick), the crow is a
                  “very beautiful and very sensible Bird” which deserves “not only mercy, but
                     <emph>protection</emph> and <emph>encouragement</emph>.” To prove his point,
                  Lofft reveals that he has in his care two crows that were lamed in a storm. Both
                  birds have become domesticated, but one bird is yet more remarkable, since
                  although enjoying his natural liberty completely, he recognizes, even in his
                  flights at a distance from the house, his adoptive home, his human friends, and
                  early protectors. (<title level="m">1805</title> 103)</p>
                  <p>The camouflaged meaning in this anecdote is not difficult to uncover: the story of
                  Lofft’s tamed and grateful crow is clearly designed to extol the virtues of
                  patronage and enlightened “care.” Lofft’s re-allegorizing of Bloomfield’s scene
                  functions itself like a “sculking gun.” Not only does it attempt to intervene in
                  the poem and regulate the imaginative terrain; it also surreptitiously accuses
                  Bloomfield of exceeding the poetic “liberty” of his “adoptive home” and offending
                  his “early protectors.” </p>
                  <p>But even if Bloomfield had taken Lofft’s advice, it is doubtful that the “stay of
                  execution” would have lasted long. From its inception, <title level="m">FB</title>
                  gave Bloomfield the creative means to explore and confront fears and terrors, not
                  to avoid or repress them. The poem is structured like a series of seismic tremors
                  followed by a temporary periods of “pastoral” calm. To some extent this pattern
                  follows the model of Thomson, but the much shorter length of <title level="m">FB</title> makes the eruptions of painful and disturbing material into the
                  text more intense and disruptive. One way in which the poem tries to keep control
                  of these ructions is, as already noted, by displacing them onto animals (Perkins
                  105-6), but as we have seen, the anthropomorphizing imagination which is released
                  by this maneuver quickly exceeds its original georgic purpose. Consider, for
                  example, the fate of “Poor, patient Ball” (<title level="m">S</title> 207), the
                  docile workhorse whose lost tail implies emasculation. His “short-clipt remnant of
                  a tail” has reduced him to “A moving mockery, a useless name” (<title level="m">S</title> 210-11) who is defenseless against blood-sucking flies. An
                  allegorized psycho-biographical reading of this image could suggest an attempt to
                  vent feelings of abjection, disempowerment, and dependency: a series of
                  displacements could take us from “poor” Ball to Giles the “Gibeonite” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 223) to Bloomfield’s more elevated insecurities about
                  status. This chain of association also links to that other, more spectacular
                  “moving mockery” of the poem, the withering account of the decline in the quality
                  of Giles’s locally produced cheese, a decline explained in terms of the dominance
                  of the London market. As the cheese is transported to the “ever-craving mart” of
                  the “huge Metropolis” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 237-8)—the same route, of
                  course, undertaken by Bloomfield in 1781—it is met by “derision and reproach”
                     (<title level="m">Sp</title> 253). The cheese is so hard and dry that it
                  resembles unflattering wooden objects, a “post” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 256),
                  or “the oaken shelf whereon ’tis laid” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 259); and in a
                  final stab of unpalatable phallic humor, it is “Too big to swallow, and too hard
                  to bite” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 262). This brilliant, satirical imagining of
                  commodification displaces the social impotence of rural labor onto the desiccated,
                  devitalized products of that labor which are “mockeries” of masculine prowess and
                  dignity. The importance of this phallic and totemic motif for Bloomfield can be
                  seen in the fact that problematic and over-determined wooden objects are the focus
                  of his two most autobiographical poems <title level="a">To a Spindle</title> and
                     <title level="a">To my Old Oak Table.</title> The motif also reappears in the
                  aptly entitled <title level="a">The Broken Crutch,</title> a poem which, as the
                  title suggests, expresses the frustrated rebelliousness of the rural lower
                     classes.<note place="end" resp="author">The motif also recurs in Bloomfield’s warning
                     to other laboring-class writers to not throw away “the honourable staff of
                     mechanic independence” for the “untried and brittle support” of patrons (<title level="m">1827</title> xii).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same disdain for servility and docility can be seen in the strange episode of
                  the two cruelly treated horses in <title level="m">Winter</title> (154-213). This
                  anecdote is meant to prove the virtues of “duty” and obedient labor, but the
                  argument relies on a brutal comparison between rural and urban exploitation.
                  Whereas “Short-sighted Dobbin” (<title level="m">W</title> 159) suffers mere
                  drudgery and cannot see (understandably) that “Thy chains were freedom, and thy
                  toils repose” (<title level="m">W</title> 162), his urban counterpart the
                  post-horse is callously and horrifically mistreated: “His piece-meal murderers
                  wear his life away” (<title level="m">W</title> 198). Though an anthropomorphic
                  reading of this scene reinforces the perceived “anti-urban” bias of the poem
                  (Lawson 88), the advantages of rural labor are hardly legion, as Dobbin still
                  “wear[s] the clinking chain” (<title level="m">W</title> 158).<note place="foot" resp="author">William J. Christmas regards the deflected
                     “revolutionary implications” of animal rights scenes in the poem as a way to
                     ensure that “explicit references” to politics would not “derail” Bloomfield’s
                     “first major entrance into literary culture” (“<title level="m">The Farmer’s
                        Boy</title>” 39). If this was the case, it simply reinforces my point that
                     the early readers of <title level="m">FB</title> seemed to be wilfully naïve
                     and ready to overlook the many indirect ways in which the poem evoked a culture
                     of terror and paranoia.</note> Moreover, the violent condemnation of urban
                  culture raises again the vexed question of Bloomfield’s own relation to his
                  formative years in the metropolis. Bloomfield’s urban identity is almost entirely
                  suppressed in his poetry, as if he could only imagine himself as the rural poet of
                  his own legend, but one way to interpret <title level="m">FB</title>’s
                  disturbances is in terms of his anxious and self-questioning urban self—the
                  autodidact poet, the artisan and the father—forcing its way into the text in
                  various disguises.</p>
                  <p>Take, for example, the poem’s most sustained full-frontal assault on modernity:
                  this is the passage at the end of <title level="m">Summer</title> which makes a
                  Cobbett-like attack on the gentrification of farming. The first point to note
                  about this tirade is that it focuses on the changed role of the farmer: formerly a
                  “good old Master” who shook his workers’ hands, he is now a collaborator with the
                  “new grandeur” (<title level="m">S</title> 348). In one sense, then, the farmer
                  resembles a compromised patron who has sold his soul to “Bold innovations” (<title level="m">S</title> 384) that “bear no peace beneath their showy dress” (<title level="m">S</title> 385). The sartorial metaphor signifies the farmer’s
                  betrayal of his roots and responsibilities, but behind the farmer is the more
                  general paradigm of social mobility, that anxious move from “humble industry”
                     (<title level="m">S</title> 354) to the “hated face” of “refinement” (<title level="m">S</title> 338). The awkward allegorical question raised by this
                  interjection, therefore, is the extent to which the successful laboring-class
                  poet—who by definition will almost certainly become socially or culturally
                  mobile—can retain an authentic self-identity without selling out to “tyrant
                  customs” (<title level="m">S</title> 335). Bloomfield’s solution to the problem
                  (which, as he was writing the poem, could only be in anticipation) is twofold: to
                  avoid self-incrimination, he displaces the offense onto the farmer; he also
                  polarizes bourgeois “refinement” and “humble” rural life, leaving nothing in
                  between, but in order to do this he has to invent an anonymous and ghostly
                  “mourner” for the lost organic society. This figure acts as a useful
                  pseudo-autobiographical device, enabling Bloomfield to present the most militant
                  “rural” version of himself in the poem: <quote>

                     </quote> Clearly, this cannot be the actual Bloomfield of 1798, who had lived in
                  London for seventeen years. What seems to be the poem’s most autobiographical
                  intervention is, significantly, an adopted voice, albeit a more elevated persona
                  than the inarticulate Giles: “Let labour have its due; then peace is mine” (<title level="m">S</title> 399). Perhaps this is Bloomfield’s fantasy of the person he
                  might have become if he had stayed in the countryside, but the statement of
                  solidarity with rural labour relies on the effacing of the real, “refined”
                  Bloomfield whose quest for peace was a complex social, intellectual, and cultural
                     affair.<note place="foot" resp="author">Bloomfield remained uneasy about
                     his role as the noble savage or peasant genius: “And this is no small privilege
                     to a man swung at arm’s length into publicity with all his mechanical habits
                     and embarrassments about him. How far such habits are, or ought to be,
                     overcome, is a question upon which I have not decided: but I have been
                     sometimes hurt, or amused, at witnessing the evident disappointment of such
                     persons as appeared to expect in the writer of pastoral poetry, and literally a
                     cow-boy, the brilliancy and the vivacity of polished conversation; to which I
                     never had made the slightest pretences” (<title level="m">1827</title>
                     iii).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, Bloomfield’s quest to find existential “peace” by confronting the demons
                  of his imagination explains the presence of three seemingly gratuitous episodes in
                  the poem: the mad girl Ann, the marooned Giles (both in <title level="m">Autumn</title>), and the poem’s climactic scene of terror, the apparition in
                     <title level="m">Winter</title>. Perhaps based on similar figures in Cowper and
                  Goldsmith, Ann (originally named Poll) is the most troubled figure in the poem:
                  “her peace was gone” (<title level="m">A</title> 115) and “Terror and Joy
                  alternate rul’d her hours” (<title level="m">A</title> 121). She could be a fallen
                  woman, though there is less evidence for this than in Wordsworth’s <title level="a">The Thorn.</title> What is clear is that she has suffered arrested
                  development and has become an exile from normal social life. As a “lost child”
                  mourned by her “afflicted parents” (<title level="m">A</title> 128), she is the
                  poem’s most spectacular orphan, detached not only from family life but also from
                  rural culture: “Inverted customs yield her sullen joy”(<title level="m">A</title>
                  130). Ann is a travesty of the organic community, preferring to sleep with pigs
                  than in the “cot’s warm walls” (<title level="m">A</title> 137). She is a blot on
                  the rural landscape, a constant reminder of social and psychological breakdown.
                  But having raised a ghost who threatens the stability of pastoral conventions,
                  Bloomfield has to rebuild those same defenses: his antidote to the mad Ann is to
                  invoke a sentimental stereotype of the humble cottage which restores the Burkean
                  virtues of family life: “Inestimable sweets of social peace!” (<title level="m">A</title> 176). With this reassurance in place, the poet is able to learn the
                  correct lesson from Ann’s tragic story, “Let peace ne’er leave me, nor my heart
                  grow cold” (<title level="m">A</title> 179).<note place="foot" resp="author">In a note added to the Preface to the 1809 edition of his poems,
                     Bloomfield finally laid Ann’s ghost to rest, claiming that he had met her on a
                     visit to Honington in 1800 and “found her greatly recovered, and sensible of
                     her past calamity” (cited in Goodridge and Lucas’s 1998 edition, 132n.).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the peace does not last long, as the very next scene is also about isolation,
                  abandonment and deep inner suffering. When Giles is given an extremely lonely job
                  guarding the crops against birds, his misery is made keener when his friends fail
                  to come and visit him. This neglect deepens the gloomy mood of alienation and
                  entrapment: “If fields are prisons, where is Liberty?” (<title level="m">A</title>
                  226). Moreover, the narrator insists, a broken promise is worse than no promise at
                  all. The breakdown of sociability leaves Giles with one option, to seek
                  consolation in the nostalgic past: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> As the retreat into the consolations of “past joys” collapses, the
                  normally compliant Giles becomes a figure of seething discontent and resentment.
                  It is hard not to see this scene as yet further circumstantial evidence of a
                  “rankling injury” of neglect and abandonment under which Bloomfield labored.</p>
                  <p>But the culmination of the poem’s engagement with terror is the appearance of the
                  “grisly Spectre” in <title level="m">Winter</title>. This scene is preceded by
                  several violent incidents, notably the “piece-meal” murder of the post-horse and
                  the treacherous nocturnal raids of the mastiff—“A pattern of fidelity by day, / By
                  night a murderer, lurking for his prey” (<title level="m">W</title> 223-4). The
                  mastiff’s victims are “peaceful sheep” (<title level="m">W</title> 226) and their
                  “reeking blood” (<title level="m">W</title> 228) evokes the slaughter at the end
                  of <title level="m">Spring</title>, as if the “reeking” legacy of that scene has
                  to be resolved before <title level="m">FB</title> can end. This closure is sought
                  through several restagings of the problem of failed guardianship. The tone is set
                  by the change of the mastiff from a “midnight Chieftain . . . / Beneath whose
                  guardianship all hearts rejoice” (<title level="m">W</title> 214-15) into a
                  creature which “will from the path of duty err” (<title level="m">W</title> 222).
                  This pattern of lost trust is repeated in the next episode in the poem, in which
                  Giles has to protect his “little flock” against such “nightly terrors” as the
                  mastiff (<title level="m">W</title> 239-40). As Giles wanders through the moonlit
                  fields, his “loos’d imagination” (<title level="m">W</title> 265) compares the
                  nocturnal clouds to a “beauteous ’semblance of a Flock at rest” (<title level="m">W</title> 260), but this sublimation of the poem’s central symbol of
                  “spotless” innocence is actually a guilty indulgence: “neglected Duty calls; / At
                  once from plains of light to earth he falls” (<title level="m">W</title> 267-8).
                  Recalled from poetry to pastoral duty, Giles finds himself in a “narrow lane”
                     (<title level="m">W</title> 269) which is uncannily both familiar and strange.
                  Temporarily disorientated by his flight of poetic fancy, Giles suddenly finds
                  himself face to face with a “grisly Spectre, cloth’d in silver grey” (<title level="m">W</title> 273). Giles’s response to the apparition is interesting:
                  rather than fleeing, he shows a determination to face down the ghost and prove
                  that it is nothing less than another figment of his imagination. Before he can
                  exorcise the phantom, however, he has to absolve himself of guilt: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> With his “conscious Innocence” (<title level="m">W</title> 312) in place,
                  Giles identifies the “motionless deformity” (<title level="m">W</title> 292) of
                  the shape as nothing more than an optical illusion, the visual tricks played by
                  bright moonlight on an “aged” ash tree. Far from being a threat, the tree is
                  actually a symbol of order and reparation: “Its perfect lineaments at once appear,
                  / Its crown of shiv’ring ivy whispering peace” (<title level="m">W</title> 306-7).
                  This symbolic reversal is not only a victory over stereotypical rustic
                     superstition,<note place="foot" resp="author">See, for example, Richard
                     Newton’s caricatures <title level="m">An Hobgoblin</title> (1792), and <title level="m">Terror or Fright</title> (1800).</note> it also represents an
                  allegorical victory for the poem. By banishing the specter, Giles has acquired new
                  psychic parents, “loit’ring Reason” and “Truth” (<title level="m">W</title> 316).
                  These are the “blest guardians” (<title level="m">W</title> 317) who will
                  “tranquillize his breast” (<title level="m">W</title> 319) and fulfill the promise
                  of <title level="m">Summer</title> when, temporarily, “Peace o’er his slumbers
                  wave[d] her guardian wing” (<title level="m">S</title> 109).<note place="foot" resp="author">Scott McEathron notes that a “yearning for peace” is

                  if all terrors have finally been expelled from the poem, the stage is now set for
                  a final reenactment of virtuous guardianship in the re-fleecing of the orphan
                  lambs. Yet, as discussed earlier, this festive resolution relies on two unstable
                  textual devices: the “Dam” who is “cheated into tenderness,” and the amnesiac
                  rechristening of the poem as a series of “Delightful moments!”</p>

                  <p>Though based on psycho-biographical speculation, I hope this essay has begun, in
                  the words of a closing phrase from the poem which was deleted on Lofft’s advice,
                  to “pierce the dark wood” of Bloomfield’s imagination.<note place="foot" resp="author">This was the original version of line 390 of <title level="m">Autumn</title> (Goodridge and Lucas 2007). As White notes, the “unsettling

                     <title level="m">FB</title> remains the most symptomatic and auspicious text
                  for this exploration, the story does not end there. In the limited space
                  remaining, I want to offer brief readings of some of Bloomfield’s subsequent works
                  through the same allegorical lens of terror, trauma, and insecurity.</p>
                  <p>The failure of <title level="m">FB</title> to exorcise Bloomfield’s personal
                  terrors is vividly evident in a letter written to George in 1801. Plagued by ill
                  health and depression, Bloomfield reveals that “I tried to sooth my pain with
                  poetry, to exert myself forcibly, and to conquer by a <foreign>coup de
                     main</foreign>, the imaginary evils that beset me, for imaginary they certainly
                  were in a great degree.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Letter 55, 27
                     August 1801.</note> With this hauntology in mind, the next text which invites
                  interpretation is <title level="a">The Fakenham Ghost,</title> a comic ballad
                  about a rustic woman who, while returning home one night, mistakes a lost ass’s
                  foal for a phantom. The poem was published in Bloomfield’s second collection
                     <title level="m">Rural Tales, Ballads and Songs</title> (1802), and an
                  introductory note states that the incident is a local legend and “is still related
                  by my Mother.”<note place="foot" resp="author">I have used the text in
                     Goodridge and Lucas’s 1998 edition. Line numbers are in parentheses after the
                     quotation.</note> Given that the story takes place in Euston Park, the country
                  seat of Bloomfield’s patron the Duke of Grafton, there seems little reason, on
                  first inspection, not to take Bloomfield at his word. However, once we place the
                  poem in the context of Bloomfield’s continuing “imaginary evils,” a darker,
                  richer, and multilayered text emerges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">The Fakenham Ghost</title> is much more than a lightweight piece
                  of Suffolk literary lore. Its plot conspicuously reworks the two major episodes
                  which conclude <title level="m">FB</title>, an encounter between a terrified
                  rustic and a specter and a healing act of animal adoption. In the reconfigured
                  psychic landscape of trauma and reparation of the later poem, there are three
                  important changes of setting and personae. First, the role of Giles is replaced by
                  “an ancient Dame” (5); second, the “Monster” is not a tree but an “<emph>Ass’s
                     Foal</emph>” which has “lost its Dam” (61); third, the location is Euston Park
                  not Sapiston. These revisions can yield all kinds of fascinating
                  psycho-biographical results. For example, if we see the “ancient Dame” as a
                  surrogate mother figure—and as the introductory note makes clear, Bloomfield’s
                  mother is one of the keepers of the tale—then it is possible to conclude that the
                  poem is a form of symbolic castigation. As “darker fears / Came o’er her troubled
                  mind” (21-2) she “own’d her sins, and down she knelt” (39). The “trotting ghost”
                  (31) which stalks her is not only her own conscience but Bloomfield’s “troubled
                  mind” pursuing its psychic prey (with the slightly comic word “trotting” connoting
                  the ballad meter which is serving as the instrument of the pursuit). The comic
                  resolution of the plot is of course one way to discharge all this painful
                  material, and there could be a hint of self-mockery in the transformation of the
                  “imp of sin” (65) into an orphaned ass’s foal. The adoption of this “shaggy
                  stranger” (67) by the Dame is in some ways a more satisfactory resolution than the
                  end of <title level="m">FB</title>, as the mother is actually human, but on the
                  other hand the assimilation remains a “joke” (76) and the “favourite” is still
                  called a “Ghost” (73).</p>
                  <p>The relocation of the action to Euston Park is also interesting, as it signifies
                  Grafton’s new role as Bloomfield’s patron. If, at some unconscious level,
                  Bloomfield is the “shaggy stranger,” then it is ultimately Grafton who “kept the
                  joke alive” (76). But there is another ghost haunting this landscape. Buried away
                  in Bloomfield’s memory is another diabolical trespasser in Fakenham Wood. In one
                  of the <title level="a">Anecdotes and Observations</title> which were published in
                  the second volume of <title level="m">Remains</title>, Bloomfield recalls being
                  told that the young Thomas Paine and his sister once wandered into these same
                     woods.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        <title level="m">Remains</title>
                     2: 85-6.</note> As Bloomfield notes wryly, “I had the misfortune to be born
                  only six miles from the birthplace of Tom Paine!! This, to some ears would be
                  horrible” (<title level="m">Remains</title> 2: 345; see also letter 354, 31 May-1
                  June 1821). As if to guard against any suggestion of Painite sympathies,
                  Bloomfield states that he heard about the incident in a roundabout way: the story
                  came from his friend Dr. Walker who was returning from Egypt (where he had just
                  given “vaccine inoculation” to troops) when he met Paine in Paris. Apparently,
                  Paine and his sister went into the wood to collect nuts, without telling their
                  parents. They became lost (“wandered out of their knowledge”), so Tom climbed a
                  tree to “see his way out of the wood” but fell and narrowly avoided serious
                  injury. Walker (as reported by Bloomfield) remarks “that there are many thousands
                  who will probably exclaim: ‘What a pity that he had not broke his neck!’” but in
                  Paris the response was different. One of Walker’s interlocutors remarks that “The
                  guardian angel of Liberty was near thee, Thomas.” In this highly mediated episode,
                  Fakenham Wood becomes nothing less that the site of a revolutionary <foreign>deus
                     ex machina</foreign> and the place where Britain’s homegrown “imp of sin” found
                  deliverance. The other “joke” of the poem is therefore its satirical
                  allegorization of counter-revolutionary hysteria and the pacification of
                  Jacobinism, and it is worth noting that 1802 was the year when invasion fears and
                  loyalist mobilization reached their peak. Hence the poem’s ending could contain a
                  covert allusion to ongoing political repression: <quote>

                     </quote> In the spirit of that playful but penetrating word “conviction,” I want
                  to suggest that <title level="a">The Fakenham Ghost</title> is a highly spun fable
                  of terror and salvation in which the symbolic aim is to reunify the body politic
                  and inoculate the poet and the reader against the Pain(e) of the traumatic loss of
                  the mother (country).</p>
                  <p>Yet this incursion of a suppressed revolutionary narrative into a seemingly
                  artless ballad shows that Bloomfield’s “rural” themes remained infected with the
                  discourse of terror and the burdens of a troubled consciousness. It is revealing
                  that Paine’s “fall” entered <title level="a">The Fakenham Ghost</title> through
                  the agency of a physician who administered “vaccine inoculation” to the army, as
                  if immunization symbolized both a medical and ideological barrier against
                     contamination.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Roland Barthes on

                  the integrity of both the organic community and pastoral poetry. Inoculation
                  represents both the “emancipation of the human race” (18) and “private peace”
                  (35); it banishes painful memories of loss and achieves a perfect victory
                  “unstain’d with gore” (36), the ideal theme for “the glory of the pastoral reed”
                     (36).<note place="foot" resp="author">See Fulford and Lee for a detailed

                  The common thread which runs through nearly all of Bloomfield’s post-<title level="m">FB</title> poems is the family romance: the loss and recovery of
                  actual or surrogate family members. Looked at superficially, there is nothing
                  surprising about finding this traditional theme in collections of rural verse with
                  titles such as <title level="m">Wild Flowers</title> (1806) and <title level="m">May Day with the Muses</title> (1822), but for Bloomfield the family romance
                  was an aesthetic and psychic space in which he could revisit and re-stage his
                  “boyage” from childhood separation to the ambiguous rewards of patronage. The most
                  symptomatic text in this context is probably <title level="a">The Broken
                     Crutch</title> (1806),<note place="foot" resp="author">I have used the
                     text in Goodridge and Lucas’s 1998 edition.</note> a poem which seems to
                  strenuously undermine itself. The story shows the humiliation of a “plebeian” man
                  who mistakenly tries to defend the honor of his niece against a landowner he
                  mistakenly perceives to be predatory: the “broken crutch” of the title is a symbol
                  of emasculation which converts popular protest into another “joke” and idealizes
                  the paternalist virtues of the niece’s suitor. Yet this victory (“unstain’d with
                  gore”) sits uneasily with an angry interjection in which the poet denounces the
                  “murderous axe” of enclosure (57-78), leaving the reader unsure about the poem’s
                  loyalties. Similarly, it is hard to know if Sir Ambrose Higham, the patron of
                     <title level="m">May Day with the Muses</title>, is a figure of unconditional
                  praise (which seems to be the prevailing critical opinion) or “sculking”
                  resentments. Given that Bloomfield wrote this last collection of poems in poverty
                  and “a wretched state of health,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Robert

                  a “monarch of his own paternal ground” (15) asking his tenants to “pay their rents

                     Introduction 47. </note> If my argument has been at all persuasive, the obvious
                  next step is to extend this allegorical and psycho-biographical approach to the
                  wider laboring-class tradition. What could emerge from such work is a new
                  aesthetics of laboring-class writing which does full justice to the unique “mental
                  pains” of the plebeian author, and which avoids or complements the critical
                  imperative to prove or disprove explicit ideological affiliations. Laboring-class
                  writing is by definition a radical culture issue; the question which remains is
                  precisely how we configure and value the full creative range and depth of such
                  writing, and the extent to which we are prepared to confront some of our own
                  mythologies in the process.</p>
