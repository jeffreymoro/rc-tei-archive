                     “Bloomfield in His Letters: The Social World of a London Shoemaker Turned Suffolk
                     Poet”
                     </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>The publication of Bloomfield’s collected letters gives us for the first time a chance
               to see him as a writer of intimate prose—prose in which he reveals his inner feelings
               and deepest desires, prose in which he comes to understand what he stands for, as
               a poet and as a man. Bloomfield’s letters, spanning the thirty and more years of his
               adult life, let us chart his progress from London shoemaker, living in an East End
               slum, through the best-selling poet of the early 1800s, to the impoverished villager
               living in obscure retirement. But they also show the development of a mind full of
               penetrating observation of himself, his acquaintances, and the world around him, and
               the emergence of a character endowed with generous humor, quiet determination, and
               exceptional sensitivity. These qualities made Bloomfield a wonderful correspondent:
               he never concealed himself from the person to whom he was writing, always offering
               them intimacy and thoughtfulness (resembling Keats in this) and always registering
               the nuances of events with a playful perceptiveness that escapes most. As a consequence,
               he was a fascinating social commentator (although social commentary is not the chief
               element of his letters), a perspicuous critic of other poets, and a forthright maintainer
               of his beliefs about writing against the interference of patrons, well-meaning or
               brow-beating. </p>
            <p>Many themes emerge from the letters: I shall concentrate in what follows on illustrating
               those which most sharply change our understanding of the writer, of his times, and
               of the business of being a laboring-class poet. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>First, then, the letters reveal with a new vividness what remains obscure in Bloomfield’s
                  verse: that he was not a farmhand living in one of Britain’s thousands of villages.
                  Despite his self-characterization in his poems as “Giles” the “farmer’s boy,” Bloomfield
                  was, when he wrote, a Londoner working in one of the capital’s hundreds of cramped
                  workshops. He was, in fact, a member of the wave after wave of immigrants that, in
                  the late eighteenth century, flowed from the country to work in London’s burgeoning
                  trades and industries, exchanging a boyhood spent herding animals and tending crops
                  for an adolescence manufacturing items for the expanding consumer market.

                  </div> The change in circumstances this move produced is revealed by his first surviving
                  letter of 1788, in which he invites a Suffolk friend to visit him: <span class="quote">‘[W]hen you are at my lodging you must expect such treatment as is in my power to give,
                     and when we are out you must have no objection to dine at a decent Cook-shop, where
                     there is good choice, and if you dont like porter we can get good ale, in short, London
                     is like other great places, allmost any thing may be had for money and when we are
                     out, whatever the expence may be for living or for seeing the public buildings, &amp;c,
                     my scheme is, that each bear his own charges, you know how George and others of our
                     trade live, but George have the honour of living in a street, but I cannot Get into
                     a street from my lodgings without going through some such crook of a hole as between
                     your near-barn and the hay-house, but take notice you are not to lodge in such a place
                     as this, you have boath had the small-pox and I think I remember that your sister
                     Judith have had it too, here is a letter enclosed from my sister to Judith and I hope
                     to see you all soon, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful for me to mention
                     only you and your brother, the reason is, I could not procure a suitable accomodation
                     for any woman whatever, a single man have no chance to do it half so well as my sister
                     have, if you all come (as I hope you will) you and your brother must lodge near me,
                     and the street where your sister will live, lead into Berkley Square, just by where
                     my sister live, and we are about three miles apart, so you will have a good chance
                     to see the town in going backwards and forwards, I shall be allways with you and we
                     must be very particular and not be out late of night, nor frequent any low lived places,
                     and as long as we do so, there is no danger to be feard, if you consider the whole
                     expense I belive it will be found a cheap way of seeing London. (letter 1, 11 April
                     1788)’</span> Bloomfield’s description reminds us of Blake’s “London,” or Wordsworth’s <em>Prelude</em> description of “Private courts, / Gloomy as coffins, and unsightly lanes / Thrilled
                  by some female vendor’s scream, belike / The very shrillest of all London cries” (1805,
                  7: 196-9). East End poverty, cramped living conditions, endemic disease, “low lived
                  places”: Bloomfield was writing from experience as one of the new class of “mechanics”
                  about which Wordsworth spoke in his preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, one of the nascent proletariat, in Marxist terms. It was this class that Wordsworth
                  diagnosed as having acquired debased cravings for stimulation as a means of escape
                  from their repetitive labor and that Marxists saw as being dosed with the opiates
                  of popular religion and mass culture. Yet Bloomfield belies the Wordsworthian and
                  the Marxist analysis: he suggests that, for first-generation migrants from country
                  to city, it was not novel forms of urban entertainment, but the recollection and celebration
                  of village community and customs, that was the goal. This is shown by a letter which
                  he wrote in 1806 about his first encounter with Italian opera: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">

                        I could only be surprize’d and astonished. I sat <span style="text-decoration: line-through">alone</span>, in the Pit, totally unknowing and unknown. Some Gentlemen behind me were extolling
                        the singular beauty of a Lady of easy Virtue who sat a few seats above us, and I excercised
                        my judgment too, (for when you <span style="text-decoration: line-through">gave</span> sent me the ticket no restriction was laid as to which way I should look,) and have
                        to tell you that of any <em>essentials</em> of beauty she had not a spark, not an atom! so much for difference of opinion. I do
                        not believe that men agree in this any more than in their palates at Table, or their
                        notions of what is beautifull in a landscape.</div><br/>

                        Theatres I have often sided so far with the Patricians as to wish the Plebeans at
                        the Devel, not because they were such, (that I leave to those who are weak enough,
                        that is, proud enough,) but merely because they would not be quiet.</div><br/> 
                     <div>I observed, according to the best of my calculation, that the petticoats of the women
                        were about ten inches longer than those of the men, one of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">them</span> the former in particular I should have been glad to have accommodated with the loan
                        of a pair of pantaloons which I had left at home, and yet it is more than a hundred
                        to one if they had pleased her;—I do not wonder in the least that Gentlemen, and ladies
                        too, should frequent a place where they can hear the finest Music, and see the most
                        surprizing agility and grace, but I am now convinced, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">too</span> that the former have an additional incentive; the exhibition of female beauty in a
                        manner, and in a way which no other place in England will warrant, and by my Soul,
                        I think this is as <em>natural</em> a feeling as any one there excited, “and further this deponent saith not.”</div><br/> 
                     <div>I have had the pleasure of witnessing the best Scenery and Dancing, and the worst
                        Lightning, in England. I saw Narcissus drown himself, (and, by the buy that same Narcissus
                        was worth going three miles to see,) I saw a very jolly and delectable looking Venus,
                        and a number of other young things whose motions indicated that they felt the want
                        of wings and were very angry indeed because they had them not. They plagued poor little
                        Cupid in a most barbarous manner, because he fell asleep after whetting his arrows,
                        on what?—on a Grindstone!</div><br/> 
                     <div>Upon the whole I frankly own that I think I should have relish’d this show much more

            </div>
            <p>Bloomfield’s village—whether the village encountered in the opera-house or that of
               his own writing—is not the agricultural world seen by a laborer who works in it: it
               is, rather, a new country—the country seen from exile by an urbanite who has nostalgic
               desires to reconstitute, in memory and on paper, the rural community he associates
               with childhood. It is family and village togetherness, imagined as innocent by comparison
               with the experienced world of urban sophistication, that Bloomfield seeks—as Wordsworth
               himself did. This suggests that it was not, as Wordsworth thought, urban life and
               labor that destroyed respect for the values and taste of the older, rural world. Rather,
               urban exile from the country produced an intense idealization of the rural just as
               Wordsworth’s continental exile did. Exile, rather than city life per se, stimulated
               the major Romantic themes of idealization of the rural and fear for its loss. For
               Bloomfield, as for Wordsworth, it was the recollection of rural society and morality
               that he had, in practice, left behind that gave him a standard against which to judge
               the novel culture available in London’s metropolitan and cosmopolitan milieu. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But he had not left it completely behind: in the early 1800s, the letters show, the
                  urban and rural poor were not discrete, mutually unknowing populations. Bloomfield’s
                  letters reveal the constant interchange between city and country-dwellers: Bloomfield’s
                  family was typical in having some siblings who worked in the city while others remained
                  in the home village—typical too in the frequent interchange between them. Letters
                  carried news, invitations, and banknotes; parcels carried pheasants, leather-samples,
                  and cheese. The foodstuffs traveled in both directions, Bloomfield taking advantage
                  of his position in Europe’s largest commercial center to send to Suffolk better rural
                  produce than could be found locally: “I send my Mother a piece of cheese such as she
                  could not get at Honington if she had money” he wrote on 30 November 1801 (letter
                  70), enclosing a Leicester cheese far superior to that of Suffolk (the best milk being
                  sent out of Suffolk to supply London’s market).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

               </p>
            </div>
            <p>People went back and forth too: Bloomfield returned to Suffolk to visit; his brothers,
               drawn to London’s commercial magnet, came to make their fortunes from music and from
               inventions, themselves returning. The laboring-classes, on the evidence of Bloomfield’s
               family, were simply not rigidly divided between shrinking rural and expanding urban
               populations: it was normal for families from the home counties to spend some of their
               lives in London, some back in the country, as did his brother George who grew up in
               Honington, worked as a shoemaker in London, and moved back to Suffolk, or his brother
               Nat, who moved from Suffolk to London, or Isaac, who lived in Suffolk but came to
               London to sell his musical settings of Robert’s poems, or Robert himself, who moved
               out of London to a Bedfordshire village in 1811. His sister Bet, meanwhile, emigrated
               to America. The Bloomfield family is revealed in Robert’s letters as being on the
               move to a degree that would have been extraordinary fifty years earlier, but nevertheless
               strenuously keeping in touch using the literacy with which their mother, a village
               schooldame, had endowed them. The causes of their peripatetic life illustrate the
               changes in rural society brought about by the combination of increased population,
               the development of “improved” capitalist agriculture, economic recessions, and a more
               centralized market economy. Brothers George and Isaac both had many children and found
               it impossible to provide for them from the proceeds of shoemaking. London, and the
               opportunity of selling poems and tunes there, offered the prospect of a way out of
               poverty.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Bloomfield’s letters show<span class="hi"> </span>his most abiding concern to have been the creation and preservation, in a more and
                  more hostile social and political climate, of village and family rootedness. While
                  he still enjoyed royalties from his poems, he used this income to try to recreate
                  rural community from the distance of London. Thus he sent his London-reared daughter
                  Hannah to Suffolk to give her experience of village life. Hannah was charged with
                  retrieving the very rocks and stones Bloomfield remembered by their local names, so
                  strong was his desire to have a bit of his boyhood about him: <span class="quote">‘I have several times intended to remind you that If your Cousins at Honington or any
                     other boys have any “Fairies Cakes,” curiously markd pebbles and will part with them

                     and some “Devel’s Toe Nails”, which are found in a field north of what was Mr Rolfs
                     Rookery, but if these are not to be had, dont stop for either. These strange names
                     make it look like a queer errand to set a young girl about, but I tell you they know
                     what I mean—I feel proud of your letters, but I would rather have your company. (Letter
                     243, 8 October 1809)’</span> Wanting his daughter to know him by reliving his own childhood, Bloomfield was excited
                  when she witnessed the harvest-home festival that was customary in the area and which
                  he had celebrated in his poem “The Horkey,” even preserving Suffolk dialect in an
                  effort “to tell the rising race of mankind” of the customs “going fast out of use”

                  </blockquote> Bloomfield’s letter on the subject is full of quiet satisfaction at rural life experienced
                  vicariously at the consequent reunion of his family: <span class="quote">‘My eldest Daughter has just return’d from an eight weeks residence in Suffolk at the
                     very Farm that employ’d me in my childhood. She has seen the Harvest, and was present
                     at the “Horkey” and with many of the persons who figured there thirty years ago when
                     I was 13 years old. There is a fund of gossip cut out for me during the winter coming.
                     She return’d on the 24<sup>th</sup>, the next day you may recollect is sacred to our <em>Leather Saint,</em> and is besides her birthday. It was a high holiday in London as a Jubilee, and to
                     crown it all my brother’s family postponed on her account the celebration of a Christning.
                     Thus, by having a family meeting we beat all the Doctors for we killd more than two
                     birds with one stone. (letter 245, 31 October 1809)’</span> Here rural, trade, and family celebrations coincide: in Honington Hannah participates
                  in the horkey; in London Robert celebrates St. Crispin’s day with other cordwainers;
                  also in London brother Nat’s family bring the Bloomfields together for a party. The
                  reality behind such rural poems as “The Horkey,” is a family straddling city and country
                  and occupying the social habitus of each.</p>
            </div>
            <p>It was a brief moment. Dispersed across town and village, the Bloomfields were rarely
               able to, in his words, “kill more than two birds with one stone.” The letters show
               Bloomfield instead, like Wordsworth, attempting to repossess his rural childhood home.
               He did this by using the wealth poetry brought him to buy the cottage his mother had
               rented, letting his relatives live there. This scheme made little economic sense:
               what drove Bloomfield was the emotional pull of his home village and his need for
               a family togetherness he had lost when sent away to London as a youth. This need was
               not met: after his mother’s death Bloomfield found, predictably, that the house made
               him an absentee landlord, embroiled in legal disputes with once-friendly neighbors
               over rights to the garden and charged with ever-mounting repair bills while his resident
               relatives seemed ungrateful or begged for more financial help. Eventually, as relations
               soured under the pressure of the financial strain Bloomfield suffered after his booksellers’
               bankruptcy, he felt reluctant to revisit the place: he could no longer sustain its
               image as a symbol of boyhood and familial community; it now spoke of his relatives’
               expectation that he, having made money, would provide for them, of his own sadness
               that they were now his clients rather than his peers, and of his disappointment that
               he could no longer afford to maintain it.</p>
            <p>If Bloomfield could not return to Honington, he could get as near as was possible
               given the necessity of being in London to attend to his publications. Almost the first
               thing he did when the poetry began to sell was to quit the crowded East End, retire
               from shoemaking, and become one of a social class that mushroomed in this period—a
               suburbanite. The suburbs as we know them today were a phenomenon of the early nineteenth
               century, producing a tamed and domesticated simulacrum of the remembered countryside,
               leisure-time idylls of green in miniature garden-plots that were both retired and
               accessible from the city, where the suburbanites worked. The outlook of the growing
               class of people who lived like this—the clerks who, like Charles Lamb and Dickens’s
               Wemmick, worked in the increasing number of counting houses, offices, and chambers
               of the imperial and governmental city—found expression in a new kind of verse, ornamental
               and decorative, that eschewed the full-blown classicism of the epic and the large-scale
               loco-description of the georgic (both styles associated with the landowning gentry
               and aristocracy). The suburban was pretty, sentimental, bejeweled, representing the
               democratization of taste in a class that read magazines and novels rather than Latin
               and Greek poetry.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">

                  </div> was criticized as the suburban work of writers who had never known the real countryside.
                  He avoided excessive ornamentation, garden settings, and tricked-out diction—all facets
                  of Leigh Hunt’s verse that aroused the ire of traditionalist critics. Nevertheless,
                  his letters reveal that he set out to choose a home that relocated the idealized virtues
                  and pleasures of the country in miniature at the edge of the city. His cottage next
                  to the Shepherd and Shepherdess Inn on the City Road, was situated at commercial London’s
                  margin, where workhouses and almshouses ran out into smallholdings, gardens, and fields.
                  Bloomfield cultivated the garden there, and ensured his family learnt to do so too,
                  as a letter from his daughter Mary to her older sister reveals: “the first thing I
                  have to tell you,” she wrote, “is of the garden, our lobernam will not blow so much
                  as we thought it would, we have got two mugs full of butterflowers, and we have some
                  beans coming up, this is holiday work and many people are crowding by our gate” (letter
                  163, 3 June 1805). She returned to the subject a week later, “You wanted to know about
                  the garden. I first tell you the beans are growing very high, a good deal of your
                  sweet Williams is dead, and your nut tree is very well, we are going to have a crop
                  of scarlet beans over the grass plat, my father’s thistle will not thrive; Charlesis

            </div>
            <p>Bloomfield’s position on the margin gave him a double knowledge that neither East
               Enders nor Suffolk villagers possessed—a double knowledge that helped make his poetry
               unique. He used this double knowledge not just to drive his yearning to articulate
               a rural world he knew to be fragile, but also to demand realism about country and
               city. It allowed him to achieve a conscious recollection of country customs in plain,
               rustic language, before these customs were submerged by urban fashions and capitalist
               agriculture. In a letter of 2 September 1802, for instance, he criticized affected
               diction and uncolloquial word order in poetry (much like Wordsworth in the Preface
               to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>), extending his argument to cover pictorial representations of the rustic: <span class="quote">‘Something of this kind may be traced in some pictures which I have occasionally seen,
                  which indeed relates more to the foregoing wrong adaptation of words, than to compound
                  epithets—A scene extremely rustic, the Death of the Fox in a Cottage-yard would you
                  there expect to see up against the wall what in London are called Bird-bottles for
                  the sparrows to build in? Country people know sparrows too well; the same picture
                  has the error of chimney pots to the cottage, which I never saw in reality; these
                  are London and Country ideas mixed. (letter 94, 2 September 1802)’</span> Had Bloomfield not, as a youth, read the magazines available in the shoemakers’ workshop
               (but unlikely to have come his way on a Suffolk farm) he would not have learnt to
               compose verse at all. He was, in fact, in the rare position of being able to benefit
               from both city and country: his rural tales benefited from his knowledge of contemporary
               taste as set out in town-based periodicals as well as from the authenticity that stemmed
               from his early upbringing on the land.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Bloomfield’s suburban cottage was, nonetheless, a retreat from the city proper. In
                  moving to London’s fringe, he was retiring from business—from the trade of shoemaking
                  and from the incessant visitors who, keen to view the phenomenon of a laboring-class
                  poet, had troubled him in his cheap lodgings. From the edge of London, he could supervise
                  his works through the press and call on his literary acquaintances, without becoming
                  a celebrity and having to appear on demand for any gentleman who wished to satisfy
                  his curiosity and advise him what to read. The suburbs for Bloomfield—and here he
                  was proleptic of the phenomenon Dickens fictionalized in Wemmick—were a daily retreat
                  from an urban intercourse from which he could not altogether withdraw, an intercourse
                  he found inimical not just for its crowdedness (although certainly for that) but also
                  for the demeaning of human relationships by the pressures of market-driven work-discipline.
                  Matters came to a head when the Duke of Grafton, his Suffolk patron, found him a job
                  in the busy Seal Office, sealing legal contracts and charters (in a form of tax collection).
                  Bloomfield’s letter on the subject (to his brother George, 29 February 1803)—a cry
                  of desperation—reads as if written by the narrator of Blake’s “London” imprisoned
                  by “each chartered street,” for it highlights the mental toll taken by the binding
                  of self to bureaucratic and commercial institutions—the lack of privacy and self-command,
                  the need to prepare a public face, the slavery to the new discipline of clock-time
                  and office-hours, the reduction of human interaction to overworked clerk and demanding
                  client: <span class="quote">‘On Friday, the day after the Holidays, I expected a busy day at the Seal Office; and
                     so I found it with a vengeance. I had eat no breakfast, and the Mob of Lawyers made
                     me perfectly savage: at One o’clock we shut the Office, but shut in between 40 and
                     50 people, and did not get through the Work for 3 quarters of an hour after one. I
                     then grew faint, and knew if I walkd home to the City Road that my Wind and indigestion

                  the East India Company; for Bloomfield less than a mile away at Temple Bar, the situation
                  was exacerbated by his dislike of being a celebrity and having his private feelings
                  and actions tattled about in the London and Suffolk newspapers and his name used by
                  quack doctors in their advertisements.</p>

               <p>Beyond the suburbs lay solace in the hills. When depressed by the city’s demands,
                  Bloomfield took to making solitary walking tours, refreshing himself with a leisured
                  consumption of nature in which he was, for a few days, his own master, his time and
                  space his own. These tours were a reaction against his lack of a stable place in which
                  independence, self-respect, and rural community could be sustained, when even the
                  suburban retreat on the City Road became prey to the pressure of business and when
                  his boyhood home in Honington seemed polluted by disputes with family and patron.
                  So Bloomfield went to Dover and to Dorking, recording his trips in intimate and informal
                  letters that bear comparison with Coleridge’s descriptions of his 1802 walking tour
                  in the Lakes and with Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals. They represent, that is to say,
                  a new kind of tour-journalism reflecting a new social practice: the pedestrian tour
                  was the creation of a class of writers (Romantics, as they were later called) who,
                  dissociating themselves from gentleman and women tourists for reasons of poverty and
                  politics, eschewed the horse and carriage and asserted their liberty and independence
                  as solitary wanderers in nature.

                  </div> Like Wordsworth, Bloomfield was an urbanite visiting countryside places he felt emotionally
                  connected to by virtue of his rural upbringing but in which he had no present-day
                  social or economic place. Like Coleridge, he was self-conscious of this anomalous
                  status and was ready to record the funny side of being out of place wherever he visited.
                  As such he was an unwitting pioneer of a practice of nature recreation and nature
                  writing that became, and remains, one of the main pursuits of Britain’s suburban masses—a
                  practice of countryside rambling that still has its dedicated organizations and magazines.
                  The description he made of his Surrey tour in 1803, for instance, has the features
                  we have come to see as familiar to the genre—unexpected adventures, hill country,
                  romantic views, and assertions about nature’s restorative powers:

                        of inhabitants for my fancy. Epsom is a pretty little town and the country round it
                        open and flat; but 3 or four miles beyond it assumes a quite different aspect, becoming
                        more hilly than I had ever before seen. Remember that I am no Welshman, therefore

                        about 8 or ten Fir Trees which are very conspicuous at a great distance; this Hill
                        the inhabitants denominate with no small share of pride “Dorking’s Glory.” It affords
                        certainly a most delightfull view on every side; here I could discover that had I

                  </blockquote> Bread and cheese was to be Bloomfield’s dinner increasingly in later years. After <em>Wild Flowers </em>(1806) his output declined and sales of his publications tailed off. In 1812 his booksellers
                  went bankrupt, depriving him of his income. Much money went to supporting relatives
                  and as donations made by his wife to the prophetess Joanna Southcott. In 1811 he moved
                  from the City Road to the Bedfordshire village of Shefford, seeking to reduce his
                  expenses and to rediscover the placedness in village life that he recalled in his
                  Suffolk youth—a placedness impossible for him to reconstitute in Suffolk because that
                  place had become vitiated by disputes. Some of his early letters from Shefford revel
                  in finding it there instead. In July 1814, for instance, he sent his daughter Hannah
                  (2-3 July 1814) a description of the village celebration of Napoleon’s defeat that
                  is a comic masterpiece, Dickensian in its celebratory yet humorous portrait of village
                  life as a teeming cavalcade in which all are united in sensual enjoyment.

                  </blockquote> Here Bloomfield’s evocation plays upon the shared knowledge he and Hannah, his daughter
                  and correspondent, have of the people involved. If there is an occasional touch of
                  sentimentality, this is because Bloomfield has a lot invested in his own and his family’s
                  incorporation in the rural community. As the comparisons with London’s Vauxhall Gardens
                  suggest, metropolitan entertainment remains a reference point: the country is engaged
                  with and judged against the city. The country festival—the social expression of that
                  community—and his description—its literary realization—dramatize the incorporation
                  of incomers from London: they show the Bloomfields are at home, accepted in the village
                  where the traditions of rural Englishness still flourish. Quietly in play in the letter
                  is a self-consciousness about national identity: to be English, Bloomfield suggests,
                  is to appreciate and participate in such bucolic communal pleasures. Hogarth’s “March
                  of the Guards to Finchley,” Hone’s <em>Every Day Book</em>, and Cobbett’s <em>Rural Rides</em> present a similar comic vision of national character, in which ale-drinking figures
                  loom large. As a small farmer, Cobbett would organize traditional rural sports on
                  the village green, seeking to renew traditional English customs in which all rural
                  classes participated, as a counterweight to the increasing class hostility between
                  landlords and farmers on the one side and their laborers on the other.

               <p>Things changed after 1815. The depressions experienced nationwide by a newly centralized
                  economy left Bloomfield and his family dependent on charity and poor relief, as they
                  did so many others. Their era of mobility ended by poverty, Shefford became a place
                  that Bloomfield often could not afford to leave: he stayed there isolated by ill-health
                  and depression. Likewise his brother George became trapped in Suffolk, as is revealed
                  in a late autobiographical letter sent by George some years after Robert died (to
                  W. Weston, circa 1830). George’s response to his pauperdom is Uriah Heepish humility
                  towards the gentlemen who gave him charity. His anger at the poverty he movingly describes

            <div>(See also Peter Denney’s comments on these exchanges.)</div><br/><p>Letters of the Lloyd Baker kind are grim evidence of the ideological strife of post-war
               Britain: they place in stark illumination the repression by which the ruling classes
               maintained their grip on power, all the while fearing revolution. Bloomfield remembered
               the disinterested patronage of the old Duke of Grafton, Prime Minister in an earlier
               era, who had supported him as a fellow Suffolk man without ever expecting political
               or religious conformity to his views, or even public praise of his beneficence. He
               knew he was living through a reactionary era, in which the classes were polarized,
               and his public response was to create, in his final collection of poems <em>May Day with the Muses</em> (1822), an ideal scenario in which, to celebrate the traditional May Day festivities,
               a squire invites the villagers to recite poems about village life. The squire thus
               renews old customs and patronizes, in the best sense, rustics who are able to voice
               their rural experience as verse. Clearly, this is wish-fulfillment on Bloomfield’s
               part: not only does he imagine that to be a rural poet is to be a cherished villager
               and vice versa, but also that poetry is a face-to-face oral activity of a united community.
               The benevolent squire, moreover, respects tradition and exacts no political toll for
               his benevolence, which he in fact regards as his duty. Meanwhile, the individual poems
               that the villagers recite also tell of a traditional community in which authority
               is vested in a single figure who can therefore be addressed, appealed to, and even,
               potentially, rebuked and chastised face to face. In the earlier verse-tale “The Broken
               Crutch,” Bloomfield had contemplated the possibility of just such a rebuke, should
               the squire turn out to be abusing the innocence of a village girl. In the event, the
               squire’s intentions are pure: he marries her, and her uncle does not need to beat
               him. The ideal village, for Bloomfield, is self-policing: the squire respects his
               tenants and they him. This was an old-fashioned and forlorn hope, perhaps, in face
               of the capitalization of farming, but it was one to which the conservative Wordsworth,
               Southey, and Gilpin, also subscribed as did the radical Cobbett—a Romantic rural paternalism.</p>
            <p>Bloomfield’s only public political discourse was his poetry. His claim to Lloyd Baker
               that he had kept a vow to make no declarations of opinion was true. Not a political
               thinker, he refused to become involved in radical writing and publishing, not necessarily
               through lack of sympathy but because radicals’ forthright and frank avowals seemed
               to him too exclusive of doubt, difference, and ambiguity, too easily certain and too
               egotistic. Like Clare in “To a Fallen Elm,” he resented radical campaigners’ assumption
               that because they were of his class they necessarily spoke for him, and he suspected
               their motives might include self-promotion. Despite, therefore, his private conversations
               with Horne Tooke and Hardy, men tried for treason for their radical campaigning, he
               was sharply critical of Thomas Paine when Paine’s disciple and bookseller, Thomas
               Clio Rickman, presumed, in an over-familiar way, that he would be keen to have him
               sell his poems: <span class="quote">‘All your writings are so confoundedly violent, that I who have four years past made
                  a determination to be nutral in Politicks and Religion, have much ado to convince
                  myself that you ought to expect much assistance from such a cowardly fellow. And it
                  is because I differ in both the above particulars from the Author you first put into
                  my hands, that I do not feel myself acting a consistant part in spreading his opinions.
                  Mr P[aine] in my estimation is the vainest of all authors. My circle of friends have
                  long ago regreted that his great mind should decend so as to disgust his readers by
                  boasting of himself. Perhaps when he laments the falling off of America from her purity
                  of principle he is only lamenting the utterly unavoidable effects of a growing population
                  there, or elsewhere, I believe that if perfect Republicanism be not a dream, its durability
                  is. I am thus commiting myself to you compleatly; but it is to show you that I cannot
                  propagate doctrines which I do not profess either to believe or to understand. <em>I must and will</em> be as <em>private</em> a Man as pastoral poetry will permit me to be, or subjects that involve not creeds
                  and systems of which all the world knows I have had small means of judging. You are
                  fond of frankness, of which you set an example both in your writings and your manners.

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The abiding theme of Bloomfield’s correspondence is the control of his own words—the
                  very issue that most plagued his admirer John Clare. Writing freed him from wage labor
                  for sixteen hours per day as a shoemaker. In terms of time, life habits, and money
                  it gave him a precarious independence as an agent on a newly capitalized popular publishing
                  market. It also subjected him to the pressures of the market while at the same time
                  he was not free from the expectations of the patrons who had helped get <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> published. His most hands-on patron was the Suffolk gentleman Capel Lofft, who expected,
                  as the price for the advice and literary connections he made available to Bloomfield,
                  to have his own views published in the form of prefaces and notes to the poems. These
                  views embarrassed Bloomfield: Lofft included irrelevant and vain justifications of
                  his own political conduct in the Preface to <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> and added ridiculously fulsome and insipid commentary in footnotes to <em>Rural Tales. </em>The booksellers responded to public demand and sought the removal of these notes in
                  the second edition; Lofft, insulted, insisted they remain. Bloomfield, caught between
                  patron and market, tried in letter after letter to negotiate with both, while maintaining
                  his own dignity. Ultimately, to his own anguish, he failed: Lofft chose to sulk, regarding
                  himself as betrayed, and Bloomfield lost his first supporter, despite a willingness
                  to compromise to a degree. But he would neither simply acquiesce to Lofft’s will nor
                  toady to him: he retained his independence but at a cost that showed him forcefully
                  that his writing was the subject of competition by others. Bloomfield was, his letters
                  reveal, caught in what we now know was a transitional stage from the eighteenth-century
                  norm of publishing under patronage, with subscribers funding the work, to the nineteenth-century
                  convention of selling via publishers to a mass market. Caught between patrons’ and
                  booksellers’ demands, he struggled to retain possession of his own writerly self,
                  to avoid becoming alienated from his own dearest words. Even well-meaning patrons
                  pressured him, assuming it their prerogative to intervene on his behalf (as they thought)
                  without first asking him. Thus the wealthy patron Lord Buchan, whose salon Bloomfield
                  had visited in 1802, sent in 1806 to Bloomfield’s publishers, a private letter Bloomfield
                  had written to him after the visit, in which Bloomfield confesses his shyness in polite
                  company and apologizes for breaking down into tears. Buchan requested the publishers
                  to include it in <em>Wild Flowers</em> along with Buchan’s own description of the occasion, so as to promote the sale. The
                  private letter reveals Bloomfield’s insecurity about appearing before his social superiors: <span class="quote">‘It may look strange that one, who has been repeatedly honoured with your lordship’s
                     conversation, should have anything left to express by writing: But the sudden transition
                     from shade to sunshine, from obscurity to publicity, which have fallen to my lot,
                     has sometimes proved almost painful, and often perplexing to a great degree. Condescension
                     from superiors ought at least to inspire confidence sufficient to meet their approbation
                     in all its shapes and modifications; and, when it does not, I am apt to suspect, that
                     it deserves no such plausible name as modesty. It is a dastardly child, the offspring
                     of ignorance and fear. I feel and know, that in my composition there is not an atom
                     of what is called wit. My replies are the slow suggestions of contemplation, and my
                     “good things” mostly come half an hour too late. I find this to be true in conversation
                     with my equals, where restraint can have no force. There is however, another enemy
                     (though in some cases my dearest friend) whose power is resistless, and whose visits
                     are perpetually made known by a rising of the stomack, and a redundance of water in
                     the eyes. Subjects of interest to the feelings are frequent in parties, such as I
                     have lately had the honour to join; when, independent of the subject being often above
                     my reach, I find this weakness, (if it be a weakness) stand in my way, and absolutely
                     obstruct any remark or reply whatever. (letter 75, 19 January 1802)’</span> When Bloomfield heard from the publishers of Buchan’s request to publish their private
                  correspondence, he politely insisted on retaining control of his own words and on
                  succeeding on his own merits, without the cachet provided by publishing letters of
                  recommendation from the socially powerful. He would not risk appearing to be a creature
                  of a Lord who had solicited for favor—an honorable decision which it required considerable
                  temerity, considering the disparity in rank between Buchan and himself, to make: <span class="quote">‘To adopt your plan, great and honourable as it is, would involve consequences that

                     and such that no person would believe me did I pretend to it. But though I feel the
                     intended honour, I feel too, other sensations that many perhaps could suppress: I
                     feel that it would be a violation of my notions of delicacy to print it now. My object
                     has been to abide by the most simple methods of acquiring reputation, the standing
                     alone, as far as my abilities go, and as far as it can be done in justice to my friends.
                     Thus it has happened that of the many letters which I have had from his Grace the
                     Duke of Grafton, Sir C Bunbury &amp;c, one from the Duke of York, and one from that most

                  writer to sustain. But Bloomfield was adamant, reserving his contempt for his elder
                  brother George, on whom he had once depended, when George would not stand up for him
                  but instead toadied to Capel Lofft: <span class="quote">‘that man would listen to Tom Cat if he could flatter him, so dont pretend that you

                  for seventeen years. Bloomfield wrote again only when he knew he was gravely ill.
                  He had not been able to preserve his family intact in face of the social pressures

                  the anti-slavery campaigner. It was, however, through the younger generation, a network
                  of sisters and wives, that Bloomfield entered the extended circle. The married sister,
                  Mary Lloyd Baker, wrote to him admiringly of his poetry and soon he was invited to
                  the family’s houses in Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, and Northamptonshire. There
                  he was delighted to find admiring female company that made no demands upon him. The

                           Prowse, née Sharp) of Wicken Park, Northamptonshire. Daughter of the surgeon William
                           Sharp and niece of Granville Sharp the abolitionist, Mary introduced Bloomfield to
                           her extended family, allowing him to make visits to the houses of family members at
                           South Mimms, Northamptonshire and Fulham as well as her own house at Uley in Gloucestershire.</span></div>

                  In their company he relaxed, flirting and joking at their country houses. And since
                  the women were not heads of the households they did not concern themselves with money
                  and social authority as gentlemen did. Bloomfield was able to feel valued as part
                  of sisterly and feminine world based on nature-love. The women appreciated poetry;
                  they sketched; they toured the Wye valley, taking Bloomfield with them. In accessing
                  the rural world through them, Bloomfield experienced it differently: it was not the
                  countryside he met on his solitary pedestrian tours, nor the Suffolk village world
                  of work and customs that he hoped to rediscover in Shefford, but a feminized world
                  of beauty disinterestedly appreciated and shared at leisure. Bloomfield flourished
                  in it, and was freed to exercise his talent for flirtatious humour, as a letter of
                  22 June 1804 reveals: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">

                        for I know that my manner of speaking of what pleases me, is apt to make others feel

                        you to appreciate its merits, and thus I have no doubt as to the pleasure you may
                        derive from so pleasing an insight into nature with so little trouble.—You have three

                        at all) and place it consciously in a good light:—but as such objects to the naked
                        eye are so disgusting I doubt this would give you but little pleasure if you should

                        may be put to another use still, whenever any man shall approach you with a view of
                        sharing your affection and your heart you may immediately put all the best of his
                        virtues into the insect-box and when you have magnified them to your liking give him

                        but had better only beg that you will both believe me to be your most sincere and
                        humble servant. (letter 134)</div>
                  </blockquote> The many letters to the Sharp sisters may prompt us to a new perspective on Bloomfield
                  in particular and laboring-class poets in general—a perspective showing that he and
                  they flourished in a feminized literary and social milieu that was itself growing
                  rapidly, as female readers valued nature-writing and as more and more female poets
                  popularized a kind of poetry that was not associated with the kind favored by ruling-class
                  men—neither with classical genres, nor political satire, nor the representation of
                  patrons’ country estates. Bloomfield, as revealed for the first time by his correspondence,
                  was not simply a “peasant poet” chiefly valuable for his portrait of labor and for
                  his symbolic position as the voice of the laboring classes. He was a varied—and often
                  comic—writer of intimate prose and verse whose articulations of the struggles he faced
                  are valuable not simply as symptoms of the dilemmas faced by laboring-class writers,
                  or as illustrations of the social world he inhabited, but also—and principally—as
                  sensitive, honest, innovative, and successful negotiations of the consequences, for
                  one in his marginal position on the edge of both, of the changing relationship between
                  country and city, and masters and markets.</p>

               Cambridge, whose work also took him to other places including Thetford. According
               to an account of his life given to John Clare, following his time in the navy he had
               lived “seven years” as a “planter” in the West Indies, before “losing all I possesed
               [sic] in the tremendous hurricane of 1812.” A poet himself, Preston wrote to and visited
               poets, including Bloomfield. Clare described him thus: “he made me believe that he
               was a very great Poet and that he knew all the world and that almost all the world
               knew him he had a vast quantity of M.S.S. he said by him but had not published much
               at present . . .— he was for ever quoting beautys from his own poetry and he knew
               all the living poets in England and scotland as familiar as his own tongue—he was
               a living hoax—he had made two or three visits to Bloomfield and talkd of him as familiar
               as if he had been his neighbour half a life time he calld him ‘brother bob’” (123).

               reform. Initially radicalized by the establishment efforts to exclude newly-elected
               John Wilkes from parliament, Horne Tooke became an organizer of societies dedicated
               to widening suffrage—including the Society for Constitutional Information. He was
               arrested and charged with treason in 1794 when, in alliance with the London Corresponding
               Society, he attempted to organize a radical convention. Acquitted, despite the bias
               of the judge, he continued to argue for parliamentary reform, though in more moderate
               form. Thomas Hardy (1752-1832), like Bloomfield a London shoemaker, was a campaigner
               for parliamentary reform and the extension of the franchise. As an organizer of the
               London Corresponding Society he, like Horne Tooke, was tried for treason in 1794.
               Although acquitted, he lost his wife and unborn child—both died in childbirth brought
               on prematurely by the stress of fleeing from a pro-government mob. After his release
               from custody, Hardy gave up politics and carried on his trade in Covent Garden.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note37_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
