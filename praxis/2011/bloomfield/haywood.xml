                  <item>Robert Bloomfield's letters document one artist’s struggles (and sometimes
                     his victories) to share his unique voice and vision; the online publication of
                     his extant letters (a companion to this collection of essays) reveals new and
                     exciting insights into Bloomfield the artist and the man. The essays included
                     in this collection highlight and draw attention to aspects of Bloomfield's
                     literary production that would likely not be possible without the full access
                     to his letters that the edition provides, and make a strong case for why
                     Bloomfield continues to be worthy of study. They suggest how much more remains
                     to be said about this prolific poet. </item>

               <p>Robert Bloomfield’s <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title> is a troubled and
                  troubling poem. Initially a spectacular success, neglected for many decades, and
                  now rightly reinstated within the expanded canon of Romantic literature,
                  Bloomfield’s masterpiece still poses interpretive challenges for even the most
                  sympathetic critic of laboring-class poetry. The aim of this essay is to propose a
                  substantial revision to some of the critical orthodoxies, both past and present,
                  upon which the reputation and value of the poem continue to rest. Specifically, I
                  want to liberate the poem from the generic confines of “rural,” “pastoral,” and
                  “georgic” writing, and relocate its most powerful effects in the quite different
                  aesthetic modes of allegory and fantasy. If this critical step seems at first to
                  be simply illogical and even impertinent (the poem’s subtitle is, after all,
                     <title level="a">A Rural Poem</title>),<note n="3" place="foot" resp="author"
                     >In Goodridge and Lucas’s 2007 edition, the original subtitle is simply given
                     as <title level="a">A Poem,</title> but Bloomfield was not in control of the
                     shaping of the poem’s image.</note> my intention is to show that the prevailing
                  pastoralization (indeed, pasteurization) of the poem reveals a curious critical
                  tendency to evade or minimize the poem’s striking evocations of violence, terror,
                  and guilt. Such evasive readings of the poem carry twin risks: firstly, of
                  reinforcing the original Bloomfield “myth” in which his poetic identity is defined
                  predominantly by rural rather than urban culture, and in which the ruptures and
                  dislocations experienced by moving from the country to the city do not threaten
                  the coherence of the text<note n="4" place="foot" resp="author">“The great city
                     can have made singularly little impression on this preoccupied shoemaker. He
                     was not gifted with imagination, but his memory shielded him from uncongenial
                     surroundings, and enabled him to transfer his mental life to those fields and
                     woodlands where he had been most happy” (Unwin 91). Derek Roper describes
                        <title level="m">FB</title> as “quiet and pleasant” (65). John Lucas calls
                     the poem’s depiction of rural life “pre-lapsarian” (62), though Lucas, like
                     most current commentators on the poem, sees the poem’s nostalgia as only
                     partially successful in fending off pressing literary and social anxieties. My
                     approach aims to probe much further into this “darker” side of
                     Bloomfield.</note>; and secondly, of losing the opportunity to use the most
                  disturbed and disturbing textual moments of the poem as portals onto Bloomfield’s
                  conflicted imaginative condition. Focusing on the poem’s episodes and tropes of
                  violence, terror, and guilt is also, I hope to show, an as yet undervalued way to
                  locate a proto-Romantic subjectivity in <title level="m">FB</title>. By probing
                  the metaphorical means by which the poem dramatizes, negotiates, and confronts a
                  variety of terrors, we can open <title level="m">FB</title> up to a new set of
                  critical perspectives in which both personal and cultural compulsions work
                  simultaneously to explore the poet’s troubled past and anxious present. If <title
                     level="m">FB</title> remains, in the last instance, a “rural” poem, it
                  represents rural life and culture through a distorting lens which reflects and
                  magnifies the twin terrors of psychic and political repression. In Bloomfield’s
                  brilliant coinage, <title level="m">FB</title> is his “boyage,” a voyage of
                  self-discovery into the painful emotional territory of separation, loss, and
                  anxious success.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="author">Letter 6, to an
                     unidentified bookseller, possibly W. Bent, 21 June 1798.</note> The value of
                  the poem, in my mind, lies not only—or even primarily—in its evocation of rural
                  culture, but in the intriguing imaginative resources which Bloomfield deploys to
                  both recognize and contain what we can surmise to be unresolved personal
                     anxieties.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="author">According to Laura Marcus,
                     eighteenth-century life writing was “a destabilising form of writing and
                     knowledge” in which the “inner” self was constituted as both a “sacred place
                     and a site of danger” (15). For Felicity Nussbaum, such writing was an
                     opportunity to “experiment with interdiscourses and the corresponding subject
                     positions to breach the uncertainties of identity” (37).</note> By taking a
                  necessarily speculative psycho-biographical approach to these issues, I hope to
                  show that <title level="m">FB</title> is a darker, deeper, and more troubled poem
                  than has yet been appreciated.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="author">There is
                     ample evidence in Bloomfield’s letters to support a psycho-biographical
                     approach to his writing. One of the best examples is his account of “the two
                     years that I was breeding with Giles” (letter 16, to George Bloomfield, 8
                     September 1799). Literary creativity and parental anxieties are fused into a
                     trope of uncertain and insecure depth which crystallizes into an apt verbal
                     slip: “ . . . by the time I was brought to Bed with my Boy, my wife was
                     breeding another;! We some times see a ball of wax with so small a portion of
                     the buoyant quality that it knows not whither to sink or swim; if you put your
                     finger on it when at the surface, it will dive deep and be a long time in
                     rising again; so it was with my Boy Charles, he dived me into some debts this
                     time twelvemonth, from which I am not yet free, but I have great hopes I shall
                     be free by the end of November.” In Jonathan Lawson’s citation of this letter
                     the key word “buoyant” is spelt “boyant,” a slip which is full of ironies.
                     Lawson is the only critic to see the importance of this letter, noting that it
                     clearly “stirred terror as well as joy” and showed a side of Bloomfield which
                     was “hidden away by his editors and biographers” (23). See also Bloomfield’s
                     barbed comment that “Gentlemen, ’tis true, seldom enter alleys, or see the
                     domestic habits of those nests of human wretchedness” (<title level="m"
                        >Remains</title> 2: 71-2). The poems, however, do enter such psychic
                     “alleys.”</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is odd that <title level="m">FB</title> has proved so resistant to allegorical
                  readings, especially when we consider that the poem was published at the end of an
                  unprecedented politicized decade in which the English countryside became a
                  fiercely contested symbolic prize (Janowitz 152-61). As the “revolution debate” of
                  the early 1790s expanded into a national ideological struggle for the hearts and
                  minds of the British people, competing visions of the “land” proliferated in both
                  print and visual culture: at the radical extreme, Spence’s “people’s farm” and
                  Paine’s agrarian justice; at the other extreme, Hannah More’s self-help village
                  politics and the culture of “contentment”; somewhere in between, <title level="m"
                     >Lyrical Ballads</title>’ lost souls and wanderers, victims of Pitt’s
                  militarism and high taxation, and Gillray’s wry images of the King as Farmer
                  George. Any attempt, therefore, to locate the “rural” in a space outside of this
                  supercharged ideological matrix, either in an uncontaminated generic zone, or in
                  the “Romantic” imagination, is a lost cause. Indeed, the quest to find “pure” or
                  detoxified images of rural life was and remains an act of fantasy, wish
                  fulfillment, and withdrawal which by negation and denial betrays its conflicted
                  and terrorized origins. The key Romantic text in this context is probably
                  Coleridge’s <title level="m">Fears in Solitude</title> (1798), a poem whose title
                  alone reveals a great deal about the Romantic paradox of retreat and
                  internalization: the deeper Coleridge retreats into heath, heart, and home, the
                  more the phantoms of Jacobin violence continue to haunt him.</p>
               <p>Yet the repressive hypothesis remains a useful if incomplete way to plot the
                  emergence of Romantic literary subjectivity. In a period where freedom of
                  expression was constantly under attack and “all privacy was subject to invasion”
                  by the state (Barrell, <title level="m">Spirit</title> 247), the switch from
                  “public” to “private” literary discourse served the twin purposes of avoiding
                  prosecution and constructing a secure model of the ego which could resist further
                  encroachments by a tyrannical State apparatus. The creative risk of this willingly
                  or unwillingly adopted strategy was the ever-present danger of uncontrollable
                  sublimation: it was one thing to intentionally allegorize contemporary politics,
                  for example in John Thelwall’s radical satires, and quite another to imaginatively
                  collude with dominant ideology by generating compelling fantasies and stereotypes
                  of oppressive power. The test case for the latter, compromised aesthetic position
                  is the De Quincey of John Barrell’s tour de force psycho-biographical study,
                     <title level="m">The Infection of Thomas De Quincey</title> (1991). For
                  Barrell, De Quincey’s autobiographical imagination is plagued (or sustained) by a
                  continuous reenactment of a childhood tragedy (the death of his sister Elizabeth),
                  the pain of which De Quincey can only psychically discharge by repeatedly
                  scapegoating and demonizing the lower classes and imperial subjects. De Quincey’s
                  subjectivity is for Barrell both a deeply personal and intensely public discourse,
                  a screen onto which the intertwined and mutually displacing terrors of private and
                  public history are projected, and in which “each aggravates the other in an
                  ascending spiral of fear and of violence” (Barrell 21)</p>
               <p>I have borrowed Barrell’s title for this essay as I see no reason why a similar
                  investigative methodology cannot be applied to Bloomfield in order to help us
                  “retrace the paths of wild obscurity” in <title level="m">FB</title> (<title
                     level="m">Sp</title> 6). As with Barrell’s De Quincey, I want to use a model of
                  Bloomfield’s creative behavior in which a “myth of his own childhood” is
                  “rewritten” as “narratives of trauma and narratives of reparation” (Barrell 22).
                  Though we can only speculate about the precise biographical details behind this
                  “myth,” I want to use the textual evidence of Bloomfield’s poems and letters to
                  propose that <title level="m">FB</title> is wracked with insecurities or “psychic
                  wounds” (Barrell 22) which emanate from Bloomfield’s past and which become
                  amplified in the echo-chamber of the politically turbulent 1790s. Of course,
                     <title level="m">FB</title> is a concealed or surrogate autobiographical poem,
                  but from the outset this generic ambiguity has not deterred critics from simply
                  peeling off Giles’s mask and conflating the hero with the poet. Indeed, it is
                  unlikely that the poem would have made the impact it did without Capel Lofft’s
                  prefatory essay, a seminal document which crafted an image of Bloomfield the
                  peasant poet and which rooted the poem’s value in its supposedly authentic
                  rendition of Bloomfield’s early life on his uncle’s farm. But even if we regard
                  the poem, correctly, as “semi”-autobiographical (White, <title level="m"
                     >Romanticism and the Poetry of Community</title> 12), it is striking that no
                  critic has yet felt the need to interpret the darker aspects of the poem within
                  this “semi”-autobiographical framework. Lofft may have had the painful examples of
                  Duck and Burns in mind when he declared that <title level="m">FB</title> conveyed
                  the “sweetness and ease” of its author (<title level="m">1805</title> 126)<note
                     n="8" place="foot" resp="author">Lofft cites Nathan Drake. See letter 25,
                     Nathan Drake to Capel Lofft, 9 March 1800.</note> but this placing of
                  Bloomfield on a moral, spiritual, and aesthetic pedestal has led to an
                  over-simplified estimation of his poetic strengths and procedures. Bloomfield’s
                  letters show clearly his ambivalent and often embittered feelings about his
                  dependency on patronage (and it would be astonishing if, as an intelligent urban
                  artisan, he did not have such a response),<note n="9" place="foot" resp="author"

                     George Bloomfield, 24 February 1801).</note> so there is no reason to assume
                  that this self-consciousness about his compromised social and cultural position is
                  not reflected, played out, and even (in the case of <title level="m">FB</title>)
                  anticipated in his poetry: <quote>

                  </quote> As much as Bloomfield’s success was a genuine literary, social, and
                  economic step forward, I want to speculate that it also reawakened and
                  reconfigured unresolved anxieties about separation, change, and dependency. The
                  violent and disturbing episodes of <title level="m">FB</title> reflect both the
                  strength of these feelings and the counter-revolutionary political mood of the
                  late 1790s: far from retreating into the idyllic past, Bloomfield’s poem provides
                  an intriguing psychopathology of laboring-class poetry in the Romantic
                     period.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="author">Barrell subtitles his book

                     be interpreted as simple racism but as a psychic attempt to displace and
                     resolve anxieties arising from the emotional damage inflicted on him by
                     childhood trauma. Similarly, I want to suggest that we can find insights into
                     the working-class writer’s troubled experience of social and cultural mobility
                     by locating what Barrell calls tropes of “trauma” and “reparation” rather than
                     looking for a direct transcription of life into text. </note>

               <p>The first description of Giles in <title level="m">FB</title> establishes the
                  poem’s characteristically awkward use of the “semi”-autobiographical mode: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> It is quite difficult to know how to react to this thumbnail sketch: does
                  it convey sympathy for the socially disadvantaged, or skepticism at the acceptance
                  of (oxy)moronic “cheerful servitude”? Moreover, the comparison with slave-driving,
                  which seems a gratuitous or strenuous attempt to present Giles as a free-born
                  Englishmen, runs the risk of backfiring: when it is read as a continuation of the
                  previous line (“no more; / No stripes, no tyranny”) there is a lingering sense
                  that (like the stereotypical slave) Giles’s docile body would not even feel these
                     lashes.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="author">The phrase “he felt no more”
                     also echoes the poem’s motto, “A shepherd’s boy, he seeks no better name” (the
                     first line of Alexander Pope’s pastoral poem <title level="m">Summer</title>).
                     Interestingly, Bloomfield cited this motto and Lofft’s introduction as examples
                     of editorial imposition. In the preface to the 1809 edition of his poems,
                     Bloomfield recalls that the first knowledge of the poem’s publication came when
                     his brother Nathaniel saw in a bookseller’s window “a book called The Farmer’s
                     Boy, with a motto. I told him I supposed it must be mine, but I knew nothing of
                     the motto” (<title level="m">1827</title> xix). Bloomfield also told Lofft
                     that, “I had not seen the poem, and consequently not the preface” until he
                     visited the Duke of Grafton (letter 23, to Capel Lofft, 5 March 1800); see also
                     the <title level="a">Authorial Note</title> (1801) cited in Goodridge and
                     Lucas’s 2007 edition (22).</note> A further problem arises if we take the
                  passage at anything like face value as an imaginative transcription of
                  Bloomfield’s own experience. The fact that Giles is “fatherless” seems to accord
                  with the young Bloomfield (whose father died of smallpox when the poet was less
                  than one-year old), so this leads us to consider that Giles could be a version of
                  Bloomfield working on his uncle Austin’s farm at Sapiston. But if this is the
                  case, how do we interpret the reference to a lingering threat of “tyranny”? If
                  tyranny does not emanate from his “generous Master” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  47)—a possible reference to his Uncle Austin—can we find another source? One of
                  the attractions (and weaknesses) of a psycho-biographical approach is that it
                  enables us to make connections between circumstantial textual “clues” and the
                  writer’s personal experience without recourse to “hard” biographical evidence. One
                  way to think about the negatively asserted “tyranny” of the vignette is therefore
                  as a dual protest: the alienated condition of rural labor is a generalized
                  expression of the personal dislocation which Bloomfield may have felt when he was
                  displaced from his home to become a “farmer’s boy.”<note n="12" place="foot"
                     resp="author">The whole question of exactly what was connoted by the word
                     “farmer’s boy” and its various derivatives is certainly worth more attention,
                     as it is more than possible that “boy” in this context was a term of derision
                     which poked fun at the docile country yokel, or at the very least that it was a
                     sentimental stereotype of conformity and social mobility. It is certainly the
                     case that a well-known ballad called <title level="m">The Farmer’s Boy</title>
                     or <title level="m">The Lucky Farmer’s Boy</title> was in circulation by the
                     early nineteenth century, though I have yet to determine if it precedes
                     Bloomfield’s poem (many versions of the ballad can be found in the <ref
                        target="http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/ballads/ballads.htm">online Bodleian
                        Library Broadside Ballads collection</ref>). In the ballad, a fatherless boy
                     begs for work at a farm and after being taken in becomes a model worker and
                     eventually marries the farmer’s daughter. See also the Cheap Repository Tract
                        <title level="m">The Good Militia Man; or, the Man that is Worth a Host,
                        Being a New Song by Honest Dan the Plough-boy turned Sailor</title> (1796),
                     in which “Dan” is a model of conformity; and <title level="m">Young Lubin was a
                        Shepherd Boy</title> (1794), in which the hapless hero drowns on the eve of
                     his wedding. Also of note are <title level="m">The Village Boy</title> (1780);
                     and <title level="m">The Wounded Farmer’s Son</title> (1795). Lofft reported
                     that on Austin’s farm the young Bloomfield was treated fairly like “all the
                     Servant Boys” (<title level="m">1805</title> xvii).</note> This disruption
                  represents a “tyranny” in the sense that the displacement was an involuntary
                  separation: in Barrell’s terms (1991, 1-24), a “narrative of trauma.” My initial
                  proposition is that a “semi”-autographical reading of the poem must take into
                  account the possibility that Bloomfield had unresolved feelings about separation,
                  loss, and success, and that these feelings are worked through imaginatively in
                  hyperbolic figurations of familial catastrophe, dispossession, and guilt.</p>
               <p>In order to test this hypothesis, we can turn to the poem’s most sensational
                  episode, the slaughter of the lambs at the end of <title level="m">Spring</title>.
                  Following scenes in which Giles has had to stake out dead crows and milk some
                  “lazy” cows, his final task of this first section of the poem is to shepherd his
                  flock, a job which, at least initially, seems like a pastoral reward for the
                  harsher and less fulfilling labors which have preceded it. Not only is this
                  pastoral mainstay the narrator’s “darling theme” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  283), it is also clear that the lambs are the epitome of pastoral comfort,
                  “Indulg’d” in a life of “ease” and “play” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 291-2). But
                  an ominous shadow soon falls over their innocent bliss, as they are also described
                  as “happy tenants, prisoners of a day” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 291) who
                  inhabit “bright inclosures circling round their home” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  286). This is another example of the oxymoronic darkening of tone which first
                  appeared in Giles’s “happy servitude.” The language of confinement alerts us to
                  the fact that there is more than one kind of “indulgence” at work here, as both
                  the lambs and the reader are being lulled into a false sense of security. No
                  amount of “spotless innocence, and infant mirth” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 317)
                  can protect the lambs from the descending knife of the “murd’ing Butcher” (<title
                     level="m">Sp</title> 346): <quote>

                  </quote> The surprising aspect of this scene is not the anthropomorphic violence
                  but the implied treachery and collusion of Giles, no longer a caring shepherd but
                  a “messenger of blood.”<note n="13" place="foot" resp="author">It is hard to
                     imagine how Nathan Drake could conclude that this scene “breathe[s] the utmost
                     tenderness and sweetness” (457-8), but the failure to confront the full impact
                     of this gruesome slaughter has persisted to the present day. Bridget Keegan
                     notes correctly that a “potent symbol of pastoralism is slaughtered” in this
                     scene, but she is reluctant to probe further; though she ponders “what other
                     feelings, besides pity for the lambs, does this unsettling scene provoke?” her
                     answer is that “the angry tone of these lines is atypical of Bloomfield” and
                     she explains the “unsettling” violence as a “profound protest against the
                     exploitation of nature” (<title level="a">Lambs,</title> pars 31, 33). In a
                     more recent assessment, Keegan explains the scene in terms of ecological
                     “sustainability” (<title level="m">Labouring-Class</title> 21-3). See also
                     White, who attributes the scene’s anger to Bloomfield’s rage at the carnivorous
                     appetites of the “the metropolitan rich” (<title level="m">Romanticism and the
                        Poetry of Community</title> 19).</note> In a striking reversal of the
                  Christian values associated with the pastoral shepherd’s role, Giles becomes
                  nothing less than a collaborator with the Herod-like butcher who “Demands the
                  firstlings of his flock to die” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 347). The political
                  connotations of this massacre are made crystal clear: the slaughter of Giles’s
                  “gay companions” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 349) is compared to the undermining
                  of “life and liberty” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 348). </p>
               <p>The full allegorical impact of this “shocking image” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  354) can be felt if we furnish the political allusion with some specific
                  historical events. In 1798, the year in which Bloomfield finished the poem, the
                  Irish rebellion saw over 20,000 Irish killed, most of whom were peasants. But the
                  trope of slaughtered innocence was also the standard textual fare of Romantic
                  atrocity scenes, and such bloody vignettes abounded in anti-slavery, anti-war, and
                  anti-Jacobin writing (Haywood <foreign>passim</foreign>). In 1797, for example,
                  William Cobbett (writing as “Peter Porcupine”) published his macabre <title
                     level="m">The Bloody Buoy</title>, also known as <title level="m">Annals of
                     Blood</title>, a catalogue of graphically detailed Jacobin outrages (Haywood,
                  chapter 2). This work was popular, and it is not beyond the bounds of speculation
                  to consider that if Bloomfield knew the work, he may have been infected by its
                  compulsion to expose the desecrated victims of political terror, even though
                  Bloomfield’s “fleeces drench’d in gore” are emblems of English, not French,
                  tyranny (<title level="m">Sp</title> 350). But political contextualization is
                  still only a partial allegorical reading of the scene, as it does not explain
                  Giles’s seemingly guilty role in the massacre, and Giles’s own feelings remain
                  obscure. As in the rest of the poem, his interiority is inconsistently
                  represented, and it is often insubstantial and transient—“he felt no more.”<note
                     n="14" place="foot" resp="author">Tim Burke has noted perceptively that, far
                     from being a representative of an organic community, Giles often works alone
                     and rarely participates in social gatherings: for Burke, <title level="m"
                        >FB</title> is the “most extended and most intense, exploration of
                     friendlessness” (3).</note> This vagueness shifts the responsibility for coping
                  with the “ideas foul” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 353) to the narrator, who
                  intervenes to bring the scene to a hasty close so that Giles (and the reader) can
                  put this carnage behind them and look ahead to the “universal joy” of summer
                     (<title level="m">Sp</title> 358).</p>
               <p>However, the “shocking” impact of this bloodbath cannot be forgotten so easily,
                  and its reverberations trouble the poem throughout the next three sections. It is
                  only just over a hundred lines into <title level="m">Summer</title>, for example,
                  before we are told that Giles fell into a “delicious” sleep after a rewarding
                  day’s labor: <quote><lg type="stanza">
                        <l rend="#indent2"> From sleep who could forbear,</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2"> With no more guilt than Giles, and no more care?</l>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> Although the reference to “guilt” could be explained in georgic terms as
                  taking a break from labor, the combined effect of the diction (“guilt,” “peace,”
                  “conscience”) surely gives these lines a darker hue when the preceding slaughter
                  is recalled. It is as if the narrator’s absolution comes only at the cost of
                  narrative amnesia. But another important pointer towards an allegorized,
                  psycho-biographical reading of the slaughtered lambs scene is the presence of
                  those “frantic Ewes” who “mourn the savage deed” (<title level="m">Sp</title>
                  342). This intense maternal grief enables an interpretation of the scene in which
                  the traumatic act of separation from the mother is both registered and contained
                  by displacing its agency onto a hyperbolically violent third party (in Barrell’s
                  terms, “this, that, and the other”).<note n="15" place="foot" resp="author"
                     >Barrell uses this phrase for the title of his introductory section,
                     1-24.</note> The seemingly paradoxical component of this fantasy—the collusion
                  of Giles in the violence—can be explained as a means to manage the guilt generated
                  by the contradictory emotions of love and resentment. This reading of the scene
                  then permits us to deepen and broaden the significance of the most “shocking”
                  object in the episode, that emblem of destroyed innocence, the gory fleece. Once
                  we see the fleece as a key player in a psycho-biographical drama of loss and
                  separation, at least four avenues of critical exploration are opened up: first, we
                  can compare the scene to one of its key intertexts, the sheep-shearing ritual in
                  Thomson’s <title level="m">The Seasons</title>; second, we can take a fresh look
                  at the way Bloomfield revisits the scene at the end of <title level="m"
                  >FB</title>, clearly in an attempt to produce a “narrative of reparation”; third,
                  we can investigate the function of the image of the fleece in Bloomfield’s curious
                  elegy to his mother, the poem <title level="a">To a Spindle</title>; and fourth,
                  we can use the idea of sartorial transformation to shed new light on a whole
                  subset of poetical tropes which cluster around the themes of adoption and failed
                  guardianship.</p>

                  also a major component in what I have called the Bloomfield “myth.” According to

                     Gentle Shepherd, and Burns’s Poems” (letter 15).</note> no critic has thought
                  to question why Bloomfield did not return to his real rather than his adopted
                     home,<note n="18" place="foot" resp="author">Note the grammatical slippages in
                     George Bloomfield’s account of this event: he told Lofft that Robert “came
                     home; and Mr Austin kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could
                     return to me” (letter 20, before 1 March 1800; <title level="m">1805</title>
                     xi).</note> and there is a further issue about the remaining fourteen years of
                  gestation during which the poem took shape in the shoemaker’s workshop in the City
                  of London. But leaving these reservations aside for now, Bloomfield clearly
                  organized <title level="m">FB</title> as an imitation of <title level="m">The
                     Seasons</title>. Beginning with Lofft and Nathan Drake, there has been a
                  tendency to bolster Bloomfield’s reputation by showing that at times he is capable
                  of bettering Thomson, either through the use of greater realism or through his
                  skill in utilizing and modifying the conventions of the georgic.<note n="19"
                     place="foot" resp="author">Nathan Drake, for example, argued that the “minutiae
                     of the animal and vegetable creation” in <title level="m">FB</title> surpassed
                     Thomson (446). Such tributes may have been particularly gratifying in light of
                     the fact that when Charles Dilly rejected <title level="m">FB</title> he
                     “exhorted” Bloomfield “not to waste his time, and neglect his employment, in
                     making vain attempts, and in particular in treading on the ground which Thomson
                     had sanctified” (Obituary in <title level="j">The Monthly Magazine; Or, British

                  potentially more probing ways to investigate Bloomfield’s relation to his poetical
                  master. <title level="m">The Seasons</title> was more than just an inspiring text;
                  it also provided aspiring laboring-class poets with two powerful but contradictory
                  narratives of cultural development and progress. On the one hand, the decline from
                  a pastoral golden age into urban decadence and corruption; on the other, the
                  georgic myth of industrious progress from barbarism to civilization.<note n="20"

                        Seasons</title> “inchoate” and “amorphous” but I doubt this was how it was
                     read, particularly by aspirers such as Bloomfield (247).</note> For the polite
                  reader of the poem, these competing models of national culture undoubtedly offered
                  differing ideological rewards and challenges, but the impact on the rural
                  laboring-class poet was potentially much more personal and deep-seated, as these
                  two narratives defined the conflicted poetic identity of the “humble” writer whose
                  value derived precisely from those “simple” origins. Critics have noted that
                  Bloomfield both benefited and suffered from the existing sentimental stereotype of
                  the “humble” laboring-class poet which predominated in his editors’ and patrons’
                  eulogies (McEathron, <title level="a">Wordsworth</title> 6), but Bloomfield’s
                  story was not only written by his benefactors and patrons: it was already woven
                  into the generic logic of the eighteenth-century georgic. Thomson’s assertion that
                  those who “fret in guilt / And guilty cities” can never know “the life / Led by
                  primeval ages uncorrupt” (Thomson, <title level="m">A</title> 1348-9) not only
                  prefigured Romantic rhetoric, it also constructed a primitivist discourse of value
                  which, particularly for the laboring-class poet, was both a literary conceit and a
                  dominant biographical construction. But if the alleged 1784 conception of <title
                     level="m">FB</title> fits this pastoral paradigm neatly (Bloomfield leaves the
                  “guilty city” for the “uncorrupted” sanctity of the farm), the converse narrative
                  of georgic progress relocates the poem’s genesis in Bloomfield’s workroom, a site
                  of industry and virtuous artisan labor.</p>
               <p>It is in this context that I want to look at the anthropomorphic force (or

                     assessment of Thomson’s contradictory attempt to combine the harsh reality of

                        <title level="m">Rural Life</title> 56).</note> of Thomson’s sheep-shearing
                  scene (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 371-422), an episode which combines
                  elements of both pastoral innocence and georgic industriousness. The sentimental
                  structure of the scene is the inverse of <title level="m">FB</title>, as the “loud
                  complaints” (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 391) of the “harmless race”
                  (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 388) of corralled sheep express an awareness
                  that their fate stands (literally) on a knife-edge; the sheep are “wondering what
                  this wild / Outrageous tumult means” and they remain—in a haunting phrase—“Inly
                  disturbed” (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 390-1), a sharp contrast to the
                  “dumb uncomplaining innocence” (Thomson, <title level="m">S</title> 416) of their
                  outward appearance. In order to reassure the sheep (and the reader), the narrator

                  natural resources are benignly “borrowed” for the good of the national economy,
                  making the fleece (however unconvincingly) a redemptive symbol of virtuous
                  commerce rather than violent expropriation.<note n="22" place="foot" resp="author"

                     >Autumn</title>, Thomson revisits the trope and condenses the georgic myth of
                  industrious advancement into a fable of sartorial progress, showing how Industry
                  took the benighted savage, “Tore from his limbs the blood-polluted fur, / And
                  wrapped them in the woolly vestment warm” (84-5).</p>
               <p>Placed next to Thomson’s virtuous and consoling fleece, the carnage of <title
                     level="m">FB</title> seems like a deliberate travesty, as if Bloomfield was
                  keen to repudiate not only the basic illusion of non-exploitative labor (which in
                  John Dyer’s even more patriotic sheep-shearing scene in <title level="m">The
                     Fleece</title> [1757] comprises “peaceful subjects” who “without murmur yield /
                  Their yearly tribute” [80]) but also Thomson’s compromise trope of mutual
                  “borrowing.” In order to explain why this metaphor was the target of such a
                  violent repudiation, we can speculate about Bloomfield’s radical, anti-capitalist
                  political affiliations, but we can also recognize that the “farmer’s boy” was
                  precisely a “borrowed” asset, a “fatherless” and “poor” boy farmed out to an
                  uncle’s farm and later transplanted a second time to his brothers’ care in the
                  “meridian,” the metropolis where he was again symbolically re-clothed. In
                  Thomsonian terms, Bloomfield’s slaughter scene collapses the stadial distinction
                  between the barbaric “blood-polluted fur” and the enlightened “woolly vestment
                  warm”: cathected indeed, Bloomfield exposes the instability of Thomson’s own
                  rhetoric in which paternalist swaddling is preceded by a violent disrobing. My
                  proposition, therefore, is that the massacre of the innocents in <title level="m"
                     >FB</title> is simultaneously an anti-pastoral debunking and a displaced
                  reenactment of what I am speculating was a traumatic moment in Bloomfield’s young
                  life when he was “torn” away from the maternal “woolly vestment warm” and
                  “borrowed” by his uncle “to pay his annual care.” The gory fleece is <title
                     level="m">FB</title>’s central <foreign>memento mori</foreign>, an emblem of
                  annihilation and arrested development.</p>
               <p>The poem’s need both to confront and discharge psychic terror is one way to
                  understand the fact that each of the four seasons of <title level="m">FB</title>
                  (and this is not apparent from the anodyne Thomsonian <title level="a"
                     >Arguments</title>) is disturbed and disrupted by episodes which narrativize
                  and allegorize emotions of fear, resentment, and guilt. At the same time, these
                  “digressions” attempt to find a resolution to the anxieties they raise and return
                  the poem to a condition of stability and “peace.” The culmination of this cycle of
                  rupture and resolution comes at the end of the poem when Bloomfield returns to the
                  haunting image of the bloody fleece. There is a strong impression that the poem
                  cannot be allowed to end until this problem has been formally resolved,<note
                     n="23" place="foot" resp="author">William J. Christmas accepts that this scene
                     can be read allegorically but only in social terms as an “ideological
                     accommodation” and a “paternalistic model for social harmony” (<title level="m"
                        >Lab’ring Muses</title> 277).</note> and this raising of the aesthetic
                  stakes brings the maternal trope more fully into view. The closing scene
                  transforms the earlier slaughter into a fable of adoption or “borrowing.” The
                  massacred flock is reconfigured as a therapeutic moment of “maternal fondness”
                     (<title level="m">W</title> 352)<note n="24" place="foot" resp="author">The
                     word “maternal” may originally have been “paternal” (see Goodridge and Lucas’s

                  borrowing the fleece of a dead lamb, the mother is “cheated” into thinking the
                  lamb is her own (<title level="m">W</title> 358). In Freudian terms, this
                  resolution could be seen as a family romance in which the displaced hero finds new
                  and more perfect parents, but in Bloomfield’s “narrative of reparation” the
                  closure is unstable and fraught with contradictions. Not only is the restored
                  mother “cheated into tenderness,” but the orphan has a split identity, wearing
                  “his predecessor’s skin” (<title level="m">W</title> 357) and being “doom’d awhile
                  disguis’d to range” (<title level="m">W</title> 356-7)—an intriguing metaphor for
                  the dilemma of the laboring-class poet who, as a cultural orphan, faces the choice

               <p>Bloomfield’s need to turn <title level="m">FB</title> into a fable of “maternal
                  fondness” did not end with the composition of the text. Lofft was overjoyed to
                  discover that Bloomfield presented the poem as a gift to his mother. He used the
                  preface to <title level="m">FB</title> to announce that Bloomfield “seems far less
                  interested concerning any Fame or Advantage he may derive to himself, than in the
                  pleasure of giving a printed Copy of [<title level="m">FB</title>], as a tribute
                  of duty and affection, to his Mother.”<note n="26" place="foot" resp="author">
                     <title level="m">1805</title> xvi-xvii. Compare Lofft's commments with
                     Bloomfield’s rapturous account of receiving his first “gift” from the Duke of
                     Grafton: “What a glorious thing is a present of -------- to a man in distress!
                     If hundreds should arise from my writings, I question if hundreds will produce
                     the exquisite sweetness of that --------” (<title level="m">1827</title>, xx).
                     The blanking out of unsightly figures shows a lingering embarrassment, but we
                     know that Bloomfield received 5 guineas, albeit given to him “screwed up in a
                     little bit of paper” (letter 22, to his mother, 5 March 1800).</note> In fact
                  Lofft revealed that Bloomfield had not visited Honington for twelve years,<note
                     n="27" place="foot" resp="author">
                     <title level="m">1805</title> xxi. It seems that Bloomfield planned to return
                     to Sapiston in 1788 or 1789 but, according to his brother George, “you told me,
                     you had resolved, not to go to Sapiston—till independent” (letter 2, from
                     George Bloomfield, 27 December 1789).</note> but this made the symbolic reunion
                  of mother and “tribute” even more moving: “[he] has review’d, with the feelings of
                  a truly poetic and benevolent Mind, the haunts of his youth” (<title level="m"
                     >1805</title> xxi). For Lofft, restoring <title level="m">FB</title> to its
                  maternal “home” is the crowning glory of the poem’s pastoral virtues, as if the
                  poem is truly where it belongs, outside of the corrupting egotistical forces of
                  “guilty cities.” But the conversion of <title level="m">FB</title> into an object
                  of gift culture does not have to be seen in these sentimental and primitivist
                  terms; it can also be seen as a measure of Bloomfield’s having finally achieved a
                  measure of self-respect and independence.<note n="28" place="foot" resp="author"
                     >Bloomfield wrote to George in 1798 that the uncorrected manuscript of <title
                        level="m">FB</title> “would look awkward to give it even to my Mother
                     without some kind of introductory letter” (letter 11, Robert Bloomfield to
                     George Bloomfield, 7 November 1798). But there is no question that Bloomfield
                     saw <title level="m">FB</title> as a means to give some material assistance to
                     his mother: “Dearest Mother—I trust I shall be abel to do you some Good, pleas
                     God. If I can assist you with some comforts my soul will rejoice” (letter 17, 3
                     October 1798). In the event, the letter which accompanied the “gift” is quite
                     neutral in tone: “I will not fail to tell you further of all that is in
                     agitation, as soon as I have Leisure, but I am rather pressed for time” (letter
                     22, 5 March 1800).</note> According to Lewis Hyde, “It is when art acts as an
                  agent of transformation that we may correctly speak of it as a gift,” adding that
                  “the transformation is not complete until we have the power to give the gift on
                  our own terms” (47). Intriguingly, Hyde illustrates this point by alluding to the
                  well-known folk-tale <title level="m">The Elves and the Shoemaker</title>. This
                  fable is not unrelated to Bloomfield’s situation: the story concerns a struggling
                  shoemaker who is rescued from pauperism by the magical intervention of two elves
                  who turn his unfinished shoes into “complete masterpieces.” The shoemaker becomes
                  “thriving and prosperous” by selling these shoes as if they were his own, at which
                  point he returns the compliment by making some clothes for the naked elves. But
                  the unresolved issue, which is not addressed by the text, is the fraudulent basis
                  of the shoemaker’s success—in essence, he has been deceiving his customers (Hunt
                  1: 140). With this fable in mind, we may wonder if “duty and affection” are the
                  only “tributes” contained within <title level="m">FB</title>; perhaps Lofft
                  unintentionally let slip one answer to this problem when he identified the
                  inspirational core of the poem as the “haunts” of Bloomfield’s youth.</p>
               <p>But if the presentation of <title level="m">FB</title> as a “tribute” to his

                  particularly valuable for any critic working on Bloomfield’s biography, yet its
                  strange refusal to conform to generic expectations and provide an unambiguous
                  “tribute of duty and affection” has failed to attract any critical attention. As
                  its intriguing title indicates, the poem is characteristically full of
                  displacements, odd rhetorical shifts and tonal shocks. Moreover, it is significant
                  that the most compelling trope of the poem is not the concluding image of reunion
                  but the mother’s “half-finished” fleece. The textual route to this image is not
                  straightforward and involves a journey through several important biographical
                  incidents and dates. Bloomfield’s brief but highly revealing preface states that
                  the poem was inspired by his mother’s last visit to London in the summer of
                     1804,<note n="32" place="foot" resp="author">See letter 136, to his mother, 3
                     August 1804.</note> but beyond this bare fact we are told nothing about their
                  relationship. Instead, the preface paints a harrowing portrait of his mother’s
                  last moments in which her usual “patient resignation” gives way to two unstable
                  forms of regressive behavior: first, she develops “an ungovernable dread of
                  ultimate want,” as if her life has been a complete failure and she is pitched back
                  into a primary condition of insecurity: “to meet Winter, Old Age, and Poverty, was
                  like meeting three giants” (65). Second, she becomes a compulsive spinner. As the
                  poem reveals, Bloomfield’s mother was by profession a “village school-mistress”
                  (line 36), but in the preface’s vignette she reverts to the customary occupation
                  for which, we are told, she was renowned, and which becomes an obsession in her
                  last moments: <quote> During the tearful paroxysms of her last depression, she
                     spun with the utmost violence, and with vehemence exclaimed, “<emph>I must
                        spin!</emph>” A paralytic affection, struck her whole right side, while at
                     work, and obliged her to quit her spindle when only half filled, and she died
                     within a fortnight. I have that spindle now. (65) </quote> These are intriguing
                  details, yet the final piece of information provided by the preface is even more
                  revealing for the purposes of this essay. Bloomfield returns to the topic of his
                  mother’s last visit to see him in London and notes that “she returned from her
                  visit to London, on Friday, the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of June, just to a day,
                  23 years after she brought me to London, which was also on a Friday, in the year
                  1781.” No further comments are given, but the coincidence of dates indicates that
                  the poem functions, at one level, as a metaphorical or allegorical revisiting of
                  that formative moment in Bloomfield’s life when “she brought me to London.” From
                  the evidence of the preface, therefore, the mother’s “spindle” is not only a
                  quasi-religious “relic” (the first word of the poem) but also a fetish, an object
                  with the transcendental power to summon the ghosts of the past.</p>
               <p>As the first line of the poem shows, Bloomfield’s relation to this fetish is
                  conflicted: “Relic! I will not bow to thee, nor worship!” Does this defiance
                  represent Bloomfield’s complex feelings about his mother? Or is it a protest
                  directed at the generic expectations of the elegy? If the latter, the line
                  explodes the notion that (in Drake’s words) “piety” and respectability seeped from
                  the pores of Bloomfield’s poetry. Whatever the answer, this is an unorthodox
                  opening to an elegy, and it establishes a discordant and edgy tone for the
                  fragmented biographical narrative which follows. In the next seven lines
                  Bloomfield seems to affirm all the pastoral myths about his poetic origins by
                  stating that the spindle evokes those “sunny days, that ever haunt my dreams” (an
                  echo of the rosy phrase “the sunshine of my youth” used in <title level="a">To My
                     Old Oak Table</title> [1803] to describe the inspiration for <title level="m"
                     >FB</title>). But these are not the days on the Sapiston farm: the lines refer
                  to the time preceding this, “ere the farm received / My vagrant foot,” and even
                  this tantalizing reference to Honington is only superficially “sunny.” To begin
                  with, the parental role in his transfer to “the farm” is conspicuously deleted and
                  replaced with the awkward passive mood. Furthermore, to call himself a “vagrant”
                  (6) is an almost comic misrepresentation of the basic facts (which were in the
                  public domain) of his involuntary removal to Sapiston,<note n="33" place="foot"
                     resp="author">According to George Bloomfield, Uncle Austin “took the Author,
                     when very young, and kept him from motives of charity” (letter 12, George
                     Bloomfield to Capel Lofft, November 1798).</note> a point that gains some
                  credence from the punning association between the “vagrant foot” and metrical
                  feet. When line six is read to the end, a quite different interpretation of events
                  emerges from the ambiguous syntax: “ere the farm received / My vagrant foot, and
                  with its liberty”—only the possessive “s” of “its” prevents this line from
                  implying that his “liberty” was sacrificed, though ostensibly that word refers to
                  the farm’s new pastoral freedoms which “Had taught my heart to wander” (8). This
                  mood of liberation could therefore be a consolation for the pain of separation and
                  the hardships of becoming (and failing to remain) a “farmer’s boy.”<note n="34"
                     place="foot" resp="author">Bloomfield was “so small of his age that Mr Austin
                     said he was not likely to be able to get his living by hard labour” (<title

               </p>
               <p>But if the waving of this spindle-wand seems to have magically cleansed
                  Bloomfield’s infant past from any parental interference—as if his mother’s death
                  has indeed released him from her sphere of influence—this does not mean that all
                  is forgiven. Having dispensed with his past, Bloomfield then calls on the spectral
                  spindle to teach “a moral” to “me and mine” (10). This “moral” takes the form of a
                  reworking of those scenes in the preface which described his mother’s dying
                  moments. In the poetic re-imagining, the two scenes of frantic spinning and
                  terrified hallucinations are conflated, as if the former is a deranged or
                  superstitious attempt to erect a barrier between herself and the three giants
                  “grim and bold.” Not content to show that “terrors fill’d her brain,— / Nor
                  causeless terrors” (13-14), Bloomfield adds a final macabre touch, the
                  intervention of Death itself who “to her trembling hand and heart at once, / Cried
                  ‘Spin no more’” (20-21). The poem changes the preface’s description of her final
                  seizure—described as a “paralytic affection” (itself an intriguing phrase,<note
                     n="35" place="foot" resp="author">The phrase “paralytic affliction” is used to
                     describe his mother’s condition in letter 152, to Thomas Park, December 23

                  echo of Lofft’s “tribute of duty and affection”)—into a more dramatic, sudden
                  demise. Death’s pronouncement “Spin no more” presumably answers the mother’s
                  deranged declaration “<emph>I must spin!</emph>” in the preface, but there is
                  surely also a disturbing allusion to the famous curse “Sleep no more” in
                  Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Macbeth</title>: this echo gives the “utmost
                  violence” of her words a much darker subtext. But if imagining his mother as an
                  infamous murderess is a shocking step for Bloomfield to take, even unconsciously,
                  the allusion could be one way, if an extreme one, to appease his feelings of
                  abandonment and betrayal. What his mother leaves on her spindle, significantly, is
                  an incomplete, “soft downy fleece” of the type that “she wound / Through all her
                  days, she who could spin so well” (22-3). This “half fill’d” and “half finish’d”
                  fleece (24) is yet another modulation of the trope of dysfunctional parental
                  bonding which recurs in <title level="m">FB</title>.</p>
               <p>The image of the incomplete fleece is central to the poem’s psychic and aesthetic
                  success. Indeed, the image can be seen as the poem’s “spindle” or pivotal point
                  around which the various strands of meaning are gathered. As if he is aware of
                  this, Bloomfield reflects on his own metaphor: <quote><lg type="stanza">
                        <l rend="#indent2"> Half finish’d? ’Tis the motto of the world:</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2"> We spin vain threads, and strive, and die</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2"> With sillier things than spindles on our hands.
                           (26-8)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> The first two lines of this generalization are unimpressively
                  conventional, but in line 28 there is a characteristic slippage. It seems that
                  Bloomfield is remembering a letter written to his brother George in September 1798
                  in which he refers self-effacingly to his plans to publish <title level="m"
                     >FB</title>: “very silly things are sometimes printed.” (letter 10, 16
                  September 1798.)<note n="36" place="foot" resp="author">Letter 10, 16 September
                     1798.</note> The verbal echo implies that Bloomfield is now thinking of his own
                  poetic identity. With his mother’s memory safely contained in the twin symbols of
                  the spindle and (more importantly) the half-completed fleece, Bloomfield can now
                  transfer the trope of spinning to the production of his own lines of verse, though
                  he makes this move initially under the protection of self-deprecating allusions to
                  “vain threads” and “sillier things.”<note n="37" place="foot" resp="author"
                     >Bloomfield may also have been remembering some lines from Dyer’s <title

                  restage the process of becoming a poet: “Then, feeling as I do, resistlessly, /
                  The bias set upon my soul for verse” (27-8). With this autobiographical
                  re-enactment in place, the final, redemptive modulation of the fleece image
                  provides an appropriately beneficent and pacific conclusion to this allegorized
                  life story. Looking ahead to his own death, he asks God to accept his “purity / Of
                  thought and texture” (32-3) and convert a “poor fragment” (31) into a “snowy
                  innocence” (35).</p>

               <p>The textual evidence adduced so far allows us to surmise that unresolved feelings
                  about filial separation lie behind Bloomfield’s affinity with the orphaned lambs
                  of <title level="m">FB</title> who are “doom’d awhile disguis’d to range” (<title
                     level="m">W</title> 355) in borrowed fleeces, so that the “unsuspecting dam”
                     (<title level="m">W</title> 359) would be “cheated into tenderness” (<title
                     level="m">W</title> 358). The trope of the “half finished” or “half fill’d”
                  fleece provided a means to condense the “torrent” of feelings about his early life
                     (<title level="a">To My Old Oak Table,</title> line 96) into a poetically
                  flexible trope of loss and transformation. In psycho-biographical terms,
                  Bloomfield was “re-fleeced” three times. The first major break was the move to
                  Sapiston, the place where he became a farmer’s boy and “reliev’d his Mother of any
                  other expence than only of finding him a few things to wear; and this was more
                  than she well knew how to” (<title level="m">1805</title> v). The second
                  transformation was his arrival in London in 1781, a journey predicated on the
                  promise of his brother Nathaniel “to clothe him” (<title level="m">1805</title>
                  v). The third metamorphosis was the publication of <title level="m">FB</title>,
                  the moment when Bloomfield became a poet and acquired a set of parental
                  substitutes in the guise of patrons and supporters. Each of these rites of passage
                  can be seen as a return of the repressed which generated new and often extreme
                  imaginings of those core emotions of insecurity, guilt, fear, and terror.</p>
               <p>The initial wrench from Honington to Sapiston seems to have been either too
                  painful or “obscure” to imagine directly. It is curious that even in his poem
                     <title level="a">On Revisiting the Place of my Nativity</title> (dated 30 May
                  1800, and published initially in the third edition [May 1800] of <title level="m"
                     >FB</title>) there are no details about his parents, his home, or, for that
                  matter, the village (121-2).<note n="38" place="foot" resp="author">Interestingly,
                     there is no record of this visit in the letters. Only letter 29, written to
                     George in May 1800, gives a few jumbled details of the coach journey, and the
                     fact that Bloomfield confuses the outward and return legs of the visit seems an
                     indication of mixed feelings: “I have wrote the latter part of my letter
                     backward.”</note> After expressing the conventional sentiment that absence has
                  given “Ideal sweetness to my distant home” there is no further mention of this
                  “home.” Perhaps Bloomfield was disconcerted by the response of local people to his
                  celebrity: <quote>I conceited that I saw the workmen and neighbours look at me as
                     an idle fellow. I had nothing to do but to read, look at them, and their
                     country and concerns. They did not seem to know how to estimate me. (<title

                  laboring-class poet whose social mobility is regarded with suspicion or
                  bewilderment by the class and community from which he or she originated. As an
                  adopted son of polite culture, Bloomfield had embarked on that perilous voyage of
                  dependency and commercial success which had afflicted the lives and the sanity of
                  some of his plebeian predecessors, notably Stephen Duck.<note n="39" place="foot"

                     acknowledge the effect of urban culture on laboring-class poets has been made
                     forcefully in relation to Stephen Duck, but is proving a harder nut to crack in
                     relation to Bloomfield. See, for example, Landry and Christmas. For the
                     purposes of this essay, I have assumed that Bloomfield absorbed the “spirit of
                     despotism” of the 1790s via whichever cultural and political forces he
                     encountered; the available evidence from letters and other sources make this a
                     reasonable assumption.</note> Unfortunately, we have only a few tantalizing yet
                  precious glimpses into Bloomfield’s life in the period, most of which appeared in
                  Lofft’s narrative, based on information supplied by George Bloomfield (letter 20,
                  before 1 March 1800). We can only speculate about this thinness of detail: it may
                  be explained by the need to conceal radical political affiliations,<note n="41"
                     place="foot" resp="author">There is one moment in <title level="m">FB</title>
                     when Giles flashes up as a potential surrogate radical figure, but typically
                     for the poem this possibility is presented through denial and pacification, to
                     the extent that the moment functions like a mock-allusion to radical allegory.
                     When he is milking cows in <title level="m">Spring</title>, Giles’s “tatter’d”
                     hat “purloins a coat of hair” (202) from the cow’s side and becomes “A mottled
                     ensign of his harmless trade, / An unambitious, peaceable cockade” (<title
                        level="m">Sp</title> 203-4). The tone of these two lines is slippery: what
                     seems like a gratuitous reinforcement of pastoral’s counter-revolutionary
                     credentials could equally, in my mind, consign Giles to docility and political
                     inefficacy. In other words he becomes—for a brief moment—the kind of
                     conservative stereotype perpetuated in Hannah More’s tracts. The other point to
                     note about the scene is that it is yet another reworking of the trope of the
                     expropriated fleece in which a natural resource is (peaceably in this instance)
                     “purloined”: the scene has the added function of attempting to allegorically
                     counterbalance the slaughtered lambs of <title level="m">Spring</title>.</note>
                  or—which is more likely—it tells us that for Lofft and other admirers and
                  promoters, Bloomfield was essentially and definitively a pastoral poet. He may
                  have lived in the city, but his real creative, spiritual, and moral home was in
                  the Suffolk countryside. The pasteurization of Bloomfield was both a marketing
                  ploy and a way of domesticating Bloomfield so that his patrons could be freed from
                  any guilt about inflating his expectations; laboring-class poets must not be
                  encouraged to “rise into a line that is beyond their reach.”<note n="42"
                     place="foot" resp="author">Anderson 393-5. Anderson’s review of the poem gives
                     a useful insight into the perils of patronage. In response to a long letter
                     from a reader which praises <title level="m">FB</title> and its author, “a
                     simple farmer’s boy” (391), Anderson states that he read “this little poem in
                     manuscript with much satisfaction” but also with uneasiness about the wisdom of
                     bringing Bloomfield “forward to public notice” (393). He states that patronage
                     can be the “severest cruelty” if it leads lower-class poets into “an
                     uninterrupted struggle” to “rise into a line that is beyond their reach.” But
                     he is reassured that the “characteristic features” of <title level="m"
                        >FB</title> are “innocence and beneficence” and “native simplicity” and that
                     these qualities are a reflection of Bloomfield’s sensible decision not to
                     aspire socially and intellectually beyond “domestic comforts” and those “few
                     congenial souls” (polite friends) “in whose conversation he may feel himself
                     fortified in his natural propensities rather than deranged” (394-5). Nathan
                     Drake also reassured budding patrons who “from their opulence and taste are
                     disposed to patronise and foster the efforts of rising genius” that they would
                     find a “peculiar gratification” in the fact that both <title level="m"
                        >FB</title> and its author were thoroughly respectable “in a moral light”
                     (479). The image of the pasteurized Bloomfield quickly congealed into a species
                     of hagiography, completely suppressing the less settling aspects of his
                     “poetical welfare.” The <title level="j">Gentleman’s Magazine</title> called
                     him “the best of husbands, an indulgent father and quiet neighbour, and
                     particularly affectionate to his mother” (70 (1800): 1181), and Robert Southey
                     applauded “one whose talents were of no common standard, and whose character
                     was in all respects exemplary” (163). But the apotheosis of this tendency was
                     probably Joseph Weston’s gushing defense of Bloomfield’s integrity in <title
                        level="m">Remains</title>. For Weston, Bloomfield is a paragon of English
                     poetical virtue, exuding “sweetness, simplicity and feeling,” producing
                     “pictures . . . drawn directly from nature” which are “<emph>always</emph> just
                     and true, like the reflections of a polished mirror” and uncontaminated by the
                     “infestation of impure motivation or poetical conduct.” Hence “everything is
                     simple and unaffected, purely pastoral and truly English” like the poet himself
                     who eschewed all “phantoms of foreign extraction” (<title level="m"

               </p>
               <p> Hence it is the rustic image of Bloomfield which is foregrounded in Lofft’s
                  account of “little Robert’s” arrival in London on 29 June 1781.<note n="43"

                     colored Bloomfield’s impressions of the great “meridian.”</note> When his

                  a “pathetic and successful Admonition,” even though it clearly reinforced
                  Bloomfield’s orphaned status. Revealingly, Bloomfield is wrongly dressed for the
                  occasion: the “little, fatherless boy” is “dress’d just as he came from keeping
                  Sheep, Hogs, &amp;—his shoes fill’d full of stumps in the heels. He looking about

                     (May 1800) as an act of “rhetorical emasculation” (White, <title level="m"
                        >Romanticism and the Poetry of Community</title> 90).</note> but the humor
                  releases some genuine tensions about the awkward transition from rural to urban
                  culture. The most telling detail is the wonderful literalization of insecurity,
                  the moment when the boy “slipt up” on the pavement (and the joke becomes even more
                  poignant when we remember that Bloomfield had come to London to be apprenticed as
                  a shoemaker). But there is more than one type of “slippage” here. When Bloomfield
                  used the preface to the 1809 edition of his poems to correct inaccuracies in
                  Lofft’s preface, the only incident which he revised in any detail was this
                  “anecdote” of rustic gaucherie. In the corrected narrative, he has prepared for
                  the “change I was going to experience” by wearing his best, Sunday clothes, “such
                  as they were.” Symbolically, he sold his smock frock (the standard dress of the
                  country laborer) for a shilling, and recalls “slily washing my best hat in the
                  horsepond, to give it a gloss fit to appear in the meridian of London.” Clearly,
                  Bloomfield wanted to make his entry into London a more empowering if still comic
                  scene, a moment which emphasized aspiration rather than ineptitude or
                     incongruity.<note n="47" place="foot" resp="author">See also a letter which
                     Bloomfield wrote to his mother in October 1797 (at which point he was hard at
                     work composing <title level="m">FB</title>). The letter makes clear that
                     Bloomfield feels some guilt about the fact that he cannot “help” his mother,
                     but he explains his dilemma in terms of “successions and changes amongst us”
                     and pinpoints his arrival in London as a key moment: “I have read your letters
                     with pleasure, when you have been under the pressure of ill health or bad
                     prospects, the natural though painful conclusion is, I cant help you; you I
                     believe often think over those things, you know the difficulty of keeping
                     afloat in the dirty stream of the world, and I think you know too the hearts of
                     us all, that the power, and not the will, is wanted.—It is sixteen years last
                     June since I washed my old hat in the Horse-pond and sold my smock for a
                     shilling to Sam Shelver’s boy, and set off to London to turn shoemaker, and I
                     always remark that though I am aquainted with the principle alterations and
                     deaths and changes, children grown to Men and Women since &amp;c, the first
                     thought that is, I mean whenever not thinking of other things my mind returns
                     to the country, for the first moment, it always presents the old picture. I see
                     my uncle master of the farm instead of my cousin, and can see in imagination my
                     old neighbours and things just as they were; fixing the memory thus, brings in
                     a strong point of view the quick successions and changes amongst us; for if I
                     had 16 years ago fixt my attention on a flourishing oak, or a whole grove of
                     oaks, the alteration might be disernable, but not striking” (letter 5, 22-[29]
                     October 1797).</note> He also recalls “riding backwards on the coach” and being
                  amazed that all the coaches “stood for hire!” (<title level="m">1827</title>
                  x-xi). These details, which Bloomfield dismisses as “surely trifling anecdotes,”
                  are all important adjustments to Lofft’s version of this rite of passage: the
                  conspicuous dressing up recalls the orphaned lamb “doom’d awhile disguis’d to
                  range”; the literal backwardness on the coach expresses the formidable scale of
                  the journey ahead of him; and the naivety about commercial society anticipates the
                  transition to artisan labor and the free market. Far more was at stake, therefore,
                  in Bloomfield’s rewriting of this initiation scene, than a simple change of
                  clothes. The Sunday-suited Bloomfield was a declaration of independence, an
                  affirmation of the right to dress (and address) himself, and a means to distance
                  himself from his alter ego Giles, who ploughs his field single-handedly “Till dirt
                  adhesive loads his clouted shoes” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 82).</p>

                  spectacular example of Bloomfield’s allegorical dramatization of terror. The
                  anthropomorphic conventions of georgic enabled Bloomfield to displace onto animals
                  a discourse of human rights and a whole battery of violent effects which seem to
                  evoke the climate of terror in the 1790s. But while some of these moments in the
                  poem have been analyzed by critics in this way, the possibility that the same
                  violent tropes might serve both a political and psycho-biographical agenda has yet
                  to be considered. For example, no serious critical attention has been given to one
                  of the earliest examples of terror in the poem, the shooting and staking out of
                  crows (<title level="m">Sp</title> 103-24). Yet this incident contains powerful
                  allegorical possibilities: an exposure of the brutality of the Black Acts, a
                  condemnation of capital punishment, an anti-hunting scene, or even an anti-war
                     allegory.<note n="48" place="foot" resp="author">In <title level="m"

                  </quote> There are a number of ways to interpret this passage: on the one hand,
                  there is a confrontation between civilization and primitive nature; on the other
                  hand, the “wings stretcht forth” clearly evoke sacrificial victims and the
                  Crucifixion. The role of Giles is also not entirely clear, as the hunter figure is
                  not Giles but a generic “sculking gunner.” Only after the passage ends are we told
                  that “This task had Giles, in fields remote from home” (<title level="m"
                     >Sp</title> 125). As there is no information about Giles’s feelings, it is not
                  easy to know if he is just indifferent, or if he is a reluctant collaborator in
                  this slaughter. Interestingly, the next day he is given a similar “care,” this
                  time to deter “prowling Reynard” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 158, another
                  “pilferer,” and the first of numerous murderous predators in the poem) by

                  </quote> Like the crow-killing, this scene evokes a contemporary political
                  landscape of terror: in the troubles in Ireland, for example, victims were
                  routinely tarred and “feather’d,” but the latter trope could also evoke the mass
                  executions of women or aristocrats in France. The crow-slaying incidents also
                  share a common theme: the severest punishment is meted out to those who “plunder”
                  and give nothing in return; or, put another way, terror is a justified defense
                  against an implacable external threat. But the most intriguing interpretation is
                  to read the scenes as an exploration of Bloomfield’s “poetical welfare,”<note

                  defend his own vocation (the rural poet) against the threat of invasion and
                  expropriation by “plunderers”—in psycho-biographical terms, this could be anyone
                  who steals his “seed” and ruins his “harvest.” If we assume that the
                  laboring-class poet is by definition a culturally insecure subject position,<note
                     n="50" place="foot" resp="author">For Hazlitt, Bloomfield’s Muse had “something
                     not only rustic, but menial in her aspect. He seems afraid of elevating nature,
                     lest she should be afraid of him” (145). Coleridge wrote to Southey in 1803
                     that “Blomfield [sic] is the Farmer’s Boy, not a Poet—in the mind of the
                     Public” (cited in McEathron, <title level="a">Wordsworth</title> 11).</note> it
                  is possible that these scenes function as fantasies of pre-emptive retaliation, as
                  if Bloomfield is attempting to expel all “threats” from the poetic landscape. This
                  interpretation gains weight from the fact that the crow-killing scene was almost
                  certainly the first part of <title level="m">FB</title> to be written. In a letter
                  to George written in September 1798, Bloomfield revealed: <quote>The parts of the
                     poem first composed, before any thought was entertained of going through with
                     the Seasons, were the morning scene in Spring, beginning “This task had
                        <emph>Giles</emph>,” and the description of the lambs at play. And if it be
                     lawful for an author to tell his opinion, they have never lost an inch of
                     ground in my estimation from that day to this.<note n="51" place="foot"
                        resp="author">Letter 10, 16 September 1798.</note>
                  </quote> Tellingly, this information also reveals that the other foundational
                  scene of <title level="m">FB</title> was the “lambs at play,” a euphemism for the
                  scene of slaughter which concludes <title level="m">Spring</title>. This
                  information makes clear that the poem’s origins lay not in rural nostalgia but in
                  one of the georgic’s most disturbing conventions, the anthropomorphized slaughter
                  of animals. In psychic terms, the two scenes record Bloomfield’s failure to
                  protect his imaginative landscape from catastrophic violation.</p>
               <p>There is also an intriguing coda to this analysis of the allegorical density of
                  the crow-slaying scene in <title level="m">Spring</title>. The spectacle of the
                  slaughtered birds prompted Lofft to spring paratextually to their defense. In one
                  of his editorial notes, he expressed his regret that Bloomfield had not given a
                  “stay of execution” to the birds. For Lofft (drawing on Bewick), the crow is a
                  “very beautiful and very sensible Bird” which deserves “not only mercy, but
                     <emph>protection</emph> and <emph>encouragement</emph>.” To prove his point,
                  Lofft reveals that he has in his care two crows that were lamed in a storm. Both
                  birds have become domesticated, but one bird is yet more remarkable, since
                  although enjoying his natural liberty completely, he recognizes, even in his
                  flights at a distance from the house, his adoptive home, his human friends, and
                  early protectors. (<title level="m">1805</title> 103)</p>
               <p>The camouflaged meaning in this anecdote is not difficult to uncover: the story of
                  Lofft’s tamed and grateful crow is clearly designed to extol the virtues of
                  patronage and enlightened “care.” Lofft’s re-allegorizing of Bloomfield’s scene
                  functions itself like a “sculking gun.” Not only does it attempt to intervene in
                  the poem and regulate the imaginative terrain; it also surreptitiously accuses
                  Bloomfield of exceeding the poetic “liberty” of his “adoptive home” and offending
                  his “early protectors.” </p>
               <p>But even if Bloomfield had taken Lofft’s advice, it is doubtful that the “stay of
                  execution” would have lasted long. From its inception, <title level="m">FB</title>
                  gave Bloomfield the creative means to explore and confront fears and terrors, not
                  to avoid or repress them. The poem is structured like a series of seismic tremors
                  followed by a temporary periods of “pastoral” calm. To some extent this pattern
                  follows the model of Thomson, but the much shorter length of <title level="m"
                     >FB</title> makes the eruptions of painful and disturbing material into the
                  text more intense and disruptive. One way in which the poem tries to keep control
                  of these ructions is, as already noted, by displacing them onto animals (Perkins
                  105-6), but as we have seen, the anthropomorphizing imagination which is released
                  by this maneuver quickly exceeds its original georgic purpose. Consider, for
                  example, the fate of “Poor, patient Ball” (<title level="m">S</title> 207), the
                  docile workhorse whose lost tail implies emasculation. His “short-clipt remnant of
                  a tail” has reduced him to “A moving mockery, a useless name” (<title level="m"
                     >S</title> 210-11) who is defenseless against blood-sucking flies. An
                  allegorized psycho-biographical reading of this image could suggest an attempt to
                  vent feelings of abjection, disempowerment, and dependency: a series of
                  displacements could take us from “poor” Ball to Giles the “Gibeonite” (<title
                     level="m">Sp</title> 223) to Bloomfield’s more elevated insecurities about
                  status. This chain of association also links to that other, more spectacular
                  “moving mockery” of the poem, the withering account of the decline in the quality
                  of Giles’s locally produced cheese, a decline explained in terms of the dominance
                  of the London market. As the cheese is transported to the “ever-craving mart” of
                  the “huge Metropolis” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 237-8)—the same route, of
                  course, undertaken by Bloomfield in 1781—it is met by “derision and reproach”
                     (<title level="m">Sp</title> 253). The cheese is so hard and dry that it
                  resembles unflattering wooden objects, a “post” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 256),
                  or “the oaken shelf whereon ’tis laid” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 259); and in a
                  final stab of unpalatable phallic humor, it is “Too big to swallow, and too hard
                  to bite” (<title level="m">Sp</title> 262). This brilliant, satirical imagining of
                  commodification displaces the social impotence of rural labor onto the desiccated,
                  devitalized products of that labor which are “mockeries” of masculine prowess and
                  dignity. The importance of this phallic and totemic motif for Bloomfield can be
                  seen in the fact that problematic and over-determined wooden objects are the focus
                  of his two most autobiographical poems <title level="a">To a Spindle</title> and
                     <title level="a">To my Old Oak Table.</title> The motif also reappears in the
                  aptly entitled <title level="a">The Broken Crutch,</title> a poem which, as the
                  title suggests, expresses the frustrated rebelliousness of the rural lower
                     classes.<note place="end" n="52">The motif also recurs in Bloomfield’s warning
                     to other laboring-class writers to not throw away “the honourable staff of
                     mechanic independence” for the “untried and brittle support” of patrons (<title
                        level="m">1827</title> xii).</note>
               </p>
               <p>The same disdain for servility and docility can be seen in the strange episode of
                  the two cruelly treated horses in <title level="m">Winter</title> (154-213). This
                  anecdote is meant to prove the virtues of “duty” and obedient labor, but the
                  argument relies on a brutal comparison between rural and urban exploitation.
                  Whereas “Short-sighted Dobbin” (<title level="m">W</title> 159) suffers mere
                  drudgery and cannot see (understandably) that “Thy chains were freedom, and thy
                  toils repose” (<title level="m">W</title> 162), his urban counterpart the
                  post-horse is callously and horrifically mistreated: “His piece-meal murderers
                  wear his life away” (<title level="m">W</title> 198). Though an anthropomorphic
                  reading of this scene reinforces the perceived “anti-urban” bias of the poem
                  (Lawson 88), the advantages of rural labor are hardly legion, as Dobbin still
                  “wear[s] the clinking chain” (<title level="m">W</title> 158).<note n="53"
                     place="foot" resp="author">William J. Christmas regards the deflected
                     “revolutionary implications” of animal rights scenes in the poem as a way to
                     ensure that “explicit references” to politics would not “derail” Bloomfield’s
                     “first major entrance into literary culture” (“<title level="m">The Farmer’s
                        Boy</title>” 39). If this was the case, it simply reinforces my point that
                     the early readers of <title level="m">FB</title> seemed to be wilfully naïve
                     and ready to overlook the many indirect ways in which the poem evoked a culture
                     of terror and paranoia.</note> Moreover, the violent condemnation of urban
                  culture raises again the vexed question of Bloomfield’s own relation to his
                  formative years in the metropolis. Bloomfield’s urban identity is almost entirely
                  suppressed in his poetry, as if he could only imagine himself as the rural poet of
                  his own legend, but one way to interpret <title level="m">FB</title>’s
                  disturbances is in terms of his anxious and self-questioning urban self—the
                  autodidact poet, the artisan and the father—forcing its way into the text in
                  various disguises.</p>
               <p>Take, for example, the poem’s most sustained full-frontal assault on modernity:
                  this is the passage at the end of <title level="m">Summer</title> which makes a
                  Cobbett-like attack on the gentrification of farming. The first point to note
                  about this tirade is that it focuses on the changed role of the farmer: formerly a
                  “good old Master” who shook his workers’ hands, he is now a collaborator with the
                  “new grandeur” (<title level="m">S</title> 348). In one sense, then, the farmer
                  resembles a compromised patron who has sold his soul to “Bold innovations” (<title
                     level="m">S</title> 384) that “bear no peace beneath their showy dress” (<title
                     level="m">S</title> 385). The sartorial metaphor signifies the farmer’s
                  betrayal of his roots and responsibilities, but behind the farmer is the more
                  general paradigm of social mobility, that anxious move from “humble industry”
                     (<title level="m">S</title> 354) to the “hated face” of “refinement” (<title
                     level="m">S</title> 338). The awkward allegorical question raised by this
                  interjection, therefore, is the extent to which the successful laboring-class
                  poet—who by definition will almost certainly become socially or culturally
                  mobile—can retain an authentic self-identity without selling out to “tyrant
                  customs” (<title level="m">S</title> 335). Bloomfield’s solution to the problem
                  (which, as he was writing the poem, could only be in anticipation) is twofold: to
                  avoid self-incrimination, he displaces the offense onto the farmer; he also
                  polarizes bourgeois “refinement” and “humble” rural life, leaving nothing in
                  between, but in order to do this he has to invent an anonymous and ghostly
                  “mourner” for the lost organic society. This figure acts as a useful
                  pseudo-autobiographical device, enabling Bloomfield to present the most militant
                  “rural” version of himself in the poem: <quote><lg type="stanza">
                        <l rend="#indent2"> Can my sons share from this paternal hand</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2"> The profits with the labours of the land?</l>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> Clearly, this cannot be the actual Bloomfield of 1798, who had lived in
                  London for seventeen years. What seems to be the poem’s most autobiographical
                  intervention is, significantly, an adopted voice, albeit a more elevated persona
                  than the inarticulate Giles: “Let labour have its due; then peace is mine” (<title
                     level="m">S</title> 399). Perhaps this is Bloomfield’s fantasy of the person he
                  might have become if he had stayed in the countryside, but the statement of
                  solidarity with rural labour relies on the effacing of the real, “refined”
                  Bloomfield whose quest for peace was a complex social, intellectual, and cultural
                     affair.<note n="54" place="foot" resp="author">Bloomfield remained uneasy about
                     his role as the noble savage or peasant genius: “And this is no small privilege
                     to a man swung at arm’s length into publicity with all his mechanical habits
                     and embarrassments about him. How far such habits are, or ought to be,
                     overcome, is a question upon which I have not decided: but I have been
                     sometimes hurt, or amused, at witnessing the evident disappointment of such
                     persons as appeared to expect in the writer of pastoral poetry, and literally a
                     cow-boy, the brilliancy and the vivacity of polished conversation; to which I
                     never had made the slightest pretences” (<title level="m">1827</title>
                     iii).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, Bloomfield’s quest to find existential “peace” by confronting the demons
                  of his imagination explains the presence of three seemingly gratuitous episodes in
                  the poem: the mad girl Ann, the marooned Giles (both in <title level="m"
                     >Autumn</title>), and the poem’s climactic scene of terror, the apparition in
                     <title level="m">Winter</title>. Perhaps based on similar figures in Cowper and
                  Goldsmith, Ann (originally named Poll) is the most troubled figure in the poem:
                  “her peace was gone” (<title level="m">A</title> 115) and “Terror and Joy
                  alternate rul’d her hours” (<title level="m">A</title> 121). She could be a fallen
                  woman, though there is less evidence for this than in Wordsworth’s <title
                     level="a">The Thorn.</title> What is clear is that she has suffered arrested
                  development and has become an exile from normal social life. As a “lost child”
                  mourned by her “afflicted parents” (<title level="m">A</title> 128), she is the
                  poem’s most spectacular orphan, detached not only from family life but also from
                  rural culture: “Inverted customs yield her sullen joy”(<title level="m">A</title>
                  130). Ann is a travesty of the organic community, preferring to sleep with pigs
                  than in the “cot’s warm walls” (<title level="m">A</title> 137). She is a blot on
                  the rural landscape, a constant reminder of social and psychological breakdown.
                  But having raised a ghost who threatens the stability of pastoral conventions,
                  Bloomfield has to rebuild those same defenses: his antidote to the mad Ann is to
                  invoke a sentimental stereotype of the humble cottage which restores the Burkean
                  virtues of family life: “Inestimable sweets of social peace!” (<title level="m"
                     >A</title> 176). With this reassurance in place, the poet is able to learn the
                  correct lesson from Ann’s tragic story, “Let peace ne’er leave me, nor my heart
                  grow cold” (<title level="m">A</title> 179).<note n="55" place="foot"
                     resp="author">In a note added to the Preface to the 1809 edition of his poems,
                     Bloomfield finally laid Ann’s ghost to rest, claiming that he had met her on a
                     visit to Honington in 1800 and “found her greatly recovered, and sensible of
                     her past calamity” (cited in Goodridge and Lucas’s 1998 edition, 132n.).</note>
               </p>
               <p>But the peace does not last long, as the very next scene is also about isolation,
                  abandonment and deep inner suffering. When Giles is given an extremely lonely job
                  guarding the crops against birds, his misery is made keener when his friends fail
                  to come and visit him. This neglect deepens the gloomy mood of alienation and
                  entrapment: “If fields are prisons, where is Liberty?” (<title level="m">A</title>
                  226). Moreover, the narrator insists, a broken promise is worse than no promise at
                  all. The breakdown of sociability leaves Giles with one option, to seek
                  consolation in the nostalgic past: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l rend="#indent2"> Back to past joys in vain his thoughts may stray,</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2"> Trace and retrace the beaten, worn-out way,</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2"> The rankling injury will pierce his breast,</l>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> As the retreat into the consolations of “past joys” collapses, the
                  normally compliant Giles becomes a figure of seething discontent and resentment.
                  It is hard not to see this scene as yet further circumstantial evidence of a
                  “rankling injury” of neglect and abandonment under which Bloomfield labored.</p>
               <p>But the culmination of the poem’s engagement with terror is the appearance of the
                  “grisly Spectre” in <title level="m">Winter</title>. This scene is preceded by
                  several violent incidents, notably the “piece-meal” murder of the post-horse and
                  the treacherous nocturnal raids of the mastiff—“A pattern of fidelity by day, / By
                  night a murderer, lurking for his prey” (<title level="m">W</title> 223-4). The
                  mastiff’s victims are “peaceful sheep” (<title level="m">W</title> 226) and their
                  “reeking blood” (<title level="m">W</title> 228) evokes the slaughter at the end
                  of <title level="m">Spring</title>, as if the “reeking” legacy of that scene has
                  to be resolved before <title level="m">FB</title> can end. This closure is sought
                  through several restagings of the problem of failed guardianship. The tone is set
                  by the change of the mastiff from a “midnight Chieftain . . . / Beneath whose
                  guardianship all hearts rejoice” (<title level="m">W</title> 214-15) into a
                  creature which “will from the path of duty err” (<title level="m">W</title> 222).
                  This pattern of lost trust is repeated in the next episode in the poem, in which
                  Giles has to protect his “little flock” against such “nightly terrors” as the
                  mastiff (<title level="m">W</title> 239-40). As Giles wanders through the moonlit
                  fields, his “loos’d imagination” (<title level="m">W</title> 265) compares the
                  nocturnal clouds to a “beauteous ’semblance of a Flock at rest” (<title level="m"
                     >W</title> 260), but this sublimation of the poem’s central symbol of
                  “spotless” innocence is actually a guilty indulgence: “neglected Duty calls; / At
                  once from plains of light to earth he falls” (<title level="m">W</title> 267-8).
                  Recalled from poetry to pastoral duty, Giles finds himself in a “narrow lane”
                     (<title level="m">W</title> 269) which is uncannily both familiar and strange.
                  Temporarily disorientated by his flight of poetic fancy, Giles suddenly finds
                  himself face to face with a “grisly Spectre, cloth’d in silver grey” (<title
                     level="m">W</title> 273). Giles’s response to the apparition is interesting:
                  rather than fleeing, he shows a determination to face down the ghost and prove
                  that it is nothing less than another figment of his imagination. Before he can
                  exorcise the phantom, however, he has to absolve himself of guilt: <quote><lg

                  </quote> With his “conscious Innocence” (<title level="m">W</title> 312) in place,
                  Giles identifies the “motionless deformity” (<title level="m">W</title> 292) of
                  the shape as nothing more than an optical illusion, the visual tricks played by
                  bright moonlight on an “aged” ash tree. Far from being a threat, the tree is
                  actually a symbol of order and reparation: “Its perfect lineaments at once appear,
                  / Its crown of shiv’ring ivy whispering peace” (<title level="m">W</title> 306-7).
                  This symbolic reversal is not only a victory over stereotypical rustic
                     superstition,<note n="56" place="foot" resp="author">See, for example, Richard

                  allegorical victory for the poem. By banishing the specter, Giles has acquired new
                  psychic parents, “loit’ring Reason” and “Truth” (<title level="m">W</title> 316).
                  These are the “blest guardians” (<title level="m">W</title> 317) who will
                  “tranquillize his breast” (<title level="m">W</title> 319) and fulfill the promise
                  of <title level="m">Summer</title> when, temporarily, “Peace o’er his slumbers
                  wave[d] her guardian wing” (<title level="m">S</title> 109).<note n="57"

                  if all terrors have finally been expelled from the poem, the stage is now set for
                  a final reenactment of virtuous guardianship in the re-fleecing of the orphan
                  lambs. Yet, as discussed earlier, this festive resolution relies on two unstable
                  textual devices: the “Dam” who is “cheated into tenderness,” and the amnesiac
                  rechristening of the poem as a series of “Delightful moments!”</p>

                  for this exploration, the story does not end there. In the limited space
                  remaining, I want to offer brief readings of some of Bloomfield’s subsequent works
                  through the same allegorical lens of terror, trauma, and insecurity.</p>
               <p>The failure of <title level="m">FB</title> to exorcise Bloomfield’s personal
                  terrors is vividly evident in a letter written to George in 1801. Plagued by ill
                  health and depression, Bloomfield reveals that “I tried to sooth my pain with
                  poetry, to exert myself forcibly, and to conquer by a <foreign>coup de
                     main</foreign>, the imaginary evils that beset me, for imaginary they certainly
                  were in a great degree.”<note n="59" place="foot" resp="author">Letter 55, 27
                     August 1801.</note> With this hauntology in mind, the next text which invites
                  interpretation is <title level="a">The Fakenham Ghost,</title> a comic ballad
                  about a rustic woman who, while returning home one night, mistakes a lost ass’s
                  foal for a phantom. The poem was published in Bloomfield’s second collection
                     <title level="m">Rural Tales, Ballads and Songs</title> (1802), and an
                  introductory note states that the incident is a local legend and “is still related
                  by my Mother.”<note n="60" place="foot" resp="author">I have used the text in
                     Goodridge and Lucas’s 1998 edition. Line numbers are in parentheses after the
                     quotation.</note> Given that the story takes place in Euston Park, the country
                  seat of Bloomfield’s patron the Duke of Grafton, there seems little reason, on
                  first inspection, not to take Bloomfield at his word. However, once we place the
                  poem in the context of Bloomfield’s continuing “imaginary evils,” a darker,
                  richer, and multilayered text emerges.</p>
               <p><title level="a">The Fakenham Ghost</title> is much more than a lightweight piece
                  of Suffolk literary lore. Its plot conspicuously reworks the two major episodes
                  which conclude <title level="m">FB</title>, an encounter between a terrified
                  rustic and a specter and a healing act of animal adoption. In the reconfigured
                  psychic landscape of trauma and reparation of the later poem, there are three
                  important changes of setting and personae. First, the role of Giles is replaced by
                  “an ancient Dame” (5); second, the “Monster” is not a tree but an “<emph>Ass’s
                     Foal</emph>” which has “lost its Dam” (61); third, the location is Euston Park
                  not Sapiston. These revisions can yield all kinds of fascinating
                  psycho-biographical results. For example, if we see the “ancient Dame” as a
                  surrogate mother figure—and as the introductory note makes clear, Bloomfield’s
                  mother is one of the keepers of the tale—then it is possible to conclude that the
                  poem is a form of symbolic castigation. As “darker fears / Came o’er her troubled
                  mind” (21-2) she “own’d her sins, and down she knelt” (39). The “trotting ghost”
                  (31) which stalks her is not only her own conscience but Bloomfield’s “troubled
                  mind” pursuing its psychic prey (with the slightly comic word “trotting” connoting
                  the ballad meter which is serving as the instrument of the pursuit). The comic
                  resolution of the plot is of course one way to discharge all this painful
                  material, and there could be a hint of self-mockery in the transformation of the
                  “imp of sin” (65) into an orphaned ass’s foal. The adoption of this “shaggy
                  stranger” (67) by the Dame is in some ways a more satisfactory resolution than the
                  end of <title level="m">FB</title>, as the mother is actually human, but on the
                  other hand the assimilation remains a “joke” (76) and the “favourite” is still
                  called a “Ghost” (73).</p>
               <p>The relocation of the action to Euston Park is also interesting, as it signifies
                  Grafton’s new role as Bloomfield’s patron. If, at some unconscious level,
                  Bloomfield is the “shaggy stranger,” then it is ultimately Grafton who “kept the
                  joke alive” (76). But there is another ghost haunting this landscape. Buried away
                  in Bloomfield’s memory is another diabolical trespasser in Fakenham Wood. In one
                  of the <title level="a">Anecdotes and Observations</title> which were published in
                  the second volume of <title level="m">Remains</title>, Bloomfield recalls being
                  told that the young Thomas Paine and his sister once wandered into these same
                     woods.<note n="61" place="foot" resp="author"><title level="m">Remains</title>
                     2: 85-6.</note> As Bloomfield notes wryly, “I had the misfortune to be born
                  only six miles from the birthplace of Tom Paine!! This, to some ears would be
                  horrible” (<title level="m">Remains</title> 2: 345; see also letter 354, 31 May-1
                  June 1821). As if to guard against any suggestion of Painite sympathies,
                  Bloomfield states that he heard about the incident in a roundabout way: the story
                  came from his friend Dr. Walker who was returning from Egypt (where he had just
                  given “vaccine inoculation” to troops) when he met Paine in Paris. Apparently,
                  Paine and his sister went into the wood to collect nuts, without telling their
                  parents. They became lost (“wandered out of their knowledge”), so Tom climbed a
                  tree to “see his way out of the wood” but fell and narrowly avoided serious
                  injury. Walker (as reported by Bloomfield) remarks “that there are many thousands
                  who will probably exclaim: ‘What a pity that he had not broke his neck!’” but in
                  Paris the response was different. One of Walker’s interlocutors remarks that “The
                  guardian angel of Liberty was near thee, Thomas.” In this highly mediated episode,
                  Fakenham Wood becomes nothing less that the site of a revolutionary <foreign>deus
                     ex machina</foreign> and the place where Britain’s homegrown “imp of sin” found
                  deliverance. The other “joke” of the poem is therefore its satirical
                  allegorization of counter-revolutionary hysteria and the pacification of
                  Jacobinism, and it is worth noting that 1802 was the year when invasion fears and
                  loyalist mobilization reached their peak. Hence the poem’s ending could contain a
                  covert allusion to ongoing political repression: <quote><lg type="stanza">

                     </lg>
                  </quote> In the spirit of that playful but penetrating word “conviction,” I want
                  to suggest that <title level="a">The Fakenham Ghost</title> is a highly spun fable
                  of terror and salvation in which the symbolic aim is to reunify the body politic
                  and inoculate the poet and the reader against the Pain(e) of the traumatic loss of
                  the mother (country).</p>
               <p>Yet this incursion of a suppressed revolutionary narrative into a seemingly
                  artless ballad shows that Bloomfield’s “rural” themes remained infected with the
                  discourse of terror and the burdens of a troubled consciousness. It is revealing
                  that Paine’s “fall” entered <title level="a">The Fakenham Ghost</title> through
                  the agency of a physician who administered “vaccine inoculation” to the army, as
                  if immunization symbolized both a medical and ideological barrier against
                     contamination.<note n="62" place="foot" resp="author">See Roland Barthes on

                  the integrity of both the organic community and pastoral poetry. Inoculation
                  represents both the “emancipation of the human race” (18) and “private peace”
                  (35); it banishes painful memories of loss and achieves a perfect victory
                  “unstain’d with gore” (36), the ideal theme for “the glory of the pastoral reed”

                  The common thread which runs through nearly all of Bloomfield’s post-<title
                     level="m">FB</title> poems is the family romance: the loss and recovery of
                  actual or surrogate family members. Looked at superficially, there is nothing
                  surprising about finding this traditional theme in collections of rural verse with
                  titles such as <title level="m">Wild Flowers</title> (1806) and <title level="m"
                     >May Day with the Muses</title> (1822), but for Bloomfield the family romance
                  was an aesthetic and psychic space in which he could revisit and re-stage his
                  “boyage” from childhood separation to the ambiguous rewards of patronage. The most
                  symptomatic text in this context is probably <title level="a">The Broken
                     Crutch</title> (1806),<note n="66" place="foot" resp="author">I have used the
                     text in Goodridge and Lucas’s 1998 edition.</note> a poem which seems to
                  strenuously undermine itself. The story shows the humiliation of a “plebeian” man
                  who mistakenly tries to defend the honor of his niece against a landowner he
                  mistakenly perceives to be predatory: the “broken crutch” of the title is a symbol
                  of emasculation which converts popular protest into another “joke” and idealizes
                  the paternalist virtues of the niece’s suitor. Yet this victory (“unstain’d with
                  gore”) sits uneasily with an angry interjection in which the poet denounces the
                  “murderous axe” of enclosure (57-78), leaving the reader unsure about the poem’s
                  loyalties. Similarly, it is hard to know if Sir Ambrose Higham, the patron of
                     <title level="m">May Day with the Muses</title>, is a figure of unconditional
                  praise (which seems to be the prevailing critical opinion) or “sculking”
                  resentments. Given that Bloomfield wrote this last collection of poems in poverty
                  and “a wretched state of health,”<note n="67" place="foot" resp="author">Robert

                     Farmer’s Boy</title>’s status as the “foundational text for Romantic-era
                  laboring-class poetry.”<note n="69" place="foot" resp="author"> McEathron,
                     Introduction 47. </note> If my argument has been at all persuasive, the obvious
                  next step is to extend this allegorical and psycho-biographical approach to the
                  wider laboring-class tradition. What could emerge from such work is a new
                  aesthetics of laboring-class writing which does full justice to the unique “mental
                  pains” of the plebeian author, and which avoids or complements the critical
                  imperative to prove or disprove explicit ideological affiliations. Laboring-class
                  writing is by definition a radical culture issue; the question which remains is
                  precisely how we configure and value the full creative range and depth of such
                  writing, and the extent to which we are prepared to confront some of our own
                  mythologies in the process.</p>
