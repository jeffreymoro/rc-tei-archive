                  <p>The tendency to associate the value of a particular literary work with the personal
                     probity of its author had characterized the polite reception of laboring-class poetry
                     ever since Oxford professor Joseph Spence wrote his influential account of Stephen
                     Duck in the early eighteenth century. Emphasizing his industriousness, contentment,
                     and piety, Spence praised the way that Duck displayed “so many Merits, and so much
                     Humility join’d together,” evincing, for example, a preference for the religious and
                     moral writings of Addison rather than the low burlesques of street literature (27).
                     From Stephen Duck to John Clare, the laboring-class poet was expected by the polite
                     to conform to a model of exemplary private virtue, diligent, dutiful, and suitably
                     distanced from what were perceived to be the vulgar elements of collective plebeian
                     life.

                     </div> But this image acquired a new urgency with the growth of popular radicalism in the
                     late eighteenth century, and especially amidst the counter-revolutionary climate that
                     witnessed, with the publication of <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> in 1800, the transformation of Robert Bloomfield from anonymous shoemaker to literary
                     celebrity.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Indeed, shortly after Bloomfield’s death in 1823, the editor of his <em>Remains</em>, his friend Joseph Weston, sought to establish the poet’s posthumous reputation by
                  commending not only the excellence of his verse, but also the spotlessness of his
                  character. And it was precisely to counter damaging rumors concerning his allegedly
                  irregular religious beliefs, at a time when such beliefs were regarded as potential
                  accessories of insurrection, that Weston set about to defend the poet’s personal morality.
                  “The virtues . . . of this excellent man,” proclaimed Weston, “did not protect him
                  from the shafts of calumny; on a point too, which . . . must have wounded his sensitive
                  heart, for it chilled the affection of his earliest friends. The world will learn
                  with astonishment, that Bloomfield has been traduced on the subject of religion!—Robert
                  Bloomfield!—whose life was one pure and gentle stream of overflowing kindness;—in
                  whose meek and quiet spirit there was ‘<em>indeed</em> no guile;’ whose conversations and writings were ever filled with incentives to piety”
                  (1: xx-xxi).</p>
               <p>As several contributors to this issue point out, among those friends most troubled
                  by rumors of Bloomfield’s dangerous religious and political views was T. J. Lloyd
                  Baker. In a series of letters of 1821, Lloyd Baker demanded that the poet, then experiencing
                  severe poverty and ill health, clarify his beliefs for the peace of mind of his supporters.
                  The letters implied that Bloomfield’s wife’s devotion to the provincial servant-prophetess,
                  Joanna Southcott, had somehow rubbed off on the poet, leading him to forgo church
                  attendance, as if religious heterodoxy were a natural stepping stone to infidelity.
                  Worse still, Lloyd Baker had heard rumors that Bloomfield had got into the habit of
                  reading radical periodical publications, which aimed to overthrow the established
                  government. And from these “two circumstances,” Lloyd Baker concluded, “the idea”
                  had spread that Bloomfield had “imbibed Deistical &amp; Republican principles”—beliefs
                  “frequently united in the same persons” (letter 351, 23 May 1821). Such rumors had
                  apparently led many of Bloomfield’s polite friends—and it was only the friendship
                  of the affluent that Lloyd Baker thought it was worthwhile preserving—to withdraw
                  their support, respect, and financial aid. But although professing to write with the
                  intention of restoring the goodwill of his polite friends, this was conditional on
                  an appropriately conservative response, and Lloyd Baker later conceded that it would
                  be “highly wrong in any person . . . to associate with, &amp; to give countenance to a
                  man” desirous of undermining the “Church or Government of this country” (letter 353,
                  29 May 1821). Understandably, Bloomfield was offended by the letter, not least because
                  none of these supposed friends were presently providing any financial assistance whatsoever.
                  He was also clearly incensed at the assumption that his personal life was the proper
                  object of surveillance by people of a superior social class, a feeling that had plagued
                  him throughout his literary career, whether he was regarded as a “curiosity” or, as
                  in this instance, a “dangerous man” (letter 351). But perhaps what infuriated Bloomfield
                  most of all was the fact that the letters forced him to compromise his independence
                  by explicating his views on two subjects, religion and politics, which, in the year
                  he first entered the polite literary scene, he had resolved not to discuss either
                  in his intimate letters or in his public writings.</p>
               <p>This essay takes as its point of departure Bloomfield’s repeated and strenuous claim
                  in his correspondence that he saw himself as a poet, not a politician. It should be
                  stressed that this was a position Bloomfield maintained to people of all political
                  persuasions: radical, liberal, and conservative. As he wrote in 1804 to the bookseller,
                  poet and republican, Thomas Clio Rickman, “I . . . have four years past made a determination
                  to be nutral in Politicks and Religion . . . <em>I must and will</em> be as <em>private</em> a Man as pastoral poetry will permit me to be, or subjects that involve not creeds
                  and systems of which all the world knows I have had small means of judging” (letter
                  129, 29 May 1804). Such a comment apparently endorsed the age-old dictum that those
                  engaged in manual work did not possess the leisure necessary for formulating accurate
                  political judgments, an idea endlessly repeated in loyalist propaganda from the 1790s
                  onward. “How can we expect to receive pure instruction,” asked one clergyman, “if
                  we . . . draw our notions of national policy from the lips of a labourer or mechanic?”
                  (Hurdis 41). But Bloomfield had a deep respect for the intellectual capacity of rural
                  and urban workers, and he was contemptuous of the tendency of the rich and polite
                  to denigrate the experiences, expressions, and aspirations of laboring people. “I
                  have heard more sense and truth in a tap-room, than I have sometimes heard in better
                  company; and there is nothing more striking to me . . . than that <em>total</em> ignorance of the <em>manner of living</em> among the poor . . . of what they talk, and of what they think! Nothing to me has
                  appeared more strange or more disgusting, than finding amongst those ranks, raised
                  above the mechanic and labourer, such a mean opinion of the poor!” (<em>Remains</em> 2: 71-72). Furthermore, as this comment attests, Bloomfield did express strong beliefs
                  on a range of social and economic questions, though these did not fit neatly into
                  the polarized political culture characteristic of the post-revolutionary period.</p>
               <p>All this seems to support the view that Bloomfield pandered to the conservative impulses
                  of the polite reading public by disingenuously representing himself as an exclusively
                  pastoral poet, as unconcerned with political subjects as the rural laboring people
                  he idealized in his poetry (Sales 18-22). And it is true that throughout Bloomfield’s
                  career, both detractors and sympathizers often described him simply as “the Farmer’s
                  Boy.” For William Hazlitt, for example, this appellation aptly reflected the fact
                  that “his Muse has something not only rustic, but menial in her aspect . . . Bloomfield
                  never gets beyond his own experience; and that is somewhat confined” (145). But Bloomfield’s
                  poetry has recently been shown to disclose a complex engagement with contemporary
                  political debate, drawing eclectically on the wide variety of radical discourses to
                  which he had been exposed during his long association with urban artisan culture (Christmas
                  27-48; White 10-25, 132-42). Even so, the distinction Bloomfield made between poetry
                  and politics deserves to be taken seriously, for his correspondence reveals this to
                  be more than just a marketing ploy, and it sheds much light on the difficulties faced
                  by plebeian autodidacts during this era of political agitation and reaction. While
                  for obvious reasons this particular laboring-class poet clearly felt more comfortable
                  commenting on political subjects in his private letters than in his literary publications,
                  it is of enormous interest, I think, that his letters nevertheless communicate a general
                  desire to find in poetry a space apart from divisive political debate, even when it
                  might have been safe to admit otherwise.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Before examining these issues, it is important to recall that the concept of natural
                     genius flourished in polite society at the same time as the political horizons of
                     plebeians were broadening, a development initiated by the Wilkes affair and then massively
                     escalated by the British response to the French Revolution.

                     </div> The rehabilitation of Shakespeare and the cult of Ossian, together with a new degree
                     of emphasis on the primitivism of “peasant” poetry, all occurred against a background
                     of polite anxiety about the increasing political activity of laboring people. In the
                     1770s, for example, the author of <em>The Minstrel</em> lamented that “All ranks are run mad with politics”; and Elizabeth Montagu—patron
                     of plebeian poetry and author of an important essay on original genius—despaired that
                     “Treason was talked in every Alehouse, and sung in every street” (Forbes 1: 158; Blunt
                     2: 76). Unlike these debating, ballad-singing plebeian patriots, the embodiment of
                     original genius was imagined as a quiet individual, whose strong sensibility and powerful
                     imagination ideally found succor in domestic and natural spaces, away from the tumult
                     of collective popular leisure or public political action. To quote one aesthetician,
                     such a person conceived poetry as a “sanctuary from which the noise and folly of mankind
                     are excluded,” a “refuge from the numerous perplexities of human life” (Duff 363).
                     In this context, given that every laboring-class poet had to identify as a natural
                     genius in order to satisfy polite taste, secure patronage, and therefore get into
                     print, this theory provided a potential vehicle for drawing upwardly aspiring artisans
                     away from the expanding sphere of popular radicalism. The significance of this is
                     reinforced by the fact that not only did many plebeian reformers have literary aspirations,
                     but, besides politics, poetry was the primary means by which artisans could satisfy
                     their intellectual ambitions.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Perhaps the most intriguing example of the literary aspirations of plebeian political
                              activists is the case of the London Corresponding Society member Richard “Citizen”

                     </div> Well before the shoemaker Allen Davenport embarked on his career as a Spencean and
                     Chartist radical, for example, he was fantasizing about cutting a figure in the world
                     of literature, seeking to climb “Mount Parnassus” and envisioning himself as a “little
                     rustic bard” (5).</p>
               </div>
               <p>To a large extent, Bloomfield genuinely embraced the idea of natural genius and gained
                  much confidence from its privileging of feeling, inspiration, and simplicity over
                  learning and artifice. Plebeian autodidacts characteristically experienced great discouragement
                  in their literary endeavors as they confronted the aesthetic standards and other invisible
                  boundaries that had formerly policed access to polite culture. As Davenport wrote,
                  reading the poetry of Pope operated to all but “extinguish every spark of my poetic
                  genius. I felt ashamed of my own, as I now thought, wretched doggerel” (15-16). Likewise,
                  in the year before Bloomfield would be buoyed up by the overwhelmingly positive reception
                  of his first published poem, he remarked of the supreme arbiter of neoclassical taste
                  that “Dr. Johnson . . . is a ‘Thwackum’ amongst criticks; I allways look at him and
                  his abilities with a mixture of reverence and anger” (letter 16, 8 September - 6 October
                  1799). This anger was at least partly informed by Bloomfield’s rejection of the assumption
                  that the republic of letters was the exclusive preserve of classically educated men
                  of leisure, a notion evidenced by Johnson’s condescending dismissal of an earlier
                  shoemaker poet James Woodhouse: “better . . . furnish the man with good implements
                  for his trade, than raise subscriptions for his poems. He may make an excellent shoemaker,
                  but can never make a good poet” (Boswell 444).</p>
               <p>By contrast, while Wordsworth had in some measure simply placed the authority of men
                  of leisure on a different footing, Bloomfield was greatly encouraged by the polite
                  Romantic poet’s attempt “to come near,” if not actually speak, “the language of Men”
                  (letter 94, 2 September 1804). After reading <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> in 1801, he wrote excitedly to his brother, George, “if there is no poetry in them
                  I will give up my pretension to feeling and Nature. I can trust you I think to be
                  struck with them, first with the extreem simplicity, and then for what I before mentioned,
                  NATURE” (letter 52, 19 April 1801). The potentially leveling implications of this
                  conception of poetry were not lost on Bloomfield, and, in his first address to the
                  public, his preface to <em>Rural Tales</em>, he declared “I feel peculiarly gratified in finding that a poor man in England may
                  assert the dignity of Virtue, and speak of the imperishable beauties of Nature, and
                  be heard, and heard, perhaps, with greater attention for his being poor” (iv). In
                  this sense, Bloomfield found the theory of natural genius immensely attractive, for
                  it popularized an aesthetic which enabled him to circumvent at least some of the obstacles
                  to polite literary culture.</p>
               <p>But if the idea of natural genius permitted plebeian poets to enter the republic of
                  letters, it did so under terms that emphatically excluded their participation in the
                  public sphere of politics. In an early issue of the official journal of the London
                  Corresponding Society, a contributor argued that it was “once the distinguished office
                  of poetry to awaken and cherish [the] heroic virtues,” before suggesting that, like
                  liberty, such a function no longer prevailed in the present “degenerate age” (<em>Moral and Political Magazine</em> 1 [1796]: 26). And one of the aims of the journal was to reclaim for an artisan occupational
                  group the public purpose of poetry against what was perceived to be its increasingly
                  private range of concerns. For most commentators, however, the qualities attributed
                  to the natural genius—enthusiasm, imagination, simplicity, sensibility, impetuosity,
                  and wildness—remained a source of enormous value in the context of poetic production.
                  It was just that these qualities were conceived as thoroughly incompatible with the
                  more overtly rational skills thought necessary for effective participation in political
                  debate (Barrell 11-13).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Most famously, in a critique of the sentimental language of Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft
                     asserted that the natural genius was a figure too impulsive and too controlled by
                     the imagination to qualify for citizenship. Although Wollstonecraft admired the “genuine
                     enthusiasm of genius,” she consigned it to the “infancy of civilization” for, in modern
                     Britain, liberty was possible precisely because “reason” had clipped the “wing of
                     fancy” and the “youth” had become a “man” (28). Small wonder, then, that Thomas Paine
                     decided to pursue a course of self-education in natural and social philosophy, noting
                     that “I had some turn . . . for poetry; but this I rather repressed than encouraged,
                     as leading too much into the field of imagination” (49). Nor is it surprising that
                     John Thelwall would justify his literary endeavors to a reading public still largely
                     hostile to his former career as a radical orator on the grounds that his proven failure
                     in politics would mean probable success in poetry. With a heavy dose of irony, Thelwall
                     announced that “since he has proved so bad a politician as to plunge himself and his
                     family in ruin . . . it ought to be regarded as an argument <span class="foreign">a priori</span> in favour of his poetical talent: that species of imprudence . . . having always been
                     considered as a distinguishing characteristic of those whom Apollo and the Muse inspire”
                     (xliv). To put it simply, what were thought to be assets in poetry acquired a largely
                     pejorative connotation when carried over to the sphere of politics. This was particularly
                     true for the prototypical plebeian poet, who was routinely represented as a child
                     of nature, a figure unassisted by civilization, and therefore implicitly deficient
                     in such mature, masculine attributes as reason, self-command, and foresight.

               <p>Accordingly, the <em>British Critic</em> began its review of Bloomfield’s second publication, <em>Rural Tales</em>, with an acknowledgement that the periodical’s focus had shifted from a serious to
                  a trivial, if still gratifying, subject. “We are pleasingly called away from our abstruser
                  studies, by these productions of a genuine Child of Nature”; and the review concluded
                  by praising this “original genius” as the “genuine inspiration of a mind, whose thoughts
                  and feelings turn naturally to poetry” (<em>British Critic</em> 19 [1802]: 338). Similarly infantilizing was the conclusion of another critic that
                  “if we behold in Thomson an elegant scholar adorning the simple beauties of nature
                  from the stores of a cultivated mind, we see in Robert Bloomfield, a simple farmer’s
                  boy, painting such scenes as no poet need be ashamed” (Anderson 3: 391). The implication
                  is that a laborer could be a poet but not a poet and a scholar, a distinction which
                  ensured that laboring-class poetry was regarded as a relatively superficial, even
                  childish, pursuit, permitted to please but not to please and instruct. As Charles
                  Lamb very bluntly put it, “I have had the felicity of hearing George Dyer read out
                  one book of ‘The Farmer’s Boy.’ I thought it rather childish. No doubt there is originality
                  in it . . . but no <em>selection</em>” (1: 162).</p>
               <p>Bloomfield was surprised at receiving such a positive response from the conservative
                  press, primarily because his patron, Capel Lofft, was a prominent radical figure and
                  a member of the polite reform association, the Society for Constitutional Information.
                  In fact, Lofft had used the preface to <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> to express a number of political views, much to the poet’s frustration. In a letter
                  to his brother George, Bloomfield wrote of the <em>British Critic</em> and the <em>Anti-Jacobin Review</em> in the context of their admiration for <em>Rural Tales</em>, “they are <em>avowd</em> partizans on the side of existing Systems, and existing abuses, and . . . I may think
                  <em>myself</em> well off to have escaped their lash” (letter 83, 3 May 1802). But the representation
                  of the plebeian poet as a natural genius found a congenial home in conservative culture,
                  undoubtedly because it enabled a talented and aspiring laborer to be celebrated for
                  possessing qualities which disqualified him from participating in the public realm
                  of politics.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In its review of <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em>, for example, the <em>British Critic</em> drew from the preface of the poem to emphasize the fact that Bloomfield had conscientiously
                     avoided a “combination among . . . journeymen shoemakers,” projecting an image of
                     a sensitive individual, opposed to collective artisan activity (15 [1800]: 602). Yet,
                     like most shoemaker poets, Bloomfield remained proud of his artisan heritage, and
                     he greatly admired the socialized forms of knowledge generated in the workshop, an
                     environment which played a formative role in nurturing his intellectual and poetic
                     endeavors.

                              pride, often defied the model of natural genius, as revealed by Keegan 195-217.</span></div>
                     </div> “In our trade,” he wrote, “when any one reads the newspapers or a book, by the neighbourly
                     custom of sitting all in one room . . . we have nothing to do, but to discuss the
                     subject. <em>Community</em>, is perhaps the point, to which those who say that ‘shoemakers are politicians,’
                     might trace the solution of their wonder” (<em>Remains</em> 2: 91-92). Equally significant, he added, this custom not only fostered the acquisition
                     of political knowledge, but also intellectual reflection of all sorts, again underscoring
                     his belief in the dignity of the “talk of the tap-room.” If the <em>British Critic</em> sought to distance Bloomfield from what was perceived as a vulgar and dangerous artisan
                     milieu, however, it simultaneously denied his ability to join the ranks of the polite
                     and to write poetry of a public or political character. “The writer’s observations
                     will not be found to have been very extensive . . . and he appears to have attended
                     to many minute circumstances, which would probably have escaped a loftier mind” (<em>British Critic</em> 15 [1800]: 602). Similarly, the poem had “various errors and defects,” as if to confirm
                     that Bloomfield possessed genius, but not the authoritative rationality of the man
                     of taste; nevertheless, such blemishes, the review suggested, were outweighed by the
                     expression of “poetical feeling” and “warm and vigorous imagination,” with the accompanying
                     implication that <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> should be read for its sentimental rather than its intellectual content (<em>British Critic</em> 15 [1800]: 601). And this appeal to sensibility enabled the <em>British Critic</em> to subsequently disregard as an irrelevance those “melancholy” “reflections” on the
                     harvest home, which indicated that the “author [had] received some impressions, probably
                     at the debating-society, of a questionable kind” (15 [1800]: 604).</p>

                              Bloomfield identified in the harvest home passage as causes of the oppression of the
                              poor: “the reduction of small farms . . . the extravagant appearance and profits of
                              farmers” and “the extravagancies and luxuries of individuals” (103).</span></div>

                     </div> Through Capel Lofft, he met and became friends with Bloomfield, whom he introduced
                     into his polite literary circles in the early 1800s. Of <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em>, Dyer described in a letter to Lofft how “it recalled to my mind those ages and those
                     countries in which the Poet and the Shepherd were more naturally united . . . . Your
                     Shepherd’s Boy with the poetical character that he undoubtedly possesses, requires
                     indeed no other name; poetry is more immediately the language of nature . . . I can
                     truly say I have been charmed with his Seasons, and that my heart echoes back every
                     thing said by you in the preface” (letter 51, 19 April 1801). This conception of poetry
                     as a literary form that had been debased by the advance of commercial refinement constituted
                     a cultural version of the age-old condemnation of luxury, which became a staple of
                     radical argument in the post-revolutionary period. To quote Thelwall, “let us . .
                     . labour to abolish luxury. . . . Let us . . . persuade mankind to discard those tinsel
                     ornaments and ridiculous superfluities, which enfeeble our minds, and entail voluptuous
                     diseases on the affluent, while diseases of a more calamitous description overwhelm
                     the oppressed orders of society from the scarcity resulting from this extravagance”
                     (Claeys 67). In the process of increasing social inequality, so the logic ran, luxury
                     corrupted the taste of the polite, leading to the predominance of a form of literature
                     governed by the shallow imperatives of fashion. But if the theory of natural genius
                     could be hitched to a radical political argument, Dyer implicitly imagined its embodiment,
                     Bloomfield, as a pre-political subject, a “Shepherd’s Boy,” as deficient in the mature,
                     masculine virtue of reason as he was free from the modern, feminine vice of sensuality.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>And yet the image of the natural genius was also invoked in radical polemic as a herald
                     of revolutionary ardor, whose lack of exposure to polite learning and other sorts
                     of cultural refinement provided the basis for an authentic critique of the subservience
                     of the literary establishment to an aristocratic political system. In an untitled
                     poem he contributed to the <em>Moral and Political Magazine</em>, for example, Dyer proclaimed that the “poet’s untaught lays” were essential to the
                     extension of “Justice,” part of a “purer song” of “Freedom” which served “Virtue’s
                     cause” (1 [1796]: 95). The iconic figure in this respect, of course, was Burns. Indeed,
                     the “ploughboy poet” was celebrated in the same magazine as an oppressed genius, whose
                     neglect exemplified the prejudice of polite culture and its associated refusal to
                     encourage talent in and diffuse knowledge among laboring people (<em>Moral and Political Magazine</em> 2 [1797]: 48).

                     </div> But such an argument was even more fraught with ambivalence. For it focused on the
                     talent of the “untaught,” “primitive” poet in order to justify an enlightenment belief
                     in the need to advance the improvement of laboring people, through the provision of
                     polite forms of knowledge no less than the support of plebeian varieties of self-education,

                     institutions available to artisan men in late eighteenth-century London, including
                     newspapers, periodicals, dissenting meeting houses, and debating societies.

                     the passing of the Gagging Acts in the mid-1790s: “It is another of the Constitutional
                     Refinements of these times to have fettered, and as to every valuable purpose, silenced,
                     these Debating Societies. They were at least, to say the lowest of them, far better
                     amusements than drunkenness, gambling, or fighting. They were no useless Schools to
                     some of our very celebrated Speakers at the Bar and in Parliament; and, what is of
                     infinitely more importance, they contributed to the diffusion of Political Knowledge
                     and Public Sentiment” (Bloomfield, <em>Farmer’s Boy</em> vii). In this way, Bloomfield was held up by Lofft to support the radical and liberal
                     notion that the present climate of surveillance and censorship threatened to stifle
                     the moral and intellectual improvement of laboring people, thereby leading to the
                     growth of those brutish, vulgar pastimes which had long been considered by individuals
                     of all political persuasions to be a lamentable hallmark of plebeian culture.</p>

                  <p>On the issues of refinement, poetic liberty, and popular education, Bloomfield clearly
                     shared many of these radical views, though he maintained a far less censorious attitude
                     to the demotic culture of laboring people. He certainly welcomed at least some of
                     the effects of the French Revolution and subscribed to the principle that the freedom
                     of the press was a vital index of liberty, presently under assault by the government.
                     “I still think that the general system of instruction, and the downfall of the feudal
                     rights of families, with the present religious toleration &amp;c are fruits of the revolution
                     not to be despised” he wrote to George, his most trusted correspondent during the
                     early stages of his career; and he then added “I should like to gossip with you face
                     to face . . . particularly on the subject of englands boast ‘the liberty of the press’”
                     (letter 133, 10 June 1804).

               <p>Something of his general outlook may be indicated by his letter to the minor poet,
                  Samuel Jackson Pratt. In Pratt’s protest poem <em>Bread</em>, the poverty that became so controversial during the famine years of 1795-1796 and
                  1800-1801 was represented not simply as the result of a series of bad harvests, but
                  as the consequence of an array of unjust human developments, including enclosure,
                  monopolization, the deregulation of the grain trade, and the introduction of the gentleman
                  farmer, leaving the poor “robb’d of each right that God bestows on man” (14). After
                  receiving an adulatory letter and copy of the poem from Pratt, Bloomfield replied:
                  <span class="quote">‘Your letter and your Poem on so great and so interesting a subject as

                     myself, that, increase of population and increase of individual comforts are not enemys
                     and strangers to each other. (letter 87, 28 May 1802)’</span> Such a position did not fit comfortably within the dividing lines of contemporary
                  political debate. Most obviously, it combined the Malthusian notion that a growing
                  population inevitably led to a rise in inequality with the rough agrarian egalitarianism
                  of Goldsmith, which was based on the contrary belief that a large, increasing rural
                  population was absolutely essential to the health of the nation. To some extent, this
                  was characteristic of the way Bloomfield, perhaps drawing on his artisan heritage,
                  felt confident to assert an independence of viewpoint on social and economic questions,
                  even to people of a superior class. As he wrote to his mother, “Don’t be alarm’d for
                  my safety I am no politician . . . I am my own master yet, and mean to remain so”
                  (letter 42, 3 November 1800).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But the reference to Goldsmith is particularly revealing in light of Bloomfield’s
                     claim that the discussion of political issues was inappropriate in pastoral poetry.
                     For not only did <em>The Deserted Village</em> directly address such subjects, but Goldsmith’s poem became thoroughly politicized
                     during the 1790s and beyond, giving expression to the grievances of rural and urban
                     workers alike. Accordingly, it was extracted in a number of radical plebeian periodicals,
                     from <em>Pig’s Meat</em> (1 [1795]: 33-36) to the <em>Moral and Political Magazine</em> (1 [1796]: 320), as well as in later pamphlets on the condition of the rural laboring
                     poor. In fact, in 1807, the author of one of these pamphlets argued, as Bloomfield
                     everywhere implied in his poetry, that a terrible decline in the condition of the
                     rural laboring poor had occurred “within the last half century,” and that, as a consequence,
                     rural leisure practices had to be respected and agricultural wages had to be raised:
                     “let the Peasant’s labour have its due” (Brewer 6, 14). On the other hand, Bloomfield’s
                     friend, the Devonshire poet, William Holloway, published an anti-pastoral poem, <em>The Peasants Fate</em>, in 1802, which was lambasted in the conservative press, in part for borrowing its
                     imagery and subject matter from <em>The Deserted Village</em>. To quote the <em>British Critic</em>, just as the author was “full of particular discontent and <em>universal benevolence</em>,” so the poem lacked feeling, failing to “raise it above flatness” (19 [1802]: 533-34).
                     As evident in an 1802 letter, Bloomfield followed the reviews of Holloway’s poetry,
                     so he would almost certainly have known that his friend was given short shrift for
                     being one of those writers who “profess to illuminate as well as to delight the public
                     by their poetical productions; and who think that questions of statistical and political
                     œconomy can be advantageously discussed in a series of descriptive couplets” (<em>Monthly Review</em> 40 [1803]: 98).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The reviewer ridiculed the basic premise of The Peasants Fate, as described in the
                              poem’s preface: “The drift of this little attempt is principally designed, (without
                              adverting to political argument,) to shadow forth the evils arising to the peasantry
                              of this country, from the system of engrossing small farms, and driving the hereditary
                              occupiers to the necessity of embracing a maritime or military life for support, or
                              being reduced to the most abject state of dependence, and submitting to the galling
                              hardship of becoming servants on the spot where they once had been masters” (Holloway
                              vi-vii)…</span></div>
                     </div> Paradoxically, therefore, while Bloomfield’s political opinions were informed by his
                     reading of the poetry of rural complaint, he must have become acutely aware that he
                     was writing at a time when pastoral poetry had been reclassified as an index of personal
                     feeling, even as it was being increasingly politicized.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Bloomfield was conscious of the fact that, particularly given his laboring-class status,
                  his poetry would be expected to have a purely private function. In his first attempt
                  to get <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> published, he wrote to an unidentified bookseller that he intended the manuscript
                  simply as an attempt to put the “little events of my boyage into metre” and to present
                  the result as a gift to his mother (letter 6, before 21 June 1798). And this was reiterated
                  by Lofft in his preface to the first published version of the poem, to show that the
                  “Author, with a spirit amiable at all times,” was motivated by “duty and affection”
                  rather than “Fame or Advantage” (Bloomfield, <em>Farmer’s Boy</em> xvi). But Lofft seemed to ascribe to the older view of poetry as a suitable arena
                  for addressing public issues, though he may well have had reservations about a laboring-class
                  poet claiming to instruct, as well as to please, people of higher social standing.
                  After Bloomfield had repeatedly requested his patron to remove or relocate some footnotes
                  and other paratextual comments from future publications, for example, Lofft resorted
                  to the language of class privilege, “renouncing . . . all future correspondence &amp;
                  conversation with a clown who would so forget himself to me” (letter 197, 16 November
                  1806).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The quarrel began when Bloomfield, under pressure from acquaintances in the London
                     publishing scene, sought Lofft’s permission to omit from future editions some radical
                     remarks concerning the suppression of newspapers and debating societies. “In his notes
                     respecting Newspapers and Debating societies,” the poet later wrote of his patron,
                     “he had originally written and pertinaciously retained a downright attack upon Government.
                     . . . I still wish it was not there, for, I am not a politician, nor never shall be”
                     (letter 198, 19 November 1806).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Bloomfield had also included a political gloss on the harvest home passage in The
                              Farmer’s Boy in the form of a paratextual quotation from the work of the naturalist
                              on Cook’s second voyage to the Pacific, which comprised a denunciation of luxury,
                              with distinct leveling connotations. But this was before, he declared, “I had considered
                              the consequence of introducing even the appearance of politics into a Rural production
                              (let my own private notions be what they may)” (letter 62, 29 October 1801).</span></div>
                     </div> For Bloomfield, however, the key principle at stake was that such political remarks
                     would take away from his work’s poetical character. As he first explained to Lofft,
                     without apparently pretending “to dictate,” there was “a very general, if not universal
                     opinion, that political thoughts and references (however just in themselves) ought
                     not to be seen . . . where rural poetry only should be found” (letter 63, before 31
                     October 1801). Of course, Bloomfield did write about rural subjects such as cruelty
                     to animals in ways which carried quite specific political connotations, as several
                     critics have recently identified (Christmas 27-48; White 10-25). But whatever he actually
                     believed about the relationship between politics and rural poetry, he was clearly
                     conscious that polite taste was predicated on the incompatibility of these two discourses.
                     At the same time, Bloomfield was also troubled by the fact that, in the present climate
                     of political polarization, Lofft’s radical sentiments would inevitably cause controversy,
                     alienating a large section of his polite readership. In addition, he could hardly
                     have failed to be incensed by the way in which the polite political reformer was using
                     his poem to demonstrate his credentials as a disinterested citizen, while silencing
                     the demands of his plebeian protégé. And in this context, Bloomfield was quite right
                     to think that the best method for maintaining his cherished sense of independence
                     was to avoid the topic of politics altogether.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Indeed, Bloomfield’s worst fear was realized in dramatic fashion in 1802 when the
                  prominent conservative politician William Windham cited the preface of <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> in parliament during a debate on the Bull-Baiting Act. The speech was part of an
                  attack on the movement to reform the manners of the poor; and to this end, Windham
                  recited the descriptions of Bloomfield reading newspapers and attending debating societies,
                  together with Lofft’s radical remarks on these subjects, to illustrate the malign
                  effects of promoting the intellectual pursuits of laboring people. More specifically,
                  he maintained that giving the “lower orders a character of greater seriousness and
                  gravity” by restricting “what were termed idle sports and useless amusements” fertilized
                  the growth of Jacobinism and Methodism, political radicalism, and religious enthusiasm
                  (<em>Parliamentary History</em> 36 [1820]: 833). Needless to say, after reading an account of the speech, Bloomfield
                  was angry at having been used as a pawn in a political conflict he had hoped to avoid,
                  which amply confirmed his prediction that “some publick notice would be taken of Mr.
                  Lofft’s reflections in the prefatory part of the Farmer’s Boy. The lot has fallen
                  to Mr. W” (letter 88, 30 May 1802).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But Bloomfield was even more enraged by Windham’s denigration of the intellectual
                     capacity of the laboring poor. Of the former Secretary at War, he communicated to
                     his brother “I think the poor people of England have very little cause to thank him
                     for his compliment on the score of their capabilities and pursuits. We might as well
                     be totally without minds, for he seems to doubt the propriety of exerting them, or
                     of making an <em>inward</em> store of pleasure for ourselves. So much of this speech is the most unadulterated
                     aristocracy that I have ever heard”; and with characteristic wit, he then inquired
                     “where is the wisdom of saying that the little sons of a little Taylor should amuse
                     themselves with <em>athletic exercises</em>? If we happen to think a moral page a better object to admire than the frizzled forehead
                     of a bull, and like the ascending of a lark in preference to the mounting of a bull-dog,
                     what has Mr. W to do with it?” (letter 88). This distinction between inward pleasure
                     and collective leisure seems to suggest that Bloomfield saw himself as a model of
                     self-improvement, whose literary talents and endeavors elevated him above his fellow
                     artisans and laborers. Yet, even though Bloomfield demonstrated an ambivalent attitude
                     to popular culture,

                              to acknowledge it. In our National Theatres I have often sided so far with the Patricians

                              those who are weak enough, that is, proud enough,) but merely because they would not

                     </div> he did not generally hold a pejorative view of plebeian habits and recreations or

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In fact, Bloomfield conceived at least some of his poetry as an attempt to resist
                     this movement. Announcing his intention to avoid the “seriousness of a preacher,”
                     for example, he described his third publication, <em>Wild Flowers</em>, as a collection of “more . . . mirth . . . than many who know me would expect, or
                     than the severe will be inclined to approve” (x-xi). For Windham, of course, the promotion
                     of robust, manly pastimes and festivities was an unabashed mode of social control,
                     aimed at securing the contentment of the laboring poor.

                              well have added to Bloomfield’s anger. For he expressed frequent opposition to war
                              and, in 1803, when an upsurge in chauvinism witnessed even radicals support the war
                              with France, he strongly criticized the mobilization of the militia: “The measures
                              persued by Government are such as to cause here the greatest consternation and alarm.
                              Great numbers are entering as Vollunteers without knowing I doubt, what they have
                              to trust to, or what will be their privilidges. . . . As to real invasion we deem
                              it less threaten…</span></div>
                     </div> In response, Bloomfield wrote “the <em>common people</em> of his native country, are a rough set no doubt, but I dislike the doctrine of keeping
                     them in their dirt. . . . how can we consistently praise the inestimable blessing
                     of letters and not wish to extend it? Or why should the great and the wealthy confine
                     the probable production of intellectual excellence to their own class, and exclude,
                     by withholding the polish, all that might amongst the poor by nature be intended to
                     be Newtons and Lockes?” (letter 88). And yet, as evident in his last poem, <em>May Day with the Muses</em>, this progressive commitment to democratizing the republic of letters, to spreading
                     the “<em>Empire of the Mind</em>,” as he called it, could and did coexist with a belief in the dignity of the culture
                     of laboring people.

                  <p>Given these views, it is perhaps surprising that William Cobbett, who also respected
                     the intellectual abilities and recreational customs of the laboring poor, would later
                     condemn Bloomfield for turning conservative and writing against the interests of his
                     class of origin. The accusation came in the course of an attempt to show that the
                     virtues and talents formerly used to justify the political authority of the patrician
                     class were now only manifest in the populace, with the result being that laborers
                     had both the right and capacity to govern themselves. Cobbett began by asserting that
                     he was “willing to trust to the talent, the justice and loyalty of the great mass
                     of the people, and especially that part of them, who raise the food, the raiment and
                     the buildings, and who fight the battles”; but he then cautioned that the “cause of
                     the people has been betrayed by hundreds of men . . . whom a love of ease and of the
                     indulgence of empty vanity have seduced into the service of bribing usurpers”; and
                     among those men he listed Bloomfield, “the Farmer’s-Boy author” who, so it was claimed,
                     had been “taken <em>in tow</em>, and pensioned for fear he should write for the people” (<em>Political Register</em> 34 [1819]: 980-81). The allegation was remarkable not only for being untrue, but because
                     Bloomfield had largely made good on his resolution to avoid taking an explicit political
                     position in any of his public writings. To add insult to injury, Cobbett again pilloried
                     Bloomfield in a later work, arguing that if the poet “had placed no reliance on the
                     faithless Muses, his unfortunate . . . family would . . . have not been in a state
                     to solicit relief from charity. I remember that this loyal shoemaker was flattered
                     to the skies, and (ominous sign, if he had understood it) feasted at the tables of
                     some of the great. Have, I beseech you, no hope of this sort; and, if you find it
                     creeping towards your heart, drive it instantly away as the mortal foe of your independence
                     and your peace” (43-44). The assumption here was that to participate in any form of
                     polite culture, particularly one such as poetry which privileged imagination over
                     fact, was inevitably to weaken the resolve, distort the mind, and so endorse the progress
                     of refinement, with all its attendant evils of luxury, corruption, and social inequality.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For Cobbett’s privileging of fact over imagination, along with his associated skepticism
                              of polite culture, see Whale 141-47.</span></div>
                     </div> For Cobbett, then, any decision Bloomfield might have made not to include politics
                     in his poetry was irrelevant, since poetic production was itself destructive of political
                     integrity, of industriousness, utility, and fairness.</p>
               </div>
               <p>To some extent, poetry did offer an attractive alternative to politics for many plebeian
                  autodidacts. In particular, it provided opportunities for personal expression which
                  enabled the laboring-class poet to feel a sense of freedom, however partially or briefly,
                  from the restraints on individual thought and conduct characteristic of many areas
                  of collective plebeian life, including, of course, political organization. Perhaps
                  this was why John Clare, who, like Bloomfield, had strong political views, distrusted
                  Cobbett for being a propagandist with “no principles” and argued against “party matters”
                  and the “reform of mobs,” while claiming “I am no politician” (<em>Letters</em> 560). And though Clare, again like Bloomfield, revered rural popular culture, his
                  solitary ways and literary ambitions were derided by his neighbors, leading him to
                  contend that “Scandal and Fame are cheaply purchased in a Village the first is a nimble
                  tongud gossip and the latter a credoulous and ready believer who . . . believd any
                  thing” (<em>By Himself</em> 78). Bloomfield similarly felt that his literary celebrity alienated him from the
                  community at Shefford, and, when T. J. Lloyd Baker forced the poet to declare his
                  political hand amidst rumors of his dangerous radicalism, he denounced the “slander”
                  that circulated in “this vile little town” (letter 352, 25 May 1821).</p>
               <p>But Bloomfield also had the disadvantage of writing in the three decades after the
                  French Revolution, when virtually every aspect of culture had become highly politicized.
                  Throughout his career, his work and public image were appropriated to serve a political
                  cause by people of a radical as well as a conservative persuasion, and this must have
                  reinforced the poet’s sense that politics was utterly incompatible with the independence
                  he so much wanted to preserve. According to Bloomfield, even his fleeting encounters
                  and birthplace were scrutinized for their political implications. As he expressed
                  to Lloyd Baker in a brilliant attempt to highlight the unreasonableness, intrusiveness,
                  and even pettiness of his correspondent’s demands, not only had he kept company with
                  bastions of conservatism and radicalism alike, the Bishops Watson and Porteous no
                  less than the survivors of the treason trials, the polite reformer John Horne Tooke
                  and the plebeian dissident Thomas Hardy, but he had the “misfortune to be born only
                  six miles from the birthplace of Tom Paine!” (letter 354, 31 May-1 June 1821).</p>

               designed, (without adverting to political argument,) to shadow forth the evils arising
               to the peasantry of this country, from the system of engrossing small farms, and driving
               the hereditary occupiers to the necessity of embracing a maritime or military life
               for support, or being reduced to the most abject state of dependence, and submitting
               to the galling hardship of becoming <em>servants</em> on the spot where they once had been <em>masters</em>” (Holloway vi-vii). These were also “evils” which Bloomfield criticized, directly
               or indirectly, in his poetry and correspondence.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Bloomfield had also included a political gloss on the harvest home passage in <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> in the form of a paratextual quotation from the work of the naturalist on Cook’s
               second voyage to the Pacific, which comprised a denunciation of luxury, with distinct
               leveling connotations. But this was before, he declared, “I had considered the consequence
               of introducing even the appearance of politics into a Rural production (let my own
               private notions be what they may)” (letter 62, 29 October 1801).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               an illdresst and a well-dresst mob, and I must indeed be unfeeling and ungenerous
               to acknowledge it. In our National Theatres I have often sided so far with the Patricians
               as to wish the Plebeans at the Devel, not because they were such, (that I leave to
               those who are weak enough, that is, proud enough,) but merely because they would not

               well have added to Bloomfield’s anger. For he expressed frequent opposition to war
               and, in 1803, when an upsurge in chauvinism witnessed even radicals support the war
               with France, he strongly criticized the mobilization of the militia: “The measures
               persued by Government are such as to cause here the greatest consternation and alarm.
               Great numbers are entering as Vollunteers without knowing I doubt, what they have
               to trust to, or what will be their privilidges. . . . As to real invasion we deem
               it less threatening than an appeal to the exercise of rights by those of our own land.
               . . . I detest, I had allmost said scorn the profession of Soldier” (letter 112, 31
