               <p class="noCount">This essay places Bloomfield in his social world—the world of Georgian London and
                  of rural Suffolk and Wales. It makes extensive use of his correspondence to offer
                  new insights into such issues as patronage and publishing, the book market, radical
                  politics, Cockney London, and the picturesque tour. It shows Bloomfield to be a witty
                  commentator on his time as well as an astute reader of the poetry of his contemporaries.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This article takes as its point of departure Bloomfield’s repeated and insistent claim
                  that he was a poet, not a politician. Drawing on the fascinating recently published
                  correspondence of Bloomfield and his circle, it examines how the dissociation of poetry
                  and politics in the post-revolutionary decades affected the poet’s public and private
                  identities. In the first instance, the article explores how the ideology of natural
                  genius exerted pressure on Bloomfield and other laboring-class poets to think about
                  poetry as a cultural form that was incompatible with the public sphere of politics,
                  especially the combative world of artisan radicalism. But the article also shows that
                  the polarization of political culture in the aftermath of the French Revolution debate
                  had the effect of politicizing even the most private aspects of Bloomfield’s life
                  and literary productions. Much to the poet’s profound vexation, his public persona
                  was appropriated by radicals, liberals, and loyalists alike, depriving him of the
                  privacy the theory of natural genius assumed he should embrace.</p>

                     “The Infection of Robert Bloomfield: Terrorising <em>The Farmer's Boy</em>”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This article argues that Robert Bloomfield’s seminal text <em>The Farmer’s Boy</em> is a much darker and more troubled poem than has been appreciated. Although recent
                  criticism has begun to explore some of the poem’s ideological complexities, there
                  is still a prevailing tendency to locate its imaginative resources and strengths in
                  its depiction of a lost pastoral world of rural English labor. Haywood aims to break
                  out of this pastoralist mold by reading the poem as a psycho-biographical allegory
                  of Bloomfield’s unresolved feelings about separation, loss, social mobility, patronage,
                  and success. By intensifying and magnifying the more violent conventions of the georgic,
                  Bloomfield converts the poem into what John Barrell (writing about De Quincey) calls
                  “narratives of trauma and narratives of reparation” (22). The pain, terror, and guilt
                  of these “narratives” reflect not only Bloomfield’s troubled poetical formation but
                  also capture the counter-revolutionary paranoia and repression of the late 1790s.
                  Although Haywood's interpretation uses the text to speculate about Bloomfield’s memories
                  of his early life, his conclusions are supported by copious illustrations and supportive
                  evidence from Bloomfield’s letters.</p>

                     “Bloomfield's Writing for Children”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Robert Bloomfield twice wrote works explicitly for a juvenile audience. <em>Little Davy’s New Hat</em> was first published in 1815 and went through three separate editions by 1824. <em>The Bird and Insects’ Post Office,</em> which Bloomfield was writing with his son Charles at the time of his death, was published
                  posthumously in his <em>Remains</em> (1824). With these texts, Bloomfield tried his hand at what was, in the early nineteenth
                  century, a relatively new genre. In addressing a juvenile audience, Bloomfield joined
                  some of the most important authors of the age. A re-examination of the works for children
                  demonstrates how Bloomfield fully participates in his Romantic cultural moment. While
                  differing in style and in audience, these two texts are also very much of a piece
                  with Bloomfield’s other core moral and artistic concerns. Although celebrating Bloomfield’s
                  children’s books could be seen as inviting the risk of once again relegating Bloomfield
                  to the status of naïf—a writer capable only of simple works and observations because
                  of his laboring-class background—if we understand them in relation to the rest of
                  Bloomfield’s achievements they appear less anomalous and less simplistic. Both works
                  are unafraid to contend with life’s harsher realities even as they perform the typical
                  moral function of children’s literature and extol the virtues of charity and kindness
                  to the poor and to animals.</p>
