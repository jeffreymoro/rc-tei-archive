                              tendency of Western scholarship with the best of intentions to fabricate a discourse
                              of blackness it then discovers and advocates, an Africanized Orientalism of the sort
                              Morrison describes. The subaltern can’t get a word in edgewise.</span></div>
                     </div> It’s not simply that most Romanticists, ourselves included, are middle class white
                     folks working for institutions that traditionally privilege peoples and cultures of
                     European descent. Nor is it simply that British culture, at least in its Romantic
                     avatar, presumes whiteness as the (transparent) racial bias of production. The whiteness
                     of Romantic studies is a symptom of amnesia. It bespeaks a massive act of forgetting
                     on the part of contemporary scholarship, an institutional disavowal of the economic
                     conditions that help make cultural production during the Romantic Era possible: the
                     maritime economy of the Atlantic. Anthologies tell the story of this amnesia. Few
                     acknowledge the huge role the West Indies played as the economic engine that drove
                     the astonishing flowering of culture we call Romanticism. While uncontroversial today,
                     Ann Mellor and Richard Matlak’s <em>British Literature 1780-1830</em> was hailed as an important revisionist compilation when it appeared in 1995. Its inside
                     covers contain a timeline that documents the decisive events of the Romantic period,
                     both in England and as far abroad as India. The absence of any reference to the West
                     Indies, however, leaves the impression (if indeed an <em>absence</em> can impress) that nothing of historical significance occurred there—no Jack Mansong,
                     no Maroon War, no British invasion of St. Domingo, no successful slave rebellion there
                     founding the first black republic in the history of the world.

                              The “Comprehensive Chronology” at the back of their edition, while capacious, persists
                              in neglecting the West Indies. It doesn’t help much to excuse the oversight by referring
                              to the benighted times of the anthology’s original publication (1996). It was reissued

                     </div> Such is the amnesia of Romanticism, the unremembered histories of diasporic Africans
                     and creole cultures in the West Indies.</p>
               </div>
               <p>We want to conjure those histories, to summon the ancestor spirits who are wandering
                  the West Indies. The process requires an incantation and ours is “Black Romanticism.”
                  Replacing the honorific “British” with “Black” allows us to dislocate Romantic studies—literally.
                  We move the ruling perspective of critical inquiry from the Island (England) to the
                  islands (West Indies). This is not, however, a movement from metropole to periphery.
                  The West Indies are not the edge of Empire. They are its engine: the economic, material,
                  and cultural condition of British prosperity and dominion during the Romantic era.
                  To chant “Black Romanticism” as means of conjuring this ancestry is to honor the Atlantic
                  as its presiding genius: the Atlantic, watery vortex of myriad economic and cultural
                  exchanges, roaring multiplicity of agencies, vast whirlpool of creative powers.</p>
               <p>Why honor the Atlantic? Why conjure its restless revenants? Partly because they haunt
                  Britain as a territorial and national entity. They are ancestors of the nation. To
                  the extent that Romanticism is <em>British</em>, the nation sets the terms conceptually for its study. The consolidation of the nation
                  as a state formation—through more blood and mayhem than many scholars want to admit—was
                  complete by the end of the era deemed “Romantic.” It seems inevitable to approach
                  culture by way of national origins. Consider three powerful accounts of the emergence
                  of British Romantic culture from the consolidation of national identity. In the important
                  book entitled <em>Britons: Forging the Nation, 1701-1837</em> (1992), Linda Colley describes the difficult cultural trick of fusing England, Scotland,
                  and Wales into a single nation, the United Kingdom. National unity became possible
                  through three powerful, shared experiences: Protestantism, commerce, and near perpetual
                  war (against the Dutch, the Spanish, and the French). The United Kingdom as a nation
                  arises as a solidarity of belief, exchange, and struggle literally grounded in the
                  insular territory of the British Isles (Ireland constituting its reviled other).</p>
               <p>This geographic territoriality of Britain receives endless endorsement from a sustaining
                  fantasy of community. A complementary account of the emergence of national culture
                  occurs in Benedict Anderson’s influential <em>Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism</em> (1994; rev. 2006). In the now familiar argument, Anderson views the nation as “an
                  imagined political community—imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign” (6).
                  Members of such a community may never meet each other, but they live their communion
                  imaginatively. Three conditions produce this imagined solidarity: capitalism, print,
                  and a language of power. Nations emerge where print advances trade in geographies
                  administrated by such a language: the British Isles, for instance, or the Spanish
                  new world. That makes the nation the solidarity of a linguistically configured imagination.
                  No wonder that culture, particularly literary culture, becomes nationally configured.
                  It’s the brainchild of a language of power that configures the nation.</p>
               <p>Finally, an important corrective occurs in the work of Srivinas Aravamudan. His <em>Tropicopolitans: Colonialism and Agency, 1688-1804</em> (1999) insists that any account of the nation must consider the role of colonies
                  in its emergence, or more specifically the decisive relationship between the imperial
                  and colonial subject. In his view the “tropicopolitan” names the colonized subject
                  as both an imperial fiction and a colonial fact, “object of representation <em>and</em> agent of resistance” (4). Against Colley, Aravamudan argues for the decisive role
                  “xenophobia, Orientalism, colonialism, and racism” (10) play in the production of
                  national identity. The nation is not exclusively a solidarity of domination. The colonial
                  subject can flip the script, appropriating its language of power for unimagined ends.
                  The tropicopolitan thus invents a counter-literacy to disrupt that language, imagining
                  a new solidarity, creating its own nation. As the creation of a linguistically configured
                  imagination, the nation proves its own undoing, promoting in a neat Hegelian way new
                  national possibilities in the tropical space of colonial domination.</p>
               <p>All three of these potent accounts of the nation share assumptions that get built
                  into the study of national cultures such as British Romanticism. They are geographically
                  territorialized: Colley’s United Kindom, Anderson’s imagined community, and Aravamuda’s
                  Empire are all grounded physically in territories with borders and colonial satellites.
                  They are linguistically territorialized too: in each instance a language of power
                  (the King’s English, printed discourse, imperial literacy) sustains national boundaries
                  and legitimates cultural production. Finally, they are racially territorialized, albeit
                  less obviously. Colley’s Britons may be ethnically diverse, but they are racially
                  homogenous, congealing into the plump white body of beef-eating John Bull. Anderson’s
                  imagined communities are only as racially diverse as a Eurpoean language of power
                  will admit, which is to say not at all, judging from the written record of the Spanish
                  conquest. While Aravamudan at least acknowledges the racial difference of the tropicopolitan,
                  his emphasis on imperial literacy as the preferred means of resistance makes whiteness
                  the cultural standard against which the colonial subject must react. Casting the other
                  in this role of reaction devalues agencies (outside literacy, for instance) incommensurable
                  with whiteness. The tropicopolitan occupies the queasy position of affirming whiteness
                  to assert racial difference. The brutal history of decolonization illustrates the
                  difficulty here. Where nation sets the terms for agency—whether of resistance or criticism—territory,
                  literacy, and whiteness determine the means and ends of cultural production.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Black Romanticism subverts those imperatives by conjuring spirits they ignore, specters
                     of the Atlantic vortex that haunt the nation and its presumed unities. Cultural critics
                     and radical historians of the last decade have forged new methods of calling them
                     up and querying their wisdom.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Important contributions other than those we mention include Edward Kamau Brathwaite,
                              Ian Baucom, Stuart Hall, W.M. Verhoeven, and Kevin Hutchings. </span></div>
                     </div> Paul Gilroy’s groundbreaking (in the literal sense of shattering territory as the
                     foundation of cultural criticism) <em>The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness</em> (1993) dislocates the <em>space</em> of cultural criticism. Gilroy replaces the nation as stable ground of cultural production
                     with the dynamic swirl of the Atlantic. Mobility becomes the new condition of agency.
                     No longer rooted but routed, identities turn fluid. Cultures split, cross, and recombine.
                     Nationality falls to hybridity as economic and cultural exchanges produce new forms
                     of cultural production that mix high and low, literate and illiterate, white, black,
                     and every shade of brown. Gilroy’s work recovers the cultural <em>multiplicity</em> that unitary notions of nation, language, and race forget. It remembers too the <em>terror</em> built into the nation as imagined community. The displaced blacks of the Black Atlantic
                     lived the full horrifying force of cultural investments in commerce, print, and language.
                     The Enlightenment looks different from the perspective of the living death sentence
                     of slavery. As Gilroy insists (to the great promise of studies in Romanticism), slaves
                     and other displaced people respond by creating counter-cultures that disrupt and transform
                     the nation and its unities. The true cultural vanguard of the Romantic era belongs
                     not to bourgeois word-worthies speaking as Man to men but to those displaced people
                     forging new ways of life under circumstances of enlightened barbarity from blood,
                     sweat, and vision.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Black Romanticism summons the spirits of those visionaries. In this it follows the
                  lead of cultural historians who navigate the complex network of exchanges circulating
                  people, ideas, practices, and things throughout the Atlantic. In <em>Cities of the Dead</em> (1996), Joseph Roach traces the circulation of cultural exchanges throughout the
                  “circum-Atlantic” world. Roach’s emphasis on the <em>circle</em> in circulations is key here. There is little inherently progressive about current
                  scholarly preoccupation with <em>trans</em>-national (or <em>trans-</em>Atlantic) literature. Nation grounds a linear exchange, and the stunning lesson learned
                  is that America readers read British books. Roach’s emphasis on the circulation of
                  surrogated cultural practices puts the stress on <em>transformation</em>. Cultures hybridize as they move. The Atlantic transforms identities and practices
                  as it circulates them.</p>
               <p>The radical prophets of this position are Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker. Their
                  monumental history of Atlantic radicalism, <em>The Many Headed Hydra: The Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic</em> (2001), politicizes what could too easily be taken for a purely cultural phenomenon:
                  the production of new identities, hopes, visions, and communities through myriad economic
                  and cultural exchanges throughout the Atlantic. They start at the bottom of that economy,
                  with the displaced commoners—from Africa, Ireland, England, France, Scandinavia, the
                  Americas, India, the Far East—who dredged the harbors and built the docks and worked
                  the ships to make the Atlantic <em>pay</em>. A “radical diaspora” of expropriated laborers—slaves and servants, peasants and
                  plebs—a “motley crew” came bodily together to drive that economy. They traded words
                  and songs, ideas and dreams as they worked. Their labor forged new cultures and communities.
                  Their common politics was a politics of the commons, for they were driven from their
                  common property to work alien worlds. This displaced, circulating proletariat was
                  culturally mixed and racially heterogeneous. In Linebaugh and Rediker’s words, “It
                  was <em>multitudinous, numerous</em>, and <em>growing</em>. [. . .] It was <em>cooperative</em> and <em>laboring</em>. [. . .] It was <em>motley</em>, both dressed in rags and multi-ethnic in appearance. [. . .] Finally, the proletariat
                  was <em>self-active, creative;</em> it was—and is—alive; it is onamove” (332-33). Atlantic circulations of people, ideas,
                  and things create new possibilities for collective living irreducible to the prim
                  unities of territory and language. This motley crew of slaves, servants, and sailors
                  multiply cultures and imagine communities beyond the territorial limits of the nation.</p>
               <p>Black Romanticism summons and celebrates their example. It deterritorializes British
                  national identity and the culture of the Romantic era, reimagining them as the <em>effect</em> of myriad economic and cultural exchanges circulating throughout the Atlantic. Economic
                  workers are cultural workers too. Where there is economic production there is cultural
                  production. Where there are economic exchanges there are cultural exchanges too. Beneath
                  the honorific of the Briton seethes a prolific cultural multiplicity irreducible to
                  the imperatives of territory, trade, and languages. Black Romanticism remembers this
                  forgotten ancestry of British culture, recovering the vital role Africans and other
                  diasporic commoners play in the cultural production called Romanticism. Black Romanticism
                  conjures these ancestors by practicing counter-literacy, reading the works of nation,
                  empire, and colony against themselves to liberate the common cultures they occlude.
                  Black Romanticism does not speak truth to power, but channels truths that power devalues,
                  multiple truths that lived and died with economic and cultural workers throughout
                  the West Indies and the larger Atlantic world.</p>
               <p>A word about that word, “black.” It acquires a threefold valence in our usage. First,
                  there is the obvious racial trace: black as in African, black as in slave. But read
                  warily. The “black” in Black Romanticism is not a new and darker purity to counter
                  British whiteness. On the contrary, it bespeaks the multiple and mixed identities
                  that arise through the circulation of people, ideas, and things throughout the Atlantic.
                  This, then, is the second valence of our usage: black as mixed, hybrid, creolized
                  cultural production. We want a Romanticism that is black in the same sense as Gilroy’s
                  Atlantic: “The fractal patterns of cultural and political exchange and transformation
                  that we try and specify [. . .] indicate how both ethnicities and political cultures
                  have been made anew in ways that are significant not simply for the peoples of the
                  Caribbean but for Europe, for Africa” (15)—and for Britain too. “Black” marks those
                  transformations. Then there is the darkest valence of all, black as “occult”—black
                  magic, black market, the black arts. Black Romanticism acquires insurgence here. Counterforce
                  to whiteness, black in our usage summons mute specters that haunt British Romanticism:
                  the slaves driving it, the terror sustaining it, the common cultures challenging and
                  transforming its superiority. Black Romanticism sets those spirits free to feed upon
                  pure dreams of mastery. It gives them voice and communicates their vitality. In this
                  it follows the example of Joan Dyan, whose imposing <em>Haiti, History, and the Gods</em> (1996) portends a new kind of criticism that takes seriously the cultural lives of
                  the unlettered to reveal their indelible influence on and transformation of European
                  culture. Black Romanticism invokes those transformations to advance them. We conjure
                  the ancestors. We practice black arts. How black is Romanticism? As black as we can
                  make it.</p>

                  <p>When Jean-Jacque Dessalines tore the white band from the French <span class="foreign">tricolour</span> in 1803, he issued a decree that would resonate in Haiti’s 1805 inaugural constitution.
                     This constitution pronounced all Haitians “black,” including Polish and German mercenaries
                     who remained on the island. Arguably the first ideological deployment of the term
                     “black,” this revolutionary tactic ultimately foundered in practice when Dessalines
                     applied the methods of the French to the whites of the island and ordered the massacre
                     of those who threatened the new nation. In so doing he, as Lindsey Twa has suggested,
                     “sealed for Haiti a lasting reputation as a nightmare republic in the eyes of the
                     greater white world” (2). However, Dessalines’ incongruous legacy as both hero and
                     villain attests to the sheer vitality and uneasy complexity of his proclamation of
                     a “Black Haiti.” He was, in retrospect, both the perpetrator and the victim of the
                     violence that can and did accompany the exchange and transformation of new world culture.
                     Out of this carnage, new cultural, spiritual and socio-economic identities emerged:
                     “great spirits on earth” sojourned to create a “brave new world” with “such people
                     in it.”

               </div>
               <p>Such people include in addition to Dessalines, Juan Manzano, Jack Mansong, Mary Prince,
                  and John Gabriel Stedman: an emperor, a poet, a bandit, a slave, and a soldier. Although
                  these five figures emerged from different geopolitical environments in the Caribbean,
                  they share a complex historical and literary trajectory: a circum-Atlantic labyrinth
                  of shifting, intersecting, and metamorphosing narratives. Four of them were, but did
                  not remain, enslaved, and the fifth simultaneously condoned and condemned the institution.
                  Despite occupying literal and figurative margins, each of these persons claimed the
                  spotlight in metropole, hinterland, and colony. Their stories—and variations of their
                  stories—traveled through and around the Black Atlantic during the Romantic era and
                  after. </p>
               <p>Writings from within as well as about the Caribbean offer insight into the construction
                  of European texts. The African-Briton binary employed by traditionally white Romanticism
                  does not accommodate the history and reality of the West Indies. The inclusion of
                  voices and stories from Jamaica, Suriname, Haiti, Bermuda, and Cuba, for example,
                  underscore the African legacies so often marginalized in European stories; in so doing
                  it irrevocably alters the narratives of the metropole. It is perhaps little surprise
                  that narratives emerging from the creolized culture of the New World would change
                  the way both African- and European- descended people understand and represent themselves
                  and their others (to themselves and their others). Kathleen M. Balutansky and Marie
                  Agnes Sourieau have identified in these creole cultures “a syncretic process of transverse
                  dynamics that endlessly reworks and transforms the cultural patterns of varied social
                  and historical experiences and identities (3). In other words, narratives emerging
                  from the Caribbean are both pre-mediated and pre-meditated. </p>

                  <p>Although recent scholarship has called attention to the many (and legitimate) problems
                     of historical transmission in the Black Atlantic world--especially to narrative and
                     mnemonic gaps—this collection of essays considers how the circulation of radically
                     different adaptations of the “same” stories provides new ways to understand the colonial
                     Caribbean.

               <h2><span class="head">*****</span></h2>
               <p>Stories about Jean-Jacque Dessalines, Jack Mansong, Juan Manzano, John Gabriel Stedman,
                  and Mary Prince have over the past two centuries become part of a constellation of
                  stories about slavery and colonialism, following a circuitous route that began in
                  Africa and traveled from Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Suriname, Bermuda, and Antigua to corresponding
                  points in England, America, and the continent. Each narrative has endured transformations
                  that render the “original” story less significant than the ways they have changed,
                  been changed, or changed the stories connected with them. Each of these figures has
                  acquired multiple and contradictory reputations in part due to changing audiences
                  and media.</p>
               <p>Jean-Jacques Dessalines, for example, has been represented as both despot and deity.
                  Formerly enslaved, Dessalines rose to power with violence and bloodshed, christened
                  himself Emperor of Haiti, and triumphed over an oppressive European rule. Although
                  Dessalines meant for the newly-independent Haiti to function without slavery, he eventually
                  resorted to related despotic measures in what Michel-Rolph Trouillot has termed <span class="foreign">caporalism agraire</span>, or agrarian militarism. When he ordered the massacre of the remaining French colonists
                  in Haiti after a reign of terror echoing that of revolutionary France, he incited
                  the wrath of his own soldiers who ambushed and executed him. Though Dessalines has
                  sustained a reputation as an autocratic despot, he has also been deemed a heroic founding
                  father of Haiti. In other words, he was both oppressed and oppressor—slave and emperor—in
                  a constantly shifting social order.</p>
               <p>Slave rebel “Three-Fingered Jack” Mansong, has been known in England and the Caribbean
                  as both the “Robin Hood of the Tropical Forest” and the “Terror of Jamaica.” Narratives
                  about his life emerged in England, the United States, and Jamaica, offering different
                  interpretations to varying audiences over the course of two centuries. To this day,
                  he remains a shadowy and ambiguous hero-villain in Jamaica. As both an emblem of freedom
                  and a murderous thug with a history inextricably linked to the likewise elusive (and
                  entirely oral) Maroon history, he embodies the contradictions that characterize life
                  under and on the margins of plantation life.</p>
               <p>Stories by and about the Afro-Cuban Juan Manzano provide a rich but contradictory
                  narrative landscape. Manzano was, like Dessalines and Jack Mansong, once enslaved,
                  but he achieved his freedom by pen rather than machete. After his escape from slavery,
                  he worked for planter Domingo Del Monte who allegedly helped him raise funds to buy
                  his own freedom. Del Monte gave Manzano’s poems and autobiography to his friend, Robert
                  Madden, who translated Manzano’s work from Spanish, added several appendices, and
                  prefaced the resulting volume with his own poems before sending them out in print.
                  In addition, Manzano—a renowned storyteller—circulated his own stories orally in Cuba
                  and Jamaica. These overlapping and stories and genres create a space to explore different
                  geopolitical systems and approaches to slavery and abolition.</p>
               <p>John Gabriel Stedman’s <em>Narrative of a Five Years Expedition Against the Revolted Slaves of Suriname</em> (1796) sits precariously within an archive that includes a web of re-printings, editorial
                  mediations, and images—most notably William Blake’s engraved illustrations. The Dutch-Scots
                  Stedman wrote about his life in Suriname and his relationship with its inhabitants,
                  particularly his alliance with his concubine Joanna and their son, Johnny. Like Manzano’s
                  narrative, Stedman’s reaches a much wider audience than he anticipated however different
                  from him in taste or agenda. Despite the disparities among the texts, reading between
                  and across the narratives offers a prismatic look at life in eighteenth-century Surinam.
                  Stedman’s fascination with Maroons, for example, provides a valuable resource to understand
                  a history that has few written texts in its repertoire. Although Stedman sustained
                  a reputation as an authority on Suriname, he b ecame, arguably, an exotic object of
                  consumption to be enjoyed by audiences in Europe and the Americas.</p>
               <p><em>The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave, Related by Herself</em>, emerged in 1831, the first account of a Black woman to be published in England.
                  Born into slavery in Bermuda, moved to Antigua, and then taken to London by her master,
                  John Wood, Prince found employment with Thomas Pringle, the secretary to the Anti-Slavery
                  society and the eventual editor of her (transcribed) narrative soon after landing
                  upon English soil. Prince’s highly mediated account has invited critical conversations
                  about the authenticity of her text since it first appeared, including two libel suits
                  that attest to its polemical nature. Prince’s multi-layered narrative captures the
                  trauma and dispossession that characterizes her transatlantic experience, and its
                  history—like hers—offers a unique opportunity to examine the exigencies of life under
                  and after slavery.</p>
               <p>In the first essay of this volume, “Jean-Jacques Dessalines: Demon, Demigod, and Everything
                  in Between” Lindsey Twa traces representations of Dessalines in literary and visual
                  texts from Haiti, the United States, and Europe to examine how these representations
                  shape his fascinating legacy. Twa’s essay insightfully proposes that Dessalines’ legacy—like
                  his physical body—was both torn asunder and restored, “rendering his complex legacy
                  piecemeal.” Twa explores his journey from abject slave to revolutionary hero and locates
                  his ultimate status as <span class="foreign">Iwa</span> (spirit) in Vodou practice as a cultural space that “recognizes and celebrates the
                  contradictory nature of this mercurial figure” (3). She notes that Kreyol (French
                  Creole) folk songs and ritualistic practice focus on the liberty he brings, “through
                  a body that is both powerful and dismembered, heroic and corrupt, living and dead”
                  (16).</p>
               <p>In our second essay, “Rewriting the History of Black Resistance: The Haitian Revolution,
                  Jamaican Maroons and the ‘History’ of ‘Three-Fingered Jack’ in English Popular Culture,
                  1799-1830,” Lissette Szwydky examines British adaptations of the history of the notorious
                  rebel. She argues that the popular history of Jack Mansong can be read as part of
                  a larger colonial history that misrepresents black resistance in the Caribbean and
                  the Americas. Particularly concerned with erasure of Maroon history from these adaptations,
                  she shows how they demonstrate that “an instance of collective rebellion could be
                  sensationalized to the point of being rendered politically insignificant.” By stripping
                  Jack of his gang of followers and by changing the identity of his captor from a Maroon
                  to a slave, she suggests, the British stage and print versions deny the actual history
                  of black resistance and independence in Jamaica. </p>
               <p>In our third essay, "Translating a Slave’s Life: Richard Robert Madden and the Post-Abolition
                  Trafficking of Juan Manzano’s <em>Poems by a Slave in the Island of Cuba</em>,” Joselyn Almeida examines the translations of Juan Manzano’s <em>Poems</em>, a manuscript that followed a labyrinthine route before its eventual publication.
                  Almeida suggests that the translation provided British abolitionists with the cultural
                  capital necessary to “ensure a future beyond 1840 given the realignment of geopolitical
                  and economic power in the Atlantic” (11). Madden’s translation functions, she argues,
                  “as a sign of appropriated cultural labor, and performs an ideological accommodation
                  of slavery within the free market/free labor system” (3).</p>
               <p>In the fourth essay, “Going Viral: Stedman's <em>Narrative</em>, Textual Variation, and Life in Atlantic Studies,” Dustin Kennedy argues that the
                  Stedman archive functions as a new “interpretive unit of cultural-community formation”
                  that “re-directs attention to revolt and insurrection as divergent (and raced) social/political
                  factors in the eighteenth-century.” Identifying Stedman as one of many authorial voices
                  that are <em>disseminated</em> through the archive of the <em>Narrative</em>, Kennedy reveals how the many iterations of the account create a “cross-pollination”
                  or circulation of revolutionary ideas throughout the Caribbean, the Americas and Europe.</p>
               <p>Our final essay, Michele Speitz’s “Blood Sugar and Salt Licks: Corroding Bodies and
                  Preserving Nations in <em>The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave, Related by Herself</em>,” uses the brutal work of the salt flats to link the British colonial project with
                  the revolutionary history of the United States. Exploring the material and metaphoric
                  significance of Prince’s narrative she argues that the “realities of salt production
                  under slavery corrode the liberatory claims of both nations.” In so doing, her essay
                  extends critical conversations about slave narratives to include the largely overlooked
                  relevance of salt raking to the economies and politics of the Black Atlantic.</p>
               <p>Taken together, these five essays advance a criticism attuned to the multiplicity
                  that sleeps and seethes beneath “Romanticism.” If the vortex of the Atlantic creates
                  new cultures—then and now—Black Romanticism makes them visible and promotes their
                  interminable circulations. We’re conjuring spirits here, the voluble but hitherto
                  silenced spirits of the diasporic people whose labor drove the Atlantic economy and
                  whose creativity infected and inflected the culture of their so-called masters. It
                  would be easy to do so as benefactors, but we hope to avoid that presumption. Dayan
                  defines terror as whipping with one hand while comforting with the other: “You harm,
                  and then you alleviate the harm you have caused: the executioner also gets to be the
                  savior; the benevolence continues the brutalization, while claiming otherwise” (206).
                  The trick to conjuring spirits such as those of the slaves that haunt Romanticism
                  is interrupt the legacy of terror that brutalized them. </p>
               <p>That means resisting the tendency to situate their messages in advance: as primitive,
                  occult, untutored, “African.” The powerful creative force of enslaved peoples in the
                  West Indies gave rise to cultural forms through which they affirmed their lives under
                  terms of subjection: Obeah, Myal, Voodoo, medicine, cooking, gardening, handicraft,
                  and the like. These were not the customs of distant primitives. They arose in curious
                  and productive contact with European cultures dislocated from their respective metropoles,
                  dominant cultures for which the process of domination produced occasions too for change.</p>
               <p>Black Romanticism is a double listening. It respects the spirits of the subjected
                  peoples and tries to hear their shouts and cries and whispers. The Assembly of Jamaica
                  heard only superstition and resistance in Obeah. Sharper ears discover a politics
                  there, an economics, the proud affirmation of dislocated lives creating forms of culture
                  from a mix of inherited, borrowed and found materials. The second register of listening,
                  then, involves the culture of the colonists. Constant exposure to the contagion of
                  slavery infects it to the point of sometimes subtle, sometimes significant mutation.
                  It’s a notorious cliché, but one worth pondering: colonists go native in the West
                  Indies—well, not <em>native</em> but creole. They start to speak a slack patois. They begin to enjoy the local cuisine.
                  They sleep with slaves. In a different but no less decisive way than that of the people
                  who sustain their lives, colonial culture changes.</p>
               <p>Kamau (Edward) Brathwaite calls this process <em>creolization</em> and argues that it and not subjection describes the interaction between European
                  and African cultures in the Caribbean. Creolization presumes “a way of seeing the
                  society, not in terms of white and black, master and slave in separate nuclear units,
                  but as contributory parts of a whole” (307). It would be a mistake, then, to view
                  the complex cultures produced in the West Indies as the product of slave societies.
                  Rather, they arise out of a difficult process whereby different peoples “adapt themselves
                  to a new environment and to each other”(307). Creolization in this sense is the heart
                  and soul of Black Romanticism. We conjure spirits to hear the changes they ring on
                  Caribbean and European cultures.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Some of the notable exceptions include Richardson and Hofkosh, Lee, Thomas, and Wood.
               Even these scholars can be dogged by the spectre of what we call “abolitionism,” the
               tendency of Western scholarship with the best of intentions to fabricate a discourse
               of blackness it then discovers and advocates, an Africanized Orientalism of the sort
               Morrison describes. The subaltern can’t get a word in edgewise.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Besides token selections from Equiano and Yearsly, Mellor and Matlak include Maria
               Edgeworth’s “The Grateful Negro” (1804). But that’s hardly a hymn to cultural crossing.
               The “Comprehensive Chronology” at the back of their edition, while capacious, persists
               in neglecting the West Indies. It doesn’t help much to excuse the oversight by referring
               to the benighted times of the anthology’s original publication (1996). It was reissued
               in paperback in 2005. That same year, the third edition of Duncan Wu’s implacably
               titled <em>Romanticism</em> (the category having swallowed any national distinction) hardly nods toward the West
               Indies in its 1552 pages. One might expect an anthology entitled <em>Transatlantic Romanticism</em> (2006) to feature the Caribbean. However, editors Lance Newman, Joel Pace, and Chris
               Koenig-Woodyard make <em>nation</em> the condition of Atlantic crossings, building an anthology that does little more
               than unite the old national entities of England, America, and Canada in a transatlantic
               horizon of whiteness. In the world of letters, segregation prevails. Black writing
               from of the Romantic era has its own special neighborhoods. Visit Richardson and Lee’s
               <em>Early Black British Writers</em> (and notice their nationalization of blackness), or Vincent Caretta’s <em>Unchained Voices</em>. Williamson’s collection, on the other hand, mixes contrary voices in exciting new
               ways.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Important contributions other than those we mention include Edward Kamau Brathwaite,
               Ian Baucom, Stuart Hall, W.M. Verhoeven, and Kevin Hutchings. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">This line is famously spoken by Miranda at the conclusion of the Tempest. We here
               also evoke Keats’ perhaps equally renowned quotation, “Great spirits on earth are
               now sojourning” (from the sonnet of that title, in “To John Reynolds, 17 &amp; 18, <em>Poetical Works of 1884</em>, which in turn invokes Wordsworth.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">In addition to the work of Joseph Roach, Diana Taylor provides a fantastic study of
               the relationships between the archive and the repertoire—between written and embodied
               histories. Saidya Hartman urges us to “brush history against the grain” as a critical
               element of the “struggle within and against the constraints and silences imposed by
               the nature of the archive—the system that governs the appearance of statements and
               generates social meaning” (11). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
