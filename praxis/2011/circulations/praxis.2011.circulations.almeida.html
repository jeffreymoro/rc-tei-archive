               <p>The World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840 featured a “who’s who” of abolitionists
                  who rose to prominence during the Romantic period. Joseph Sturge envisioned “a Society
                  for the abolition of slavery throughout the world” (Richard 204), and was the prime
                  mover behind the formation of The British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society and the
                  convention. Such notables as Lady Byron, Amelia Opie, and Benjamin Robert Haydon,
                  John Keats’ longtime friend, witnessed Thomas Clarkson give the opening oration and
                  prayer. Reflecting on the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=sp&amp;sText=Anti-Slavery+Society&amp;rNo=0">commemorative portrait</a> he painted afterwards, Haydon wrote “I have seen the most afflicted tragedies, imitative
                  and real; but never did I witness in life or in the drama, so deep, so touching, a
                  pathetic an effect produced on any great assembly as by the few unaffected, unsophisticated
                  words of this aged and agitated person” (qtd. in Richard 218). For as much as the
                  Convention was ostensibly launching a new chapter for British abolitionists, they
                  were also witnessing the end of an era, symbolized in Clarkson’s “aged and agitated
                  person.” As David Turley shows, Clarkson was as much of symbol of continuity as a
                  representative of the “growing divergences” within the anti-slavery movement after
                  the goal of the abolition of slavery in the West Indies had been achieved. Clarkson
                  “seemed too attached to reputation … embarrassed or irritated Wilberforce, Stephen,
                  and Macaulay, who all also doubted his judgment on some issues” (Turley 93).

                           and Samuel Wilberforce chose to make some of them public in the life of their father
                           they published in 1838. In the view of private and public critics of the Wilberforce
                           sons there was more than filopietism at issue in their charge that Clarkson claimed
                           leadership in the cause when their father was entitled to it; they suggested that
                           Clarkson had been to all intents and purposes an agent of the Abolition Committee.
                           Sara Coleridge saw the Wilberforce sons claiming antislavery for their brand of Clapham

                  </div> Against these internecine struggles, the Convention became a rallying point and a
                  potent reaffirmation of the abolitionist mission. In reciting the milestones of the
                  abolitionist movement, the Secretary of the Committee reminded fellow abolitionists
                  that “notwithstanding their joy and thanksgiving for the events they had been permitted
                  to witness” in the “freedom of every descendant of Africa in the British Colonies,”
                  they “could not forget that in the nations of the American Continent and its adjacent
                  islands, upwards of five millions were still groaning under the oppression, and subject
                  to the cruelty of slavery” (
                  “Proceedings”
                   6).</p>

               <p>One of the speakers at the convention was Richard Robert Madden, an Irish physician
                  and civil servant with literary ambitions, who delivered a thirty-page report on the
                  status of Cuban slavery. He is best known perhaps for his 7 volume <em>History of the United Irishmen</em> (1843-6) (Rodgers 119), and he has enjoyed a recent resurgence thanks to the work
                  of Gera Burton, Lorna Willliams, William Luis, and Sylvia Molloy. Romanticists may
                  know him through Alan Richardson and Debbie Lee’s <em>Early Black British Writing</em>, which includes two of Madden’s translations of the Afro-Cuban poet Juan Manzano.

                     Apprenticeship </em>(1835). He afterwards was appointed Superintendent of Africans in Havana between 1836
                  and 1839, where he moved through the top circles of Cuban society, including the <span xml:lang="es" lang="es" class="foreign">tertulias</span> of “liberal” planter Domingo del Monte, where he most likely met Manzano.

                  </div> Manzano had been among the Marquesa’s favorite pages, a post for which his early education
                  had prepared him—he was nicknamed “pico de oro” [golden tongue] and the plantation
                  children, black or white, would gather to hear his stories (<em>Obras</em> 10, 12).

                  which she submitted Manzano on the mere suspicion of either cause the narrative to

               <p>This essay examines the translation of Manzano’s <em>Poems by a Slave in the Island of Cuba, Recently Liberated: Translated from the Spanish
                     by R.R. Madden, with the History of the Early Life of the Negro Poet Written by Himself</em> (1840) within the moment that traditionally has been read as a transition between
                  slave labor and free market capitalism. The complicity of Cuban planters with Madden,
                  an avowed abolitionist, to disseminate a translation of Manzano’s life invites us
                  to think further about the circumstances of production of a text that has received
                  ample critical attention. Madden generates the translation as part of the cultural
                  capital that the British abolitionist movement needed to ensure a future beyond 1840
                  given the realignment of geopolitical and economic power in the Atlantic during the
                  1830s, one that included British support for the Latin American Wars of Independence.

                  </div> Yet this realignment corresponded with a “new international division of labor [that]
                  provided important industrial raw materials and foodstuffs for industrializing core
                  powers” (Tomich 69). Notwithstanding Clarkson’s insistence that free labor in a free
                  market would reward those who employed it, in this new order British consumption did
                  not suddenly switch from plantocratic monopolies to the free market.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>One of the priorities of British abolitionists at this time, as Thomas Clarkson reminded
                           the Anti-Slavery Convention delegates, was to demonstrate that abolition was an economically
                           sound proposition, and that a free market would reward “free men” and those who had
                           liberated them. Clarkson stated “Now that this [worldwide abolition] is possible,
                           that this may be done, there is no question. The East India Company alone can do it
                           of themselves, and they can do it by means that are perfectly moral and pacific, according
                           to your own principles, namely, by the cultivation of the earth and by the em…</span></div>
                  </div> Rather, Britons continued to consume the products of slaves from Cuba, Brazil, and
                  the United States even as they sought national rehabilitation from their own participation
                  in the slave trade.

                           1830-1867 (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2002) 338-379.</span></div>
                  </div> The free market actually integrated both slave and free labor into the circulation
                  of capital through the mechanism of credit, which can also be read as “the scene of
                  exchange between the linguistic and the economic” (Derrida, 
                  “White Mythology,”
                   216). Within translation’s economy of linguistic indebtedness, Madden’s text functions
                  paradoxically as a sign of appropriated cultural labor, and performs an ideological
                  accommodation of slavery within the free market / free labor system. He “imports”
                  the “raw material” of Manzano’s life and reflects the double bind of an abolitionism
                  intimately bound up with free market beneficence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In <em>The Ear of the Other</em>, Derrida suggests that “Translation can do everything except mark this linguistic
                  difference inscribed in the language, this difference of language systems inscribed
                  in a single tongue” (100). In the case of Madden and Manzano, the fraught relationship
                  between a translator and his source —the impossibility of complete fidelity to the
                  original— acquires added levels of complexity given the asymmetry of power between
                  translator and author. Madden’s position as representative of the British government
                  placed him in a quasi-diplomatic role, and his authority to mediate between his own
                  government, planters like Del Monte, and slaves who were sold in violation of the
                  1835 treaty between England and Spain inflects his translation with ventriloquizing
                  and distancing voices.

                           adopt within two months the most efficacious measures against participation of her
                           subjects in the slave trade. Article Three declared severe punishments for shipowners,
                           captains, and crew members involved.” See Arthur Corwin, Spain and the Abolition of
                           Slavery in Cuba, 1817-1886 (Austin: U of Texas P, 1967), 60-1.</span></div>
                  </div> Brian Mossop defines the ventriloquizing voice as one that is written for “the party
                  to whom the translator is reporting” and the distancing one as “the manner of writing
                  of the party who has already written a text in the source language” (19); in Madden’s
                  case, this would be an abolitionist’s voice. His choice of tailoring the translation
                  to the expectations of British readers or highlighting the provenance of the text
                  and his own role as translator has generated a range of critical responses to Madden’s
                  agency. Sylvia Molloy has read a kind of betrayal in Madden’s omission of Manzano’s
                  name from the English translation, the changes Madden makes to the chronology of events,
                  and the removal of individuating biographical details, such as Manzano’s constant
                  hunger.

                           place names, and dates, thereby producing a less socially grounded text than Manzano
                           seemingly intends.” See The Representation of Slavery in Cuban Fiction (Columbia:

                  More recently, Gera Burton counters Molloy by suggesting that there was a friendship
                  between the two men, and that Madden’s abolitionist credentials, amply documented,
                  place him above the suspicion of “unauthorizing” Manzano’s text, and filtering the
                  narrative for a British audience through colonialist lenses.

                  shared. “Surmounting the odds, Manzano and Madden each succeeded in effecting agency
                  by forming an alliance of sorts. As a counter-discursive strategy, the Irishman ‘united
                  his voice’ with that of the Cuban” (Burton 50).

               <p>The unmediated way in which Burton presents this union, however, points to the abolitionist
                  relationship to power, one in which humanitarians emphasized the complete abjection
                  of enslaved peoples in order to speak and act on their behalf. Randall McGowen suggests
                  that this strategy “obscured the process by which this identification [with power]
                  was achieved, and the cost it might occasion for a victim. The appeal to humanity
                  made it easier to imagine a sympathetic link that leapt across cultural differences.
                  . . But the precondition to such an appeal to be made was the denial of its own power”
                  (108). In stressing the friendship between Manzano and Madden, Burton minimizes the
                  collaboration between Madden and Del Monte in getting the original from Manzano. The
                  abolitionist content of Madden’s translation conceals the site of cooperation between
                  the planter and Madden, yet it is crucial in understanding how Madden’s translation
                  performs an ideological accommodation of Cuban slavery in the new Atlantic economy
                  while it overtly condemns it. The collusion between Madden and Del Monte creates a
                  problem space where Manzano’s cultural capital is appropriated first by Del Monte
                  and subsequently by Madden, since both the planter and the civil servant could see
                  their respective causes advanced through the translation of Manzano’s life into English.
                  During the 1830s, Del Monte and other Cuban abolitionists were concerned that too
                  many Africans had been imported to Cuba, and feared that the imbalance between blacks
                  and whites would precipitate a second Haiti (Sarracino 103-4). Del Monte saw British
                  vigilance against further trade in slaves as a means of controlling Cuba’s African
                  population, and he was a willing collaborator with Madden. As Del Monte complained
                  to a correspondent in the United States: <span class="quote">‘<span xml:lang="es" lang="es" class="foreign">Los habitantes más ricos del país están ciegos y no ven el peligro inminente en que

Del Monte’s abolitionism is thus mixed with an implicit policy to whiten the overall
                  population of Cuba, and to maintain power concentrated in a ruling elite. Ironically,
                  his friendship with Madden and other British Superintendents eventually implicated
                  Del Monte in the notorious Escalera conspiracy in 1843.

                  second moment of surprise, where Manzano’s poetry is not just “verses,” but “of a
                  high order too.” The reviewer responds to the distancing voice that reveals Madden’s
                  assumptions about a British abolitionist audience after 1839, and the desire of such
                  an audience to read slavery as foreign and not as an occurrence that had been deeply
                  familiar until 1838. The autobiography of a <em>Cuban</em> slave iterates and promises to revitalize the slave narrative in exotic garb, from

                  manuscript, and give it to Madden (Luis 83). There is no evidence in the narrative
                  or his letters to Del Monte that Manzano is ever offered any remuneration for writing
                  it (except for the facilitation of his manumission), and Manzano did not know the
                  details of what Del Monte planned for it beyond a vague notion that his master at
                  the time “tenía interés de que biesen en Europa algunos que tenía razón de ablar de
                  un siervo de su casa, poeta, cuyos versos recitaba de memoria y algunos dudaban que
                  fuesen de uno sin estudios” […was interested that some people from Europe saw for
                  themselves that he was right to speak about a servant in his household, a poet, whose

                  (Manzano, <em>Obras</em>, 87). If, as Burton claims, Madden befriended Manzano while the later was still writing
                  the <span xml:lang="es" lang="es" class="foreign">autobiografía</span>, Madden did not intimate anything about the autobiography’s projected translation
                  or audience. Del Monte and Madden thus circumscribe Manzano’s sense of audience to
                  men who have direct power over him. By contrast, Equiano saw himself addressing the
                  British nation; as Sonia Hofkosh has argued, “Equiano’s <em>Interesting Narrative</em> claims its place in the public sphere, as a political intervention in a vital national
                  debate, as an ‘insrument’ in the formation of public opinion and legislative policy”

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><em>Poems by a Slave in the Island of Cuba</em> came out in time for the convention, and Madden dedicated it to Joseph Sturge. The
                  social and economic relations that allowed Del Monte to appropriate the manuscript
                  from Manzano and gift it to Madden, who then repurposed it for his own ends, emerge
                  in Madden’s own account of the circuitous route of the text: <span class="quote">‘A Collection of Poems written by a slave recently liberated . . . was presented to
                     me in the year 1838 by a gentleman at Havana, a Creole . . . some of these pieces
                     had had fortunately found their way to Havana, and attracted the attention of the
                     literary people there, while the poor author was in slavery in the neighborhood of
                     Matanzas. The gentleman to whom I have alluded . . . redeemed this poor fellow from
                     slavery . . . [and] induced him to write his story. (Madden 37, 39)’</span> If Manzano and Madden had a friendship —an alliance, as Burton suggests— why is it
                  Del Monte who “presents” the text to Madden, and who also “induces” Manzano into the
                  labor of writing it? Manzano’s free will is subject to Del Monte as the man who “redeemed”
                  him from slavery; besides the religious connotations of saving someone from sin, the
                  second definition of the word suggests to “gain or regain possession of something
                  in exchange for payment” (OED). The relationship of indebtedness that Del Monte creates
                  when he “redeems” Manzano entitles him to Manzano’s labor without remuneration. Manzano
                  thus has to suffer “inducement” to write as payment for Del Monte’s role in buying
                  him out of slavery. The labor that Manzano is compelled to do for Del Monte does not
                  get remunerated, unless Manzano’s manumission itself is a form of payment, a loan
                  that Manzano must repay. Del Monte thus practices a kind of usury to extract the literary
                  value of Manzano’s life, one that Madden continues in his translation by staging Manzano’s
                  invisibility in the text. In Derridean terms, this relationship of usury is one of
                  “erasure by rubbing, exhaustion, crumbling away, certainly; but also the supplementary
                  product of a capital, the exchange which far from losing the original investment would
                  fructify its initial wealth, would increase the return in the form of revenue, additional
                  interest, linguistic value” (
                  “White Mythology”
                   210). The omission of Manzano’s name as author, and the attribution in the Preface
                  to Del Monte <em>and not</em> Manzano as the originator of the text, multiply the relation of indebtedness that
                  induces labor.

                  of recording my conviction, that the blessings of education and good government are
                  only wanting to make the Natives of Africa, intellectually and morally, equal to any
                  people on the surface of the globe” (37). Like Del Monte, Madden seeks to “redeem”
                  Manzano before a mostly white audience, like the “God of all light and truth” on whom
                  Madden calls to “Reprove the despot and redeem the slave” (
                  “The Slave-Trade Merchant”
                   l. 259). Redemption, however, involves a taking of possession of Manzano through the
                  translated text and Madden’s appropriation of Manzano’s cultural labor. The translation
                  codifies the commodification of the Cuban worker’s labor for a British market and
                  the complicity of the Cuban elite, collapsing the labor of the “recently liberated”
                  with the work of the slave. The symbolic investment of the translation reproduces
                  the transformation of the two kinds of labor into credit and debt that mirrored the
                  workings of the free market and finance capital. In 1834, for instance, British banks
                  financed the first Cuban railroad with a loan of £400,000, and its construction relied
                  “on local journeymen and mainly rented slaves and freemen” (Zanetti and García 26,
                  29).

                           Consul in Havana in 1837 while Madden acted as Superintendent of Liberated Africans,
                           intervened to get investment for the Sociedad Minera del Cobre, which introduced another
                           railroad for mining interests in Cuba. Zanetti and García add “the first foreign loan
                           in Cuban history, was contracted with the banking firm of Alexander Robertson who

            <p>Moreover, the strange presentation of the work as the <em>Poems of a Cuban Slave</em>, when what one in fact reads first is Madden’s own two poems, 
               “The Slave Trade Merchant,”
               and 
               “The Sugar Estate,”
               before getting to Manzano’s life and poems, reifies the position of the British subject
               as interpreter and consumer of the lives of others. Within the <em>Poems by a Cuban Slave</em>, Manzano’s life serves as documentation for Madden’s poems, a proto-appendix that
               foreshadows the appendices that follow. One contemporary reviewer noted the imbalance:
               “The major part of [<em>Poems by a Cuban Slave</em>] is occupied by a poem of Dr. Madden’s own” (
               “Anthology”
               403). Madden crowds out Manzano, and turns the translator, usually the marginal, anonymous
               figure, into the author. Even as he explains the translation, Madden manages to highlight
               his poems. “I have given a literal translation of it [Manzano’s life], and that translation,
               revised by a Spaniard, will be found at the end of these poems” [
               “The Slave Trade Merchant”
               and 
               “The Sugar Estate”
               ] (39).</p>
            <p>The signifying relation between Madden’s framing poems and appendices and Manzano’s
               work in the volume becomes the “exchange” that will “fructify … the wealth” of Madden’s
               investment in Manzano, since Madden uses the Cuban writer’s life to draw both veracity
               and value for his own enunciations—both the poetic and the documentary. Besides performing
               the abolitionist gesture of showing the world that Africans had intelligence and feelings,
               Madden self-consciously presents his work as part of a literary abolitionist tradition.
               He places himself alongside a canonical list of British anti-slavery poets such as
               Hannah More, James Montgomery and William Cowper on the grounds that Cuban planters
               have only been written about “by travelers who have judged their humanity by the curteousness
               of their manners” (38), and he intends to rectify the record. With the “The Slave
               Merchant” and “The Sugar Estate,” Madden “determined, therefore, to give a short but
               faithful sketch of the Cuban slave-trade merchant and planter in verse” (38). These
               poems have been overlooked in commentary about Madden’s translation, which has focused
               on Manzano’s life and poems given contemporary critical interests. Yet the poems are
               as much a part of the translation as Madden’s pledged fidelity to Manzano’s original
               since they situate Madden in an aesthetic, cultural, and political landscape that
               abolitionist readers could understand and through which they could read Manzano’s
               life.</p>
            <p>As McGowen points out, “The discourse of the anti-slavery movement revolved around
               three figures—the slave, the slave owner, and the humanitarian” (104). Madden recasts
               these figures through the cultural Otherness of Cuba and the foreignness of Spanish.
               He differentiates the humanitarian through his depiction of the Cuban slave-merchant
               and the planter as personifications of extreme greed and his exposure of the dissonance
               between the planter’s gallant code of conduct to foreigners <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-à-vis</span> his inhumanity to the slaves. The need for translation, given Cuba’s exotic setting,
               makes the silence of the slaves more pronounced since there is an added layer between
               the British abolitionist reader and the Cuban enslaved person—that of a “foreign”
               language. In 
               “The Slave-Trade Merchant”
               , the figure of effictio serves to draw a portrait in contrasts between the surface
               appearance and the truths that Madden as abolitionist and cultural insider can reveal.
               Effictio is forensic as it is descriptive, and it allows Madden to distance himself
               clinically from the slave merchant as he catalogues the “trade” (l.39) and denounces
               the crimes that support it. The deference that people have towards the merchant’s
               “solemn features” (l.2), and conspicuous wealth, “those gay saloons, this banquet
               hall’s array” (l.13), ignores his real identity, which Madden can disclose as privileged
               observer. He instructs the reader:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Behold, his heart! It is not all that’s fair </div>
                  <div class="l">And smooth without, that’s staunch and sound elsewhere. </div>
                  <div class="l">E’en in the calmest breast, the lust of gold </div>
                  <div class="l">May have its firmest seat and fastest hold</div>

                  <div class="l">Nor spark of pity where its lust enthralls. (16-24)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Greed infects the merchant’s “heart” and “core,” corrupting and ultimately destroying
               his ability to feel for others. Madden asks his readers to weigh the merchant’s material
               well-being and desire for profit against his diseased morality “To human suffering,
               sympathy and shame, / His heart is closed, and wealth is all his aim” (l. 218-9).
               The heroic couplets reinforce the opposition between the public persona of the planter
               and his rotten internal self. The heart is “not all that’s fair,” and “the calmest
               breast” burns with the “lust of gold.”</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Madden attributes society’s acceptance of the planter to his seeming lack of connection
                  to the violence of slavery because of the physical distance between the businessman
                  and slavers in the African coast. Scenes of a writing slave merchant do not occur
                  often in abolitionist poetry; their appearance in Madden’s poem call attention to
                  writing as an instrument of the trader, one that he uses to manage his business across
                  continents. The merchant “Sits at his desk, and with composure sends / A formal order
                  to his Gold-coast friends / For some five hundred ‘bultos’ of effects” (l.44). The
                  writing of the merchant enables the conversion of credit, “the formal order,” into
                  “bultos,” a conversion reversed once the slaves reach their expected destination.
                  As Ian Baucom explains, “slaves were thus treated not only as a type of commodity
                  but as a type of interest bearing money. They functioned in this system simultaneously
                  as commodities for sale and as the reserve deposits of a loosely organized, decentered,
                  but vast trans-Atlantic banking system” (61).

                  </div> The Spanish term <span xml:lang="es" lang="es" class="foreign">bultos</span> casts into relief the symbolic transacting of the merchant’s credit and its concatenation
                  of value to slaves both as commodities and as potential capital in the bodies that
                  will be forced to labor. Later, Madden indicates “The pen does all the business of
                  the sword, / On Congo’s shore, the Cuban merchant’s word / Serves to send forth a
                  thousand brigands bold” (125).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Madden uses English as a marker of cultural and national difference in order to disentangle
               the process of his own literary translation of “bultos” into “slaves” from the mechanisms
               of credit that perform the transformation of these symbolic values into commodities.
               According to Madden, the Cuban merchant, the “proud” and “excellent Señor,” has a
               counterpart in the African agents who “foment the strife / of hostile tribes” (ll.
               129-30) in order to obtain slaves, and not in the London merchants and bankers with
               whom the Cuban elite also transacted, as observed earlier. The word <span class="foreign" xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor,</span> usually a title of respect, denotes the merchant’s cultural separateness with contempt,
               an othering that is enforced through the seamless continuity that the poem posits
               between the greed of the merchant and the violence of the African slavers. Greed thus
               becomes culturally othered, province of “The tribe of Cuban traders, linked in crime,”
               and geographically situated in “Havana and its joys” (ll. 191). The Señor and Cuban
               culture, including the Spanish language, belong to a world of corruption that the
               British abolitionist, by virtue of being an outsider, can denounce in English. He
               laments as much when he asks:</p>

            <p> It is up to Madden to then become the agent who denounces, who warns, who becomes
               the “new Las Casas.” Madden thus invests British culture and the English language
               with moral authority, developing a parallel, if unstated, narrative of the British
               abolitionist as a virtuous figure who stands in opposition to his Cuban counterparts,
               the merchant and Manzano, who here is not counted among the voices that could “bid
               these horrors cease,” though his autobiography is included in the volume. Madden displays
               intense indignation on behalf of “human flesh”; “victims”; “human cargo”; “slaves”;
               “naked wretches”; “Specters of men”; and an anaphoric enumeration of nameless victims,
               “how many wretched beings,” “infants,” “defenseless mothers,” “struggling hands,”
               “sick,” “creatures,” and “negroes” (ll. 75-108). He catalogues the victims of slavery
               as a means of producing them to expose the merchant’s crime.</p>
            <p>Madden expands the cultural inscription of greed and cruelty as Cuban in “The Sugar
               Estate,” the companion poem to 
               “The Slave-Trade Merchant,”
               in which an English traveler narrates his journey from Havana through the Cuban countryside.
               He visits a plantation, where he enjoys the hospitality of a Cuban Conde [Count],
               and converses with him and the <em>mayoral</em> [overseer] regarding the state of Cuban slavery. What he finds there pales in comparison
               to “All to the charge of British planters laid . . . And yields the bad pre-eminence
               in crime / To Spanish guilt in ev’ry tropic clime” (69). The comparison with West
               Indian slavery, which has been abolished, contains a message of absolution that serves
               to reconstruct the national narrative of British slavery. According to Madden, British
               planters were not as bad as their Cuban or Spanish counterparts, since in Cuba “the
               grasping master must still have / Just thrice the produce from each working slave”
               (ll.93-4). Yet the contrast is more than moral; it also pits temporalities and national
               histories against one another. Madden locates the present of the Cuban plantation
               in relation to the guilty past of British slavery and the contemporaneity of post-abolition
               Britain. The play of temporal frames underscores the retrograde character of the Cuban
               system, whereas Britain’s historical edge corresponds with the moral leadership that
               abolitionists claim.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Conde combines the worst traits of British planters and aristocrats alike. Following
                  James Montgomery, who calls the Creole planter “The bloated vampire of a living man”
                  (26), Madden defines the Conde as a figure whose ostentatious wealth, like the planter’s,
                  points to the misery of the slaves under his control:
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">

                     </div>
                  </blockquote> The French turn of the Conde’s table, with its “ragouts” and “Frieandeaus,” offers
                  a menu characterized by frivolity. The linking of the Conde’s appetite and “excess”
                  invokes the sin of gluttony, and the identification between the bodies of enslaved
                  laborers and consumption that an earlier wave of abolitionists, such as William Cowper
                  and S.T. Coleridge, had popularized.

                  </div> The moral condemnation of the menu corresponds to the traveler’s abolitionist objections
                  to the Conde’s arguments for slavery, which by 1840 had been popularized on both sides
                  of the Atlantic. These included the relative well-being of slaves in comparison to
                  the poor of other countries, the familial loyalty of slaves, and the planter’s insistence
                  that the slaves would have been worse off in Africa.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Conde politely shows the traveler out after discovering his abolitionist sympathies;
               as he’s leaving the plantation, the traveler runs into the mayoral, who gladly corrects
               his impressions of Cuban slavery and inadvertently completes the portrait of the Conde’s
               dissipation. The mayoral, “almost frank and civil in his way,” (l. 56) focuses on
               the profit motive as the driving force behind slavery. “With twenty hours of unremitting
               toil . . . believe me few grow old, / but life is cheap, and sugar sir,—is gold .
               . . Our interest is to make the most we can / Of every negro in the shortest span”
               (ll. 163-70). He calmly explains how the “unremitting toil” of the enslaved laborers
               is directly connected to their high mortality rate, and the almost instant replacement
               of dead workers with new ones, implicating the United States in supplying Cuba with
               slaves. “There’s stock abundant in the slave bazaars, / Thanks to the banner of the
               stripes and stars” (l. 157-8). Family relationships are non-existent in what amounts
               to a sugar-cane gulag. There are no civil or religious marriages, and low birth rates
               are accompanied by infanticide “they [mothers] preferred to see / Their children dead
               before their face, ere they / Would give their young ‘negritos’ to the kind / Indulgent
               masters which they are said to find” (ll. 83-6). During the first part of the mayoral’s
               explanation, he details the use of whips, stocks, and other physical punishments with
               a precision and casualness that appear to leave the traveler speechless. As if to
               answer the traveler’s silence, the mayoral continues in a monologue, and attempts
               to distance himself from the daily cruelty he inflicts: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Think you, for us there’s profit in the gain</div>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> This passage is somewhat odd within abolitionist poetry which, in all the impersonations
               it offers, does not feature overseers as commentators on slavery. The mayoral argues
               that since he does not directly “profit,” he is exonerated him from the pain he inflicts
               on the Conde’s behalf. The denial of his role would appear as rationalization were
               it not for his momentary indentification with the powerlessness of the slaves, imagining
               a situation where the master is “to toil compelled.” This insubordinate and potentially
               revolutionary scenario is rooted in the mayoral’s resentment of the Conde’s gambling
               and dissipation in Havana, which results in heavier demands on him and the slaves
               he oversees. He recognizes that in being an instrument of the Conde, he is part of
               a system that is regulated by “oppression’s iron hand,” yet is unable to imagine himself
               outside of it.</p>
            <p>Though the traveler finds himself in a plantation, the slaves remain strikingly silent
               once again. Their only representation is through a brief allusion to Manzano. The
               indirect reference to Manzano illustrates the supplementary function that his narrative
               plays in connection to Madden’s framing poems. Describing “the proud Havana infamous
               renown” (l. 20), Madden notes “those ladies, foreigners, and all / Whose wretched
               negroes tremble at their call […] Their home spent passions and their smiling lips,
               / Their out-door meekness and their in-door whips” (ll. 33-8). The description is
               based on one of Manzano’s sequences of his tenure as a page for the Marquesa in Havana,
               where he attended her at <span class="foreign" xml:lang="es" lang="es">tertulia</span> and card tables. “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="es" lang="es">Yo no me podia separar detras del espaldar de su taburete hasta la ora de partir que
                  era por lo regular las dose de la noche … si en el inter duraba la tertulia me dormia
                  si al ir detrás de la bolante por alguna casualidad se me apagaba el farol . . . yo
                  iba a dormir al sepo</span>” [I could not quit the side of her chair till midnight . . . If during the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="es" lang="es">tertulia</span> I fell asleep, or when behind the volante, if the lanthorn went out by accident .
               . . I was put up for the night in stocks] (Manzano, <em>Obras</em>, 15; Madden 86). Manzano’s account serves as corroboration for Madden and heightens
               the location of debt in the freed subject, just as interest is located in the body
               of the slave. Manzano’s account “cannot quit the side” of Madden’s poems, just as
               he could not leave the Marquesa at the playing table.</p>
            <p>Manzano’s text and its translation signify a relationship of usury that problematizes
               the revelatory paradigm of Madden’s condemnation and the forensic authority of the
               accusation of dissimulation that Madden levels at the merchant and the planter. The
               paradigm depends on the opposition of values between the merchant and the abolitionist,
               one in which the abolitionist favors the value of humanity over the Cuban merchant’s
               greed. This opposition results in a narrative of liberal values that eschew economic
               ones, and “put people first.” The writing of the merchant —the letters of credit that
               exchange for “merchandise” and expected returns in monetary interest— bears an economic
               value derived from the legal negation of the enslaved person as an agent and his or
               her economic exploitation through violence. Madden pits abolitionist writing against
               the merchant’s as writing that has a positive relationship to value as it affirms
               the enslaved person’s humanity morally and legally. Yet if the merchant’s letters
               of credit signify people as commodities and bearers of interest, Madden’s writing
               codifies the relationship of debt involved in “redemption.” The freedom of the enslaved
               subject therefore is also figured in terms of credit; once free, the former slave
               becomes a debtor to the “credit” that the establishment is willing to extend. Through
               Madden’s Wordsworthian purification of Manzano’s autobiography, Manzano’s freedom
               is construed in terms of its relationship to debt and the credit that Madden and Del
               Monte lend. </p>
            <p>Madden’s instinct to translate and elicit empathy for the suffering of Cuban slaves
               participates in the Romantic impulse to intervene that Lee identifies in the dialectic
               between humanitarianism and capitalism at the heart of the abolitionist movement (36).
               Yet with the end of the struggle for abolition, slaves were no longer the “Others”
               directly connected to Britain’s colonial apparatus in the West Indies who demanded
               such ethical commitments. Rather, slaves in Cuba, Brazil (and to a lesser degree the
               United States) were the Other once removed. In the new Atlantic economic order that
               demanded primary materials for the metropole, the labor of those Others was increasingly
               out of view. The liberation of British slaves made it easier for Britons to refigure
               their slaveholding past and distance themselves from connections to other slave-holding
               countries. In that climate, Madden returned to the stock characters of the “aged and
               shaking” abolitionist poetry and rhetoric: the cruel, primped, and pilfering creole
               planter; the exploited and exploiting overseer, the tortured slave—types that in 1840
               seemed to belong to a distant past rather than the present, before presenting Manzano,
               an example of the last type. </p>
            <p>“Translation generates the comfortable expectation of stating a relative truth lighter
               than absolute truth: the claim to be truthful at least to the truth propounded in
               the source language,” suggests Tullio Maranhão (65). If Madden was “truthful at least”
               to the “truth” in Manzano’s original, it was in exposing the relations that made Manzano’s
               a twice trafficked life. </p>

               they published in 1838. In the view of private and public critics of the Wilberforce
               sons there was more than filopietism at issue in their charge that Clarkson claimed
               leadership in the cause when their father was entitled to it; they suggested that
               Clarkson had been to all intents and purposes an agent of the Abolition Committee.
               Sara Coleridge saw the Wilberforce sons claiming antislavery for their brand of Clapham

         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">One of the priorities of British abolitionists at this time, as Thomas Clarkson reminded
               the Anti-Slavery Convention delegates, was to demonstrate that abolition was an economically
               sound proposition, and that a free market would reward “free men” and those who had
               liberated them. Clarkson stated “Now that this [worldwide abolition] is <em>possible</em>, that <em>this may be done</em>, there is no question. The East India Company alone can do it of themselves, and
               they can do it by means that are <em>perfectly moral and pacific, according to your own principles</em>, namely, by the <em>cultivation of the earth</em> and by the employment of <em>free labour</em>. They may, if they please, not only have the high honour of abolishing Slavery and
               the Slave Trade, but the advantage of increasing their revenue beyond all calculation;
               for, in the first place, they have land in their possession twenty times more than
               equal <em>to the supply of all Europe with tropical produce</em>; in the second place, they can procure, not tens of thousands, but tens of millions
               of free labourers to work; in the third place, <em>what is of the greatest consequence in this case</em>, the price of labour with these is only from a penny to three-halfpence per day.
               What slavery can stand against these prices?” [Emphasis Clarkson]. See Thomas Clarkson,
               <em>The Opening of the General Anti-Slavery Convention</em> (London: 1840) 2. “The tens of millions of free labourers to work” and “the advantage
               of increasing revenue beyond all calculation” drive the logic of Clarkson’s argument
               for humanitarian capitalism. Measured against the systematized violence of slave production,
               nearly next-to-nothing wages “only from a penny to three-halfpence a day” appear as
               just compensation for “free” labor.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               In the letter, Madden wrote “I cannot tell you how grieved I am about poor Manzano,
               the Cuban poet. Many a time the poor fellow came to my house and talked over his trouble
