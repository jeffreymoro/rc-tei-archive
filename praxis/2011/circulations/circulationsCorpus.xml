               <p>On October 17, Haiti commemorates the assassination of its revolutionary hero and
               first head of state, Jean-Jacques Dessalines (ca. 1758-1806). Haiti dignifies no
               other individual with an official national holiday. Haiti’s <foreign>Père de la
                  Patrie</foreign> was born a slave in what was at that time France’s most valuable
               colony, Saint-Domingue. There are few extant details of his personal life and
               thoughts. In his early life, he seems to have been most noted for his ugliness and
               the extent of his scars. And most accounts agree that within the strictly stratified
               society of Saint-Domingue, Dessalines began life at the absolute bottom: he had the
               infinite misfortune of being the black slave of a black master who brutalized him
               with frequent floggings (Harvey, 21; Heinl, 88). All this would change for
               Dessalines, however, when the enslaved laborers organized and rebelled. </p>
               <p>The complexities and amazing extremes of this slave-to-emperor’s biography cannot be
               separated from the extraordinary times and place in which he lived. It would not be
               hyperbole to proclaim that the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) was the most signal and
               transformative event in the Age of Revolution. Saint-Domingue’s astounding journey
               from a French sugar colony of nearly a half million enslaved to an independent black
               nation is a convoluted tale. With the slave uprising, the colony erupted into battles
               that fell along economic and racial fault lines. At one point there were as many as
               six factions warring at once, with alliances formed and dissolved in rapid succession
               between the various groups: rich white planters, poorer white laborers, French troops
               trying to restore order in the colony, the opportunistic armies of England and Spain,
               free persons of color (most of mixed-race ancestry, “mulattos”), and the enslaved
               majority with its own internal divisions between African and Creole born. During the
               long years of fighting, most sides at one point courted the rebel blacks with offers
               to arm and then to emancipate. A “born soldier,” Dessalines became known as a
               courageous fighter and a fear- and fealty-inspiring commander in his own right. He
               ascended rapidly through the ranks, becoming a key and indefatigable general under
               the famous Toussaint L’Ouverture, fighting for the royalist Spanish army, then for
               the French republican army fighting against the Spanish and British. In 1799,
               Toussaint entrusted Dessalines with putting down a civil war, which has been
               typically understood as a conflict between mulattos in the south against the blacks,
               who were aided by a U.S. Navy blockade. With the revolts crushed, Toussaint needed to
               stabilize the black armies and eliminate officers and soldiers loyal to his rival,
               the defeated southern leader Andre Rigaud. Dessalines’s reprisals led to many
               executions, to which Toussaint is said to have chastised, “I said to prune the tree,
               not to uproot it.” Some scholars have suggested, however, that Toussaint had ordered
               these killings but had his generals take responsibility in order to keep his hands
               and reputation (relatively) clean (James 236; Dubois 236). Regardless of the veracity
               of the claims of such political underworkings, the war’s events have allowed most
               histories to treat Dessalines as Toussaint’s brutal foil.</p>
               <p>Nonetheless, Dessalines was the soldier that the battlefield and times necessitated,
               a general willing to see plainly what was needed and not hesitating to respond
               accordingly if bluntly. Military expediency, not diplomacy, distinguished Dessalines.
               After Toussaint’s capture and deportation in 1802, Dessalines deemed that the war was
               now a revolution for total independence rather than colonial autonomy with
               emancipation. And he succeeded in completing history’s most successful slave revolt,
               leading the colony to national independence, though Haiti’s subsequent instabilities
               have and continue to call into question how well this dream was achieved. Historian
               Laurent Dubois’s cogent assessment of Toussaint just as easily applies to Dessalines:
               “Though his ultimate inability to construct a multiracial, egalitarian, and
               democratic society in Saint-Domingue might strike us as particularly tragic, given
               his origins, this was a failure he shared with the leaders of every other
               postemancipation society in the Atlantic world” (174).</p>
               <p>History and legend link Dessalines with several signal acts in the birth of this
               first modern independent black nation. In May 1803, he tore the white band from the
               French <foreign>tricolour</foreign>, uniting the blue and red in a new flag. This became
               the symbol of racial unity between blacks and people of color in the face of France’s
               final attempts to retake the colony through a desperate war of extermination (Dubois,
               292-3). The symbol of the flag would later be made concrete in the nation’s 1805
               inaugural constitution, which proclaimed that all citizens would henceforth be
               designated “black.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Haiti’s constitution
                  pronounced all Haitians “black,” even the Polish and German mercenaries who had
                  remained on the island after defecting from the French and British armies.
                  Dessalines and his advisors were well aware that Haiti’s precarious independence
                  and the freedom of the self-liberated slaves depended on not allowing the tensions
                  of skin color, with its underlying meaning of caste, to weaken the fledgling
                  nation. David Nicholls has suggested that this may be one of the earliest, if not
                  the first, time that the term “black” was employed ideologically (36). </note>
               Dessalines’s “indigenous army” and a growing coalition of guerilla fighters, aided by
               a yellow fever epidemic, decimated the remaining French forces, who ultimately
               surrendered in December, 1803. On January 1, 1804, Dessalines proclaimed national
               independence and severed colonial ties by replacing the name Saint Domingue with the
               Amer-Indian word Haiti (<foreign>ayti</foreign>). As Dubois has noted, the re-christening
               of the nation with its original Taino name attempted to symbolically disrupt
               centuries of European empire and brutality (299). More ominously, the declaration
               also chided the new black citizens for not fully avenging their dead by allowing some
               French planters to remain on the island. Later that spring, rhetoric moved to action.
               Convinced that the French who had remained in the colony in the hopes of reclaiming
               some of their land and property were already plotting to destabilize the young
               nation, Dessalines ordered their execution. Ignoring the hideous atrocities of
               France’s campaign of extermination at the close of the revolution, popular accounts
               describe Dessalines’s orders as a barbarous aberration. By ordering the remaining
               colonists’ doom, Dessalines sealed for Haiti a lasting reputation as a nightmare
               republic in the eyes of the greater white world. </p>
               <p>Dessalines’s meteoric rise from abject slave to iron-fisted emperor willing to
               preserve his fledgling nation’s freedom by any means necessary seems only fit to
               engender an even more dramatic downfall. Dessalines’s despotism, draconian labor
               policies, and enforced land reform plans soon disillusioned the peasants,
               fair-skinned elite landowners, and military alike. On October 17, 1806, Dessalines’s
               soldiers ambushed their leader and rendered his body to pieces. Legends state that
               the madwoman Défilée, possibly Dessalines’s spurned lover and a sutler to his troops,
               gathered, buried, and guarded the emperor’s remains in a final act of restorative
               devotion. </p>
               <p>At his death, Dessalines was both torn asunder and repaired. His complex legacy
               suffered a similar fate. Over two centuries of Haitian, European and U.S. American
               popular representations of Dessalines reconstruct this leader, though often by
               eliminating his contradictions, thus rendering his complex legacy piecemeal. Haiti’s
               revolutionary heroes, especially the black triumvirate of Toussaint L'Ouverture,
               Henri Christophe and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, are important not only in political
               histories but also cultural storytelling. And not surprisingly, their biographical
               narratives are often conflicting and depend greatly on who is enacting the telling.
               In this essay, I will examine some of the many ways that popular representations of
               Dessalines have shaped his legacy—politically, creatively and ritualistically. I will
               begin with an overview of representations of the demonic Dessalines, which continued
               into the twentieth century, particularly during the U.S. Occupation of Haiti. Next, I
               will outline how African-American writers in particular have recovered Dessalines as
               a dramatic and powerful black hero, though one unburdened from his more extreme
               actions. I will conclude my discussion with the Haitian folk religion of Vodou, which
               is one of the few spaces that recognizes and celebrates the contradictory nature of
               this mercurial figure. </p>
               <p>Early Haitian histories with accounts of Dessalines largely do not appear until
               around the mid-nineteenth century, during the waning years of the Revolutionary
               generation and a growing economic divide that tended to fall along color
               distinctions. These written accounts were largely put forward by the economically and
               politically powerful educated mulatto elite who, perhaps not surprisingly, privileged
               mulatto revolutionary leaders like André Rigaud over black leaders like Dessalines
               and Christophe. Historian David Nicholls gives one of the most comprehensive
               meditations on the divide between racial and color identities within Haitian culture
               and its importance in the construction of its history for political purposes. He
               notes, “Mulatto historians developed a whole legend of the past, according to which
               the real heroes of Haitian independence were the mulatto leaders…. The black leaders
               were portrayed as either wicked or ignorant, and the legend was clearly designed to
               reinforce the subjugation of the masses and the hegemony of the mulatto elite” (11;
               see also 85-101). </p>
               <p>These early Haitian historians who chose to demonize Dessalines found good company
               with an already established and ever increasing body of European and U.S. accounts
               that established the vocabulary and interpretive lens through which this founding
               father and all of Haiti would be judged: African savage, diabolical, inhuman,
               ferocious, base and sanguinary, cruel and brutal, vain and capricious, lustful and
               insatiable (Barskett; Chazotte; Dubroca, Franklin; Harvey). In his literary analysis
               of narratives of the Haitian Revolution, Matt Clavin argues that the ubiquitous
               published histories and biographies that circulated throughout the nineteenth-century
               trans-Atlantic world commodified the Haitian Revolution and its principal actors.
               This flood of writing captured the attention of and titillated a growing boom of
               readers in a competitive literary market. Clavin argues that this was accomplished
               through the use of standard literary techniques, especially the conventions of Gothic
               literature, such as crumbling and exotic scenery, characters seemingly outside the
               bounds of Enlightenment rationality, and, above all, descriptions of “indescribable”
               violent and brutal acts (14-29). Dessalines provided the most direct and titillating
               example of exotic barbarity, the Enlightenment turned on its head but corrected with
               the equally brutal downfall of the black emperor, an example of horrific history that
               far outpaced Gothic fiction and found an eager audience. </p>
               <p>Not surprisingly, these numerous accounts of the Haitian Revolution can also be
               sorted based on the ideologies of their authors: abolitionist or pro-slavery.
               Abolitionist accounts tended to diminish the role of Dessalines in lieu of Toussaint
               L’Ouverture, who in turn was presented as gentle, educated, Christian and
               compromising. Captured and deported before the extremely brutal final revolutionary
               period, where both sides waged a desperate war of extermination, Toussaint as martyr
               could become a positive symbol of black potential and enlightened character. What the
               Abolitionists downplayed, the pro-slavery side sought to exploit: Dessalines’s
               killings, portrayed as the sanguinary finale of blacks’ mercurial treachery, served
               as the shining example of the disasters that awaited sudden and complete
               emancipation. Pierre Etienne [Peter Stephen] Chazotte, who claimed to be one of the
               few eyewitnesses to survive Dessalines’s ordered massacre of French whites in 1804,
               published an English translation of his experiences in 1840, based, as he claimed, on
               notes he had written during the events. His work was meant to discredit what he saw
               as the abolitionist lies particularly propagated by the English. For Chazotte,
               Dessalines was a mindless executioner, a puppet of the English Wilberforce Society
               (41, 48, 69). Over several detailed pages, Chazotte regaled his readers with his
               direct observations of the executions (46-51), adding voyeuristic passages of pathos
               for the killings in the night that he overheard but did not see from his guarded
               residence: “Cries of murder, defiance, despair, rage, and vociferations, intermixed
               with the groans and lamentations of the wounded and the dying, resounded through the
               whole place” (50). Chazotte used his narrative to produce a damning account of the
               English as the main force who spurred the barbaric yet simplistic blacks towards
               violence, while also concluding that this merely shows the imitative nature of all
               persons of African descent and that a modern self-rule was well beyond Haitians’
               capabilities. </p>
               <p>Building upon earlier descriptions like Chazotte’s, the British Minister Resident to
               Haiti Sir Spenser St. John wrote the most popular and widely circulated of
               nineteenth-century descriptions of Haiti’s history and religion, <title level="m">Haiti or the Black Republic </title>(1884), a work <emph>intended</emph> to prove
               the inferiority of blacks, especially regarding self-government. According to St.
               John, although Dessalines had been a revolutionary hero, what truly “endears his
               memory to the Haytians” was his inaugural act of white massacre (77). St. John notes
               that Dessalines suspected that some of his generals, out of “interest or humanity,”
               may not have carried out his orders fully and took it upon himself to tour the
               country and “pitilessly massacred every French man, woman, or child that fell in his
               way.” St. John continued, “One can imagine the saturnalia of these liberated slaves
               enjoying the luxury of shedding the blood of those in whose presence they had
               formerly trembled; and this without danger; for what resistance could those helpless
               men, women, and children offer to their savage executioners?” (77) (St. John,
               however, did allow that more properly enlightened and educated Haitians were at least
               “in truth utterly ashamed of the conduct and civil administration of their national
               hero” (79).) St. John’s work remained highly influential into the twentieth century,
               becoming one of the most frequently cited sources behind early accounts justifying
               and supporting the U.S. military invasion and occupation of Haiti. Two days after the
               initial U.S. Marine invasion of what would become a nineteen-year occupation
               (1915-1934), the <title level="j">New York Times</title> outlined the Black
               Republic’s “customs” of corruption, despotism, revolution, and assassination, noting
               that this has held true since Haiti’s founding father had ordered the massacre of the
               country’s remaining whites (“Latest Revolution” 8). By invoking the terrifying events
               of 1804, the <title level="j">New York Times</title> assured its readers of the vital
               importance of a strong U.S. military presence in 1915. </p>
               <p>Five years later and in direct response to damning revelations of the U.S.
               Occupation’s financial and military abuses, the December 1920 <title level="j">National Geographic Magazine </title>defensively presented the benefits of
               occupation in a lavishly illustrated, three-article suite which cited St. John’s
               1880s work frequently. British explorer and photographer Sir Harry Johnston
               contributed one of the articles, presenting a picturesque Haiti greatly improved
               under U.S. guidance. Johnston, however, takes issue with a few lingering details. In
               Port-au-Prince, Johnston describes the great expanse of the Champ de Mars: “In the
               middle of this open space is a preposterously vulgar statue of Dessalines, who is
               regarded as the national hero of Haiti, the people having, with typical ingratitude,
               put on one side the real great man of their history, the remarkable and noble-hearted
               Toussaint L'Ouverture” (“Haiti” 496). The monumental honoring of a monster, rather
               than the more beneficent and accommodating Toussaint, underscored the <title level="j">National Geographic</title>’s presentation of Haitians, particularly the
               peasants who dared to resist their U.S. occupiers, as petulant children who neither
               appreciated what was good for them, nor showed proper gratitude or respect. </p>
               <p>Importantly, the information within this article was gathered during Johnston’s
               six-month trip through the Caribbean and United States in 1908-9, <emph>before</emph>
               the U.S. occupied Haiti. The <title level="j">National Geographic</title>, therefore,
               has shifted the meaning and context of Johnston’s text to coincide with a vision of
               Haiti as newly cleaned-up and “regenerated” by the United States. Originally
               publishing his findings in <title level="j">The Negro in the New World</title>
               (1910), Johnston did note at that time the ugly nature of the statue of Dessalines on
               the Champ de Mars and called for its removal (177). Johnston described the massacring
               Dessalines to be an “abominable monster of cruelty” and an example of “the Negro at
               his very worst” (159). Additionally, he argued, “It is a <emph>disgrace</emph> to
               Haiti that amidst all her monuments, good, bad, and indifferent, none has been raised
               to commemorate the character and the achievements of Toussaint Louverture, whose
               record is one of the greatest hopes for the Negro race” (158-9, italics in original).
               Johnston’s pronouncement mirrors Englishman Hesketh Prichard’s lament of 1900 that
               Haitians have consciously selected the barbarous Dessalines over the noble (and
               probably not “full-blooded negro”) Toussaint for their national hero (279-80). For
               both authors, Toussaint is the exception that proves Dessalines’s bloody rule.
               Moreover, outside observers continued to be incredulous of contemporary Haitians’
               choice of Dessalines as the country’s highest honored national hero, a sure
               indication of the faulty and incompetent progress of the black nation. </p>
               <p>What these outside observers failed to acknowledge, however, was that the honoring of
               Dessalines had and continued to be rigorously deliberated by the Haitian elite. The
               beginnings of the official recovery of Dessalines began in the 1840s. As the
               revolutionary generation passed away, Dessalines’s legacy was rehabilitated enough to
               allow for a modest grave marker, and an even more modest pension for his aging widow.
               In 1861, Haitian newspapers heatedly debated a proposal for the creation of a
               monument to Dessalines. As historian David Nicholls has pointed out, Haitians chose
               sides in this “acute controversy” based on political and racial allegiances; blacks
               and those espousing a <foreign>noiriste</foreign> ideology supported the creation of the
               monument, while most mulattoes opposed it. The few supportive mulattoes carefully
               advocated honoring Dessalines the “liberator,” not Dessalines the “despot” (86). Not
               surprisingly, French diplomats in Haiti actively campaigned against a monument in
               honor of one who had killed so many French citizens. No major monument resulted from
               this debate. Perhaps more fitting, Haiti had a gunboat named after Dessalines long
               before any memorial.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In the fall of 1883,
                  President Salomon acquired the gunboat <emph>Dessalines</emph>. Its namesake would
                  have approved that its first major expedition was to run down the ship of the
                  president’s rebelling opponent. Dessalines, however, surely would have disapproved
                  of the fact that an American commanded the boat (Heinl 270).</note> Full and
               official state-sponsored recovery of Dessalines as the liberator of the Haitian
               people waited until the 1890s with President Florvil Hyppolite (1889-96), who had a
                  <emph>French</emph>-made marble mausoleum erected, and more importantly,
               rhetorically linked himself to the revolutionary hero to strengthen his own political
               agendas (Brutus 246-65). Nord Alexis, president during the 1904 centennial, completed
               the recovery of Dessalines’s patriotic legacy by unveiling the national anthem, “La
               Dessalinienne,” and commissioning the leading Haitian sculptor of the day, Normil
               Charles, to create the Champ de Mars monument. </p>
               <p>Dessalines’s statue and rehabilitated legacy continued to prove malleable. Posed high
               on a pedestal, Johnston’s photograph (c. 1908-9) shows Dessalines stepping stiffly
               forward and holding aloft a saber in his right hand, and a scabbard in the left,
               which Johnston identified as an excessive second sword (“Haiti” 496) [fig. 1].
               Dessalines braces a painted metal national flag permanently unfurled with the
               national motto, “Liberty or Death!” and “To die rather than be under the domination
               of Power.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Dessalines, here, does not present
                  the flag that flew under his reign. While he is credited with first creating the
                  blue and red national flag, with its vertical bands from the removal of the white
                  from the French flag at a ceremony at Arcahaie on 14 May 1803, Dessalines changed
                  the blue to black soon after independence. These early flags also included Haiti’s
                  national emblem, the palm tree surmounted by a Phrygian cap, with flags and
                  cannons at its base. Alexandre Pétion, Haiti’s first mulatto leader, returned the
                  black band to blue, though switched the bands to a horizontal orientation, which
                  is what is used for this 1904 statue. Extreme <foreign>noiriste</foreign> François
                  Duvalier changed the blue back to black in 1966, with the blue returning after the
                  fall of the Duvalier regime in 1986 (Heinl 109; Nicholls, 234-5). </note> Later
               1920s photographs, taken at the height of the U.S. occupation, show the isolated
               Dessalines still dominating the great public space, but now with his painted flag
               removed. Perhaps the call to liberty at all cost did not sit comfortably
               with a foreign occupier and accommodating administration working to put down
               insurgency and dissent. Charles’s statue would soon succumb to a similar fate.
               Criticized for its “cold mask” which did not resemble the likeness more popularly
               accepted by this time as the emperor’s, the Haitian government later removed the 1904
               Dessalines to the town hall of Gonaives (Brutus, II, 261). </p>
               <p>While nearly every history outlines Dessalines’s fierce and brutal character, there
               are very few contemporary descriptions of what he physically looked like. ‘A short,
               stout Black,’ seems to be the most thorough description left and no likenesses taken
               from life have been authenticated (Heinl 126). Rather, a range of likenesses from
               nineteenth-century engravings abound, with a few becoming privileged, and one
               accepted as a correct representation by state-sponsored commissions in the twentieth
               century: the portrait of Dessalines from the series of paintings displayed in the
               national palace, <title level="s">Heros de l’independence d’Haiti</title> (1804-1806)
               (fig. 2). Several Haitian administrations promoted this particular likeness of
               Dessalines and had it copied into medallions, engravings, and even a 1949
               commemorative postage stamp by famed Haitian designer Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noël. A
               new Dessalines monument now dominates Port-au-Prince’s Champ de Mars, this one
               created by famed African-American sculptor Richmond Barthé and installed in 1953. In
               this commission, Barthé worked directly from a photograph of the national palace
                  painting.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Richmond Barthé’s personal papers
                  held at Amistad Research Center, Tulane University, New Orleans, still include the
                  photograph of the Dessalines portrait painting, and his preliminary sketches from
                  this copy. The Haitian government may have provided Barthé with a copy of the
                  painting from which to work. During this period, the national Haitian tourist
                  bureau circulated copies of this series of paintings as part of their advertising
                  brochures, with the entire series printed in a special issue on Haitian culture
                  and history: “Tricinquantenaire de l’Indépendance d’Haïti,” <title level="j">Formes et Couleurs </title>12.1 (1954).</note> All of these elite- and
               state-sanctioned images present a heroic black figure arrested in his grandeur, and
               not as a mercurial fighter and contested leader.</p>
               <p>Perceptions of Dessalines’s character proved even more malleable than his image.
               Dessalines expected and embraced the fact that the greater world would find him
               horrific and blood thirsty. The January 1, 1804 declaration of independence was
               proclaimed before a crowd at Gonaïves. It is clear, however, that Dessalines and his
               secretary, an educated officer of color named Louis Félix Boisrond-Tonnerre who
               authored and read the proclamation on Dessalines’s behalf, understood the
               proclamation’s audience to include not only the new citizens of Haiti, but also the
               greater international community. The declaration rebukes Haiti’s new black citizens
               for failing to avenge their dead by allowing some French to still remain in the
               country. The elimination of these French would serve not only as the final step in
               completing the war of emancipation, it would also ensure that no remaining foreigner
               would continue to plot “to trouble and divide us” (Dubois and Garrigus 189). More
               importantly, Dessalines/Boisrond-Tonnerre prods that a final act of massacre would
               send the most dramatic message possible to dissuade France and any other power that
               this fledgling nation could ever be reclaimed for slavery: <quote>…know that you have
                  done nothing if you do not give the nations a terrible, but just example of the
                  vengeance that must be wrought by a people proud to have recovered its liberty and
                  jealous to maintain it. Let us frighten all those who would dare try to take it
                  from us again; let us begin with the French. Let them tremble when they approach
                  our coast, if not from the memory of those cruelties they perpetrated here, then
                  from the terrible resolution that we will have made to put to death anyone born
                  French whose profane foot soils the land of liberty (Dubois and Garrigus
                     189).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Dessalines’s declaration, however,
                     quickly follows this provocation of France and greater transatlantic powers
                     with ameliorating lines for the nations within Haiti’s immediate region: “Let
                     us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us
                     allow our neighbors to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the laws
                     that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary
                     firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our glory
                     consist in troubling the peace of the neighboring islands. Unlike that which we
                     inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants;
                     they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them” (Dubois
                     and Garrigus 190).</note>
                  </quote> Importantly, in the declaration’s closing lines, Dessalines also claimed his
               own legacy: “Recall that my name horrifies all those who are slavers, and that
               tyrants and despots can only bring themselves to utter it when they curse the day I
               was born…” (Arthur and Dash 44). In April 1804, following the actual killings of the
               remaining French planters, Dessalines proclaimed: <quote>‘We have rendered to these
                  true cannibals, war for war, crime for crime, outrage for outrage. Yes, I have
                  saved my country; I have avenged America. The avowal I make in the face of earth
                  and heaven, constitutes my pride and my glory. Of what consequence to me is the
                  opinion which contemporary and future generations will pronounce upon my conduct?
                  I have performed my duty; I enjoy my own approbation: for me that is sufficient’
                  (Barskett 183). </quote> Dessalines carefully posited his acts against a history
               of the French slave system notorious for its excessive cruelties, tortures and rapes,
               and he orchestrated the executions to be a signal to the greater world of an
               unrepentant blackness that grounded the newly created Haitian identity. </p>
               <p>Amazingly, despite his extreme rhetoric and actions, Dessalines’s character lent
               itself not only to disparaging accounts, but also dramatic and even morally uplifting
               representations. Since there are few records of Dessalines’s own accounting of his
               thoughts and actions, his life has been used as a blank canvas for more romantic
               inscriptions. Indeed, given how he proclaimed his own legacy, Dessalines probably
               would have been shocked by the numerous representations that attempt to sanitize his
               legacy, especially those examples put forth by fellow blacks. Several prominent
               African-American writers have attempted to recover a revolutionary hero without the
               accrued weight of his harsher actions. In 1863, former slave William Wells Brown
               published <title level="m">The Black Man</title>, a collection of biographical
               sketches designed to refute stereotypes of black inferiority. For Brown, the
               courageous Dessalines “was a bold and turbulent spirit, whose barbarous eloquence lay
               in expressive signs rather than in words” (111). Brown, however, does not describe
               Dessalines’s “expressive signs,” stating that enough historians have noted them, but
               without rightly considering the circumstances under which he lived and led. </p>
               <p>Three decades later, African-American publisher and activist William Edgar Easton
               out-distanced Brown’s positive portrayal in his play <title level="m">Dessalines</title> (1893). In the play, Dessalines awakens from his excessive
               brutality when he rescues his mulatto enemy’s sister, Clarisse, from a voodoo witch
               and then falls in love with her. The fair Clarisse converts Dessalines to
               Christianity and the play ends without even a hint of massacres or political
               despotism. In the play’s preface, Easton openly admits to taking factual liberties in
               creating a play that would highlight the rich possibilities of uplifting racial
               drama. Yet his preface also laments the lack of African Americans writing and staging
               black history, implying the importance of historical fact. Easton believes drama to
               be the perfect medium for teaching both history and moral virtue. He prefers
               ultimately, however, to skew history and reconstitute a sanitized Dessalines in order
               to fulfill the higher purposes of serious moral drama and race pride: “Let the critic
               with a charitable hand separate its [the play’s] history from romance and give the
               author the credit, at least, of seeking, in the way he knows best, to teach the
               truth, that ‘minds are not made captive by slavery’s chains, nor were men’s souls
               made for barter and trade’” (vii). </p>
               <p>Indeed, the debut staging of Easton’s interpretation of Haiti’s history was actually
               about the visibility and control of African-American self-presentation. <title level="m">Dessalines</title>’s debut has been called the “most note worthy
               African-American event” during the 1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, even
               though it did not actually occur on the fairgrounds or with Exposition sanctioning.
               Rather, it was produced privately at the Chicago Freiberg’s Opera House as a part of
               the African-American protest against the Exposition’s exclusion of African Americans
               in its planning and the rejection of many proposals for exhibits to display the
               accomplishments of African Americans (Hill and Hatch 88-9, 138-9). Dessalines,
               therefore, needed first and foremost to represent black heroic accomplishment, and
               not the gray zone of a complex and violent historical reality. </p>
               <p>Prominent twentieth-century African-American writers continued Easton’s belief in
               racial uplift through black historical drama, with Haiti frequently providing
               exciting material and inspiring heroic figures. And like Easton before them, those
               who staged their work around Dessalines as their lead character did so by ignoring
               the more contradictory and violent aspects of his actions. For example, writer and
               linguist John Matheus wrote the libretto to the opera <title level="m">Ouanga: a
                  Haitian Opera in Three Acts</title> (c.1929; copyrighted 1938) centered on
               Dessalines’s 1804-1806 rule, but omitted his ordered killings. Rather, <title level="m">Ouanga</title> portrays the emperor’s greatest crimes as forsaking his
               true love Défilée and attempting to outlaw voodoo, with both directly causing his
               assassination. Matheus preferred to have his romantic protagonist in dramatic
               confrontation with voodoo, rather than admit the terrorizing and tyrannical aspects
               of his hero. </p>
               <p>Famed writer Langston Hughes also had an abiding fascination with Haiti, its
               revolutionary history, and the character of Dessalines. In February 1928, Hughes
               began work on an opera on the Haitian Revolution, first sketched as a “singing play”
               entitled <title level="m">Emperor of Haiti</title>. His plot traces the rise and fall
               of a fierce Jean-Jacques Dessalines, whom he envisions as a key leader of the initial
               uprising. He revised his text into a play entitled <title level="m">Drums of
                  Haiti</title>, which was first performed in 1934; he continued to revise (and
               rename) the work, premiering <title level="m">Troubled Island</title> in 1936. It was
               this later version that would be finally turned into an opera with music by William
               Grant Still, debuting in 1949 (Hughes Papers, boxes 536, 539; see also Rampersad
               165-6, 175-9). Like <title level="m">Ouanga</title>, Hughes’s play and opera
               dramatize the life and downfall of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and provide another
               example of a sanitized Dessalines as main character. <title level="m">Troubled
                  Island</title> begins on the eve of the revolutionary uprising in 1791. Act II
               then jumps forward over two decades to the end of Emperor Dessalines’s reign, thus
               omitting both the bloody fight for independence and Dessalines’s ordered massacres.
               While alluding to Dessalines’s military exploits, the heart of the later acts present
               Dessalines’s failures as a statesman, his rejection of the country’s African roots in
               voodoo, and his assassination as a betrayal by his treacherous mulatto assistants and
               consort. </p>
               <p>In one final example of Dessalines’s extreme sanitization at the hands of
               African-American writers, Helen Webb Harris composed <title level="m">Genifrede: The
                  Daughter of L’Ouverture, a Play in One Act</title> (1923) as part of a drama class
               at Howard University. In her example, Harris centers the play around the iron-will of
               Toussaint L'Ouverture, but presents Dessalines as a moderator to Toussaint’s extreme
               sense of justice, which included executing his daughter’s fiancé. All of these
               productions present the Haitian revolutionary as a figure of heroic black
               masculinity, reflecting an African-American focus on representational figures to
               instill race pride. </p>
               <p>These African-American writers portrayed Dessalines as a simplified and somewhat
               thuggish saint. Interestingly, within the Haitian folk religion of Vodou, Dessalines
               actually has become a saint. Vodou is a highly syncretic, African-derived, complex
               New World religion that has vibrantly adapted (and continues to adapt) to the needs
               and struggles of Haitians. Like Dessalines, this much maligned religion has been
               distilled in the popular imagination outside of Haiti in the form of a highly
               circumscribed stereotype. The religion is known more popularly by the moniker
               “voodoo”; histories, sensationalized travelogues, and, especially, horror films
               present “voodoo” as a demonic, brutal, and blood- and zombie-driven cult of death and
               debauchery. While many Haitians believe in a single supreme God, they also believe in
               a pantheon of intermediary spirit-saints, or <foreign>lwas</foreign>, who actually
               intercede within their lives through personal encounter. Vodou’s dominant spirit and
               warrior is Ogou. Within the Vodou pantheon, Ogou splits into multiple manifestations,
               creating a family of spirits tied to war and, since the army is never far removed
               from government in Haiti, politics and social power. Vodou’s adaptability means that
               new historical events and leaders can be incorporated into this divine army. The
               historic Jean-Jacques Dessalines, like most elite blacks and mulattos of his era,
               probably opposed and even worked to suppress Vodou (Nicholls 170). In death, however,
               Haitian adherents incorporated him into the Vodou pantheon as Ogou Desalin. Like his
               historical counterpart, Ogou Desalin is a powerful guardian and fierce conqueror. He
               is also vainglorious with a notorious sexual appetite, a penchant for blind rage, and
               an equivocal nature (Dayan 139; Largey 328). </p>
               <p>Vodou rituals involve what religious scholar Karen McCarthy Brown has termed
               “performance-possession”: the dramatic moment when a Vodou spirit possesses (or
               mounts) an adherent (<title level="m">Mama Lola </title>6). Through the possessed
               individual, the <foreign>lwa</foreign> bodily displays his personality, and interacts with
               those present at the ceremony. His physical likeness shifts, therefore, with each
               person possessed, transcending the visual representations of Dessalines codified by
               the state’s various commemorative and political projects. In Haiti’s highly visual
               and oral culture, such ritual performances become bodily manifestations where past
               histories meet present problems, helping to create meaning and solutions. </p>
               <p>All manifestations of Ogou poignantly model the constructive and destructive uses of
               power. Brown has described the ritual dance performed by those possessed by Ogou.
               First, Ogou takes a ritual sword and wields it against an invisible enemy. Before
               long, however, his aggressive swipes and jabs become directed towards people present
               at the ceremony. Finally, Ogou turns the sword upon himself. Ogou performs the paradox
               at the center of Haitian military and political history, where leaders heralded as
               heroes have time and again turned upon their own people while also instigating their
               own destruction (<title level="m">Mama Lola</title> 95-6). Dessalines proclaimed
               himself the avenger of the former slaves, yet he considered his people ungrateful and
               unruly, and used his standing army to enforce draconian labor policies. In
               establishing a national identity centered on blackness and land ownership, Dessalines
               also threatened the fairer-skinned elite, contributing to his assassination. </p>
               <p>Historian Joan Dayan has provided one of the most extensive analyses of Dessalines’s
               leap from revolutionary leader to <foreign>lwa</foreign>. Kreyol folk and ritualistic
               songs, which may be as old as the revolutionary era, focus on the liberty that
               Dessalines brings, yet through a body that is both powerful and dismembered, heroic
               and corrupt, living and dead. The songs’ Kreyol words embody multiple meanings and
               necessarily duplicitous, interpretations. Likewise, in Vodou ritual, when Ogou
               possesses an adherent and makes himself manifest to worshippers, his ritualistic
               actions and pronouncements are also duplicitous, revealing both his multiple nature
               and the contradictions inherent within power structures: ritualistic actions show
               both devotion and vengeance, efficacy and blind rage railing against insurmountable
               odds (Dayan 31). As we have seen, and much to the chagrin of nineteenth- and
               twentieth-century outside observers, many Haitians claim Dessalines as their most
               revered national hero despite his dramatic faults. Perhaps this is because Dessalines
               goes beyond his fighting for and founding of independence; now as Ogou Desalin, he
               both resists oppression and displays how power can corrupt. This is a prescient model
               for understanding the personal and political injustices found within the adherent’s
               contemporary world. </p>
               <p>Within Vodou, remembered histories possess the power to shape and interact with
               contemporary problems. The worship of Ogou Desalin performs an important
               revolutionary history and embodies contemporary relationships with power structures. Ogou
               Desalin shows that liberation is never complete, while teaching that the most
               powerful can be the most vulnerable and vice versa. Ogou Desalin also shows that
               power in general is always corruptible, and that the dispossessed must always be wary
               of whom they call hero. Rendered to pieces at his death, Dessalines’s spirit and
               legacy has only grown more powerful as representations continuously reconstitute,
               rework and repair this mercurial hero. Most popular representations circumscribe him
               to the space of either demon or saint. Vodou, however, provides a model that accepts
               and even finds necessary Dessalines’s equivocal nature. </p>

                  <p> Michel-Rolph Trouillot begins his essay, “From Planters’ Journals to Academia:
                  The Haitian Revolution as Unthinkable History,” with an anecdote. In 1790, a
                  planter in Saint Domingue writes a series of letters to his wife in France
                  reassuring her that the Revolution has not spread to the Caribbean. He writes,
                  “There is no movement among our Negroes . . . . They don’t even think of it. They
                  are very tranquil and obedient. A revolt among them is impossible” (Trouillot 81).
                  Apparently, all was quiet on the (French) Western front. There was no sign of an
                  organized slave revolt. The thought of an uprising was “impossible.” </p>
                  <p>In August of the following year, the Haitian Revolution began. The irony of this
                  story is not lost on Trouillot, who explains: <quote>The Haitian Revolution thus
                     entered history with the peculiar characteristic of being unthinkable even as
                     it happened. Publications of the times, including the long list of pamphlets on
                     Saint Domingue published in France from 1790 to 1804, reveal the incapacity of
                     most contemporaries to understand the ongoing Revolution on its own terms. They
                     could read the news only with their ready-made categories, and these categories
                     were incompatible with the idea of a slave revolution. (82) </quote> Trouillot
                  chalks up the planter’s ignorance to a larger world view shaped and shared by
                  slave owners about enslaved peoples. He argues, “When reality does not coincide
                  with deeply-held beliefs, human beings . . . phras[e] interpretations that force
                  reality within the scope of these beliefs. They devise formulas to repress the
                  unthinkable and to bring it back within the realm of accepted discourse”
                     (Trouillot 81). In short, the planters were in denial. To
                  believe that the principles of the French Revolution could be adopted by slaves in
                  Saint Domingue required that planters not only acknowledge the humanity of slaves,
                  but also admit that stereotypes and misinformation spread about their intellectual
                  abilities were untrue. Identifying with revolutionary principles and, more
                  importantly, rising in arms <foreign>en masse</foreign> in order to defend those
                  principles required both intellectual and military prowess—two things that French
                  colonists living in Saint Domingue during the French Revolution preferred to deny.
                  As one may easily guess, the idea of a mass slave revolt would have been a
                  frightening image for slave owners in Saint Domingue (where slaves outnumbered
                  the free population by ten to one) after the revolution broke out in France 1789.
                  Nevertheless, it was the image they were met with in 1791. A well-organized slave
                  revolt turned into a full-scale revolution that lasted until 1804 and led to the
                  formation of the Republic of Haiti. </p>
                  <p> Although the Haitian Revolution is the most successful slave revolt in the
                  Western hemisphere, it was preceded by many smaller uprisings, not only in Saint
                  Domingue, but also throughout the Caribbean and the Americas.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a recent comprehensive history, see Alvin O. Thompson,
                        <title level="m">Flight to Freedom: African Runaways and Maroons in the
                        Americas</title> (Kingston: U of the West Indies P, 2006).</note> Jamaica,
                  in fact, was home to the second most successful slave revolt in the Americas just
                  a few decades later, with the Christmas Rebellion of 1831. Jamaica was also home
                  to several uprisings throughout the late-seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
                  with resistance coming from both slaves and free blacks. There were at least five
                  organized slave insurrections in the central region of the island between 1673 and
                     1725.<note place="foot" resp="editors">According to Thompson, there were
                     outbreaks of violence in the following years 1673, 1678, 1685, 1690, and 1725.

                  famous slave revolt in eighteenth-century Jamaica, Tacky’s Rebellion, occurred in
                  the spring of 1760 in St. Mary Parish and took several weeks to quell. An existing
                  copy of the record book of slave trials in St. Andrew Parish (located just south
                  of St. Mary) lists 56 individual cases of “rebellious” activities prosecuted
                  between 1746 and 1782, including not only violent offences, but also the harboring
                  of runaway slaves and possession of obeah materials.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Diana Paton, “Punishment, Crime, and the Bodies of

                     tried during the period.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>English colonists in Jamaica also fought multiple wars against free blacks in the
                  eighteenth century. The First Maroon War lasted four decades and ended with two
                  treaties signed in 1739 and 1740; the Second Maroon War occurred in 1795-96. Both
                  conflicts posed serious threats to the European colonists with regard to both the
                  cost of troops and the financial burdens of war. In the four decades leading up to
                  the culmination of the First Maroon War, the Jamaican Assembly passed 44 acts and
                  spent £240,000 before signing treaties with the Maroons (Robinson 38). The
                  eight-month long conflict with the Trelawny Town Maroons in 1796 is estimated to
                  have cost between £350,000 and £500,000. “All this,” Mavis Campbell points out,
                  “to quell just over 150 arms-bearing Maroons” (244). Yet, despite their relatively
                  small numbers, the Trelawny Town Maroons were not to be underestimated. An early
                  nineteenth-century history by R. C. Dallas details the feared outcome of not
                  taking every expense necessary to end the Second Maroon War. He writes as follows:
                     <quote>[The Trelawny Town Maroons] threatened the entire destruction of the
                     island; for had this body of Maroons evinced that their rebellion was not a
                     temporary struggle, but a permanent and successful opposition to the
                     Government, it is highly probable that the example might in time have united
                     all the turbulent spirits among the slaves in a similar experiment . . . such a
                     decided triumph might have tempted numbers of the plantation negroes, unwilling
                     before to change a state of peace for warfare, to join the Maroons: at all
                     events they would have been a rallying point for every discontented slave . . .
                     . The lives of the colonists must have been spent in continual terror; massacre
                     and depredation would have spread throughout the country . . . . (2-3)</quote>
                  According to Dallas, any expense taken to remove the Maroon threat in 1796 was
                  worth it. The above passage explicitly expresses a fear of mass revolt on the part
                  of both Maroons and slaves that is much larger in scale than actually occurred in
                  Trelawny Town. </p>
                  <p> So, why was Dallas convinced that the expense was worth it? Because the threat
                  posed by the Saint Domingue Revolution was very real. News of the rebellion in
                  Saint Domingue spread quickly to Jamaica. “Within a month after the August
                  uprising in St. Domingue,” writes David Geggus, “slaves in Jamaica were singing
                  songs about it” (276). British planters on the island took note. Using a wide
                  range of primary material, including the governor’s correspondence, Geggus
                  describes the subsequent months as follows: <quote>By November, whites were
                     complaining of “insolent” behavior and that the slaves had become “so different
                     a people from what they were.” “I am convinced,” wrote one master, “that the
                     Ideas of Liberty have sunk so deep in the minds of <emph>all</emph> Negroes,
                     that whenever the greatest precautions are not taken they will rise. “Head
                     negroes” were overheard talking of killing whites and dividing up their lands.
                     “Negroes in the French country,” they said, “were men.” (Geggus 277)</quote>
                  According to the picture painted here, Jamaican planters and French planters were
                  obviously on opposite sides of the spectrum with regard to acknowledging the
                  potential threat of being vastly outnumbered by slaves. Yet, the Jamaican
                  planters’ fears were never fully realized. After 1792, rebellious activity on the
                  island decreased over the next decade when compared to the previous three decades.
                  After 1792, the initial cause for alarm greatly subsided and all but vanished from
                  existing documents.</p>
                  <p> For Geggus, the answer to the paradox as to why Jamaica remained stable during
                  the Haitian Revolution is quite simple. British military presence was key. Slave
                  resistance in the British Caribbean was low during the Age of Revolution for the
                  following reason: <quote>It was precisely during the years 1776-1815 that
                     Britain’s military presence in the region was at its peak. . . . . The British
                     colonial garrisons were boosted during the American War of Independence, and
                     they were not cut back to prewar levels in 1783. . . . . A succession of
                     international crises ensured that, when the St. Domingue slave revolt broke
                     out, there were already more soldiers in Jamaica than ever before in peacetime.
                     (Geggus 293)</quote> The worrisome tone that underscored the earlier examples
                  provided by Geggus vanished quickly because British military presence kept
                  rebellious activity at a minimum after 1792. Within months the tone had completely
                  shifted, and the island’s planters were calm.<lb/>
                     <quote>The impact of the St.
                     Domingue Revolution on Jamaica’s slaves appears to have been slight . . . . The
                     slaves did not revolt . . . . Yet the initial reaction to the 1791 uprising had
                     been one of excitement and admiration accompanied in some quarters by a desire
                     to emulate it. Quite possibly planters covered up minor incidents on their own
                     estates, and there can be no doubt that they wished to avoid giving an
                     impression of public alarm that might damage their all-important commercial
                     credit. (Geggus 288)</quote> The English had their assurances that the island
                  was tranquil. Public documents gave no indication of unrest among the slaves.</p>
                  <p>The history laid out above demonstrates that the opinions of planters in Saint
                  Domingue in 1791 lay in stark contrast to the ideas of planters in Jamaica shortly
                  thereafter. Similarly, the French colony and British colony would take very
                  different trajectories over the next decade. However, there is one trend that
                  French and British literature about black resistance in the Caribbean shared
                  during the same period. Despite the fact that all of the colonies in the Caribbean
                  had their share of revolts both small and large, many historical and literary
                  sources written by European colonists misrepresented mass revolts (even denied
                  them) by focusing on isolated incidents involving one or two individuals, as
                  opposed to well-organized, collective rebellions. Trouillot again gives us a
                  useful summary of the reports from Saint Domingue immediately preceding the
                  Haitian Revolution: <quote>Close as some were to the real world, planters and
                     managers could not fully deny resistance, but they tried to provide reassuring
                     certitude by trivializing all its manifestations. Resistance did not exist as a
                     global phenomenon. Rather, each case of unmistakable defiance, each possible
                     instance of resistance, was treated separately and drained of its political
                     content. Slave A ran away because he was particularly mistreated by his master.
                     Slave B was missing because he was not properly fed. Slave X killed herself in
                     a fatal tantrum. Slave Y poisoned her mistress because she was jealous. The
                     runaway or the rebellious slave emerges from this literature . . . as an animal
                     driven by biological constraints . . . . This is not “a man in revolt” . . .
                     but a maladjusted Negro . . . . (Trouillot 86)</quote> Although he is referring
                  to reports written by French colonists in Saint Domingue, Trouillot’s “unthinkable
                  history” of organized black resistance also applies to English representations of
                  Jamaica at the turn of the nineteenth century that appeared both in print and on
                  stage just as the French lost control of their own Caribbean colony. </p>
                  <p>The misrepresentation of collective rebellion just outlined also characterizes the
                  history of Three-Fingered Jack in English popular culture.</p>

                  <head>“The Terror of Jamaica” in England</head>
                  <p>The story of Three-Fingered Jack (the escaped slave who terrorized the British
                  colonists in Jamaica from 1780 to 1781) appeared in England in at least five major
                  versions between 1799 and 1830. These adaptations included Benjamin Moseley’s
                     <title level="m">Treatise on Sugar </title>(1799), William Earle’s novella
                     <title level="m">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack </title>(1800), a
                  pantomime by John Fawcett titled <title level="m">Obi; or, Three-Finger’d Jack
                  </title>(1800), a sixty-page pamphlet by William Burdett titled <title level="m">Life and Exploits of Mansong, Commonly Called Three-Finger’d Jack, the Terror
                     of Jamaica</title> (1800), and finally <title level="m">Obi; or ,
                     Three-Fingered Jack</title>, a melodrama by William Murray (1830). Although
                  different in their respective politics and approaches, these five
                  nineteenth-century version of the story deemphasized the collective threat posed
                  by Three-Fingered Jack’s exploits in 1780-81. </p>
                  <p> Although he was notoriously dubbed the “Terror of Jamaica,” Three-Fingered Jack
                  is loosely tied to the Haitian Revolution in contemporary scholarship. In the
                  article that introduced Three-Fingered Jack to twentieth-century readers, Alan
                  Richardson shows that the popularity of this story in the first decade of the
                  nineteenth century fits into a larger trend in English literature and popular
                  culture much like the one outlined by Trouillot. Richardson’s piece demonstrates
                  how English representations of obeah generally played up the most sensational
                  aspects of the African tradition in an attempt to cover up the more unsettling
                  reality of black uprisings in the West Indies. Voodoo priests were partly
                  responsible for several organized revolts in Saint Domingue including the 1791
                  rebellion that began the Haitian Revolution.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Richardson for a more detailed account, as well as C. L. R. James,
                        <title level="m">The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San
                        Domingo Revolution </title>(New York: Vintage, 1989).</note> Similarly,
                  obeah men were responsible for several uprisings in Jamaica throughout the
                  eighteenth century, the most famous being Tacky’s Rebellion in 1760, which led to
                  the outlawing of the practice on the island.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Srinivas Aravamudan’s introduction to his edition of William Earle’s
                        <title level="m">Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack

                  </p>
                  <p>Although there is no hard evidence proving that Three-Fingered Jack was involved
                  in obeah rituals, obeah made its way into the story of Three-Fingered Jack
                  beginning with Moseley’s 1799 account. The following year, his name became
                  synonymous with the practice with the appearance of three popular adaptations
                  including Earle’s novella, Fawcett’s pantomime, and Burdett’s account. The
                  popularity of the story of Three-Fingered Jack at the height of the Haitian
                  Revolution makes sense. Richardson explains, “In the defeat of Jack and of obi
                  with him, the ‘Terror of Jamaica’ and the ‘Horror’ of Saint Domingue could be
                  symbolically exorcised” (Richardson 19). Richardson sees the obvious subtext of
                  the Haitian Revolution written into Fawcett’s pantomime. However, unlike the
                  revolution in Saint Domingue, the story of “The Terror of Jamaica” ends with the
                  colonial government’s authority restored, partly through the containment of rogue
                  religious and rebellious practices. The addition of the obeah storyline into the
                  popular English history of Three-Fingered Jack certainly invites such
                  conclusions.</p>
                  <p>However, the defeat of obeah in the English adaptations of Three-Fingered Jack was
                  not the only way that the popular history was rewritten at the turn of the
                  nineteenth century in order to shape popular understanding of black resistance in
                  the West Indies. The English adaptations misrepresented the history of collective
                  resistance in Jamaica in two major ways. First, Three-Fingered Jack, the leader of
                  a gang of sixty rebels, became a lone rebel. Stripping Jack of his followers made
                  the story appear to be an isolated incident, as opposed to a collective effort.
                  Moseley and Murray erase Jack’s gang in their versions of the story. Earle and
                  Fawcett give Jack a few rag-tag followers, but neither acknowledges the actual
                  size and loyalty of Jack’s gang. Only Burdett makes Jack the leader of a large
                  group of slave rebels; however, his account quickly dispatches of the gang that
                  eluded government officials for more than one year.</p>
                  <p>The second way that Three-Fingered Jack’s popular history in England ignored the
                  actual history of black resistance and independence in Jamaica was by changing the
                  identity of Jack’s captor from a Maroon to a slave. All of the nineteenth-century
                  adaptations of the story of Three-Fingered Jack misrepresent the identity of
                  Jack’s killer. Whether intentional or not, this change completely distorted the
                  story of Three-Fingered Jack by ignoring the role that free blacks played in
                  restoring order to the island. Most of the adaptations contain no free black
                  characters in the story. The two major changes to the story rewrote the history of
                  Three-Fingered Jack so that it (like other stories of slave insurrections in the
                  West Indies) was depicted as an isolated incident as opposed to a link in a chain
                  of organized rebellions that occurred in the European colonies in the Caribbean in
                  general, and Jamaica in particular, during the decades leading up to the Slave
                  Trade Act of 1807, and later full emancipation through the Slavery Abolition Act
                  of 1833.</p>
                  <p>According to Diana Paton, the popularity of Three-Fingered Jack during the first
                  three decades of the nineteenth century is undeniably tied to English abolition
                  debates. The story of Three-Fingered Jack was particularly appealing for
                  nineteenth-century writers because it could be used to argue both for and against
                  slavery. Paton explains as follows: <quote>The cumulative impact of the cultural
                     figure of Three-Finger Jack was not to a produce a coherent argument regarding
                     the slave trade or slaver. Rather, representations of Jack could be adapted and
                     adopted by those on all sides of the slavery debates. Nevertheless, the easiest
                     fit was with a gradualist and ameliorationist viewpoint; potentially hostile to
                     the slave trade, but not emancipationist. Criticisms made by the prose and
                     stage versions of Three-Fingered Jack could be reconciled with the continuation
                     of slavery. (59) </quote> Paton argues that the shift in British public opinion
                  that led to full emancipation less than three decades after Three-Fingered Jack
                  became a household name in London motivated Murray to give a more sympathetic
                  portrayal of Jack in the 1830 melodrama. This may be true to some extent; however,
                  the massive overhaul made to the story by its earliest English adapters forever
                  changed the popular history of Three-Fingered Jack’s rebellion.</p>
                  <p> There is some disagreement among scholars as how best to approach the various
                  adaptations of the story given the diverse range of political sympathies expressed
                  in each. For example, Earle’s novella is fervently abolitionist in its
                  presentation of Jack’s story. The pantomime by Fawcett, on the other hand, is
                  hardly radical in tone. Instead, the Fawcett pantomime, as Robert Hoskins
                  explains, <quote>. . . is woven into the imperial age. The site of the plantation
                     is assumed ripe for commercial exploitation and political control. The moral
                     and civic imperative is to impose the unquestioned superiority of Western
                     civilization on new lands and peoples. This mind-set in itself assumes
                     juxtaposition and conflict of opposites—civilization versus savagery and a
                     tamed, pastoral nature versus an untamed wilderness. Thus Afro-Caribbean
                     society and Jack as black insubordinate by definition became that dangerous or
                     unpleasant Other. (Hoskins par. 6)</quote> Jeffrey Cox agrees that an
                  overarching conservative ideology dominates Fawcett’s pantomime; however, he sees
                  moments where “aspects of Jack's story and of his culture break free from the
                  play's ideology,” and suggests that these moments of subversion were possible in
                  performances (depending on the cast, venue, and audience), if not explicitly
                  expressed in its printed songs and scene descriptions (Cox par. 7). </p>
                  <p>James O’Rourke’s recent article on Murray’s 1830 melodrama argues that the play is
                  full of Jacobin sympathies, specifically because Jack’s character undergoes major
                  development from the 1800 pantomime. He writes, “the 1830 <title level="m">Obi</title> is . . . in fact a Jacobin play, both in its legitimation of the
                  violence of the oppressed and underclass and in the repudiation of its inherited
                  romantic plot” (O’Rourke 286).<note place="foot" resp="editors">While in
                     some ways the melodrama might be seen as a more radical version than its
                     earlier dramatic predecessor because it humanizes Jack within a similar
                     domestic framework, the production as a whole depoliticizes the history of
                     Three-Fingered Jack. Murray’s melodrama primarily sympathizes with Jack’s
                     desire to avenge his murdered wife and deemphasizes revolutionary rhetoric. For
                     example, in Act I, Scene 3, Jack expresses a desire to avenge “the wrongs of my
                     poor country,” but only after listing his wife and children and spending most
                     of his lines discussing personal motives. Murray’s melodramatic anti-hero is
                     significantly humanized through this domestic storyline when compared to the
                     earlier pantomime, but he is in no way presented as a rebel who posed an actual
                     threat to the colonial government protecting England’s strongest asset in the
                     West Indies.</note> This observation is accurate insofar as the two popular
                  dramas are concerned. Cox and Paton also agree that Three-Fingered Jack was cast
                  in a more sympathetic light on the 1830 stage when compared to the 1800 pantomime.
                  Most notably, Murray’s addition of spoken lines delivered by Ira Aldridge (the
                  first black actor to portray the Jamaican folk hero) introduced radical
                  possibilities in the performance of the melodrama that were absent from the 1800
                  pantomime. However, the 1830 melodrama hardly sounds radical when compared to
                  Earle’s abolitionist novella, which actually introduces Three-Fingered Jack as “a
                  bold Defender of the Rights of Man.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">The
                     quote is from the Advertisement to Earle’s novella.</note> (You really can’t
                  get more “Jacobin” than that.) O’Rourke’s reading is a convincing comparative
                  reading of the two plays, but is less convincing when one considers all of the
                  nineteenth-century adaptations in unison, and then compares them to the historical
                     record.<note place="foot" resp="editors">One recent work that puts forth
                     a very different interpretation of Fawcett’s pantomime is Peter P. Reed,
                     “Conquer or Die: Staging Circum-Atlantic Revolt in <title level="m">Polly</title> and <title level="m">Three-Finger’d Jack,”</title>
                        <title level="j">Theatre Journal </title>59 (2007): 241–258. Reed reads
                     Fawcett’s pantomime as a radical play, a conclusion that, I believe, is
                     sustainable only if the pantomime is read independent of the other popular
                     adaptations of the story.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> There is validity in all of the readings outlined above, especially since there
                  is no way to gauge how different readers and theatergoers may have interpreted any
                  of the adaptations produced in the nineteenth century. However, what is very clear
                  is how the nineteenth-century versions of the story simplified the events leading
                  up to Three-Fingered Jack’s demise either by erasing an entire population of free
                  blacks from the narrative or at least drastically downplaying their role in the
                  defeat of Three-Fingered Jack. My reading does not discredit existing scholarship
                  on the subject. However, my argument questions to what extent any of the
                  adaptations can be read as radical given that by erasing or downplaying the
                  involvement of Maroons and by making Three-Fingered Jack a one-man show,
                  nineteenth-century adapters failed to portray a long history of black resistance
                  in colonial Jamaica during a period of major unrest in Saint Domingue and
                  Jamaica.</p>

                  <p>According to eighteenth-century sources including Moseley, Three-Fingered Jack was
                  killed by a Maroon named Reeder, a free man. However, all of the
                  nineteenth-century adaptations of the story recast Reeder as a slave named Quashee
                  who (along with another slave named Sam) agrees to fight Three-Fingered Jack in
                  return for his freedom (and sometimes money). Moseley, Earle, and Burdett explain
                  the name change (contemporaneous news reports only use the name Reeder) by telling
                  the reader that Quashee took the name Reeder after being christened in order to
                  help him fight Jack. In the two theatrical pieces, Reeder is simply replaced by
                  Quashee, with no name change ever taking place during the course of the play
                  (although the christening still takes place in the pantomime). </p>
                  <p>There are two important things to note with regard to this change in the English
                  versions. First, there is no historical evidence to support the name change to
                  Reeder through christening. Geggus explains that by the late eighteenth century,
                  three-quarters of Maroons had British names (284). Therefore, the only explanation
                  for the addition of a Christian storyline is to depict the superiority of British
                  culture and values and propagandize British imperialism through the devaluation of
                  an African religion. (The adaptations all sensationalize obeah while discrediting
                  it as mere superstition.) The second point to note is that the five English
                  versions push the Maroons to the margins of the story of Three-Fingered Jack, or
                  erase them entirely. Erasing the Maroons from the story’s afterlife in English
                  popular culture also made it easy to depict Jamaica as a stable British colony
                  during the time of the greatest unrest in the West Indies. </p>
                  <p>By 1780, the year of Three-Fingered Jack’s activity in Jamaica, the Maroons had a
                  long history on the island. Maroon populations in Jamaica date back to the
                  sixteenth century, when the island was under Spanish control. When the British
                  gained control of the island in 1655, the Maroons refused to give up their
                  independence. They violently resisted the British colonists, and they were very
                  successful. Decades of confrontations ultimately resulted in the First Maroon War,
                  which officially lasted from 1731 until 1740. Unable to defeat the Maroons, the
                  British colonists instead entered into a series of official treaties that granted
                  the Maroons autonomy and approximately 2500 acres (concentrated in the five towns
                  of Trelawny Town, Scots Hall, Nanny Town, Accompong, and Moore Town). Independence
                  and land were “granted” in exchange for assistance in quelling slave riots and
                  capturing escaped slaves. Maroons were expected to participate in the capture of
                  Three-Fingered Jack, and eighteenth-century Jamaican newspapers and government
                  documents confirm that a Maroon named Reeder was in fact responsible for killing
                  him (Aravamudan, 11-13). </p>
                  <p> The consensus in the eighteenth-century primary sources of information makes the
                  change from Maroon to slave all the more pronounced in the nineteenth-century
                  adaptations. The source of the confusion seems to be Moseley’s 1799 treatise,
                  where the story of Three-Fingered Jack is included in an appendix as a subsection
                  of an essay on obeah. The reader gets a significantly changed version of the story
                  in Moseley’s text, which begins “I saw the Obi of the famous negro robber,
                     <emph>Three fingered</emph> Jack, the terror of Jamaica in 1780 and 1781. The
                  Maroons who slew him brought it to me” (rpt. in Aravamudan, 164). He refers to the
                  man as Quashee, not Reeder as named in the reports. Why the name change? Moseley
                  offers a simple explanation. “Quashee, before he set out on the expedition, got
                  himself christianed, and changed his name to James Reeder” (rpt. in Aravamudan
                  166). Moseley’s account marks the first mention of religious conversion in the
                  story of Three-Fingered Jack. There is no mention in any contemporary newspapers
                  or other documentation. The absence of this information in any previous source
                  does not necessarily mean that Moseley’s explanation is false; however, there is
                  no primary source material to confirm Moseley’s claim. </p>
                  <p>Although Moseley never explicitly calls Quashee a slave (in fact, he calls him a
                  Maroon), his description of Quashee is vague and likely the source of confusion
                  among most of the later adapters. Moseley tells his readers that Jack was finally
                  apprehended after the colonial government offered a substantial reward for his
                  capture, as well as the promise of freedom to any slave who managed to dispatch of
                  the menace. These rewards were in fact offered, but only the bounty was claimed
                  since Jack was killed by a Maroon. This fact is erased in all of the adaptations
                  that follow. From 1800 on, Quashee was always a slave. In the adaptations that
                  follow Moseley, Quashee’s characterization ranges from an industrious slave
                  primarily motivated by the colonial government’s financial reward and promise of
                  freedom, to a loyal slave who earns his freedom after risking his life to defend
                  his benevolent (and grateful) master. </p>
                  <p>Earle’s 1800 novella (without a doubt the most explicitly abolitionist adaptation
                  of the story) also casts Quashee as a slave; however, Earle’s narrator focuses
                  more on the bounty offered by the colonial government, rather than the promise of
                  freedom. Disgusted by the financial reward offered for Jack’s capture, Earle’s
                  narrator offers the following take on Three-Fingered Jack’s demise: “Thus died as
                  great a man as ever graced the annals of history, basely murdered by the hirelings
                  of Government” (Earle 157). Earle’s description is the most accurate of the
                  nineteenth-century English adaptations because money did in fact play a major role
                  in Three-Fingered Jack’s capture; Reeder collected a reward of at least £300.
                  However, Earle’s Quashee is described as a slave working on behalf of the same
                  government that enslaves him. This historical inaccuracy—in the most radical
                  adaptation of the five versions produced in England, no less—not only
                  misrepresents Reeder’s identity, but does so at the expense of recognizing the
                  Maroons, the most significant example of free blacks living in Jamaica at the
                  time.</p>
                  <p>Because of Earle’s abolitionist sympathies, Quashee’s actions are ultimately
                  un-heroic in the novella; however, Earle’s characterization is a far cry from the
                  other nineteenth-century versions of the story by Fawcett, Burdett, and Murray.
                  Burdett’s version (also published in 1800) makes Quashee a hero, a well-deserving
                  recipient of his dual reward. Despite its claims to historical accuracy, Burdett’s
                  account presents Quashee as a slave fighting primarily for his freedom—the money
                  is just an added bonus. The final lines of his pamphlet are “Reeder and Sam,
                  gifted with freedom and the rewards, annually celebrate the fall of the once
                  terror of the whole island of Jamaica” (Burdett 56). The order of words “freedom
                  and rewards” is significant. Fawcett, Burdett, and Murray all focus on the reward
                  of freedom; in fact, the two stage adaptations mention <emph>only</emph> this
                  reward. By 1800, this became the standard storyline for Quashee. In other words,
                  Earle’s characterization of Quashee as a government mercenary faded as soon as it
                  was introduced because it was overshadowed by less radical adaptations with a
                  wider popular reach.</p>
                  <p>Unlike the textual accounts, which give Quashee/Reeder more agency in his decision
                  to pursue Three-Fingered Jack, the theatrical adaptations characterize him as a
                  loyal slave whose duty to his master is rivaled only by his dedication to his own
                  family. Fawcett’s pantomime presents Quashee and Sam as loyal fathers fighting for
                  freedom. Their duty to their wives and children is presented alongside
                  subservience to the owner of the plantation. This sentimental characterization
                  would certainly raise the eyebrows of today’s readers, but was a typical
                  characterization of slaves in literary and theatrical productions that argued for
                  abolition of the slave trade, if not for full emancipation.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on this popular, sentimental representation of
                     slaves see George Boulukos, <title level="m">The Grateful Slave: The Emergence
                        of Race in Eighteenth-Century British and American Culture
                     </title>(Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008).</note> This characterization is taken
                  to a greater extreme in the 1830 melodrama where Quashee’s motivation for fighting
                  Jack is presented as a humble slave’s loyalty to a benevolent owner, which is made
                  explicit at the end of the melodrama’s first act: <quote>QUASHEE. (<emph>with
                        great feeling</emph>) Massa! you have been kind massa to me; and Missee Rosa
                     been kind missee to wife and pickaninny here, and I now show you black man's
                     heart beat warm as white. I will go; and if I meet this Jack, Quashee will kill
                     him, or him kill Quashee, only if poor nigger die, you take care of wife and
                     little Massa Quashee. (Act I, Scene vii)</quote> Quashee puts his life on the
                  line in order to defend his master’s family. All that he asks in return is that
                  his “Massa” will look over his wife and child should he be killed in the conflict.
                  Quashee’s loyalty is rewarded with freedom at the close of the melodrama, giving
                  this final popular adaptation of the legend of Three-Fingered Jack an exaggerated
                  sentimental tone that completely contradicts the historical record as far as
                  scholars have been able to piece it together.</p>
                  <p> The stories presented in both the 1800 pantomime and the 1830 melodrama are
                  ridiculous when compared to the reality of Three-Fingered Jack’s defeat at the
                  hands of a Maroon. Although the Maroons in Jamaica were required to work with the
                  colonial government as a condition of their autonomy, this group was in not
                  subservient to government officials or planters in the way that is suggested by
                  the nineteenth-century adaptations of the story. As mentioned earlier, fifteen
                  years after Three-Fingered Jack was killed in Jamaica and five years before he was
                  resurrected through adaptations in England, the Trelawny Town Maroons were
                  involved in a violent eight-month-long insurrection against the colonial
                  government. In 1796, the government, once again unable to control the Maroons,
                  shipped the Trelawny Town Maroons to Nova Scotia. Most of the Maroons involved in
                  this transportation eventually resettled in Sierra Leone in 1800, the same year
                  that a Maroon named Reeder was transformed into a slave named Quashee for the
                  entertainment of English audiences.</p>
                  <p>The historical inaccuracies in presentations of the Quashee/Reeder character may
                  be attributed to innocent errors on the part of Earle, Fawcett, and Murray who, as
                  far as we know, did not spend time in Jamaica prior to authoring their
                  adaptations. However, the versions written by Moseley and Burdett are a different
                  case. For example, Moseley’s explanation that Quashee and Sam were “allured by the
                  rewards offered by Governor Dalling . . . and by a resolution which followed it,
                  of the House of Assembly,” implies that the promise of freedom played a part in
                  motivating these men to confront Three-Fingered Jack. This statement contradicts
                  Moseley’s earlier claim that he once met the Maroon who defeated Jack, as well as
                  his explanation that both Quashee and Sam were both of Scots Hall, Maroon Town.
                  Moseley, who spent time in Jamaica prior to publishing his 1799 treatise, would
                  know the difference between a Maroon and a slave. His vague version of the story
                  comes across as rather disingenuous given his otherwise meticulous descriptions of
                  the cultural practices, geography, and economy of Jamaica.</p>
                  <p>The same error also seriously undermines the credibility of Burdett’s account.
                  Like Moseley, Burdett explains that Quashee and Sam are from Scots Hall, Maroon
                  Town. Nevertheless, he describes Quashee as “the Slave who, some time before, in a
                  battle, had cut off Jack’s two fingers,” and that Quashee was once an “intimate of
                  Jack’s in his days of slavery” (Burdett 46, 35). These claims are blatantly false.
                  Similar discrepancies can be found in his characterization of Mr. Chapman, who
                  Burdett describes as “an eminent Planter in <emph>Maroon’s Town</emph>,” despite
                  the fact that there were no white planters in any area belonging to the Maroons
                  (Burdett 37). Chapman’s character is likely based on white superintendents,
                  appointed by the Governor, who lived in Maroon settlements according to the terms
                  of the treaties signed between Maroons and the colonial government. Carey Robinson
                  describes the duties of superintendents as chiefly maintaining friendly relations
                  between the government and the Maroons. Superintendents also resolved disputes
                  among Maroons, held court alongside four other Maroons, and reported to the
                  Governor every three months regarding the population, crime, and the condition of
                  the roads of the town where they resided (Robinson, 64-65). Although
                  superintendents were granted significant authority in the officially-sanctioned
                  Maroon communities, they were not slaveholders. There is no basis for Burdett’s
                  Chapman, at least not the way that he is presented to readers. It is hard to
                  believe that a “many years overseer of a Jamaican plantation,” as Burdett claims
                  to be, would make such a critical error, especially in 1800, less than five years
                  after the Second Maroon War, which was widely reported in English
                     publications.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A Royal Proclamation

                  </p>
                  <p>The factual errors in Burdett’s version are particularly disturbing because the
                  author presents his account as a history written to provide contextual information
                  for Fawcett’s popular pantomime. From the onset, the publication is put forth as
                  an educational tool meant to be read as a history. Burdett’s version of the story
                  is billed as a “Narrative of Facts” on which “the Public may depend” (iv).
                  However, as anyone acquainted with the history of Three-Fingered Jack would note,
                  Burdett’s history is largely a fiction, and Paton even describes it as a
                     novel.<note resp="editors" place="foot">“History” is a loaded term.
                     While it is possible that Burdett was using the term loosely, he also plays up
                     his historical sources and includes references to many actual events as if he
                     is partly depending on his account to be taken as truth. First, the publication
                     is presented as a history, and although many novels (Earle’s included) made
                     similar claims about their narratives’ authenticity, the publication’s lengthy
                     title and its overall presentation suggest that the text is a history, not a
                     fiction. Second, Burdett repeatedly stops the action to cite sources and
                     provide other first-hand accounts that will corroborate his “history.” Finally,
                     several publications published throughout the nineteenth century cited
                     Burdett’s account as a history. For a list of works derived from Burdett’s
                     version see Diana Paton’s “Histories of Three-Fingered Jack: A Bibliography,
                     William Burdett, <title level="m">Life and Exploits of Mansong</title>, and
                     pamphlet accounts deriving from Burdett,” an electronic bibliography available
                     online at www.brycchancarey.com/slavery/tfj/burdett.htm.</note> Burdett draws
                  explicitly upon Bryan Edwards’s <title level="m">History of the West
                     Indies</title> and Moseley’s works; however, these sources are used to paint a
                  detailed picture of obeah as a practice, not Three-Fingered Jack the person. </p>
                  <p>The historical inaccuracies in the portions of the text that deal specifically
                  with Three-Fingered Jack are apparent from the onset. The first ten pages of
                  Burdett’s history cover Jack’s life in Africa among warring tribes, his capture by
                  his enemies, his sale to a slave merchant headed for Jamaica. This is a
                  fascinating story; however, to date there is no proof that Three-Fingered Jack was
                  born in Africa. The liberty that Burdett takes with the tale of Jack’s origins is
                  similar to Earle’s novella. However, Earle’s novella is clearly a work of fiction,
                  whereas Burdett’s version of the story floats back and forth between fact and
                  fiction.</p>
                  <p>For example, about a third of the way through Burdett’s adaptation of the story,
                  he includes a lengthy digression about obeah and the role that it played in the
                  “formidable insurrection” that occurred in St. Mary Parish in 1760. Here Burdett
                  is drawing on actual events. The insurrection is Tacky’s Rebellion, and Burdett is
                  correct in explaining that the insurrection led to the outlawing of obeah. The
                  historical digression lends Burdett’s account historical credibility. When Burdett
                  returns to Three-Fingered Jack, the author brings up another actual uprising—the
                  attack on Crawford Town on February 10, 1780, which burned the community to the
                  ground. Burdett claims that Three-Fingered Jack was the leader of this organized
                  attack. However, as L. Alan Eyre has explained, “The burning of Crawford Town
                  certainly did take place, but there is no other evidence [aside from
                  nineteenth-century accounts] that Jack took part in it” (12). </p>
                  <p>The conflation of these two separate events—the burning of Crawford Town and
                  Three-Fingered Jack’s year-long run—is significant. Making Jack responsible for
                  the attack on Crawford Town is one way that Burdett’s self-described history by a
                  former planter resembles the planter’s journals from Saint Domingue discussed
                  earlier. In this example we see two independent, organized rebellions portrayed as
                  a single event. The result is the appearance that these were orchestrated by a
                  single man and, therefore, not widespread. The two incidents did in fact around
                  the same time and in the same general vicinity; however, conflating the burning of
                  Crawford Town with Three-Fingered Jack’s activities ignores the range of
                  rebellious activity from the island’s dispersed and diverse black populations.</p>
                  <p>Despite acknowledging that Crawford Town was completely destroyed by this
                  uprising, the author wraps up the anecdote with a decisive victory for the
                  colonial government. According to Burdett: <quote>The Governor sent five hundred
                     choice Maroons in pursuit of those rebels. They met—they fought; the negroes,
                     as before, rushed upon their guns, but the Maroons firing as they retreated,
                     kept them at bay, and made a great slaughter. –Jack encouraged his men, but
                     could not rouze them to the combat, and they fled in every direction. The next
                     day, the Governor published a pardon to such of the insurgents as would return
                     to their duty; this had the desired effect; for they all returned, except Jack,
                     who was still determined to harass the European settlers. (Burdett 33)</quote>
                  This account is yet another example of the gross discrepancies found in Burdett’s
                  version. Contemporaneous news reports date the disbanding of Jack’s gang in
                  December 1780, ten months after Crawford Town was set ablaze. While it may be true
                  that Governor Dalling issued a pardon for slaves involved in that incident, he did
                  no such thing for Jack’s band of rebels. In fact, by the end of 1780, a reward of
                  £5 was issued for the capture of any of Three-Fingered Jack’s accomplices.
                  Admittedly, this bounty was nowhere near the £300 reward offered for their
                  captain, but the situation was not resolved as easily as Burdett claims in his
                  version of the story.</p>
                  <p> Burdett’s account of the Crawford Town incident is also interesting because it is
                  the only appearance of Maroons in the text. Burdett uses the word “Maroon” exactly
                  four times in his account, but this is the only time that he uses the word to
                  describe a group of residents on the island.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The second use in this edition is a quote from Moseley referring to the
                     “Maroon who killed” Three-Fingered Jack. Burdett insists that Quashee is a
                     slave despite quoting Moseley to the contrary. The other two references are
                     geographic, referring to Scots Hall, Maroon Town.</note> The term is never
                  defined. The Maroons’ cameo is misleading to say the least. They are depicted as
                  foot soldiers in the service of the colonial government when, in truth, their
                  relationship to the plantocracy (as well as with slaves) was much more complicated
                  than Burdett would have his readers assume.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example, Paton explains that slaves were often angry with the
                     Maroons for working with the plantocracy to keep them enslaved. However,
                     several sources report that many Maroon settlements often welcomed escaped
                     slaves, completely disregarding their official orders to turn in any slave
                     found. The treaty that ended the Second Maroon War required the Trelawny Town
                     maroons to surrender all runaway slaves that had joined their numbers.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What could have led Burdett to make such an obvious mistake? Paton offers a few
                  suggestions. She explains that “the British understanding of the place of black
                  people in the Caribbean located them firmly as slaves,” and the adaptations
                  produced in England did nothing to challenge those assumptions, presumably because
                  it was deemed unnecessary (or undesirable). “Maroons, as autonomous black
                  characters, even if tied to the plantocratic state through treaties, would have
                  disrupted such a vision” (Paton 52). This argument holds up for all of the English
                  adaptations. Although Paton defends Earle and Burdett for at least acknowledging
                  the presence of the Maroons, the passage cited above clearly shows that Burdett’s
                  account only brings in the Maroon soldiers to move the action along. He never
                  gives a definition, nor explains to his readers that Maroons were free blacks
                  living in independent areas gained through treaties with the colonial government.
                  There is no mention that their military skill was perhaps stronger than the
                  British soldiers on the island, and that the treaties signed were the only way
                  that the colonists could “control” the island. Granted, most English newspapers
                  also omitted these facts, and other sources also misrepresented Maroons (Moseley,
                  for example). However, his inclusion of the Maroons is ultimately so misleading
                  that he may as well have omitted them entirely from the story as the stage
                  adapters did. </p>
                  <p>I agree with Paton’s explanation of the misrepresentation or omission of the
                  Maroons in the English adaptations because they challenged conventional categories
                  that many would have been interested in upholding. However, Paton is less
                  convincing in her final explanation for Quashee’s change from Maroon to slave in
                  the nineteenth-century adaptations. “Forgetting the maroon status of Jack’s
                  killers also made sense because the tension it raises was less relevant to British
                  audiences than to Jamaican” (Paton 52). Her reasoning is that Jamaican audiences
                  would have understood the strained relationship between Maroons, slaves, and the
                  colonial government directly caused by the conditions laid out in the treaties
                  signed between the free blacks and the white colonists. These nuances are lost in
                  the English adaptations. <quote>In becoming a British story told about Jamaica,
                     rather than a Jamaican story, Three-Fingered Jack lost sight of the complex
                     relationships and strategic difficulties among different segments of those
                     struggling and negotiating with plantocractic power, substituting a more
                     straightforward vision of social relations in which there were only two sides
                     to choose from: with Jack, or with the social order of slavery and the
                     plantation. (Paton 53) </quote> The English adaptations certainly simplify the
                  story into a black-and-white narrative with no shades of gray; however, the
                  consistent erasure of the Maroons from the English adaptations suggest that there
                  was more to the revisions made to the story than merely a question of its
                  “relevance” to British audiences. The Maroons were certainly relevant to both
                  Jamaicans and Britons, especially only four years after the Second Maroon War.
                  Perhaps it is more accurate to say that affording the Maroons their proper place
                  in the popular history of Three-Fingered Jack would have required Britons to face
                  the reality of black resistance in Jamaica, just as the greatest slave revolution
                  in history was taking place on a neighboring island, and only a few short years
                  after the Maroons were able to sustain an eight-month long conflict against
                  British authorities. </p>
                  <p>If Burdett actually spent time in Jamaica as the overseer of a plantation as he
                  claims, then his failure to provide an accurate representation of the Maroons and
                  their continued resistance against the plantocracy is similar to the “objective”
                  accounts of life in the West Indies by French planters outlined by Trouillot at
                  the beginning of this article. If Burdett only claimed to be an authoritative
                  source that his readers could rely on for accurate information, then his version
                  of the history of Three-Fingered Jack was a fiction that followed the same
                  strategies used by actual planters in order to promote a particular agenda. In the
                  case of Burdett’s adaptation of the story, the politics of the piece are clearly
                  laid out in his description of Mr. Chapman, the supposed eminent planter from
                  Maroon Town: <quote>Mr. Chapman was a good man, and very generally beloved; his
                     slaves appeared all happy; and his plantation was esteemed the most thriving in
                     the island. This may very readily be imputed to the willingness with which the
                     negroes laboured for so good a master; and we can assert, from experience, that
                     if every planter in Jamaica were to follow his humane example, it would not
                     only tend to increase their own private wealth, but the good of the country at
                     large; and it is indisputably as easy for a master to gain the love of his
                     slaves as their hatred. (42)</quote> Whether or not Burdett actually spent time
                  as a planter in Jamaica is uncertain; however, his sympathies obviously lie with
                  the “benevolent planter” characterization widely circulated during the decades
                  leading up to abolition.</p>
                  <p>Obviously, the story of Three-Fingered Jack was well known and could not be
                  denied. The story had also proved to be quite popular and profitable in England,
                  and Burdett even includes a scene-by-scene description of Fawcett’s pantomime as
                  an appendix to his own publication in order to capitalize on its success.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A description of Fawcett’s pantomime was
                     included in at least the first five editions of Burdett’s text.</note> However,
                  although it did not make any sense to deny the story of Three-Fingered Jack from a
                  financial perspective, it also did not make much sense to give an accurate history
                  of the rebel slave and his death at the hands of Maroons. To accurately depict the
                  Maroons in the English adaptations of the story of Three-Fingered Jack would have
                  been to admit that the colonial government did not have complete control over
                  black populations in Jamaica. Pushing the Maroons to the margins of this
                  historical event effectively erased a history of black resistance in Jamaica from
                  this popular story at precisely the time that the most successful slave revolution
                  in the Western Hemisphere was at its peak.</p>
                  <p>The Haitian Revolution that produced “unthinkable” moments in prose coincided with
                  both the Second Maroon War in Jamaica and the appearance of four of the five
                  English adaptations of the story of Three-Fingered Jack. The fact that the
                  adaptations by Moseley, Earle, Fawcett, and Burdett significantly downplay the
                  real possibility of revolution and resistance from Jamaica’s black populations
                  demonstrates that Trouillot’s analysis of documents produced about the revolution
                  in Saint Domingue may be easily applied to English representations of Jamaica.
                  However, the extent to which they reveal British anxieties about the spread of
                  revolution to their own colonies is unclear, mostly because of the military’s
                  strong presence in the region. The end of Fawcett’s 1800 pantomime—where all
                  characters including the chorus of slaves sing “God Save the King”—certainly
                  presented English audiences with a confident image of the island’s stability.</p>
                  <p>All of the nineteenth-century adaptations of the story of Three-Fingered Jack fail
                  to acknowledge the possibility of a massive slave rebellion inherent in both the
                  historical event they were adapting and the more immediate examples of resistance
                  and revolution taking place in the West Indies at the turn of the nineteenth
                  century. The adaptations of the story of Three-Fingered Jack are especially useful
                  in showing how nineteenth-century English accounts changed the politics behind the
                  events that transpired in Jamaica in the late eighteenth century. Collectively,
                  the adaptations demonstrate how an instance of collective rebellion could be
                  sensationalized to the point of being rendered politically insignificant. As such,
                  the popular history of Three-Fingered Jack should be read as part of a broader
                  history of misrepresenting black resistance and independence in the Caribbean. The
                  nineteenth-century adaptations of the story show that even though the history of
                  black resistance and independence was not wholly “unthinkable,” it was
                  nevertheless an unfolding history that these writers preferred not to think about.
                  More importantly, ignoring the possible tensions in Jamaica was a luxury only
                  afforded by a strong British military presence on the island. The end result was
                  that the story of Three-Fingered Jack, just like many stories of the West Indies,
                  allowed English audiences to imagine Jamaica as a colony in close proximity to
                  Saint Domingue, but closed from its revolutionary influence.</p>

               <p>The World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840 featured a “who’s who” of
               abolitionists who rose to prominence during the Romantic period. Joseph Sturge
               envisioned “a Society for the abolition of slavery throughout the world”
               (Richard 204), and was the prime mover behind the formation of The British and
               Foreign Anti-Slavery Society and the convention. Such notables as Lady Byron, Amelia
               Opie, and Benjamin Robert Haydon, John Keats’ longtime friend, witnessed Thomas
               Clarkson give the opening oration and prayer. Reflecting on the <ref target="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=sp&amp;sText=Anti-Slavery+Society&amp;rNo=0">commemorative portrait</ref> he painted afterwards, Haydon wrote “I have
               seen the most afflicted tragedies, imitative and real; but never did I witness in
               life or in the drama, so deep, so touching, a pathetic an effect produced on any
               great assembly as by the few unaffected, unsophisticated words of this aged and
               agitated person” (qtd. in Richard 218). For as much as the Convention was
               ostensibly launching a new chapter for British abolitionists, they were also
               witnessing the end of an era, symbolized in Clarkson’s “aged and agitated
               person.” As David Turley shows, Clarkson was as much of symbol of continuity as
               a representative of the “growing divergences” within the anti-slavery
               movement after the goal of the abolition of slavery in the West Indies had been
               achieved. Clarkson “seemed too attached to reputation … embarrassed or
               irritated Wilberforce, Stephen, and Macaulay, who all also doubted his judgment on
               some issues” (Turley 93).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Turley
                  adds: “However, these occasional tensions had been kept private until Robert
                  and Samuel Wilberforce chose to make some of them public in the life of their
                  father they published in 1838. In the view of private and public critics of the
                  Wilberforce sons there was more than filopietism at issue in their charge that
                  Clarkson claimed leadership in the cause when their father was entitled to it;
                  they suggested that Clarkson had been to all intents and purposes an agent of the
                  Abolition Committee. Sara Coleridge saw the Wilberforce sons claiming antislavery
                  for their brand of Clapham evangelicnism against Clarkson’s historical
                  interpretation which had literally offered a diagram of numerous branches
                  contributing to the cause.” See David Turley, <title level="m">The Culture
                     of English Antislavery, 1780-1860,</title> (London: Routledge, 1991).</note>
               Against these internecine struggles, the Convention became a rallying point and a
               potent reaffirmation of the abolitionist mission. In reciting the milestones of the
               abolitionist movement, the Secretary of the Committee reminded fellow abolitionists
               that “notwithstanding their joy and thanksgiving for the events they had been
               permitted to witness” in the “freedom of every descendant of Africa in
               the British Colonies,” they “could not forget that in the nations of the
               American Continent and its adjacent islands, upwards of five millions were still
               groaning under the oppression, and subject to the cruelty of slavery” (<title level="a">Proceedings</title> 6).</p>
               <p>One of the speakers at the convention was Richard Robert Madden, an Irish physician
               and civil servant with literary ambitions, who delivered a thirty-page report on the
               status of Cuban slavery. He is best known perhaps for his 7 volume <title level="m">History of the United Irishmen</title> (1843-6) (Rodgers 119), and he has enjoyed
               a recent resurgence thanks to the work of Gera Burton, Lorna Willliams, William Luis,
               and Sylvia Molloy. Romanticists may know him through Alan Richardson and Debbie
               Lee’s <title level="m">Early Black British Writing</title>, which includes two
               of Madden’s translations of the Afro-Cuban poet Juan Manzano.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Richardson and Lee include the poems <title level="a">Thirty Years</title> and <title level="a">The Dream: Addressed to My Younger

               embarked for Jamaica as a Special Magistrate in 1833, and two years later published
                  <title level="m">A Twelvemonth’s Residence in the West Indies, During the
                  Transition from Slavery to Apprenticeship </title>(1835). He afterwards was
               appointed Superintendent of Africans in Havana between 1836 and 1839, where he moved
               through the top circles of Cuban society, including the <foreign xml:lang="es">tertulias</foreign> of “liberal” planter Domingo del Monte, where he
               most likely met Manzano.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Domingo del Monte
                  (1804-1853) was the leading literary critic of his time, counting among his circle

                  (1824) and friend of William Cullen Bryant. Del Monte founded and edited the

                  States and Europe.</note> The Afro-Cuban poet frequented Del Monte’s

               a valet.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Manzano was still a slave during
                  this period, but he was able to contract his labor with the Marquesa’s
                  permission.</note> Manzano had been among the Marquesa’s favorite pages, a
               post for which his early education had prepared him—he was nicknamed
               “pico de oro” [golden tongue] and the plantation children, black or
               white, would gather to hear his stories (<title level="m">Obras</title> 10, 12).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Literally “golden
                  beak.”</note> But the Marquesa’s preference came at a price.
               Manzano’s account reveals she shared the planters’ paranoia about a
               slave’s thievery and lying, and the punishments to which she submitted Manzano
               on the mere suspicion of either cause the narrative to halt into silence; he closes
               the narration of incidents where he or his family suffer extreme physical pain and
               trauma saying “<foreign xml:lang="es">Pero pasemos en silencio el resto de esta

               <p>This essay examines the translation of Manzano’s <title level="m">Poems by a
                  Slave in the Island of Cuba, Recently Liberated: Translated from the Spanish by
                  R.R. Madden, with the History of the Early Life of the Negro Poet Written by
                  Himself</title> (1840) within the moment that traditionally has been read as a
               transition between slave labor and free market capitalism. The complicity of Cuban
               planters with Madden, an avowed abolitionist, to disseminate a translation of
               Manzano’s life invites us to think further about the circumstances of
               production of a text that has received ample critical attention. Madden generates the
               translation as part of the cultural capital that the British abolitionist movement
               needed to ensure a future beyond 1840 given the realignment of geopolitical and
               economic power in the Atlantic during the 1830s, one that included British support

               corresponded with a “new international division of labor [that] provided
               important industrial raw materials and foodstuffs for industrializing core
               powers” (Tomich 69). Notwithstanding Clarkson’s insistence that free
               labor in a free market would reward those who employed it, in this new order British
               consumption did not suddenly switch from plantocratic monopolies to the free market.<note place="foot" resp="editors">One of the priorities of British
                  abolitionists at this time, as Thomas Clarkson reminded the Anti-Slavery
                  Convention delegates, was to demonstrate that abolition was an economically sound
                  proposition, and that a free market would reward “free men” and those
                  who had liberated them. Clarkson stated “Now that this [worldwide abolition]
                  is <emph>possible</emph>, that <emph>this may be done</emph>, there is no
                  question. The East India Company alone can do it of themselves, and they can do it
                  by means that are <emph>perfectly moral and pacific, according to your own
                     principles</emph>, namely, by the <emph>cultivation of the earth</emph> and by
                  the employment of <emph>free labour</emph>. They may, if they please, not only
                  have the high honour of abolishing Slavery and the Slave Trade, but the advantage
                  of increasing their revenue beyond all calculation; for, in the first place, they
                  have land in their possession twenty times more than equal <emph>to the supply of
                     all Europe with tropical produce</emph>; in the second place, they can procure,
                  not tens of thousands, but tens of millions of free labourers to work; in the
                  third place, <emph>what is of the greatest consequence in this case</emph>, the
                  price of labour with these is only from a penny to three-halfpence per day. What
                  slavery can stand against these prices?” [Emphasis Clarkson]. See Thomas
                  Clarkson, <title level="m">The Opening of the General Anti-Slavery
                     Convention</title> (London: 1840) 2. “The tens of millions of free
                  labourers to work” and “the advantage of increasing revenue beyond all
                  calculation” drive the logic of Clarkson’s argument for humanitarian
                  capitalism. Measured against the systematized violence of slave production, nearly
                  next-to-nothing wages “only from a penny to three-halfpence a day”
                  appear as just compensation for “free” labor. </note> Rather, Britons
               continued to consume the products of slaves from Cuba, Brazil, and the United States
               even as they sought national rehabilitation from their own participation in the slave
               trade.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Catherine Hall, <title level="m">Civilizing Subjects: Metropole and Colony in the English Imagination,
                     1830-1867</title> (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2002) 338-379.</note> The free
               market actually integrated both slave and free labor into the circulation of capital
               through the mechanism of credit, which can also be read as “the scene of
               exchange between the linguistic and the economic” (Derrida, <title level="a">White Mythology,</title> 216). Within translation’s economy of linguistic
               indebtedness, Madden’s text functions paradoxically as a sign of appropriated
               cultural labor, and performs an ideological accommodation of slavery within the free
               market / free labor system. He “imports” the “raw material”
               of Manzano’s life and reflects the double bind of an abolitionism intimately
               bound up with free market beneficence. </p>
               <p>In <title level="m">The Ear of the Other</title>, Derrida suggests that
               “Translation can do everything except mark this linguistic difference inscribed
               in the language, this difference of language systems inscribed in a single
               tongue” (100). In the case of Madden and Manzano, the fraught relationship
               between a translator and his source —the impossibility of complete fidelity to
               the original— acquires added levels of complexity given the asymmetry of power
               between translator and author. Madden’s position as representative of the
               British government placed him in a quasi-diplomatic role, and his authority to
               mediate between his own government, planters like Del Monte, and slaves who were sold
               in violation of the 1835 treaty between England and Spain inflects his translation
               with ventriloquizing and distancing voices.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The treaty “declared (Articles 1 and 2) the Spanish slave traffic abolished
                  in all parts of the world, and promised that as soon as the treaty was ratified,
                  Spain would adopt within two months the most efficacious measures against
                  participation of her subjects in the slave trade. Article Three declared severe
                  punishments for shipowners, captains, and crew members involved.” See Arthur
                  Corwin, <title level="m">Spain and the Abolition of Slavery in Cuba,
                     1817-1886</title> (Austin: U of Texas P, 1967), 60-1.</note> Brian Mossop
               defines the ventriloquizing voice as one that is written for “the party to whom
               the translator is reporting” and the distancing one as “the manner of
               writing of the party who has already written a text in the source language”
               (19); in Madden’s case, this would be an abolitionist’s voice. His choice
               of tailoring the translation to the expectations of British readers or highlighting
               the provenance of the text and his own role as translator has generated a range of
               critical responses to Madden’s agency. Sylvia Molloy has read a kind of
               betrayal in Madden’s omission of Manzano’s name from the English
               translation, the changes Madden makes to the chronology of events, and the removal of
               individuating biographical details, such as Manzano’s constant hunger.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Lorna Williams adds “The altered status
                  of Manzano’s experience is clearly not due entirely to the process of
                  translation, which can only be an approximation to the original, for Madden also
                  exercises editorial judgment by suppressing family names, place names, and dates,
                  thereby producing a less socially grounded text than Manzano seemingly
                  intends.” See <title level="m">The Representation of Slavery in Cuban
                     Fiction</title> (Columbia: U of Missouri P, 1994) 32.</note>
               “[Madden’s] translation was presented not as the life story of one
               individual but as the generic account of ‘the Cuban slave’ […] The claim
               for representativeness that led Madden to the excision of the particular […] tell us
               as much about Madden and his practice of reading as it does about the generic Cuban
               slave” (Molloy 405-6). More recently, Gera Burton counters Molloy by suggesting
               that there was a friendship between the two men, and that Madden’s abolitionist
               credentials, amply documented, place him above the suspicion of
               “unauthorizing” Manzano’s text, and filtering the narrative for a
               British audience through colonialist lenses.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> 
                  It is also a view shared by Fionnghuala Sweeny. “Though the text
                  certainly underwent ideological conditioning in Madden’s hands, thereby
                  exceeding the ethical debate typically invoked in Anglo-American narratives,
                  Madden was after all a committed abolitionist, and a representative of British
                  humanitarian interests in Cuba” (406). See <title level="a">Atlantic
                     Countercultres and the Networked Text: Juan Francisco Manzano, R.R. Madden, and

                  401-413.</note> Burton reads the alterations of the original Spanish, including
               the sequence of events, as Madden capturing the “ambivalence” of the
               colonial condition Madden and Manzano shared. “Surmounting the odds, Manzano
               and Madden each succeeded in effecting agency by forming an alliance of sorts. As a
               counter-discursive strategy, the Irishman ‘united his voice’ with that of
               the Cuban” (Burton 50).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Burton’s
                  research uncovers a letter that Madden wrote in 1844 and the draft of an elegy he
                  wrote after he wrongly believed Manzano had been killed in the Escalera
                  conspiracy. In the letter, Madden wrote “I cannot tell you how grieved I am
                  about poor Manzano, the Cuban poet. Many a time the poor fellow came to my house
                  and talked over his trouble and those of his unfortunate tribe with me. I think
                  there ought to be a monument erected in Jamaica as a man of the African race who
                  was an honor to it and a victim to the tyranny of its oppressors.” Burton
                  reads the letter and the poem as intense “involvement” on
                  Madden’s part. See Gera Burton, <title level="m">Ambivalence and the
                     Postcolonial Subject</title> (New York: Peter Lang, 2004), 94-95.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The unmediated way in which Burton presents this union, however, points to the
               abolitionist relationship to power, one in which humanitarians emphasized the
               complete abjection of enslaved peoples in order to speak and act on their behalf.
               Randall McGowen suggests that this strategy “obscured the process by which this
               identification [with power] was achieved, and the cost it might occasion for a
               victim. The appeal to humanity made it easier to imagine a sympathetic link that
               leapt across cultural differences. . . But the precondition to such an appeal to be
               made was the denial of its own power” (108). In stressing the friendship
               between Manzano and Madden, Burton minimizes the collaboration between Madden and Del
               Monte in getting the original from Manzano. The abolitionist content of
               Madden’s translation conceals the site of cooperation between the planter and
               Madden, yet it is crucial in understanding how Madden’s translation performs an
               ideological accommodation of Cuban slavery in the new Atlantic economy while it
               overtly condemns it. The collusion between Madden and Del Monte creates a problem
               space where Manzano’s cultural capital is appropriated first by Del Monte and
               subsequently by Madden, since both the planter and the civil servant could see their
               respective causes advanced through the translation of Manzano’s life into
               English. During the 1830s, Del Monte and other Cuban abolitionists were concerned
               that too many Africans had been imported to Cuba, and feared that the imbalance
               between blacks and whites would precipitate a second Haiti (Sarracino 103-4). Del
               Monte saw British vigilance against further trade in slaves as a means of controlling
               Cuba’s African population, and he was a willing collaborator with Madden. As
               Del Monte complained to a correspondent in the United States: <quote>

                  between the races of America</title>]. Del Monte’s abolitionism is thus
               mixed with an implicit policy to whiten the overall population of Cuba, and to
               maintain power concentrated in a ruling elite. Ironically, his friendship with Madden

               <p>For his part, Madden banked on the abolitionist familiarity with autobiography as a

               summary of a generic slave narrative with the exception that it singles out
               Manzano’s origin: <quote>A volume has just been published of a very singular
                  character and of great interest. . . But the more most remarkable circumstance is

                  endowment and poetical genius. Juan —, although now happily free—his
                  name, nevertheless, is concealed, lest the publication of this volume should be to
                  his injury at Havana—was a slave for thirty eight years. Amidst the utmost

                  </quote> Whereas British writers such as Equiano and Prince have demonstrated their
               “native endowment,” other enslaved peoples have yet to demonstrate it;
               Juan’s “high native endowment” as a <emph>Cuban</emph> slave
               strikes the reviewer as a “remarkable circumstance.” The qualifications
               after Manzano’s first name parallel the list of accomplishments that intensify
               the writer’s second moment of surprise, where Manzano’s poetry is not
               just “verses,” but “of a high order too.” The reviewer
               responds to the distancing voice that reveals Madden’s assumptions about a
               British abolitionist audience after 1839, and the desire of such an audience to read
               slavery as foreign and not as an occurrence that had been deeply familiar until 1838.
               The autobiography of a <emph>Cuban</emph> slave iterates and promises to revitalize
               the slave narrative in exotic garb, from “a voice coming from some place other
               than ‘here’ (and possibly ‘now’)” (Mossop 34).</p>
               <p>Most critics accept that Del Monte acted as Manzano’s literary patron, yet it
               is clear that the relationship between master and slave that pervaded Cuban society
               underwrote the solicitation of the manuscript and its subsequent edition. Del Monte solicited
               the autobiography from Manzano after the Afro-Cuban poet recited the sonnet <title level="a">Mis treinta años</title> [<title level="a">My Thirty Years</title>]
               in a <foreign xml:lang="es">tertulia</foreign>; the story that Manzano’s talent

               associates, edit the Spanish manuscript, and give it to Madden (Luis 83). There is no
               evidence in the narrative or his letters to Del Monte that Manzano is ever offered
               any remuneration for writing it (except for the facilitation of his manumission), and
               Manzano did not know the details of what Del Monte planned for it beyond a vague
               notion that his master at the time “tenía interés de que biesen en
               Europa algunos que tenía razón de ablar de un siervo de su casa, poeta,
               cuyos versos recitaba de memoria y algunos dudaban que fuesen de uno sin

               he was right to speak about a servant in his household, a poet, whose verses he
               recited from memory, which some doubted could be from one without education]
               (Manzano, <title level="m">Obras</title>, 87). If, as Burton claims, Madden
               befriended Manzano while the later was still writing the <foreign xml:lang="es">autobiografía</foreign>, Madden did not intimate anything about the
               autobiography’s projected translation or audience. Del Monte and Madden thus
               circumscribe Manzano’s sense of audience to men who have direct power over him.
               By contrast, Equiano saw himself addressing the British nation; as Sonia Hofkosh has
               argued, “Equiano’s <title level="m">Interesting Narrative</title> claims
               its place in the public sphere, as a political intervention in a vital national
               debate, as an ‘insrument’ in the formation of public opinion and
               legislative policy” (334).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  signification of Equiano’s autobiography, as those of Mary Prince and
                  Ottobah Cugoano, is then incorporated into the larger national narrative, as the
                  commemorations of the abolition of the trade in Britain last year have done. For

               intervention that Manzano could envision for his text and the range his voice and
               story could have: a Cuban freedman speaking to other freedmen, slaves, and

                  <title level="m">Poems by a Slave in the Island of Cuba</title> came out in time for
               the convention, and Madden dedicated it to Joseph Sturge. The social and economic
               relations that allowed Del Monte to appropriate the manuscript from Manzano and gift
               it to Madden, who then repurposed it for his own ends, emerge in Madden’s own
               account of the circuitous route of the text: <quote>A Collection of Poems written by
                  a slave recently liberated . . . was presented to me in the year 1838 by a
                  gentleman at Havana, a Creole . . . some of these pieces had had fortunately found
                  their way to Havana, and attracted the attention of the literary people there,
                  while the poor author was in slavery in the neighborhood of Matanzas. The
                  gentleman to whom I have alluded . . . redeemed this poor fellow from slavery . .
                  . [and] induced him to write his story. (Madden 37, 39)</quote> If Manzano and
               Madden had a friendship —an alliance, as Burton suggests— why is it Del
               Monte who “presents” the text to Madden, and who also
               “induces” Manzano into the labor of writing it? Manzano’s free will
               is subject to Del Monte as the man who “redeemed” him from slavery;
               besides the religious connotations of saving someone from sin, the second definition
               of the word suggests to “gain or regain possession of something in exchange for
               payment” (OED). The relationship of indebtedness that Del Monte creates when he
               “redeems” Manzano entitles him to Manzano’s labor without
               remuneration. Manzano thus has to suffer “inducement” to write as payment
               for Del Monte’s role in buying him out of slavery. The labor that Manzano is
               compelled to do for Del Monte does not get remunerated, unless Manzano’s
               manumission itself is a form of payment, a loan that Manzano must repay. Del Monte
               thus practices a kind of usury to extract the literary value of Manzano’s life,
               one that Madden continues in his translation by staging Manzano’s invisibility
               in the text. In Derridean terms, this relationship of usury is one of “erasure
               by rubbing, exhaustion, crumbling away, certainly; but also the supplementary product
               of a capital, the exchange which far from losing the original investment would
               fructify its initial wealth, would increase the return in the form of revenue,
               additional interest, linguistic value” (<title level="a">White
                  Mythology</title> 210). The omission of Manzano’s name as author, and the
               attribution in the Preface to Del Monte <emph>and not</emph> Manzano as the
               originator of the text, multiply the relation of indebtedness that induces labor.
                 <note place="foot" resp="editors">Manzano is said to have composed a second
                  half to the narrative, one which Madden reported as lost. Yet even in discussing
                  the lost manuscript, Madden returns to Del Monte as its source. “[The
                  autobiography] was written in two parts—the second part fell into the hands
                  of persons connected with his former master, and I fear it is not likely to be
                  restored to the person to whom I am indebted for the first portion of this
                  manuscript” See R.R. Madden, <title level="m">Poems by a Slave in the Island
                     of Cuba</title>, ed. Edward J. Mullen (Hamden: Archon Books, 1981) 39. </note> By accepting the manuscript from Del Monte, Madden assumes Manzano’s debt. </p>
               <p>Madden’s stated aim in performing the translation is to “vindicate in
               some degree the character of the negro intellect, at least the attempt affords me an
               opportunity of recording my conviction, that the blessings of education and good
               government are only wanting to make the Natives of Africa, intellectually and
               morally, equal to any people on the surface of the globe” (37). Like Del Monte,
               Madden seeks to “redeem” Manzano before a mostly white audience, like the
               “God of all light and truth” on whom Madden calls to “Reprove the
               despot and redeem the slave” (<title level="a">The Slave-Trade Merchant</title>
               l. 259). Redemption, however, involves a taking of possession of Manzano through the
               translated text and Madden’s appropriation of Manzano’s cultural labor.
               The translation codifies the commodification of the Cuban worker’s labor for a
               British market and the complicity of the Cuban elite, collapsing the labor of the
               “recently liberated” with the work of the slave. The symbolic investment
               of the translation reproduces the transformation of the two kinds of labor into
               credit and debt that mirrored the workings of the free market and finance capital. In
               1834, for instance, British banks financed the first Cuban railroad with a loan of
               £400,000, and its construction relied “on local journeymen and mainly
               rented slaves and freemen” (Zanetti and García 26, 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Financing for other projects continued throughout the
                  century. John Hardy, British Consul in Havana in 1837 while Madden acted as
                  Superintendent of Liberated Africans, intervened to get investment for the
                  Sociedad Minera del Cobre, which introduced another railroad for mining interests
                  in Cuba. Zanetti and García add “the first foreign loan in Cuban
                  history, was contracted with the banking firm of Alexander Robertson who not only
                  took care of the issue and placement of the bonds but also acted as agent for the
                  Junta de Fomento (Development Board) in purchasing equipment and other railroad
                  material. This first contract marked the beginning between Robertson and Cuban
                  railroad companies that would extend itself over two decades . . . When the new
                  railroads of Matanzas and Júcaro needed financial assistance, nothing was
                  easier for them than to follow the path already taken by the Junta de Fomento and
                  contract two loans with the Robertson bank.” 113-14</note>

               <p>Moreover, the strange presentation of the work as the <title level="m">Poems of a
                  Cuban Slave</title>, when what one in fact reads first is Madden’s own two
               poems, <title level="a">The Slave Trade Merchant,</title> and <title level="a">The
                  Sugar Estate,</title> before getting to Manzano’s life and poems, reifies
               the position of the British subject as interpreter and consumer of the lives of
               others. Within the <title level="m">Poems by a Cuban Slave</title>, Manzano’s
               life serves as documentation for Madden’s poems, a proto-appendix that
               foreshadows the appendices that follow. One contemporary reviewer noted the
               imbalance: “The major part of [<title level="m">Poems by a Cuban Slave</title>]
               is occupied by a poem of Dr. Madden’s own” (<title level="a">Anthology</title> 403). Madden crowds out Manzano, and turns the translator,
               usually the marginal, anonymous figure, into the author. Even as he explains the
               translation, Madden manages to highlight his poems. “I have given a literal
               translation of it [Manzano’s life], and that translation, revised by a
               Spaniard, will be found at the end of these poems” [<title level="a">The Slave
                  Trade Merchant</title> and <title level="a">The Sugar Estate</title>] (39). </p>
               <p>The signifying relation between Madden’s framing poems and appendices and
               Manzano’s work in the volume becomes the “exchange” that will
               “fructify … the wealth” of Madden’s investment in Manzano, since
               Madden uses the Cuban writer’s life to draw both veracity and value for his own
               enunciations—both the poetic and the documentary. Besides performing the
               abolitionist gesture of showing the world that Africans had intelligence and
               feelings, Madden self-consciously presents his work as part of a literary
               abolitionist tradition. He places himself alongside a canonical list of British
               anti-slavery poets such as Hannah More, James Montgomery and William Cowper on the
               grounds that Cuban planters have only been written about “by travelers who have
               judged their humanity by the curteousness of their manners” (38), and he
               intends to rectify the record. With the “The Slave Merchant” and
               “The Sugar Estate,” Madden “determined, therefore, to give a short
               but faithful sketch of the Cuban slave-trade merchant and planter in verse”
               (38). These poems have been overlooked in commentary about Madden’s
               translation, which has focused on Manzano’s life and poems given contemporary
               critical interests. Yet the poems are as much a part of the translation as
               Madden’s pledged fidelity to Manzano’s original since they situate Madden
               in an aesthetic, cultural, and political landscape that abolitionist readers could
               understand and through which they could read Manzano’s life.</p>
               <p>As McGowen points out, “The discourse of the anti-slavery movement revolved
               around three figures—the slave, the slave owner, and the humanitarian”
               (104). Madden recasts these figures through the cultural Otherness of Cuba and the
               foreignness of Spanish. He differentiates the humanitarian through his depiction of
               the Cuban slave-merchant and the planter as personifications of extreme greed and his
               exposure of the dissonance between the planter’s gallant code of conduct to
               foreigners <foreign xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</foreign> his inhumanity to the
               slaves. The need for translation, given Cuba’s exotic setting, makes the
               silence of the slaves more pronounced since there is an added layer between the
               British abolitionist reader and the Cuban enslaved person—that of a
               “foreign” language. In <title level="a">The Slave-Trade Merchant</title>,
               the figure of effictio serves to draw a portrait in contrasts between the surface
               appearance and the truths that Madden as abolitionist and cultural insider can
               reveal. Effictio is forensic as it is descriptive, and it allows Madden to distance
               himself clinically from the slave merchant as he catalogues the “trade”
               (l.39) and denounces the crimes that support it. The deference that people have
               towards the merchant’s “solemn features” (l.2), and conspicuous
               wealth, “those gay saloons, this banquet hall’s array” (l.13),
               ignores his real identity, which Madden can disclose as privileged observer. He
               instructs the reader:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l rend="#indent2">Behold, his heart! It is not all that’s fair </l>
                        <l rend="#indent2">And smooth without, that’s staunch and sound
                        elsewhere. </l>
                        <l rend="#indent2">E’en in the calmest breast, the lust of gold </l>
                        <l rend="#indent2">May have its firmest seat and fastest hold</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2">May fix its fatal canker in the core,</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2">Reach every feeling, taint it more and more;</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2">Nor leave one spot of soundness where it falls,</l>
                        <l rend="#indent2">Nor spark of pity where its lust enthralls. (16-24)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Greed infects the merchant’s “heart” and
               “core,” corrupting and ultimately destroying his ability to feel for
               others. Madden asks his readers to weigh the merchant’s material well-being and
               desire for profit against his diseased morality “To human suffering, sympathy
               and shame, / His heart is closed, and wealth is all his aim” (l. 218-9). The
               heroic couplets reinforce the opposition between the public persona of the planter
               and his rotten internal self. The heart is “not all that’s fair,”
               and “the calmest breast” burns with the “lust of gold.” </p>
               <p>Madden attributes society’s acceptance of the planter to his seeming lack of
               connection to the violence of slavery because of the physical distance between the
               businessman and slavers in the African coast. Scenes of a writing slave merchant do
               not occur often in abolitionist poetry; their appearance in Madden’s poem call
               attention to writing as an instrument of the trader, one that he uses to manage his
               business across continents. The merchant “Sits at his desk, and with composure
               sends / A formal order to his Gold-coast friends / For some five hundred
               ‘bultos’ of effects” (l.44). The writing of the merchant enables
               the conversion of credit, “the formal order,” into “bultos,”
               a conversion reversed once the slaves reach their expected destination.
               As Ian Baucom explains, “slaves were thus treated not only as a type of
               commodity but as a type of interest bearing money. They functioned in this system
               simultaneously as commodities for sale and as the reserve deposits of a loosely
               organized, decentered, but vast trans-Atlantic banking system” (61).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Referring to the <emph>Zong</emph> massacre,
                  Ian Baucom writes, “That the money truths of the transatlantic slave trade
                  could attach themselves not only to the slaves who reached the markets of the
                  Caribbean alive but also to those who drowned along the way; that a sufficiently
                  credible imagination could see in a drowned slave a still existent, guaranteed,
                  and exchangeable form of currency; that a British court could hold the majesty of
                  the law to endorse this act of the imagination; that the attorneys for William
                  Gregson and his partners could convince a jury that by drowning 132 of the
                  Zong’s less desirable slaves into the sea Captain Hollingwood had not so much
                  murdered a company of his fellows as hurried them into money, is also, as we shall
                  see, unsurprising—perhaps even the inevitable consequence of that
                  epistemological revolution (most commonly expressed as an accounting procedure)
                  which had permitted Britain’s capital houses to convert ‘their’
                  slaves into paper money.” See <title level="m">Specters of the Atlantic:
                     Finance Capital, Slavery, and the Philosophy of History</title> (Durham: Duke
                  UP, 2005).</note> The Spanish term <foreign xml:lang="es">bultos</foreign> casts
               into relief the symbolic transacting of the merchant’s credit and its
               concatenation of value to slaves both as commodities and as potential capital in the
               bodies that will be forced to labor. Later, Madden indicates “The pen does all
               the business of the sword, / On Congo’s shore, the Cuban merchant’s word
               / Serves to send forth a thousand brigands bold” (125).</p>
               <p>Madden uses English as a marker of cultural and national difference in order to
               disentangle the process of his own literary translation of “bultos” into
               “slaves” from the mechanisms of credit that perform the transformation of
               these symbolic values into commodities. According to Madden, the Cuban merchant, the
               “proud” and “excellent Señor,” has a counterpart in the
               African agents who “foment the strife / of hostile tribes” (ll. 129-30)
               in order to obtain slaves, and not in the London merchants and bankers with whom the
               Cuban elite also transacted, as observed earlier. The word <foreign xml:lang="es">Señor,</foreign> usually a title of respect, denotes the merchant’s
               cultural separateness with contempt, an othering that is enforced through the
               seamless continuity that the poem posits between the greed of the merchant and the
               violence of the African slavers. Greed thus becomes culturally othered, province of
               “The tribe of Cuban traders, linked in crime,” and geographically
               situated in “Havana and its joys” (ll. 191). The Señor and Cuban
               culture, including the Spanish language, belong to a world of corruption that the
               British abolitionist, by virtue of being an outsider, can denounce in English. He
               laments as much when he asks:<quote>

               up to Madden to then become the agent who denounces, who warns, who becomes the
               “new Las Casas.” Madden thus invests British culture and the English
               language with moral authority, developing a parallel, if unstated, narrative of the
               British abolitionist as a virtuous figure who stands in opposition to his Cuban
               counterparts, the merchant and Manzano, who here is not counted among the voices that
               could “bid these horrors cease,” though his autobiography is included in
               the volume. Madden displays intense indignation on behalf of “human
               flesh”; “victims”; “human cargo”; “slaves”;
               “naked wretches”; “Specters of men”; and an anaphoric
               enumeration of nameless victims, “how many wretched beings,”
               “infants,” “defenseless mothers,” “struggling
               hands,” “sick,” “creatures,” and “negroes”
               (ll. 75-108). He catalogues the victims of slavery as a means of producing them to
               expose the merchant’s crime.</p>
               <p>Madden expands the cultural inscription of greed and cruelty as Cuban in “The
               Sugar Estate,” the companion poem to <title level="a">The Slave-Trade
                  Merchant,</title> in which an English traveler narrates his journey from Havana
               through the Cuban countryside. He visits a plantation, where he enjoys the
               hospitality of a Cuban Conde [Count], and converses with him and the
                  <emph>mayoral</emph> [overseer] regarding the state of Cuban slavery. What he
               finds there pales in comparison to “All to the charge of British planters laid
               . . . And yields the bad pre-eminence in crime / To Spanish guilt in ev’ry
               tropic clime” (69). The comparison with West Indian slavery, which has been
               abolished, contains a message of absolution that serves to reconstruct the national
               narrative of British slavery. According to Madden, British planters were not as bad
               as their Cuban or Spanish counterparts, since in Cuba “the grasping master must
               still have / Just thrice the produce from each working slave” (ll.93-4). Yet
               the contrast is more than moral; it also pits temporalities and national histories
               against one another. Madden locates the present of the Cuban plantation in relation
               to the guilty past of British slavery and the contemporaneity of post-abolition
               Britain. The play of temporal frames underscores the retrograde character of the
               Cuban system, whereas Britain’s historical edge corresponds with the moral
               leadership that abolitionists claim.</p>
               <p>The Conde combines the worst traits of British planters and aristocrats
               alike. Following James Montgomery, who calls the Creole planter “The bloated
               vampire of a living man” (26), Madden defines the Conde as a figure whose
               ostentatious wealth, like the planter’s, points to the misery of the slaves
               under his control:<quote>

                  </quote> The French turn of the Conde’s table, with its
               “ragouts” and “Frieandeaus,” offers a menu characterized by
               frivolity. The linking of the Conde’s appetite and “excess” invokes
               the sin of gluttony, and the identification between the bodies of enslaved laborers
               and consumption that an earlier wave of abolitionists, such as William Cowper and
               S.T. Coleridge, had popularized.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an
                  analysis of the figure of consumption in Colerige, Southey, Cowper, and More, and
                  its relationship to cannibalism, see Timothy Morton, <title level="m">The Poetics
                     of Spice: Romantic Consumerism and the Exotic</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP,
                  2000) 171-206.</note> The moral condemnation of the menu corresponds to the
               traveler’s abolitionist objections to the Conde’s arguments for slavery,
               which by 1840 had been popularized on both sides of the Atlantic. These included the
               relative well-being of slaves in comparison to the poor of other countries, the
               familial loyalty of slaves, and the planter’s insistence that the slaves would
               have been worse off in Africa.</p>
               <p>The Conde politely shows the traveler out after discovering his abolitionist
               sympathies; as he’s leaving the plantation, the traveler runs into the mayoral,
               who gladly corrects his impressions of Cuban slavery and inadvertently completes the
               portrait of the Conde’s dissipation. The mayoral, “almost frank and civil
               in his way,” (l. 56) focuses on the profit motive as the driving force behind
               slavery. “With twenty hours of unremitting toil . . . believe me few grow old,
               / but life is cheap, and sugar sir,—is gold . . . Our interest is to make the
               most we can / Of every negro in the shortest span” (ll. 163-70). He calmly
               explains how the “unremitting toil” of the enslaved laborers is directly
               connected to their high mortality rate, and the almost instant replacement of dead
               workers with new ones, implicating the United States in supplying Cuba with slaves.
               “There’s stock abundant in the slave bazaars, / Thanks to the banner of
               the stripes and stars” (l. 157-8). Family relationships are non-existent in
               what amounts to a sugar-cane gulag. There are no civil or religious marriages, and
               low birth rates are accompanied by infanticide “they [mothers] preferred to see
               / Their children dead before their face, ere they / Would give their young
               ‘negritos’ to the kind / Indulgent masters which they are said to
               find” (ll. 83-6). During the first part of the mayoral’s explanation, he
               details the use of whips, stocks, and other physical punishments with a precision and
               casualness that appear to leave the traveler speechless. As if to answer the
               traveler’s silence, the mayoral continues in a monologue, and attempts to
               distance himself from the daily cruelty he inflicts: <quote>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> This passage is somewhat odd within abolitionist poetry which, in
               all the impersonations it offers, does not feature overseers as commentators on
               slavery. The mayoral argues that since he does not directly “profit,” he
               is exonerated him from the pain he inflicts on the Conde’s behalf. The denial
               of his role would appear as rationalization were it not for his momentary
               indentification with the powerlessness of the slaves, imagining a situation where the
               master is “to toil compelled.” This insubordinate and potentially
               revolutionary scenario is rooted in the mayoral’s resentment of the
               Conde’s gambling and dissipation in Havana, which results in heavier demands on
               him and the slaves he oversees. He recognizes that in being an instrument of the
               Conde, he is part of a system that is regulated by “oppression’s iron
               hand,” yet is unable to imagine himself outside of it. </p>
               <p>Though the traveler finds himself in a plantation, the slaves remain strikingly
               silent once again. Their only representation is through a brief allusion to Manzano.
               The indirect reference to Manzano illustrates the supplementary function that his narrative
               plays in connection to Madden’s framing poems. Describing “the proud
               Havana infamous renown” (l. 20), Madden notes “those ladies, foreigners,
               and all / Whose wretched negroes tremble at their call […] Their home spent passions
               and their smiling lips, / Their out-door meekness and their in-door whips” (ll.
               33-8). The description is based on one of Manzano’s sequences of his tenure as
               a page for the Marquesa in Havana, where he attended her at <foreign xml:lang="es">tertulia</foreign> and card tables. “<foreign xml:lang="es">Yo no me podia
                  separar detras del espaldar de su taburete hasta la ora de partir que era por lo
                  regular las dose de la noche … si en el inter duraba la tertulia me dormia si al
                  ir detrás de la bolante por alguna casualidad se me apagaba el farol . . . yo
                  iba a dormir al sepo</foreign>” [I could not quit the side of her chair till
               midnight . . . If during the <foreign xml:lang="es">tertulia</foreign> I fell asleep,
               or when behind the volante, if the lanthorn went out by accident . . . I was put up
               for the night in stocks] (Manzano, <title level="m">Obras</title>, 15; Madden 86).
               Manzano’s account serves as corroboration for Madden and heightens the location
               of debt in the freed subject, just as interest is located in the body of the slave.
               Manzano’s account “cannot quit the side” of Madden’s poems,
               just as he could not leave the Marquesa at the playing table.</p>
               <p>Manzano’s text and its translation signify a relationship of usury that
               problematizes the revelatory paradigm of Madden’s condemnation and the forensic
               authority of the accusation of dissimulation that Madden levels at the merchant and
               the planter. The paradigm depends on the opposition of values between the merchant
               and the abolitionist, one in which the abolitionist favors the value of humanity over
               the Cuban merchant’s greed. This opposition results in a narrative of liberal
               values that eschew economic ones, and “put people first.” The writing of
               the merchant —the letters of credit that exchange for “merchandise”
               and expected returns in monetary interest— bears an economic value derived from
               the legal negation of the enslaved person as an agent and his or her economic
               exploitation through violence. Madden pits abolitionist writing against the
               merchant’s as writing that has a positive relationship to value as it affirms
               the enslaved person’s humanity morally and legally. Yet if the merchant’s
               letters of credit signify people as commodities and bearers of interest,
               Madden’s writing codifies the relationship of debt involved in
               “redemption.” The freedom of the enslaved subject therefore is also
               figured in terms of credit; once free, the former slave becomes a debtor to the
               “credit” that the establishment is willing to extend. Through
               Madden’s Wordsworthian purification of Manzano’s autobiography,
               Manzano’s freedom is construed in terms of its relationship to debt and the
               credit that Madden and Del Monte lend. </p>
               <p>Madden’s instinct to translate and elicit empathy for the suffering of Cuban
               slaves participates in the Romantic impulse to intervene that Lee identifies in the
               dialectic between humanitarianism and capitalism at the heart of the abolitionist
               movement (36). Yet with the end of the struggle for abolition, slaves were no longer
               the “Others” directly connected to Britain’s colonial apparatus in
               the West Indies who demanded such ethical commitments. Rather, slaves in Cuba, Brazil
               (and to a lesser degree the United States) were the Other once removed. In the new
               Atlantic economic order that demanded primary materials for the metropole, the labor
               of those Others was increasingly out of view. The liberation of British slaves made
               it easier for Britons to refigure their slaveholding past and distance themselves from connections to other
               slave-holding countries. In that climate, Madden returned to the stock characters of
               the “aged and shaking” abolitionist poetry and rhetoric: the cruel,
               primped, and pilfering creole planter; the exploited and exploiting overseer, the
               tortured slave—types that in 1840 seemed to belong to a distant past rather
               than the present, before presenting Manzano, an example of the last type. </p>
               <p>“Translation generates the comfortable expectation of stating a relative truth
               lighter than absolute truth: the claim to be truthful at least to the truth
               propounded in the source language,” suggests Tullio Maranhão (65). If
               Madden was “truthful at least” to the “truth” in
               Manzano’s original, it was in exposing the relations that made Manzano’s
               a twice trafficked life. </p>

                  <p>John Gabriel Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative of a Five Years' Expedition
                     Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</title> (1796) is a very complicated
                  text. It tells the story of an officer in the Scots Brigade deployed in 1772 to
                  the Dutch-controlled colony of Surinam to suppress an armed black revolt against
                  plantation slavery. It also exposes the cruelty of both slavery and military
                  authority, while providing a rare account of a wide spectrum of colonial society.
                  It takes advantage of Stedman's role as a colonial authority, writing from the
                  privileged perspective of the colonial gaze, but it also challenges many
                  assumptions and prejudices natural to the colonizer's world view. Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> is gaining importance in Atlantic Studies, because
                  it both reflects the larger experience of circum-Atlantic circulation in the Age
                  of Revolution and provides a unique perspective that differs from other primary
                  material from the period. It should be possible to differentiate between what is
                  typical of society and what is particular to an individual's perspective in
                  Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title>, right? There is just one problem:
                  there is more than one Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title>.</p>
                  <p>Today's reader is in a position to understand the role that variation plays in the
                  construction and interpretation of Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title>.
                  Contemporary culture is comfortable with the idea of media going
                  “viral,” taking on a life of its own as it is experienced and altered
                  by users on the net. Likewise, a type of reading that is attentive to reference
                  and mutation is necessary for Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> because
                  of the proliferation of versions that have emerged over the more than two-hundred
                  year history of its publication legacy. </p>
                  <p>While Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> is gaining critical attention
                  in Atlantic Studies, a close look at its textual history reveals that it has never
                  been out of the public's consciousness for long. The current multiplex
                  configuration of Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> emerged in 1988, the
                  result of Richard and Sally Price's new scholarly edition. The Prices' text
                  transcribed Stedman's 1790 manuscript version for the first time, aiming to
                  restore his original authorial intent and exposing the extent to which the text
                  had been altered by Stedman's first editor, Joseph Johnson. <note place="foot" resp="editors">To add to this confusion, the Prices' restored text
                     exists in both a full transcription complete with original orthography and
                     spellings (1988) and a modernized, abbreviated version (1992). </note> The
                  original, 1796 published version of the <title level="m">Narrative</title> was
                  successful, resulting in several editions in multiple languages. It contained,
                  however, views on race, slavery, social justice and inter-racial sex that were
                  very different than those found in Stedman's manuscript. Upon seeing these
                  alterations, Stedman reflected in his journal, “receive the 1st vol. of my
                  book quite mard oaths and Sermons inserted etc” (June 24, 1795). These
                  changes coalesce around the description of Stedman's relationship with Joanna, a
                  woman in bondage. To briefly give a sense of what is at stake in the competing
                  texts, in their introduction to the revised manuscript edition the Prices note
                  that “the edited version, saying nothing of her beauty, emphasizes Joanna's
                  pitiable condition (bathed in tears rather than bathing with her companions) and
                  makes Stedman her protector and patron, rather than her
                  lover-aspiring-to-be-her-husband” (lxi). If the editorial imperative to
                  cloak Joanna in the modest garb of a sentimentalized relationship with Stedman
                  protects her, in a sense, from being the <title level="m">Narrative</title>'s
                  object of sexual desire, it also obscures the nature of Stedman and Joanna's
                  relationship by defaulting to the confines of gender hierarchies: paternal
                  protection and female emotional dependence. Both versions of the <title level="m">Narrative</title> are troubled by what they cannot contain, whether it be the
                  sexual exploitation made possible by plantation-slavery, or the inter-racial
                  desire that would eventually mark Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> as
                  a singular example of resistance to the exploitations inherent in the
                  eighteenth-century Atlantic world. </p>
                  <p>The Prices' edition made Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> available to
                  contemporary critics, enabling its increasing importance for literary and
                  historical scholarship in Atlantic studies. It also introduced the complexity of
                  having two texts sharing the same name in a field that emphasizes the material
                  production, publication, and dissemination histories of primary sources. The
                  difference between the original published version and the recovered manuscript
                  raises an essential question: how should we read Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> now that there are two of them? On one hand, it is a text
                  that is similar to a planter's journal, a record of colonial society that can be
                  read for silences and echoes of life under plantation slavery. On the other, it is
                  a text that crosses social boundaries between master and slave, white and black,
                  colonizer and colonized, wealthy and poor, in ways that make even the
                  comparatively conservative first publication version appear radical. For scholars
                  interested in reading Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> as a reflection
                  of history, Stedman's manuscript version <emph>might</emph> offer a closer
                  depiction of his perceived experience. And yet, focusing on the Prices' recovered
                  manuscript edition leaves out the prevailing cultural biases that Johnson's 1796
                  version reflects. Choosing one edition over the other is no longer an option for
                  scholars who turn to Stedman's writings as a gateway to eighteenth-century life.
                  Both are essential for triangulating Stedman's particular experience and the
                  larger cultural biases that mediated that experience in print. </p>
                  <p>I will confess now that it is not my intention to map the differences between the
                  two versions of Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title>. The Prices'
                  introduction to their revised manuscript edition describes these changes in
                  extensive detail. Instead, I take up the task of understanding the ramification of
                  the Prices' edition not only on criticism that has emerged as a result of their
                  recovery work, but also to understand the recent revival of Stedman's writings in
                  the context of a much longer process of cultural appropriation that has been
                  ongoing since the <title level="m">Narrative</title>'s first publication in 1796.
                  In essence, this is an effort in tracking: in tracking knowledge circulating in
                  the Atlantic; in tracking the cultures that respond to and appropriate Stedman's
                  account of his time in Surinam for their own purposes; and in tracking the
                  significance of alterations made to the text. It is clear from the two versions of
                  Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> that authorship is only one force at
                  work in shaping the text, and not necessarily the most powerful force, either. In
                  order to bring the cultural forces at work in the construction of Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> to light, it is necessary to expand the notion of
                  authorship to include not only the figure of a single author, but also the acts of
                  referencing, printing, and reprinting. Rather than arguing for a definitive
                  edition of the <title level="m">Narrative</title>, I argue that the work can best
                  be understood by considering it simultaneously as manuscript, editorialized
                  publication, and re-telling. All together, this plurality of authorship and
                  edition forms the core of what I call the Stedman Archive: the collectively
                  produced text. The Stedman Archive is a convenient shorthand denoting the many
                  documents that have Stedman's experience in colonial Surinam as their center. In
                  one way or another they each recount that experience from a perspective unique to
                  the type of writing each document undertakes, and together they reveal the
                  incomplete understanding that any one in particular is able to capture. </p>
                  <p>The central texts of the archive are the <title level="m">Narrative</title>'s
                  original publication and the Prices' restored manuscript edition, produced from
                  the rare manuscripts and journals first recovered by antiquarian Stanbury
                  Thompson. In the 1960s, Thompson published Stedman’s journals and letters,
                  as well as a biographic history of the Stedman family refined from these sources
                  and interviews conducted with Stedman's living descendants. (Thompson found these
                  important documents in a junk shop, and is ultimately responsible for their
                  preservation.) While Thompson's publications offer a fair reading copy for readers
                  unused to working with hand-written manuscripts, they are at times unreliable in
                  their transcription and translation, and can usefully be checked against the
                  originals held by the James Ford Bell library at the University of Minnesota lest
                  Thompson's bias be mistaken as Stedman's. <note place="foot" resp="editors">I would like to especially thank Dr. Marguerite Ragnow and the James Ford Bell
                     Library for assistance with the manuscript materials for this purpose.
                     Quotations from Stedman's journals drawn from Thompson have been compared to
                     the original collection, <title level="m">John Gabriel Stedman, Journal,
                        diaries, and other papers, 1772-1796</title>, James Ford Bell Library
                     1772oSt. </note>The same is true of the <title level="m">Narrative</title>,
                  which went through many editions, abridgments, and translations. Until the Prices'
                  recovered manuscript edition in 1988 the biases of his many editors were
                  mistakenly attributed to Stedman. </p>
                  <p>It should be noted that the Prices' introduction includes a meticulously
                  researched list of the textual variations that the <title level="m">Narrative</title> underwent over the course of two hundred years, including
                  descriptions of the changes made to the text in each case. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See the Prices' introduction to the 1988 manuscript
                     edition, (lxxii-lxxxiii).</note> Indeed, the only limitation to their research
                  is that it ends with the addition of the restored version of the text. In 1988
                  they could not foresee the effect that their edition would have in scholarship or
                  the arts over the following two decades. Critics have since assessed Stedman's
                  account of Surinam as imperial travelogue, as a vector of revolutionary knowledge,
                  as a carrier of the hidden history of women in slavery, or as colonial
                  pornography, and in the process have re-written the <title level="m">Narrative</title> into current scholarly paradigms of the eighteenth-century
                  Atlantic world. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Mary Louise Pratt
                     (travelogue), Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker (vector of revolutionary
                     knowledge), Jenny Sharpe (hidden history of women in slavery), and Marcus Wood
                     (colonial pornography). </note> Alongside this renewed scholarly attention,
                  Beryl Gilroy re-wrote Stedman's experience from his first-person perspective in
                     <title level="m">Stedman and Joanna - A Love in Bondage</title> (1991) .
                  Drawing on the <title level="m">Narrative</title>, as well as Stedman's private
                  journals and letters, Gilroy focuses on Stedman and Joanna's relationship even
                  while expanding the length of the tale to include Stedman's pre- and post-Surinam
                  life. All of these texts maintain an important fidelity to Stedman's account, but
                  their strategic changes leave authorship in the archive indeterminate. During the
                  two centuries since its original publication, Stedman's account has resurfaced
                  repeatedly alongside the struggle against slavery, colonialism, and racism. As a
                  result, the full scope and importance of the Stedman Archive only becomes clear
                  from a critical perspective instructed by the black Atlantic; it is an archive
                  endowed with both the conventions of British culture and print apparatus in the
                  eighteenth century, and productive of post-colonial re-writings emerging in
                  diverse political and national contexts.</p>
                  <p>In its original form the <title level="m">Narrative</title> is a more or less
                  chronological account of Stedman's time spent in Surinam, ranging over a wide
                  variety of subjects including ethnographic observation, colonial history, military
                  engagements, a naturalist's attention to flora and fauna, and Stedman's
                  relationships with the people he encounters in every strata of plantation society.
                  It is an example of what Mary Louise Pratt has described as travel writing, in
                  which the imperialist perspective of the traveler has the power to render what it
                  observes as legible in the scientific, racial, and economic consciousness of the
                  imperial observer. The travel writing genre privileges the author as individual,
                  granting the power of interpretation over the events and peoples related in the
                  account. Stedman's writing, in the case of the <title level="m">Narrative</title>,
                  mirrors the function of his imperial subjectivity. It is the written analogue of
                  his other positions of authority: as a military officer who suppresses a slave
                  revolt, and as a white European male who is able through local/colonial custom to
                  temporarily take a slave woman as his wife to increase his domestic comfort while
                  in Surinam. </p>
                  <p>Stopping there would be stopping short. Stedman was more than a traveler in
                  Surinam, and he was also more than a colonial agent and oppressor. The <title level="m">Narrative</title> can be read as the outgrowth of social subjectivity
                  categories that typify the operation of the larger plantation slavery system in
                  the West Indies and South America, but it must also be recognized in its
                  particularity. In the following sections, I will consider what happens when
                  Stedman's authorship becomes displaced in the larger archive – how critics rewrite
                  what they read, how an author becomes a character, and above all else, how textual
                  changes challenge criticism's reduction of Stedman to imperialist. </p>

                  <head>Viral History</head>
                  <p>As Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> goes viral, the logic of the
                  transmission vector becomes useful in thinking about how knowledge can be tracked
                  through an archive. Disease marks the transgressed boundary of the body, as
                  suffering is passed from one subject to the next. It is often associated with
                  myriad cultural interactions and social stigmas, and has become one of the primary
                  organizations of body control in our current time via management, prevention, and
                  treatment. Extending this metaphor to the viral transmission of a text emphasizes
                  the split between “agent” and “effect”; the text-as-virus
                  becomes the vehicle for disseminating the knowledge-as-disease. The subversive
                  quality of the transmitted knowledge remains true to today's viral media, which
                  typically spreads its information prior to official media coverage. </p>
                  <p>In terms of today's criticism, the primary conceptual category for the subversive,
                  or alternative, interpretation of a text is the act of producing a “hidden
                  history,” a re-telling of a familiar history or narrative from below. The
                  effect of this critical effort is to empower new social consciousnesses by
                  revealing versions of the past that destabilize the “always-already”
                  logic of currently dominant and hegemonic social configurations. If something
                  happened once, after all, it could happen again. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus
                  Rediker's <title level="m">The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and
                     the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic</title> helped define the
                  field of Atlantic Studies by envisioning a model of one continuous and ongoing
                  resistance throughout the Atlantic world to expanding global capital during the
                  early modern era and throughout the Age of Revolution. By reading the silences of
                  texts for the experience of the mass of humanity that did not have the privilege
                  of producing the materials that now define our historical archives, Linebaugh and
                  Rediker describe a counter-history to one inundated by ruling-class assumptions. </p>
                  <p>Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> plays a crucial role in <title level="m">The Many-Headed Hydra's</title> perspective of history, but his
                  dual-natured character and text seemingly do not fit in its conception of history
                  from below. In order to understand the relative “silencing” of Stedman
                  that takes place in Linebaugh and Rediker's history, it will be useful to consider
                  one of Rediker's later essays, <title level="a">The Red Atlantic,</title> that
                  describes Stedman's role as a carrier of knowledge. Rediker reads William
                  Blake’s poetic protagonist, Red Orc, from <title level="m">America, a
                     Prophecy</title> to continue his project of tracing resistance from below in
                  the Age of Revolution. (Blake engraved sixteen illustrations for the <title level="m">Narrative</title> from watercolors and sketches done by Stedman while
                  in Surinam.) Rediker argues that a link between Red Orc and Stedman's narration of
                  the execution on the rack of a slave named Neptune “show[s] how the
                  knowledge of both violence and resistance circulated around the red Atlantic – how
                  African rebels in America influenced Blake, who in turn represented their struggle
                  to a metropolitan public” (125). For Rediker, Stedman takes on the role of
                  mercenary-observer, recording the stoicism of Akan-speaking people. Their
                  revolutionary spirit moves through the middle passage, to gallows resistance in
                  Surinam, and eventually to the pages of Blake's poem. Stedman remains a colonial
                  oppressor while Blake, the artist, gets the creative glory. While focusing on the
                  circulation of revolutionary knowledge through the Neptune-to-Red Orc
                  transformation, Rediker acknowledges Stedman as the source for more of Blake's
                  material, particularly as the inspiration for <title level="a">The
                     Tyger.</title>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">The Prices' introduction
                     discusses the Stedman / Blake interplay (xxxix). </note> Taking up this
                  particular moment of exchange at the end of <title level="m">The Many Headed
                     Hydra</title>, Linebaugh and Rediker demarcate their roles as follows:
                  “Stedman respected the creature, but only with the hunter's wish to kill it.
                  Blake also wondered about the relation between hunter and hunted, but he widened
                  it to include the larger social forces of oppressor and the oppressed”
                  (349). By considering the role of each in these terms, Linebaugh and Rediker tend
                  to align Stedman with a sort of colonial realism, in which he becomes the predator
                  par excellence and his writing becomes bare record. Blake, whose vision is limited
                  to what Stedman reports, gains the artistic and romantic receptivity to the latent
                  content – the disease-as-knowledge that Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> carries. </p>
                  <p>Considering Stedman's experience in the larger context of the Stedman Archive
                  reveals the extent to which the <title level="m">Narrative</title> exceeds the
                  function of being a bare conveyor of history; the text's self-conscious
                  construction of Stedman's character and the plurality of authorial and editorial
                  influence over the many versions of the <title level="m">Narrative</title> argue
                  against the stability of Stedman-as-recorder of a particular historical-material
                  moment. Yet even considering the <title level="m">Narrative</title> as a stable
                  text (Linebaugh and Rediker use the Prices' restored manuscript edition) can yield
                  a literary interpretation as well as a historical-materialist treatment of the
                  text. M. Allewaert considers Stedman to be representative of colonial writing that
                  is conscious of the “swamp sublime,” the ecological characteristic of
                  the swamp which undermines Enlightenment notions of the subject that she sees
                  emerging as a response to the author becoming a “citizen-subject of print
                  culture.... [The] shift from subjectivity to agency [in the swamp] testifies to an
                  organization of political life that is not dependent on the separation of subjects
                  from the world.... [A]t precisely the moment citizen-subjects were emerging in
                  metropolitan centers, the plantation zone gave rise to an ecological practice
                  closely linked to <foreign>marronage</foreign>, a process through which human
                  agents found ways to interact with nonhuman forces and in so doing resisted the
                  order of the plantation” (341). For Allewaert, the swamp becomes a
                  manifestation of the sublime in its dangerous indeterminacy, penetrating and
                  altering the isolated subjectivity of the colonial master-class. It also becomes
                  the figurative reservoir for revolutionary resistance on behalf of the escaped and
                  revolting black populations of the plantation zone. Drawing upon Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> (again, the Prices' 1988 edition), Allewaert
                  focuses on Stedman's appreciation of the rebel's ability to use the terrain to
                  their strategic advantage, closely reading a Blake image to show the white
                  colonial's discord with nature as juxtaposed to the black assimilation to the
                  natural landscape. While many other aspects of the text speak to exchanges that
                  undermine romantic notions of subjectivity (disease and inter-racial sex
                  particularly), Allewaert's discussion of Stedman emphasizes that Stedman's text is
                  an outgrowth from plantation zone experience rather than the preserved
                  master-colonialist gaze presumed by Linebaugh and Rediker. </p>
                  <p>Stedman's personal experience is erased from Linebaugh and Rediker's hidden
                  history of the Revolutionary Atlantic, leaving only his role as a carrier and
                  transmitter of subversive history. Plates from Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> open and close <title level="m">The Many Headed
                     Hydra</title>, and indeed one figure graces its cover. The meditation of how
                  Stedman impacted the revolutionary Blake serves as the afterword to the text. Yet
                  because Stedman fought against the revolted slaves, he remains in Linebaugh and
                  Rediker's critical estimate synonymous with the forces of colonial domination.
                  Stedman's ambiguous dexterity in crossing plantation culture's social barriers,
                  experience of inter-racial love, and the specifics of his response as a witness to
                  marroon resistance and the horrors of slavery are all silenced in their history.
                  Stedman's politics partly explain this choice. He remained “moderate”
                  on the issue of slavery following his return from Surinam, and while his
                  sympathies were against the brutality of the institution even to the point of
                  professing racial equality, he also, as the Prices' introduction puts it,
                  “rehearsed [in his manuscript] the whole panoply of already well-worn
                  arguments in favor of the continuation of slavery and the trade...” (lxii).
                  Yet it is also necessary to recall that it was Stedman, not Blake, who witnessed
                  the colonial violence in Surinam, and that his writings exhibit a profound
                  difference between his own mindset and that of the Surinam planters. </p>
                  <p>Stedman's importance as a transmitter of Akan and other cultural legacies (with
                  both origins in Africa and new spontaneous cultural formations of the West Indies
                  and other Atlantic sites) should be considered as a sign of how the plantation
                  zone had affected his subjectivity. Although associated with the dominant military
                  power, Stedman is for that reason an importantly destabilizing vector for the
                  transmission of African diasporic culture. Speaking through Blake's plates and
                  editorial muffling, Stedman's mediated voice warns that the spread of knowledge
                  about the Atlantic might always require the flexibility of sounding through the
                  very apparatus that would deny that voice, passing the message on with the merest
                  trace of an Akan accent. Witnessing the spread of Stedman's knowledge through text
                  necessarily requires flexibility in relation to authorship, and speculation about
                  the cultural saturation of the ideas he helped to transmit must therefore trace
                  both silences and echoes. </p>

                  <p>What, then, is hidden in the Stedman Archive that makes it such a persistently
                  engaged group of texts in the long effort to overthrow slavery and racism? As
                  versions and variants of Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> proliferated
                  over the course of two centuries, each new writer repeated Joseph Johnson's
                  original editorial effect by imposing their own emphasis on Stedman's experience.
                  While recent critical attention has treated Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> as a bearer of history and carrier of resistance in the
                  Revolutionary Atlantic, a distinct genealogy has emerged in both primary and
                  secondary retellings of the <title level="m">Narrative</title> that focuses on the
                  relationship between Stedman, Joanna, and their son, Johnny. For hidden history,
                  the act of producing a genealogy is everything; it is the tool by which alternate
                  archives of historical possibility become visible. While this sense of genealogy
                  certainly applies, there is a quality to the Stedman Archive that exceeds the act
                  of revelation. The problem with genealogy, as a word, is that it is implicitly
                  associated with a system of reproduction and family that assumes many things about
                  the appropriateness of family, love, and childbearing. All of these assumptions of
                  typicality work against the transgressive aspect of Stedman and Joanna's
                  relationship – if, that is, it does exceed the ongoing exploitation of people
                  under slavery. If Stedman's text contains something that is passed on through its
                  viral reproduction, another term from the rhetoric of disease can be useful for
                  understanding the limitations inherent in the concept of genealogy. A virus is
                  also a pathogen, a word that combines the concepts of pathos and genesis,
                  suffering and passion given birth. As the Stedman Archive takes shape under the
                  guidance of editors and re-writers, Stedman, Joanna, and Johnny form the
                  passionate center driving reproduction of Stedman's text. </p>
                  <p>Many people have been drawn to this aspect of Stedman's text. In 1834, prominent
                  U.S. abolitionist Lydia Maria Child excerpted the material related to Joanna from
                  the <title level="m">Narrative</title> for inclusion in the gift-book, <title level="m">The Oasis</title>. Child's reasons for drawing on Stedman's
                  experience were strategic; the abolitionist movement in the United States had
                  experienced a series of violent anti-abolitionist riots fueled by the mob's fear
                  and repulsion of inter-racial marriage. By returning to a British source, Child
                  was able to include an example of inter-racial desire among the many other
                  anti-slavery pieces of <title level="m">The Oasis</title>, a collection including
                  poems, factoids, short stories, dramatic sketches, personal narratives, legal
                  summaries, and a biography of William Wilberforce, the British abolitionist who
                  led the parliamentary effort to abolish the slave trade in 1807. As the first
                  abolitionist gift-book in the U.S., its purpose was to describe abolitionism to a
                  diverse audience unfamiliar with the growing movement.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Gift-books were a popular form of publishing in the
                     mid-nineteenth century. <title level="m">The Oasis</title> was well received as
                     the first abolitionist gift-book, but its sales disappointed Child, who had the
                     volume published at her own expense. The more successful abolitionist gift-book
                        <title level="m">The Liberty Bell</title>, edited by Maria Chapman and
                     published for several consecutive years, was printed more modestly, was funded
                     by donation, and sold at anti-slavery bazaars. Child's involvement with the
                     later <title level="m">Liberty Bell</title> includes the stories <title level="a">The Quadroons,</title>
                        <title level="a">Slavery's Pleasant Homes,</title> and <title level="a">The
                        Emancipated Slaveholders,</title> among others. For more on Child's
                     involvement with abolitionist gift-books, see Carolyn Karcher's <title level="m">The First Woman in the Republic</title> (208-9), Valery Levy's

                  familiar components of abolitionist ideology are represented through a range of
                  writing directed at both adult and young readers. Inter-racial desire remained a
                  fixture of Child's fiction throughout her career, and including Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> allowed her to broach the topic amid the storm of
                  racist violence of the 1830s. Child's redacted version reveals the wide scope of
                  Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title>, for while his relationship with
                  Joanna becomes one of the major components of his account, it makes up only forty
                  pages when extracted and reprinted in <title level="m">The Oasis</title>. Although
                  it is by far the largest portion of Child's gift-book, this accounts for a
                  relatively small portion of the sprawling two volume, eight-hundred page original
                  edition of the <title level="m">Narrative</title>. </p>
                  <p>Child's redacted version of the <title level="m">Narrative</title> highlights how
                  emphasizing the positive aspects of Stedman and Joanna's relationship can have a
                  silencing effect of its own. The anti-abolitionist politics of Child's time
                  required a de-emphasis of inter-racial sexuality, resulting in an even further
                  refiguring of Joanna into what Jenny Sharpe identifies as the universal model of
                  womanhood. In trying to use the sexual degradation of women as an argument against
                  slavery, abolitionists sought to extend their contemporaneous culture's
                  conceptions of womanhood across racial lines in an empowering way. The problem of
                  this logic, as Sharpe reminds us, is that “[b]y defining slave women's lives
                  as simply the negation of the domestic happiness that white women enjoyed.... this
                  discourse fails to contend with the kind of domesticity white men established with
                  their concubines in the colonies≵ (85).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Although Sharpe's reservations concerning the unintentional
                     effects of Child's depiction of Joanna are essential for understanding the
                     dangers of focusing on Stedman and Joanna's domesticity, Sharpe is too quick to
                     condemn Child as complicit with the race prejudices of her time. Speaking
                     directly to her period's intense and violent response to inter-racial marriage,
                     Child quips ironically to reassure her readers that “should any
                     fastidious readers be alarmed, I beg leave to assure them that the
                     Abolitionists have no wish to induce any one to marry a mulatto, even should
                     their lives be saved by such an one ten times” (<title level="m">The
                        Oasis</title>, 65). Sharpe represents this chiding comment from a writer who
                     would serially forefront inter-racial marriage as a path to overcoming
                     society's antagonistic relationships as a straight description of her beliefs
                     concerning race and marriage. </note> Working from the editorialized 1796
                  version of the <title level="m">Narrative</title>, Child's version remains true to
                  the text, but furthered Johnson's removal of Stedman's sexual attraction to Joanna
                  and other enslaved women by altering the image of Joanna for her gift-book,
                  covering Joanna's exposed breast.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                     </note> The danger of this change is made clear by Mary Louise Pratt's
                  remark on Stedman's power as a writer, that "the allegory of romantic love
                  mystifies exploitation out of the picture" (97). By emphasizing the domestic
                  relationship between Stedman, Joanna, and Johnny, Child's edition calls attention
                  to an inter-racial marriage while silencing the sexual content of the wider <title level="m">Narrative</title>. Images of torture and bondage that Marcus Wood has
                  read as colonial pornography are shed, leaving an example of inter-racial
                  domesticity that has been modestly clothed.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Marcus Wood considers the pornographic content of the <title level="m">Narrative</title> at length in relation to eighteenth-century ideas of

                  <p>And yet, following Pratt's analysis of mystification, the comparison of these two
                  images of Joanna reveals that a further alteration has been made, the removal from

                     Joanna, and Johnny together accompany the text in both its publication in

                  alone, critics attentive to the silences of exploitation in the eighteenth-century
                  Atlantic may inadvertently have overlooked a domestic connection between Stedman
                  and Joanna that reaches beyond the context of the plantation. Stedman and Joanna's
                  relationship would end like many others did, with Stedman returning to Europe and
                  Joanna remaining in America. Unlike the dénouement of other colonial love stories,
                  Stedman and Joanna's domestic connection would continue as Johnny entered
                  Stedman's European household following his mother's death. </p>
                  <p>Taking up Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> for reasons similar to
                  Lydia Child's, Beryl Gilroy refashioned Stedman and Joanna's relationship to an
                  even greater extent than that which transformed Joanna into an example of
                  universal womanhood in the nineteenth century. Rather than read Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> for the reflection of colonial exploitation and
                  silence, Gilroy emphasizes Stedman and Joanna's love as a condition that shapes
                  Stedman's and his readers' consciousness of slavery. The cover illustration for
                     <title level="m">Stedman and Joanna – A Love in Bondage</title> (1992) provides
                  a good example of the type of re-writing the original undergoes in Gilroy’s

                     </note> Standing side by side, Stedman appears in his Scott's Brigade
                  uniform, while Joanna is posed with one arm wrapped around his waist. The
                  miniature inset in the image’s bottom left corner depicting Joanna and
                  Johnny is emphasized by Stedman's pointing hand. Palm fronds and rope provide the
                  mixed-media background, and Gilroy's dependence on Stedman's private journals and
                  letters is emphasized by the overlaid manuscript writing. Stedman and Joanna's
                  image juxtaposition enacts the same overall effect achieved in Gilroy's rewriting.
                  Stedman retains his significance as a colonial officer, but has been removed from
                  the iconography of colonial domination (Stedman’s figure is cropped from an
                  image in which he stands over the corpse of a maroon rebel). Instead, Gilroy
                  depicts Stedman as an introspective protagonist struggling to come to terms with
                  the ill effects of colonial slavery from well before his deployment until long
                  afterwards. Joanna has been returned to her sexualized state (her breast is again
                  uncovered), but has gained the agency of being a desiring subject herself. She has
                  the ability to touch Stedman sexually, undoing in part the ubiquitous degradation
                  of women under slavery. The sum total of the image shows another way of reading
                  the <title level="m">Narrative</title>, that its sexual content is both
                  exploitative and transgressive. For as much as Gilroy's image manipulation
                  decontextualizes its figures, it also is able to show visually the content of the
                     <title level="m">Narrative</title> that had drawn readers for two centuries.
                  Using their portraits from the original text, the cover depicts Stedman and
                  Joanna's fraught domesticity. </p>
                  <p>In <title level="m">The German Ideology</title>, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels
                  describe the family as the original location for the alienation of labor as
                  private property. Their description is interesting for the imaginative work that
                  it must do as Marx and Engels transplant the family as it existed in the
                  nineteenth century back in time as an original, and eerily timeless, first stage
                  of human social organization. They write: “the first form [of private
                  property and unequal distribution] lies in the family, where wife and children are
                  the slaves of the husband. This latent slavery in the family, though still very
                  crude, is the first property, but even at this early stage it corresponds
                  perfectly to the definition of modern economists who call it the power of
                  disposing of the labour-power of others” (159-60). A few necessary points
                  need to be made. First, in projecting the heterosexual, monogamous, indeed the
                  strangely <emph>nuclear</emph> family structure, Marx and Engels are not
                  describing the early dependence of human society on the power relations contained
                  in the family structure, but rather their own time's simultaneous dependence on
                  the family, <emph>as well as</emph> the dependence on investing that structure
                  with the labels primitive and “natural.” The ideology of the family,
                  then, constructs the family as an incredibly old and unchanging set of
                  relationships capable of replication but not alteration, when in fact it is a
                  series of relationships that are modern, rather than ancient. A second point to
                  note is the reflection of slavery within their description of the family.
                  Acknowledging the power that one form of social organization has to reflect in
                  another is useful for understanding the revolutionary potential of the Stedman
                  household. If Marx and Engels' logic is troublesome because it imagines the
                  growing up of slavery from within the family to a global state of race-based
                  plantation slavery as a modern, “natural” outgrowth of the most
                  intimate human relationships, then Stedman's example shows the opposite potential
                  of the domestic as a way to deny race as the primary feature of his son's
                  identity. Instead of calling backward to make the family into an origin, Stedman
                  recognizes the simultaneity of the family and slavery. The importance of the
                  mixed-race Stedman household stems not from any attempt of Stedman to interfere
                  with the system of slavery, which he did not, but rather emerges from Stedman's
                  refusal to let the relations of colonial slavery dictate his relations of
                  domesticity. </p>
                  <p>Stedman altered the conventions of British society both in his daily life and in
                  his public writings by incorporating new experiences of eighteenth-century life
                  within the familiar narratives of experience. Following his return to Europe,
                  Stedman produced his <title level="m">Narrative</title> for print while keeping a
                  journal that records his exceptional family’s experience in British society.
                  In order to make sense of his time in Surinam, Stedman drew from literary
                  conventions, characters, and narratives to tell his story. His private writings
                  from the same period record his mixed-race, mixed-nationality household from the
                  domestic perspective, depicting both the strained relationship between Stedman's
                  Dutch wife, Adrianna, and Johnny, as well as Stedman’s emphatic inclusion of
                  Johnny within traditional familial relationships. If Stedman
                  “re-wrote” his and Joanna's relationship into the normative codes of
                  domesticity, then his journalistic evidence of an analogous effort to establish
                  Johnny socially within the codes of relation and inheritance tempers the critical
                  assumption that such re-writing is necessarily aligned with a system of colonial
                     domination.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Moreover, Tassie Gwilliam
                     has analyzed a similar "seepage" between Stedman's literary construction of
                     Joanna in terms of sentimentality and the ongoing violence of slavery: "While
                     Stedman intermittently represses the evidence of Joanna's incorporation in
                     slave society in order to define her as an interlude or a relief from torture
                     for the reader and narrator, the seepage from the surrounding text undermines
                     his efforts, and in fact, many of his effects depend precisely on her
                     endangered status. The sentimentalized description of Joanna that Stedman
                     produces, with its dematerialized eroticism, cannot entirely be divorced from
                     the horrifyingly mutilated bodies that people the text" (655).</note>
                  Stedman’s readiness to bend the normative forces of domesticity to include
                  the potential for legitimized inter-racial relationships is a radically
                  destabilizing social scenario. While the racial power dynamics of plantation
                  slavery made Joanna sexually available to Stedman in Surinam, his continual effort
                  to endow their relationship with consent and love in his writings generated
                  cultural tension by denying Joanna's reduction to a sexual commodity. Stedman's
                  “cleaning up” of the sexual relations in the colonial system by
                  scripting them within the codes of the British middle class family is then both at
                  once a problematic erasure of colonial power and a powerful challenge of the
                  homogenous constitution of the nation-state. Stedman's re-writing of Joanna denies
                  her reduction to a sexual commodity, implicitly denying his own association as a
                  white male consumer of subjugated women. The mitigating quality of this particular
                  recorded relationship is that the denial does not transpire in silence as so many
                  others did. </p>
                  <p>At the end the five years expedition, Stedman left Joanna and Johnny in Surinam to
                  return to Europe. In the <title level="m">Narrative</title>, Joanna is depicted as
                  having the agency to decide not to return with Stedman “first from a
                  Consciousness that with propriety she had not the disposal of herself - &amp;
                  Secondly from pride, wishing in her Present Condition Rather to be one of the
                  first amongst her own Class in America, than as she was well Convinced to be the
                  last in Europe at least till such time as fortune should enable me to establish
                  her above dependance” (1988, 603). The only record of Joanna’s choice
                  is inundated with Stedman’s narrative authority, and in itself is at best a
                  compromised version of what grounds their domestic relationship may have entailed.
                  Joanna's choice in this moment signals a much wider comprehension of what her and
                  Stedman's relationship would mean in the wider context of colonization, rather
                  than being limited to the local plantation society. When the <title level="m">Narrative</title> gives Joanna agency, however, it exonerates Stedman of not
                  only his role as a colonial exploiter of women (Joanna's choice of separation is
                  made on other grounds), but also his abandonment. If the Stedman Archive was
                  limited to the core texts, it would be difficult to argue that Stedman has been
                  judged unfairly as a practitioner of the colonial romance and the mystification
                  that authorship has the power to produce over any scene. By reading this moment in
                  the <title level="m">Narrative</title> against the wider collection of journals
                  and textual variation in the archive, it becomes clear that their domestic
                  relationship remained in place even while they were separated by vast geographic
                  distance. Following Joanna's death three years later (reputedly by poisoning),
                  Johnny, who had been manumitted before Stedman’s return, traveled to Europe
                  to live with his father.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Jenny Sharpe
                     offers an interpretation of Johnny’s manumission. Interpreting the
                     alteration between the diary and <title level="m">Narrative</title> version of
                     the events surrounding Joanna’s continued bondage, Johnny’s
                     manumission, and Stedman’s return to Europe, Sharpe observes that
                     Joanna’s agency in the scenario likely opened the way for her son’s
                     freedom as much or more than Stedman’s efforts and finances would allow
                     (75-77).</note> The Stedman family in Europe was then composed of Stedman, his

                  <p>The relationship between Stedman and Joanna evokes the unequal social agencies
                  produced by colonial slavery between white men and women of color. In <title level="m">Ghosts of Slavery</title>, Jenny Sharpe draws on the differences
                  between Stedman’s <title level="m">Narrative</title> and his journal
                  accounts of his time in Surinam to uncover probable moments of agency that Joanna
                  would have had working within the social practice of concubinage in colonial
                  Surinam. In an effort to de-sanctify Stedman’s account of their
                  relationship, Sharpe emphasizes the removal of any mention of monetary exchange
                  from the public telling of their relationship in the <title level="m">Narrative</title>, even though the negotiation of payment is a process
                  recorded in the comparatively private journal entries. While Stedman made this
                  change in an effort to construct his relationship with Joanna outside of the
                  practice of concubinage and within the normalized conceptions of marriage, Sharpe
                  locates Joanna's not-quite-agency not as the decision-making self control of the
                  liberal subject but rather as a generalized social position experienced by women
                  in her position in slave society. Rather than privilege the idea of universal
                  womanhood by which Joanna as an individual transcends the larger degraded
                  experience of slavery, Sharpe finds her silenced choice at the moment when her
                  sexual availability becomes a negotiable social relationship through the practice
                  of contractual prostitution. Joanna’s limited complicity with slave
                  society’s social practices allows her to partially navigate among sexual
                  relationships (being raped, paid, or consenting to concubinage), but Sharpe
                  reminds us that Joanna’s choice does not equate to a resistance, for there
                  was no position for refusal (xvii-xviii).</p>
                  <p>Sharpe argues that Stedman’s <title level="m">Narrative</title> constructs
                  Joanna as an early version of the tragic mulatto figure, fulfilling the social
                  role of wife within the custom of concubinage only until replaced by a white wife
                  in the future. Stedman, notoriously, did precisely this by marrying Adrianna while
                  Joanna was still alive. However, the journal legacy of his later domestic life
                  counters an outright dismissal of Joanna within the narrative and social codes of
                  marriage. The Stedman archive provides a text in which the silence of sexual
                  exploitation is provocatively read, but only with the foreclosure of long-term
                  family relationships. Johnny's inclusion in the multi-national Stedman household
                  reconstitutes the domestic as a location for social change capable of
                  supplementing the prevailing truths of colonial domination.</p>
                  <p>Accounting for Johnny’s continued inclusion in the Stedman family draws
                  attention to the changing social disapprobation of inter-racial relationships in
                  Europe over the longer scale of the archive. While Stedman’s relationship to
                  Johnny is a major focus of the journals, antiquarian Stanbury Thompson
                  editorializes throughout his print edition of these materials to remind the reader
                  of the race difference between them by steadily footnoting Johnny as
                  “quadroon,” and leaving him off Stedman’s family tree at the
                  opening of the book.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example, from
                     Thompson's edition of Stedman's journal: "Francis Gloyns was the tutor of
                     Stedman's quadroon son" (267). To open his discussion of Johnny's death in his
                     biography of Stedman, Thompson begins, "Major John Gabriel Stedman's last
                     letter to his quadroon son Johnny, is well known" (62). Unaware of his ironic
                     reproduction of his own demarcation of Johnny's race, Thompson concludes:
                     “How easy it is to perceive from the above lines, that the quadroon was a
                     victim of slander, calumniation, what we call today, the <emph>colour
                        bar</emph>, or class distinction in a sense. Man is only equal to Man in the
                     eyes of God” (67).</note> Thompson's alterations produce a distinction in
                  the Stedman household based on race, which the journals themselves steadily
                  refute.</p>
                  <p>Taken together, Sharpe and Thompson's usage of the journals illustrate two key
                  interpretive assumptions. First, since the journals are more record-like than the
                     <title level="m">Narrative</title>, they are assumed to contain more truth than
                  Stedman's other writings. Their authenticity becomes revelatory particularly in
                  the case when they record the monetary negotiations of his relationship with
                  Joanna which are entirely written out of the sentimentalized version found in the
                     <title level="m">Narrative</title>. For criticism attentive to this
                  discrepancy, their relationship becomes an exchange of prostitution in the last
                  resort. Extending the emphasis placed on the journal as the record of a hidden,
                  private reality, Stedman's depiction of his relationship with Johnny in the
                  journals should be judged on the same grounds. Second, Thompson's editorialization
                  represents a lingering critical and social uneasiness surrounding Stedman's
                  relationship with both Joanna and Johnny, as well as racial integration in
                  general. Linebaugh and Rediker's uneasy dependence on Stedman's text (Stedman
                  being an enemy of the commons revolution) and Sharpe's adamant emphasis on his
                  complicity with gendered colonial power relations define important ways that
                  Stedman's subject position is shot-through with condemnable affiliations. In spite
                  of this, Stedman's subsequent writings continue to transmit a fundamental
                  disconnection from the colonial dominant subjectivity. Though Johnny's origins are
                  troublesome to contemporary critical assessment, his role within society resulting
                  from his inclusion within the domestic relationships of Stedman's family remains
                  resoundingly opposite to that of the majority of social relations between white
                  male and enslaved females. Rather than accept the convoluted logic of the slave
                  system, Stedman instead chose the domestic as the major narrative for his
                  relationship with his son.</p>
                  <p>Stedman’s journal reveals to us that Johnny’s life was one filled with
                  school, tutors, trips to the local fair, and practical jokes. There is also an
                  unmistakable tension between Johnny and his stepmother, and there are many entries
                  in which Stedman defends Johnny from her anger or sends him out of the house. The
                  following series of relevant entries from 1784 through the New Year narrate the
                  difficult navigation of Johnny’s role in the Stedman family following the
                  birth of Stedman and Adrianna’s first child together: <quote>Nov. 27 My

                  <p>Stedman's journals mix a day to day record of household expenses with short
                  descriptions of the events transpiring in his family's life. This section,
                  narrowed down to a sequence of events that links the birth of Stedman and
                  Adrianna's first child together with a series of painful illnesses, offers a
                  compelling opportunity to speculate on how the material could take shape if it
                  were re-written as narrative in the Stedman Archive. Beryl Gilroy draws from this
                  material twice as she adds Stedman's post-Surinam life as context for her
                  interpretation of his relationship with Joanna, using both Johnny's gift to George
                  and his swallowing of the pin to locate him in the household. Gilroy disassociates
                  the two moments into isolated events, rather than narrate their unfolding as an
                  intertwined sequence of events (171-2). Taken as a linear sequence, these journal
                  entries depict the destabilizing threat that the birth of George represented to
                  Johnny's role in the household. Stedman's first socially legitimized (in wedlock
                  and in race) son arrives to much fanfare. Johnny swallows a large pin, and whether
                  intentionally or not, is forced back into the household's attention, even if it is
                  a negative attention. Johnny's gesture toward George, along with Stedman's
                  insistence on their brotherhood, navigates the domestic crisis; Johnny's gift of
                  money symbolically negates the race relations of the larger capital system,
                  rendering Johnny both a position of agency in economic exchange, and a recognized
                  location within the Stedman household's relations of reproduction.</p>
                  <p>If the Stedman household acted as a space for a different system of relationships
                  than those typically resulting from colonialism, the journals also suggest
                  Stedman's continuing concern over British society's acceptance of racialized
                  violence. Stedman records on Febuary 10th, 1785 that one “Capt. Kenneth
                  Mackenzie [was] reprieved from being hanged, for killing a man on the coast of
                  Africa, by blowing him off from the mouth of a cannon” (<title level="m">Journal</title> 251). Five years later, at fifteen, Johnny went before the
                  mast, making two voyages to the West Indies. During his last (and fifth total)
                  voyage, Johnny died off the coast of Jamaica; the only direct record of Stedman's
                  response remains a letter to his brother, William George, while in Holland.
                  Stedman clearly expected a juridical investigation into Johnny's death:
                  “There being but two men with him at the time, they are, by all, suspected
                  guilty of his death, and now upon their trial in London before Sir Sampson
                  Wright”(Thompson 65). In crafting his biography of Stedman, Thompson
                  researched English court records, but was unable to locate any judicial
                  proceedings in Johnny's case.</p>
                  <p>If Stedman lacked a legal resolution in the death of his son, his <title level="m">Narrative</title> provided him a public forum for representing its meaning.
                  Stedman's journals from the time of this letter are missing, but his effort to
                  memorialize Johnny results in an essential variation between the <title level="m">Narrative</title>'s first edition and the Prices' revised manuscript edition.
                  Critics and readers now encounter Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title>
                  through the Prices' edition, which consistently allows Stedman's original
                  authorial intent to separate himself from prevailing cultural biases toward race
                  and slavery. And yet, by reverting to the 1790 manuscript, the Prices’
                  edition significantly alters the legacy of Johnny Stedman. Johnny's death off the
                  coast of Jamaica was marked in the first print edition by the inclusion of <title level="a">An Elegy on My Sailor</title> as the conclusion of the text.
                  Reverting, in this case, removes an update which likely had Stedman’s
                  support, and which stressed the legacy of race in Stedman’s re-writing of
                  his time in Surinam. In this sense, the Prices’ excellent edition,
                  responsible for recalling Stedman's reputation from the pro-slavery
                  editorialization of the 1796 edition, also edits the legacy of Johnny and the text
                  via the absence of the elegy.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the
                     Prices' discussion of this alteration, see their introduction (lv-lvii). </note>
                     <lb/> While the two endings follow a similar trajectory, the difference between
                  the final images oscillate between a hopeful endorsement of colonial Britain (both
                  in the <emph>1790</emph> manuscript and the Prices' 1988 edition based on the
                  manuscript) and a tragic foreclosure of Stedman's happiness resulting from
                  continued colonial activity (the first and subsequent print editions until 1988).
                  Both endings record the news of Joanna's death by poison, and Johnny's removal to
                  Europe to be with his father. The manuscript account carefully includes Stedman's
                  marriage to Adrianna as a response to this news: “now a young Lady whom I
                  thought nearest Approach'd to her [Joanna] in every Virtue help'd to Support my
                  Grief by becoming my Other Partner.... I Sought no other Fortune &amp; with this
                  Amiable new Companion &amp; my boy, whom she tenderly Loves, I peacably Retired to
                  the Fruitful Country of <emph>devon</emph> in England...” (1988, 625). While
                  Stedman had married Adrianna before this news, his effort to construct the
                  sequence of events according to a proper narrative furthers his project of
                  legitimizing his relationship with Joanna and Johnny within the parameters of
                  traditional domestic relations. Adrianna is directly compared to Joanna in virtue,
                  contrary to Sharpe's description of concubinage as a scenario wherein women of
                  color hold the place which will be occupied by a proper white woman in the future. </p>
                  <p>The manuscript version offers continuity between Stedman's two families, and
                  continues by briefly narrating a scene of domestic bliss in which Johnny is saved
                  by way of his position within the family. Thinking he had already had the
                  smallpox, Johnny gets inoculated with the rest of the family “only to
                  encourage his Brother,” but becomes unexpectedly ill with the rest of the
                  family, having only had the waterpox before. A brief anecdote, Stedman
                  nevertheless uses the concept of inoculation to present Johnny as a fellow
                  sufferer in the family's precautions rather than an “immune”
                  inhabitant of the West Indies. After briefly relating Johnny's later service to
                  “the Kingdom of Great Britain” in the merchant fleet and navy, Stedman
                  closes his manuscript with a depiction of Britain's future: “While, long,
                  long, may you live &amp; be happy in the Bless'd Island, accumulating wealth with
                  honor &amp; Surrounded with victory, till the Lowest subject amongst you shall
                  have Ascended to the highest pinnacle of unfading Glory -- Finis” (1988,
                  626). In relation to the long description of Stedman's own service in the
                  colonies, the insularity of this last line rings at least somewhat ironic.
                  Offering a vision which places the colonial center at the pinnacle of glory,
                  Stedman bases that vision on an advancement of the “lowest subject.”
                  Taking Stedman's own household as the benchmark of this accumulated glory, the
                  colonial power's ascendancy is predicated on Johnny's happy inclusion in the
                  domestic realm. </p>
                  <p>The 1796 edition follows the news of Joanna's death not with a transition to
                  Stedman's integrated family, but instead turns quickly to Johnny's death and
                  elegy. The exclusion of social integration serves to demarcate Johnny firmly
                  within the realm of the colonial periphery, rather than acknowledge his position
                  within British society or the domestic sphere. Yet while the conservative first
                  edition forecloses both the acknowledgment and acceptance of Johnny within British
                  society, it also emphasizes the importance of Stedman's relationship to his son
                  and Joanna. Markedly, the elegy allows Stedman to describe the domestic unity with
                  Joanna displaced by his return to Europe:<quote>

                  <p>The departed Johnny's body, poetically praised for its "blooming age" and
                  "olive-beauty," offsets the two lines containing the "rage" of the ocean and the
                  "scorn" of European racial biases. The evidence for Stedman's alternate
                  understanding of the world – a different sort of "optics" in the poem's
                  terminology -- is contained in the poem's logical inversion of the colonizers as
                  "European slaves." In 1792, at the time of his son's death, Stedman viewed the
                  world quite differently than the way enshrined in the ending of the 1790
                  manuscript. </p>
                  <p>The belief that Stedman had found a space for Johnny within British society at the
                  apex of colonialism is displaced by the material (and racial) poetics of the
                  elegy. He could look at his son and see both himself and the "sterling" worth of
                  life that the economic drive to accumulate guineas made invisible. The elegy
                  concludes with an image that completes the exclusion of Stedman's Surinam family
                  from the domestic space of the British nation, but in so doing emphasizes the
                     <title level="m">Narrative</title>'s purpose in describing the familial-social
                  aspect of his time in Surinam:<quote>

                     </quote> Rather than the long-term accumulation of wealth, Stedman's 1796
                  ending subverts his return to Europe by imagining the heavenly reunion with Joanna
                  and Johnny. The foreclosure of racial mixture within British society is only
                  enacted through the emphatic presentation of Stedman's inter-racial family in
                  heaven, and the erasure of Adrianna and the other children from the account.</p>
                  <p>Though Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> reached a wide audience,
                  appearing in multiple editions and languages, the revolutionary domestic
                  relationship between Stedman and his son found another, spontaneous vector of
                  dissemination among the larger culture. Forms of popular publication including
                  periodicals and epistolary sample books gave Stedman’s writings a perpetual
                  access to the household ramparts of British middle-class ideology. Stedman
                  composed a letter to his son intending it as a portion of Johnny’s
                  inheritance to be delivered after the elder Stedman's death. A journal entry from
                  January 14, 1787 reports that Stedman showed the letter to Johnny once, before
                  sealing it up with several important documents, including Johnny’s
                  manumission certificate, baptism record, and other legal detritus from the Surinam
                  court. Following Johnny's death off the coast of Jamaica, this letter found its
                  way into print, receiving sustained republication (sometimes sourced, other times
                  not) as an example of the highest sentiment of the father-son relationship. </p>
                  <p>For the many editors of the various publications which reprinted Stedman’s
                  letter to Johnny as an example of the epistolary art, the prevailing trend was to
                  reprint it without too much bother about either the stability of the text or its
                  original context. While these eighteenth and nineteenth-century editors typically
                  maintain Stedman's name, the re-printings (other than <title level="j">The Weekly
                     Entertainer</title>) lack any mention of a race context, and instead slip into
                  the naturalizing assumption that the sentiment of the father-son relationship on
                  display is as socially typical as it is well expressed. By this assumption, the
                  colonial context of Stedman and Johnny’s relationship is forgotten,
                  consummating the inclusion of the legacy of colonial race relations within the
                  domestic codes of British middle-class ideology. While the meaning of race for the
                  readers of this letter is not directly challenged, this nevertheless represents
                  how an unmarked and subtle counter-example to the hegemony of an assumed British
                  homogeneity came to be absorbed within the boundaries of normalcy.</p>
                  <p>The letter reached print twice before coming to Stedman’s attention. The
                  first printing, in <title level="j">Gentleman’s Magazine</title> (Sept 1793)
                  is typical of later printings; the brief introduction lacks any specification of
                  race, focusing instead on the context of Stedman’s military gentility and
                  recovery from illness. (Many subsequent letters would get even this fact wrong,
                  presuming Stedman to have died before his son, further naturalizing the letter
                  into presumptions about genealogy and descent.) The publishing history of the
                  letter continues in <title level="j">The Weekly Entertainer</title>, the only
                  printing accompanied by an introduction from Johnny’s tutor which
                  specifically polices race by marking Stedman’s son as “mulatto.”
                  By 1796, the letter appeared three more times, in <title level="j">The
                     Correspondent</title> as a reprint from <title level="j">The European
                     Magazine</title> (April, 1795), and also in <title level="j">Town and Country
                     Magazine</title> (July 1795). Following this spate of publication, the letter
                  circulates well into the nineteenth century, appearing in the <title level="j">Journal of Health Conducted by an Association of Physicians</title> (Feb
                  1833), the <title level="j">Parlor Letter Writer, and Secretary’s
                     Assistant</title> (1845), and the <title level="j">American Fashionable Letter
                     Writer</title> as late as 1850. These many printings attest to the popularity
                  of the letter’s sentiment, and unlike the legal documents of emancipation it
                  was once sealed with, Stedman’s letter records and transmits a version of
                  history that willingly inverts and forgets the racial hierarchies of his time. The
                  letter took on a life of its own, but it also marks a propagation of sentiment
                  between Stedman and his son. </p>
                  <p>Knowing the historical specificity of the circumstances of its composition allows
                  current readers to understand the truly provocative nature of the letter, and the
                  extent to which Stedman’s writing inverts the hierarchies of racism within
                  its message. Stedman implores Johnny: “love Mrs. Stedman [his step-mother]
                  and her little children from your heart… thou are a brother to her helpless little
                  ones”. The letter imagines a unity of Stedman’s British household on
                  earth, but the story is different in heaven, recalling the elegy's ending of the
                     <emph>1796</emph> edition. Stedman writes that he and Johnny might,
                  “together with your beloved Mother my Dear Johanna - have a chance once more
                  to meet where in the presence of our Heavenly Benefactor - our Joy - and Happiness
                  shall be Eternal and Compleat” (January 14, 1787). Stedman’s heavenly
                  family, then, is once again his Surinam family. Without the colonial specificity,
                  this sentiment of reunion operates within the context of a heavenly reward, and
                  within the traditional narrative structures of the domestic sphere.
                  Stedman’s imaginative effort to value his relationship with Joanna inverts
                  the hierarchies of race on which his contemporary world depended. This sentiment
                  disseminated throughout culture at large, spreading the inversion of black and
                  white wives to an unknowingly accepting public. </p>

                  <p>Stedman's pen sent the message that he considered his relationships with Joanna
                  and Johnny to be equitable and meaningful within the social patterns of his
                  contemporaneous culture. Whether through editorial distortion, free appropriation
                  to other ends, or strategic re-tellings, Stedman's record of inter-racial
                  relationships has proven invaluable to studies of colonialism. The line between
                  public and private writing has dimmed as authors and critics return to previously
                  unpublished material for analysis, but the archive itself illustrates that the
                  instability of authorial intent is a vital characteristic of circulating
                  knowledge. Stedman's influence on Blake does more than connect the legacy of Akan
                  speaking peoples of Africa to a radical poetics distributed to British culture.
                  Tracking the circulation of revolutionary ideas fundamentally destabilizes
                  authorship, and the notions of identity and ownership associated with it. Between
                  Stedman, Blake, the sundry editors who either mediated or appropriated Stedman's
                  writings over more than two centuries, critics, and contemporary writers who
                  re-tell his story, treating Stedman as the sole authorial agency at work in
                  constructing the material in the archive would be to ignore the web of social
                  connections also at work contributing to the text's meaning over time. </p>
                  <p>Many agencies have supported the distribution of Stedman's writings, with various
                  ideological reasons for doing so. The original imperialist perspective of an
                  account of life in the colonies (emphasized by Johnson in the first edition) is
                  never isolated from the domestic sentiment of the archive highlighted by the
                  fashionable magazines, nor from the nineteenth-century abolitionist attraction to
                  Joanna's domesticity in Lydia Maria Child's re-production of the family elements
                  of the <title level="m">Narrative</title> in her gift-book <title level="m">The
                     Oasis</title>, nor Beryl Gilroy's post-colonial incorporation of Stedman's
                  early and later life in her retelling of their story in <title level="m">Stedman
                     and Joanna - A Love in Bondage</title>. </p>
                  <p>As a publicly traded (and supplemented or de-historicized) text, the Stedman
                  archive brings to attention the transformation of Stedman from author to
                  character. Deidre Lynch's <title level="m">The Economy of Character</title>
                  identifies fictions of social circulation as a key component of mass British
                  culture's literary self-fashioning in the eighteenth century. From the familiar
                  narratives of items (most often money) circulating in society and tales of social
                  pretension such as Henry Fielding's <title level="m">Tom Jones</title> or Tobias
                  Smollett's <title level="m">Roderick Random</title>, Lynch identifies the key
                  binary between sameness and singularity underlying the social function offered by
                  fictions of circulation. The difference of character is between the uniqueness of
                  the “bland handsomeness” of the generalized, exchangeable gentleman
                  (even on the face of the coin) and the uniqueness of everyone else. Marking both
                  the “high” and the “low” of society, the difference
                  “between those qualified to observe and those who are objects of others'
                  observation” in these stories of circulation, Lynch's critique of character
                  identifies the social use such narratives had for rendering society as an
                  economically comprehensible whole (82). Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title>, and hence the archive, begins with a determined
                  self-fashioning by way of direct references to Jones and Random. If these
                  characters allude to the cultural picaresque narrative which Lynch describes as
                  the accumulation of experience in preparation for the attainment of the privileged
                  social position of the gentleman, they also mark Stedman's own incomplete
                  inhabitation of the dominant male-imperial perspective. Unlike Jones and Random,
                  Stedman does not only accumulate social experience or wealth, he accumulates
                  intimate domestic relationships. As a result, the Stedman archive represents an
                  effort to define character at odds with the logics of capital exchange – a
                  character that circulates, rather than accumulates, knowledge.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The other dominant allusion in Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> is the tale of Inkle and Yarico. This story
                     depicts an early explorer's treachery toward a native woman. Having married her
                     during a lengthy ship-wreck, Inkle sells Yarico and their unborn child into
                     slavery after their rescue and return to Barbados (British territory). Werner
                     Sollors summarizes the account as a “brief and simple moral tale
                     represent[ing] slavery as the betrayal of a beloved, combining a mild
                     antislavery sentiment with a critique of the merchant as a type” (195).
                     Sollors also describes the literary genealogy of the tale from Richard Steele's
                        <title level="j">Spectator</title> version (March 13, 1711) through
                     Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title> and subsequently the logic of the
                     “tragic mulatto” that emerged in the writing of Lydia Maria Child
                     in dialogue with William Wells Brown's novel <title level="m">Clotel; or the
                        President's Daughter</title> (1853). Beryl Gilroy also re-wrote <title level="m">Inkle and Yarico</title>. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Standing at the edge of his own transmogrification from an author to a character,
                  Stedman defines himself through the complex idea of singularity. Singularity is
                  unlike the uniqueness deployed in Lynch's analysis. For her model, uniqueness
                  polices the boundary between the category of the exchangeable, bland
                  gentleman-observer who does not bear the weight of having a distinct identity (and
                  therefore being unmarked as an “other” from the colonial perspective)
                  and everyone else who has been isolated from power by their uniqueness not as a
                  category, but as a subject of the capitalist-male-imperial-gaze. Stedman's
                  singularity is not an isolating adjective, though it is limiting. The phrase
                  “studying to be singular” originates in Stedman’s journal entry
                  from November 29, 1785. The Prices use Stedman’s phrase in their
                  introduction when introducing his character, and focus on the portion of the entry
                  that is self-reflective. The following is the whole entry, produced as a
                  conglomeration of the original format and spelling of the diary, and the
                  Prices’ {entry}, whose glosses appear in [brackets]: <quote>I again dine

                  singularity is, in the Prices’ quote, a method by which Stedman has
                  recursively become known and accepted by various cultural groups, in spite of his
                  initial strangeness. The context for this process is also important. The everyday
                  matter which precedes Stedman’s contemplation is typical for other entries
                  in the journal, insomuch as they record day to day events and accounting tables.
                  Whatever caused Stedman to record this reflection, whether linked to his visits or
                  letter writing or no, is not specified. Importantly, though, his thoughts on
                  “being singular” are not limited to his own character, but also extend
                  to his family. The four people mentioned are Stedman and Adrianna, his second son,
                  George William, and Johnny. The final line completes the thought; Stedman’s
                  family have been in Devonshire for nearly a year, and have grown used to their
                  English neighbors. Presumably, the mased, or confused, perception of the Stedmans
                  is wearing off.</p>
                  <p>According to Samuel Johnson’s dictionary from 1785, there were two main
                  meanings of “singular” in common use when describing a person’s
                  character or an event. While in a strict sense singular can mean "Alone; that of
                  which there is but one," this falls short of the way in which Stedman uses the
                  term. The second definition in use is more apt: "Having something not common to
                  others.” Johnson’s definition goes further to say that singular
                  “is commonly used in a sense of disapprobation, whether applied to persons
                  or things,” yet also provides a usage example from the Archbishop John
                  Tillotson contradictory to this assertion: “It is very commendable to be
                  singular in any excellency, and religion is the greatest excellency: to be
                  singular in any thing that is wise and worthy is not a disparagement, but a
                  praise.” Being singular, then, is a way to name a certain deviation from
                  what is expected as normal. As a marker of behavior or thinking that is atypical
                  of a prevailing expectation of eighteenth-century colonial ideology, being
                  singular is officially inflected as a negative appellation, yet qualified in
                  certain cases that are deemed “wise and worthy.” Perhaps the most
                  startling revelation of this thought is the alteration of the notion of the
                  “common.” Rather than reference the system of social organization by
                  which a group of people share either material or land wealth, or even band
                  together in common for political protection as is the case for Lockeian notions of
                  private property protected through social association, the common has already at
                  this early stage stabilized linguistically as commonly held perceptions of the
                  world, including commonly held notions of race. </p>
                  <p>Stedman’s singularity is not a case of exerting his unique personality as an
                  individual, but rather is a technique that willingly asserts that things marked as
                  socially disreputable can be reinvested with a positive regard. Both in his <title level="m">Narrative</title> manuscript and elsewhere in his writings, Stedman
                  conjures the title characters of Henry Fielding’s <title level="m">Tom
                     Jones</title> and Tobias Smollet’s <title level="m">Roderick
                     Random</title> as models for his own behavior. By studying other
                  “singular” characters, Stedman illustrates the reproducibility of his
                  own particular world view as well as the potential of published material to spread
                  ideas. Stedman employs them as examples that foreground his own rewriting of his
                  colonial experience. While being singular often manifests as a sexual
                  licentiousness with women of all races, or the propensity to get drunk and
                  fistfight, Stedman also is “singular” in more ways than those which
                  re-value rowdy behavior. Whereas Roderick Random, for example, will eventually
                  rely on the rags-to-riches narrative when his long lost father re-enters his life
                  with a fortune made via colonial slavery, Stedman instead uses his singular
                  character to exceed the normal forms of colonial relations. In numerous instances,
                  Stedman engages with enslaved members of Surinam society on equal footing. He
                  takes their advice on how to survive and prevent the diseases which devastate the
                  other colonial troops, settles disputes with those under his military command on
                  equal footing with his white subordinates, and eventually uses his singularity of
                  character to stabilize the atypical makeup of his family in later life. </p>
                  <p>By linking his own character with Roderick Random and Tom Jones, Stedman also
                  intended to recode their characters within his own project of revaluing race and
                  familial relationships in his <title level="m">Narrative</title>. Stedman relates
                  how many of his messmates rebuke him for his attempt to secure the freedom of his
                  son, Johnny: “Do as we do / say’d they / Stedman and never fear, if
                  our Children are Slaves they are provided for, and if they die… may they be
                  damn’d into the bargain, thus keep your Sighs in your Belly, and your Money
                  in your Pocket my Boy” (1988 289). Stedman is incensed at this sentiment,
                  and accordingly relates a sympathetic, non-military audience shortly thereafter. A
                  few days pass, wherein Stedman gains the assurance of assistance in buying
                  Johnny's manumission from Mr. De Graav, who attains guardianship over the
                  plantation held in absentee which claimed both Joanna and Johnny. Stedman relates
                  that: <quote>The weight of a Millstone was removed from my labouring breast… Soon
                     after this I was surrounded by several Gentlemen, and Ladies, / to whom my
                     friend had Communicated this very romantic adventure/ Some of whom pleased to
                     Call me <title level="m">Tom Jones</title>, and the others <title level="m">Roderick Random</title>-They all congratulated me on my Sensibility, and my
                     having met with so valuable an Acquaintance, all seem'd to partake in the
                     pleasure that I now felt. (1988 291) </quote> In the edited first edition of
                  1796, the passage remains, but the literary allusion is expunged. Stedman’s
                  original choice to anchor this event around popular literary characters indicates
                  the extent to which literary production could spread such atypical and incendiary
                  stances. By associating Jones and Random to the sentiment generated by the promise
                  of attaining freedom for his son, Stedman’s rhetorical strategy attempts to
                  generate an audience both in his text and in the larger literary print sphere. By
                  removing the reference to Jones and Random, the editor of the 1796 edition
                  isolated Stedman’s sentiments in his own text. Yet within the <title level="m">Narrative</title>, this instance nevertheless produces the re-coding
                  of literary techniques- adventure and romance - across cultural lines of taboo,
                  extending the approval of the “gentlemen and ladies” of polite society
                  to the circumstances of his inter-racial relationship. If the removal of such
                  references to popular literary characters stymied the connections Stedman tried to
                  construct between his own singular experience and the larger cultural examples
                  available in the print sphere, other forms of popular publication such as
                  periodicals and epistolary sample books gave Stedman’s writings a perpetual
                  access to the household ramparts of British middle-class ideology. </p>
                  <p>The reproducibility of Stedman as a character in the larger archive maintains an
                  important symbolic link to the revolutionary domestic space that the Stedman
                  household created in British society. While each retelling of the story resurrects
                  his character in the hands of a new author, the likeness of character between
                  Stedman and Johnny exemplifies the concept of singularity. Quite aside from the
                  confusion of having two “characters” with the same name, the
                  reproduction of the father in the son becomes the condition by which Stedman is
                  lastingly disassociated from the colonial perspective while in Surinam and onward
                  for the remainder of his life. The domestic is no longer the space for the
                  continuance of Marx and Engels' understanding of slavery (through gender, race, or
                  class) but rather becomes the space through which the father is re-produced as a
                  singular subject alongside of and in relation to people alive in the Atlantic
                  world. </p>

                  <title level="m">The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave, Related by
                  Herself</title> is a particularly slippery narrative. Published in 1831, it
               appeared well after the 1807 Act of Parliament that had abolished the slave trade,
               but just two years before the Crown’s 1833 Emancipation Bill.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The British Abolition of Slave Trade Act of 1807
                  finally achieved this result.</note> The later document legally freed slaves in
               British colonies, and few doubt the place of Prince’s <title level="m">History</title> in the mounting storm of anti-slavery voices that swayed the
               necessary popular sentiment for the bill’s passage. But questions of authorship
               and veracity trouble this text.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Historically,
                  slave narratives did not enjoy widespread or easy credibility, and debates over
                  their veracity continue to find voice today. Prince’s contested narrative
                  follows those such as Olaudah Equiano and Phyllis Wheatley among others, which
                  were also produced with various paratextual materials so as to validate their
                  authenticity, often coming with oaths and affirmations of truth from established
                  white abolitionist subjects. In addition, unlike the work of Equiano or Wheatley,
                  Prince’s narrative is not self-penned, which has only added to the
                  controversy surrounding this particular document.</note> Critics recognize that
               Prince’s <title level="m">History</title> is a highly mediated document,
               involving the Quaker Susanna Strickland Moodie, who was Prince’s amanuensis,
               and the abolitionist Thomas Pringle, whose notably anxious prefatory remarks disavow
               any biased editorial work.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For both British

               multigeneric qualities add to these questions of authenticity. Indeed, the work
               contains many tropes common to early-nineteenth-century slave narratives: an almost
               epic catalogue of physical, sexual, and mental violations; scenes of forced,
               degrading, and painful familial separation; accounts of “going from one butcher
               to another” when being sold and passed on to new slave owners; and apostrophic
               appeals given up to a Christian deity that both establish the speaker as righteous
               and call attention to the contrastingly “ungodly” acts perpetrated by
               masters, overseers, and plantocrats alike (71-2).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Prince, <title level="m">The History of Mary Prince, A West

               essay seeks to move beyond regarding this text as a record of the horrific realties
               of the institution of slavery in some abstract sense. Instead, it turns to the
               material and metaphoric significance of salt in Prince’s autobiography in order
               to recover a lost history of the Caribbean slave economy and to recognize types of
               rhetorical and artistic nuance overlooked in critical discussions about slave
               narratives.</p>
               <p>A focus on salt allows us to see in more complicated ways how the narrative of Mary
               Prince figures in the popular imagination, especially when considering the ways in
               which histories of Caribbean slave economies have been and continue to be influenced
               by academic scholarship on the Caribbean, the Americas, and the British Empire.
               Prince’s account of slavery in the Bermudan salt flats bespeaks a commercial
               diversity not often acknowledged in scholarly accounts of slave economies. Current
               critical dialogues seem to have let our Romantic predecessors set the boundaries of
               our considerations of the Caribbean and, like Coleridge, Shelley, or William Fox, we
               tend to speak widely about sugar and tobacco, two generally expendable or superfluous
               goods, and grant little attention to more essential consumables harvested by enslaved
               laborers. This concentration on the sweet or smoky has occluded the Caribbean salt
               industry’s material significance and covered over this particular slave
               commodity. Further, buttressing the vast amount of scholarship on the historical
               significance of luxury consumables which could easily impede international or
               regional revenue streams if boycotted, this paper brings to light the unacknowledged
               history of Caribbean salt raking relative to not only British colonial economies and
               politics, but also to the revolutionary history of the United States, in which it
               plays a pivotal role. </p>
               <p>Prince’s narrative attests to the importance of salt, a central product of
               slave labor in the British-held West Indies. Although its overall value is largely
               ignored in literary scholarship, harvesting salt proved harmful enough to inspire
               Prince’s rendition of a horrific <emph>contortion of being</emph>. Her repeated
               detrimental exposure to salt transforms Prince’s body, consciousness, and
               ultimately, of course, her narrative — making it tantamount to a material
               history and psychological case study of a forced merger of landscape, labor, body,
               and mind. Prince’s text records how lethal amounts of salt seep through the
               skin, forging a visceral, literal, and grotesque union between salt, the commodified
               substance, and the slave, the commodified worker.</p>
               <p>William Fox’s <title level="a">An Address to the People of Great Britain, on
                  the Utility of Refraining from the Use of West India Sugar and Rum</title>
               exemplifies the general scope and reach of British abolitionist rhetoric, which was
               often linked only to the sugar trade. He describes the West Indies as “a world
               of groans, tears and blood, where the body is externalized, turned into the
               environment in which it is tortured” (131). For transatlantic slavery
               economies, it is precisely the salt marshes of the West Indies where such a
               transformation was possible; where the body is beyond a doubt
               “externalized” in the manner Fox mentions above as it blends and
               metamorphosizes into a state of dreadful hypersalinity, increasingly absorbing and
               resembling the salt-drenched landscape within which it labors. Critic Timothy Morton
               cites Fox’s speech in his wonderful collection <title level="m">Radical
                  Food</title>, but in keeping with contemporary discourse on slavery and British
               colonial commodities he applies the statement to sugar only, though it can also offer
               a point of origin for the complex array of Caribbean slave commodities, both
               excessive and essential (6-7, 13).</p>
               <p>In his influential exploration of what he identifies as the Blood Sugar topos, Morton
               explains how British subjects wrote, read, and parodied an association between the
               sugar in their tea and the blood of the slaves forced to harvest it, linking notions
               of guilt and shame to the consumption of sugar obtained from the West Indies.
               Building upon the ways that Morton catalogues the various cash crops produced by
               British holdings in the Caribbean, I would add to this list the interim period when
               Turks Island functioned as a source of salt, not a luxury good but a survival
               commodity. By providing a necessary substance and sacrificing their lives in the salt
               ponds, these enslaved subjects preserved the colonies by preserving the
               colonists’ food.</p>
               <p>Tellingly, salt does not meet the criterion of superfluousness that foments a
               sentiment of shameful consumption back in England and drives Romantic authors to
               decry slavery in droves. Morton’s project reminds us of the type of
               self-righteous remarks Coleridge integrates into his lectures against slavery, which
               are as follows:<quote> Surely if the inspired Philanthropist of Galilee were to
                  revisit earth and be among the feasters as at Cana he would not change Water into
                  Wine but haply convert the produce into the things producing, the occasioned into
                  the things occasioning! Then with our fleshly eye should we behold what even now
                  truth-painting Imagination should exhibit to us – instead of sweetmeats Tears and
                  Blood, and Anguish – and instead of Music groaning and the loud Peals of the Lash.
                  (13-4)</quote> Coleridge’s critique depends upon not just Christian notions
               of transubstantiation. It also turns upon the ironic fluctuations coursing between
               his depiction of the horrifying affect generated by the suggestion of the slave body
               “groaning” under the “loud Peals of the Lash” and the
               celebratory sensations registered by the “feasters” of opulent and
               inessential “sweetmeats.” But the slave-based economy was more diverse
               than this, as the salt trade demonstrates. The Blood Sugar discourse never broadly
               acknowledges colonial profiteering reaped by the salt trade and includes only the
               most easily expendable of slave commodities; however, keeping this in mind, it is
               also important to consider how it would be difficult, if not unjust on various
               levels, to shame someone for consuming an item essential to life. In addition, the
               boycott of any luxury good engendered great economic consequences within the whole of
               the slave trade, bringing in larger tax revenues per item than common goods like
               salt. </p>
               <p>Further complicating the history of this discourse, Prince repeatedly refers to the
               “sweetness” of freedom in her text, but the fact that she works in the
               salt flats instead of sugarcane fields problematizes the textual figuration of the
               “image of sugar-as-revolution, of rebellion-as-sweet, which holds these two
               meanings so delicately in (dis)solution” (Morton 102).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Morton, Timothy, <title level="a">Blood Sugar,</title>
                     <title level="m">Romanticism and Colonialism: Writing and Empire,
                     1780-1830</title>, eds. Tim Fulford and Peter J. Kitson (Cambridge: Cambridge
                  UP, 1998) 87-106.</note> Pertaining to the sugar trade, the association between
               sweetness and freedom hybridizes the qualities of the sugar trade and of sugar the
               commodity: sugar signifies the pain and harm slavery incurs, while standing as a
               celebrated consumable with a taste so palatable that it can represent slavery’s
               opposite, freedom. In contrast, sweetness for Prince is only ever the antithesis of
               salt; salt is not her preservation. Her slave status denies her even the dietary
               benefits salt yields for those classed high enough to consume salt-preserved meat.
               For her corn-fed and meat-deprived existence, salt only and exclusively helps others
               such as the American revolutionaries, whose support of economic and political
               independence figures conversely to her imprisonment. As she concludes her history,
               Prince repeats one of her main claims: “All slaves want to be free—to be
               free is very sweet” (85, 93). Although Prince was born in Brackish Pond,
               Bermuda, a site named after the intersection between salt water and fresh water, her
               text displays not one kind word devoted to the world of the savory; there is no such
               salient, silver-lined nostalgia or ironic wordplay attributed to salt. She goes on
               record as contrasting, insisting, repeating that “to be free is very
               sweet.” Unlike the Blood Sugar topos, which allowed literary giants to dabble
               in its ironic aesthetic, Prince’s daily encounters and direct material
               relationship with the savory commodity that is salt drive the ironic inflections
               embedded in her allusions to human liberty rendered “sweet.”</p>
               <p>Salt is the linguistic linchpin of Prince’s narrative just as it was the
               all-consuming force behind her existence on Turks Island. Thus, salt offers a poetic
               as well as material significance to Caribbean history. According to figures compiled
               by the National Museum on Turks Island, salt production began in the Bermudas by
               default. At the close of the seventeenth century, the greater expanses of the North
               American mainland dwarfed Bermuda’s tobacco output, so Bermuda needed
               “another export, and they found it in salt production on Grand Turk
               Island” (3).<note place="foot" resp="editors">

               the salt trade was the foundation of the island’s economy (2). By the time of
               the American Revolution, the colonies on the North American mainland had greatly
               increased the demand for salt. At this point maritime law decreed that any
               “American vessel carrying salt was automatically subject to seizure,” but
               Bermuda “was at the same time dependent on the mainland for survival and so
               continued an illegal trade with the colonies” (10). During the period when
               European North America stretched from the Atlantic coast to the Appalachians,
               mainland salt sources were scarce. Merchants had to turn to Europe and the West
               Indies for salt, and Grand Turk and Salt Cay in fact provided roughly one-sixth of
               the salt British North Americans consumed before the American Revolution (15). Museum
               sources trumpet the point that “salt imports [were] vital to the success of the
               American Revolution and [that] the United States was dependent upon the salt imports
               . . . until almost the end of the nineteenth century” (16). </p>
               <p>Unlike most historical surveys produced today that focus almost exclusively on the
               Bermudan sugar trade, various historical texts from the colonial period evidence the
               Bermudan salt works, and the impact of its respective slave economy. A chronicle
               entitled <title level="a">Salt</title> from John Holroyd, the Earl of
               Sheffield’s 1783 <title level="m">Observations on the Commerce of the American
                  States with Europe and the West Indies</title>, confirms the Turks and Caicos
               National Museum’s claims in the following remarks: <quote>A great part of the
                  salt consumed in the American States especially for butter and pork, was imported
                  from the salt islands in the West Indies; but the planters had no concern with it;
                  it was no production of their labor, but of the heat of the sun, was collected by
                  the Bermudans, and sold at a low price to the ships from the continent.
                  (25)</quote> The Earl of Sheffield not only documents the large amount of salt
               North American colonists demanded, but further displays the commodity as a source of
               easy profit for entrepreneurial British colonials. This passage also reveals the
               labor stratification involved in salt production, which relied on
               “Bermudan” labor, or, in other words, slave labor that would in time
               evolve into wage-slave labor. Adding greater detail, in the 1796 publication, <title level="m">An Historical, Geographical, Commercial, and Philosophical View of the
                  United States of America, and of the European Settlements in America and the
                  West-Indies</title>, William Winterbotham records Bermudan migratory labor
               practices, marking a seasonal influx of three to four hundred men who would leave
               Bermuda proper to rake salt on Turks Island. Winterbotham relates how the salt
               garnered from such projects was later “carried to America for provisions”
               (290). Additional evidence of an early North American dependence upon West Indian
               salt exists in the vast annals of George Washington’s letters. In various
               epistles Washington discusses Bermudan imports essential to pre- and
               post-revolutionary America, and in a letter drafted in 1779 he directly refers to the
               exchange of American-made flour for salt procured from the Bermudan Isles (436).</p>
               <p>These historical documents evidence the foundational trade relationship that bound
               the North American colonists to West Indian salt colonies; however, the scant amount
               of extant scholarship that touches upon this economic relationship presents almost no
               information covering the excruciating day-to-day realities involved in the processes
               of salt production. Even though the Turks and Caicos Islands’ Museum offers a
               nod to the salt industry and its legacy as a slave economy, it nevertheless
               replicates the popular focus on the sugar trade, providing just one brief paragraph
               detailing salt raking as “brutal labor,” and a few asides addressing how
               no colonists or planters would trouble themselves with the harsh business of
               harvesting salt from the ponds of Turks Island or Salt Cay. The Museum’s
               literature does, however, explain how standing in “brine all day or walking
               barefoot over chunks of salt crystal made the work drudgery. Cuts failed to heal and
               boils developed on skin constantly exposed to brine. The bright sun reflecting off
               salt water, white sand, and salt crystals contributed to the onset of
               blindness” (12). More nuanced and complete renderings of such labor-induced
               deformations do not exist in the archival depositories or in the holdings of the
               Turks and Caicos National Museum, but they frequently emerge in Prince’s
               narrative.</p>
               <p>Prince allows us to bridge a gap in our understanding of the history of salt
               production even though, as Moira Ferguson rightly notes, the Bermudan salt industry
               was in decline by the time Prince became involved in it (8). Prince’s
               experience in the salt ponds provides her the means to display the material horrors
               of this specific mode of slave labor, and also enables her to create a personal
               metaphor or trope for the moral corruption that slavery was spreading well beyond the
               salt works of Turks Island. On a material level, American revolutionaries either had
               no access to or had to turn their backs on British imports, making them dependent
               upon the salt harvested in the brackish Bermuda. This made salt mining on Turks
               Island as lucrative as it was inhumane, and in various passages Prince strives to
               unveil the atrocities salt imposes on the bodies forced to rake it. Ultimately,
               Prince molds her many references to the salt industry of Turks Island into a
               compelling trope, grafting her figurations of a body and mind transformed by labor
               onto narratives of a British body politic and its ideological claims that purport to
               be working for freedom. Further, Prince’s testimony acknowledges how even
               though the enslaved salt rakers had to dedicate the majority of any twenty-four hour
               day to laboring in the salt flats, these were not the only moments in which slaves on
               Turks Island were dosed with deadly amounts of salt.</p>
               <p>Prince describes a typical day of salt raking as one beginning at 4 a.m. with labor
               continuing until dark, interrupted solely by rushed breaks—the only point at
               which she could eat (71). She explains that she stood “up to (her) knees in the
               water” and because they “worked through the heat of the day ... salt
               blisters [formed] in those parts [of the body] which were not completely
               covered” (71-2). Speaking for herself and other members of this enslaved
               population, she recounts how “[o]ur feet and legs, from standing in salt water
               for so many hours, soon became full of dreadful boils, which eat down in some cases
               to the very bone” (72). Thus pickled, they would return to the salt ponds every
               day except for Sunday. “On Sundays,” she narrates, “we went into
               the bush and cut the long soft grass, of which we made trusses for our legs and feet
               to rest upon, for they were so full of salt boils that we could get no rest lying
               upon the bare boards” (72). Even her supposed day of rest is spent in reaction
               to the salt she would otherwise be laboring to produce. It cannot be overemphasized
               that upon Prince’s arrival at Turks Island, nearly every moment of her waking
               life centered on salt. Compounding the extent to which salt eats away at the majority
               of Prince’s wakeful hours spent on Turks Island, the bodily wounds she incurs
               from salt mining prohibited even the prospect of healing sleep.</p>
               <p>Alongside Prince’s gruesome catalogue, spawned out of an almost ubiquitous
               physical presence of and proximity to salt, are the seemingly unconscious references
               to a salt-based existence that penetrates much more than her flesh. Sodium chloride
               invades her being and narrative like a virus. On a level far beyond the possible
               morphology or contortion of being perpetrated by any number of inhumane slave labor
               practices embedded within Caribbean or North American mainland sugar production
               processes, salt laborers are consumed by the commodity they labor to produce; as the
               salt wounds fester, deepen, and increasingly mutate the body, these laborers become
               hypersalinated humans, undergoing a cruel sea change, mentally as well as physically.
               Not only does salt become the crux of Prince’s existence on Turks
               Island—she is literally a slave to salt and rarely allowed to pursue anything
               outside fostering its production—but, additionally, she frames her existence
               through the lens of salt. </p>
               <p>Discussions of various moments throughout her life often disclose how this decade as
               a salt laborer marks her psychically. As she laments being separated from her family,
               a rupture that took place long before she worked salt but which she narrates after
               slaving on Turks Island, she discloses how the “trials” of her life as a
               slave “make the <emph>salt water</emph> come into my eyes when I think of the
               days in which I was afflicted—the times that are gone; when I mourned and
               grieved with a young heart for those whom I loved” (64; emphasis added). The
               same commodity that corrodes this enslaved body of labor also assumes a descriptive
               placeholder for Prince’s tears and consumes her emotionally. After she leaves
               Turks Island and serves as a domestic slave on the island of Bermuda, Prince
               describes how she finds her “master beating his daughter,” and how she
               attempts to intercede until he “began to lick (her) [with a lash]. Then (she)
               said, ‘Sir, this is not Turk’s Island’” (77). Revisiting
               Prince’s narrative with special attention to the salt trade, the term
               “lick” bears an especially disturbing resonance because of the
               traditional place of a salt lick, being what hunters set out to lure game. However,
               this particular moment also marks how Prince associates the place name of Turks
               Island with a space of exceptional and irregular wrongs—an alternate moral
               universe where travesties of justice become admissible. Likewise, in a poignant but
               brief consideration of salt in Charlotte Sussman’s book on commodities of
               consumption, she notes how Prince’s diction links the “sentimental
               recollections [that] ‘make salt water’” spring from the eyes to the
               “physical labor involved in producing salt, and the physical pain of being made
               to drink saltwater.” Sussman acknowledges that this phenomenon implies a close
               tie between “sentimental affect and the material conditions of Caribbean slave
               women,” a tie, further, that surpasses that of other abolitionist texts
               (153-4). </p>
               <p>Within a critical tradition that refuses to imbue Prince’s narrative with the
               truth-value granted to self-penned slave narratives, critics like Gillian Whitlock
               have nevertheless uncovered how this text carries the historical heft that it has
               long enjoyed. Whitlock underscores how those passages dedicated to figurations of the
               body and bodily harm have fared better historically, and have been readily taken as
               true or truthfully representative of Prince’s lived experience. Whitlock notes
               the following: “[u]ltimately, the inscriptions of flogging on the body of the
               Caribbean woman, a body made grotesque and painful by abuse, are what speak
               authentically to the good people of England” (<title level="m">Intimate</title>
               23). I would like to suggest that the audience might not read the bodily images
               incorporated into this narrative as exclusively as Whitlock implies, or with a truth
               value different to that which they grant to other elements of Prince’s text.
               But regardless, Whitlock’s observations prove valuable to my project because
               they reveal how Prince’s record of bodily horrors did and may still ring true
               for many readers, which in turn, could then add substance and authority to those
               metaphors and associations she links to salt-induced transfigurations of the
               body.</p>
               <p>Adding to the various examples that demonstrate how Prince’s time as a salt
               laborer becomes a metaphoric or associative touchstone, emotional disclosures are in
               fact continually linked to detrimental bodily encounters with salt. As Prince
               launches into her final account of the ten years she slaves in the salt marshes she
               completes her chronicle of Turks Island with a portrayal of a brutally mistreated old
               slave named Sarah, who was “beaten severely,” and “flung … among
               the prickly-pear bushes, which [were] all covered over with sharp venomous prickles.
               By this,” Prince continues, “her naked flesh was so grievously wounded,
               that her body swelled and festered all over, and she died a few days after”
               (75). This specific scene of a slave woman’s death, brought on by wounded flesh
               paired with a swollen and festering body, does not complete Prince’s dictation
               of the life of a salt laborer by accident. Rather, this narrative arrangement
               displays a subtle link functioning in Prince’s mind and propelling her
               narrative, a train of thought that fuses images of paramount and painful bodily
               transformations and punishments with the space and labor of the Turks Island salt
               ponds. Much in the same way, and not more than a sentence later, she remarks,
                  <quote>I think it was about ten years I had worked … at Turk’s Island, when
                  my master left off business, and retired to a house in Bermuda, leaving his son to
                  succeed him in the island. He took me with him to wait upon his daughters; and I
                  was joyful, for I was sick, sick of Turk’s Island, and my heart yearned to
                  see my native place again, my mother, and my kindred. (75-6)</quote>
               </p>
               <p>The fact that Prince so enthusiastically embraces a different mode of slave labor
               underscores the especially compromising conditions she endures raking salt.
               Additionally, the confession that she is “sick, sick of Turk’s
               Island” can signify not only on the level of the figurative, but also in the
               literal sense, especially when paired with the following information regarding the
               type of medical treatment Prince and other slaves were granted there. In a sadly
               ironic turn, Prince discloses how her overseer at Turks Island attempts to treat
               illness with a supposed salt-cure. Prince explains, “when we were ill, […] the
               only medicine given to us was a great bowl of hot salt water, with salt mixed with
               it, which made us very sick” (73). In stating that their only
               “medicine” is salt, Prince successfully portrays a complete merger of
               labor, land, and body. </p>
               <p>Shortly after these reflections, Prince remembers a moment taken from “the time
               [that she] was a slave on Turk’s Island” when she finally gets to see her
               mother (76). A ship arrives in port loaded with more slaves imported to work the salt
               flats, and her mother happens to be aboard the ship. Prince divulges that she
               “could scarcely believe” this news, “but when [she] saw [her] poor
               mammy [her] joy was turned to sorrow, for she had gone from her senses.” She
               then narrates how her mother “began to talk foolishly, and said that she had
               been under the vessel’s bottom” (76). Salt water quite obviously not only
               stands in ponds for raking salt, but encompasses the oceans that all slaves were
               forced to travel when they were brought to work in the colonies. Although
               Prince’s enslaved mother does not work in the salt ponds, she too reaches her
               compromised state from within a damaging cocoon of oceanic salt water. This fluid
               series of connections is paralleled literally by the porous nature of the skin and
               psyche which for Prince have both been soaked in salt—a process that opens
               physical and psychic wounds as it exposes both her exterior and interior body to the
               potentially threatening substance. </p>
               <p>Prince characterizes a tortured life lived in saline, but she also narrates
               salt-related mortification and death—a slow manifestation of dying also
               instigated by crystals of salt—and so figures a complete circle of
               salt-saturated life, a trajectory of being filtered almost entirely through the
               commodity she is forced to slave for. Prince writes:
                  <quote>Work—work—work—Oh that Turk’s Island was a horrible
                  place! The people in England, I am sure, have never found out what is carried on
                  there. Cruel, horrible place! </quote>
                  <quote>Mr. D— had a slave called old Daniel, whom he used to treat in the most
                  cruel manner. Poor Daniel was lame in the hip, and could not keep up with the rest
                  of the slaves; and our master would order him to be stripped and laid down on the
                  ground, and have him beaten with a rod of rough briar till his skin was quite red
                  and raw. He would then call for a bucket of salt, and fling [it] upon the raw
                  flesh till the man writhed on the ground like a worm, and screamed aloud with
                  agony. This poor man’s wounds were never healed, and I have often seen them
                  full of maggots, which increased his torments to an intolerable degree. He was an
                  object of pity and terror to the whole gang of slaves, and in his wretched case we
                  saw, each of us, our own lot, if we should live to be as old. (73-4)</quote> In
                  <title level="m">Sucking Salt</title> Meredith Gadsby identifies how
               ‘“seasoning,’ or the agony of a whipped slave whose bleeding wounds
               are rubbed with salt or washed with brine—and the simultaneous necessary
               dependence on salt for sufficient seasoning of foods speak to the notions of balance
               and excess” (10). Prince characterizes Daniel’s torture by salt-lash,
               which Gadsby reminds us is termed “seasoning” in the colonial Caribbean
               vernacular, as a feasible future for the “whole gang of slaves,” who go
               through excessive and brutal salt-induced reconfigurations of body and mind in order
               to provide the “sufficient seasoning of foods” that meets the needs of
               multiple national projects and kitchen tables. Moreover, Prince’s disturbing
               narrative of how “poor. . . Daniel’s . . . wounds were never
               healed” parallels the course of her own life both in the West Indies and later
               in England. When she reports her story to her amanuensis, and although she is
               nominally “free” in England, at least a decade after her salting days,
               she has not healed either bodily or psychologically. Like Daniel’s story, hers
               does not end in death or any substantive freedom, but in suffering, both of them
               possessing transformed bodies abandoned to a narratological limbo or an eternal hell,
               where their mutilated external forms perpetually display a tormented subject within. </p>
               <p>Prince, who narratologically expresses her knowledge of the mental and physical
               abuses her masters inflict upon her, also depicts what could amount to a type of
               bodily speech or protest during the latter years of her life, which take place in
               England. Notably, withstanding the fact that England held slavery to be illegal since
               the 1772 Mansfield decision in the Somerset case, and that Prince adopts the name of
               Molly Wood, accompanying her West Indian master (Mr. Wood) and mistress across the
               Atlantic with future freedom in mind, she was not granted any such liberty upon
               arrival (86). As Ferguson’s masterful archival work avers, in 1829 and after
               Prince’s <title level="m">History</title> was drafted, she unsuccessfully
               petitioned the House of Lords for her freedom (127). Now living in England and under
               the last master she introduces in her narrative, Prince details how she is now
               “quite cripple;” “I soon fell ill of the rheumatism, and grew so
               very lame that I was forced to walk with a stick . . . . I was ill a long long time;
               for several months I could not lift [a] limb” (79). Prince’s body
               revolts, refuses to continue to submit to the demands laid down by impossible labor
               expectations. The relation of Prince’s own bodily disfigurement suggests that
               she ought to have put down her toil no matter what sort of system of labor required
               it. The intense labor Prince performs wreaks havoc upon her flesh, propelling her to
               her “crippled” state. However, Prince’s <title level="m">History</title> is rarely examined as a critique of damaging labor practices,
               although the inhumane salt raking processes presented in her narrative would outlast
               chattel slavery.</p>
               <p>The troubling encounters Prince recites heighten the specificity and novelty of salt
               labor simply because this commodity merges with the laboring body to such a great
               extent— perhaps comparable only to those arduous and intrusive tasks born by
               coal and lead miners who were likewise compromised by their work environments. Salt
               literally breaches the boundary between the commodity and the laboring body. After
               Prince works in the salt flats of Turks Island, she emerges from her labor greatly
               changed. She is cannibalized by salt; she exists as a human commodity, a slave, and
               harvests a commodity, salt, that devours her flesh. This economy of cannibalism and
               corporeal alteration entails an existential transformation. Tales of raw, grated
               flesh incurred from brutal labor or slavery practices are not new, but here we are
               introduced to a story that serves as a critique not simply of slave labor, but also
               of what would prove to be standard labor practices found in the Caribbean salt
               industry even after slavery was abolished. Prince’s narrative underscores the
               particularity of this unique historic and geographic context as the body loses a
               contest of differentiation with salt, its co-commodity.</p>
               <p>Prince seeks to escape this threatening saline world in an idealized Britain;
               according to her history, the sheer horror of her salt-drenched state drives Prince
               to evoke her definition of Anglo-Saxon values, which she juxtaposes against what
               qualify as distinctly un-English acts perpetrated by who those who crossed the
               Atlantic. When Prince invokes a singularly English ethical code and exclaims that the
               “people in England,” surely, “have never found out what is carried
               on” at Turks Island, she rehearses an abolitionist view, purporting these
               enslaved populations to be systemically dependent upon British subjects. Moreover,
               the rhetorical charge she lofts upon a particularly English ethos fantastically
               subordinates not only the slaveholders and abolitionists but also the enslaved
               populace in the colonies to an idealized public across the sea, as she reinvests
               powerful authority in a body of English people who, by this line of reasoning, could
               feasibly halt the brutalization that American abolitionists, or any enslaved
               individuals, seemingly cannot. Prince appeals to her English readership, announcing,
               “I am often much vexed, and feel great sorrow when I hear some people in
               [England] say, that the slaves do not need better usage, and do not want to be free.
               They believe the foreign people who deceive them, and say slaves are happy. I say,
               Not so” (93). Prince attempts to use her identity—not that of a British
               subject but that of a “freed” slave on British soil—to include her
               pleas within a national popular fantasy, one of an inherently freedom-centric
               “English people” (93, 94). Jenny Sharpe’s consideration of
               Prince’s <title level="m">History</title> provides a particularly instructive
               discussion on the deployment of strategic tropes and omissions within various
               abolitionist-backed slave narratives. Prince’s text enacts this type of
               rhetorical move, especially where she paints the fate of any and all enslaved bodies
               of people in the British-held West Indies as being exclusively determined by citizens
               living in England. Sharpe compellingly argues that such narrative devices covered
               over and ignored the agency exhibited by slaves who ran away, revolted, or escaped
               slavery without nationalized or outside aid of any kind (124-127). </p>
               <p>In addition to Sharpe’s foundational work, a more recent article by Kremena
               Todorova also recognizes Prince’s nationalized rhetoric and how her narrative
               plays into British exceptionalism. Todorova writes, “[i]n the discourse
               originated by [Prince’s] <title level="m">History</title>, the English
               character and identity are consistently shielded from implications of immorality.
               Even though plantocrats and abolitionists [were] divided over the question of
               slavery, both sides avow[ed] their endorsement of a glorious English national
               identity” (299). However, Prince’s story subtly interrogates just how
               well England measures up to this ideal by depicting the horrors that British men and
               women perpetrate on both sides of the Atlantic. Even as she relates how her mistress
               “stripped and flogged her,” which she follows with a report of her master
               “abusing [her] with every ill name he could think of,” she censors
               herself and does not repeat any of these damning expletives, deeming them to be
               “(too, too bad to speak in England)” (68). Through such reticence she
               pays homage to an idealized version of an upright English nation, and Prince
               suggests, by definition, that even unjust words, let alone acts, cannot be pronounced
               or performed upon its righteous soil. By extension, such passages beg the question of
               why these expletives are somehow permissible on British-held soil, and implore one to
               question the practices and qualities of the English men and women who operate in this
               way.</p>
               <p>Prince’s work as a salt laborer, status as a female slave, and affiliation with
               the British West Indies allow her to import startling eyewitness testimony to her now
               nearby English readers. She retrieves and salvages stories amassed from the very
               realms that contorted her subjectivity and human form, delivering them to English
               citizens who are complicit with the abuses exacted within Britain’s colonial
               holdings. She absorbs even the bodily impact of the oceanic voyage many English
               subjects never took, in addition to the tolls exacted in and out of the salt marshes.
               “This is slavery” she explains: “I tell it to let the English
               people know the truth” (94). In moments like these, Prince also helps to define
               what English morality is or should be. Strikingly similar to Hegel’s analysis
               of the <title level="a">Lord and the Bondsman,</title> this unchosen yet pivotal role
               tasks Prince in a way that transforms her physically and mentally under slavery. In
               addition, it confirms Prince’s position as a black female orator or narrator
               and occupant of what Paul Gilroy has established as the black diaspora’s
               inside/outside locality within Modernity, enabling her narrative to carry special
                  weight.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Paul Gilroy notes how
                  England’s cultural imagination has traditionally been shaped by those
                  populations that have been largely excluded or deemed to be outsiders. He writes,
                  “The fact that some of the most potent conceptions of Englishness have been
                  constructed by alien outsiders like Carlyle, Swift, Scott, or Eliot should augment
                  the note of caution sounded here. The most heroic subaltern English nationalism
                  and counter cultural patriotisms are perhaps better understood as having been
                  generated in a complex pattern of antagonistic relationships with the
                  supra-national and imperial world for which the ideas of ‘race,’
                  nationality and national culture provide primary (though not the only)
                  indices.” Paul Gilroy, <title level="m">The Black Atlantic: Modernity and
                     Double Consciousness </title>(Cambridge: Harvard UP 1993) 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Read in light of the historical documents compiled here, we can see how the fruit of
               Prince’s torturous labor filled the pockets of British colonial investors, and
               fed scores of American colonists during that nation’s quest for revolutionary
               freedoms. But, although its extraction was beneficial materially, the realities of
               salt production under slavery corrode the liberatory claims of both nations. This, I
               have attempted to argue, is the type of implicit critique produced in the numerous
               occasions where Prince juxtaposes British idealism with harrowing tales of the
               everyday drudgery she experiences on Turks Island and even back in Britain. Indeed,
               Prince contributes to absolutist visions of British exceptionalism, replete with
               discourses of British liberty, justice, and righteousness, but her version of this
               exceptionalism insists on recognizing that these laudable standards be necessarily
               counterpoised to those propagated in the salt works in which she slaved. In her
               narrative, Prince, like others forced into the salt industry, materially preserves
               two nations while the very salt she unwillingly rakes continually corrodes and eats
               at her flesh and soul. The various trials of unfreedom and the psychological and
               physical injury Prince endures not only produce a deformed body and a reformulated
               consciousness, but also spawn her multivalenced testimony. Such physical and mental
               legacies emerge from her intimate knowledge and experience, and like the material
               history of salt in this Caribbean slave economy and its crucial place in North
               American revolutionary life, they might be lost to us without her narrative.</p>

                  <p>With notable exceptions, studies in British Romanticism remain pretty white.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Some of the notable exceptions include
                     Richardson and Hofkosh, Lee, Thomas, and Wood. Even these scholars can be
                     dogged by the spectre of what we call “abolitionism,” the tendency of Western
                     scholarship with the best of intentions to fabricate a discourse of blackness
                     it then discovers and advocates, an Africanized Orientalism of the sort
                     Morrison describes. The subaltern can’t get a word in edgewise.</note> It’s not
                  simply that most Romanticists, ourselves included, are middle class white folks
                  working for institutions that traditionally privilege peoples and cultures of
                  European descent. Nor is it simply that British culture, at least in its Romantic
                  avatar, presumes whiteness as the (transparent) racial bias of production. The
                  whiteness of Romantic studies is a symptom of amnesia. It bespeaks a massive act
                  of forgetting on the part of contemporary scholarship, an institutional disavowal
                  of the economic conditions that help make cultural production during the Romantic
                  Era possible: the maritime economy of the Atlantic. Anthologies tell the story of
                  this amnesia. Few acknowledge the huge role the West Indies played as the economic
                  engine that drove the astonishing flowering of culture we call Romanticism. While
                  uncontroversial today, Ann Mellor and Richard Matlak’s <title level="m">British
                     Literature 1780-1830</title> was hailed as an important revisionist compilation
                  when it appeared in 1995. Its inside covers contain a timeline that documents the
                  decisive events of the Romantic period, both in England and as far abroad as
                  India. The absence of any reference to the West Indies, however, leaves the
                  impression (if indeed an <emph>absence</emph> can impress) that nothing of
                  historical significance occurred there—no Jack Mansong, no Maroon War, no British
                  invasion of St. Domingo, no successful slave rebellion there founding the first
                  black republic in the history of the world.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Besides token selections from Equiano and Yearsly, Mellor and Matlak include
                     Maria Edgeworth’s “The Grateful Negro” (1804). But that’s hardly a hymn to
                     cultural crossing. The “Comprehensive Chronology” at the back of their edition,
                     while capacious, persists in neglecting the West Indies. It doesn’t help much
                     to excuse the oversight by referring to the benighted times of the anthology’s
                     original publication (1996). It was reissued in paperback in 2005. That same
                     year, the third edition of Duncan Wu’s implacably titled <title level="m">Romanticism</title> (the category having swallowed any national
                     distinction) hardly nods toward the West Indies in its 1552 pages. One might
                     expect an anthology entitled <title level="m">Transatlantic Romanticism</title>
                     (2006) to feature the Caribbean. However, editors Lance Newman, Joel Pace, and
                     Chris Koenig-Woodyard make <emph>nation</emph> the condition of Atlantic
                     crossings, building an anthology that does little more than unite the old
                     national entities of England, America, and Canada in a transatlantic horizon of
                     whiteness. In the world of letters, segregation prevails. Black writing from of
                     the Romantic era has its own special neighborhoods. Visit Richardson and Lee’s
                        <emph>Early Black British Writers</emph> (and notice their nationalization
                     of blackness), or Vincent Caretta’s <emph>Unchained Voices</emph>. Williamson’s
                     collection, on the other hand, mixes contrary voices in exciting new
                     ways.</note> Such is the amnesia of Romanticism, the unremembered histories of
                  diasporic Africans and creole cultures in the West Indies.</p>
                  <p>We want to conjure those histories, to summon the ancestor spirits who are
                  wandering the West Indies. The process requires an incantation and ours is “Black
                  Romanticism.” Replacing the honorific “British” with “Black” allows us to
                  dislocate Romantic studies—literally. We move the ruling perspective of critical
                  inquiry from the Island (England) to the islands (West Indies). This is not,
                  however, a movement from metropole to periphery. The West Indies are not the edge
                  of Empire. They are its engine: the economic, material, and cultural condition of
                  British prosperity and dominion during the Romantic era. To chant “Black
                  Romanticism” as means of conjuring this ancestry is to honor the Atlantic as its
                  presiding genius: the Atlantic, watery vortex of myriad economic and cultural
                  exchanges, roaring multiplicity of agencies, vast whirlpool of creative
                  powers.</p>
                  <p>Why honor the Atlantic? Why conjure its restless revenants? Partly because they
                  haunt Britain as a territorial and national entity. They are ancestors of the
                  nation. To the extent that Romanticism is <emph>British</emph>, the nation sets
                  the terms conceptually for its study. The consolidation of the nation as a state
                  formation—through more blood and mayhem than many scholars want to admit—was
                  complete by the end of the era deemed “Romantic.” It seems inevitable to approach
                  culture by way of national origins. Consider three powerful accounts of the
                  emergence of British Romantic culture from the consolidation of national identity.
                  In the important book entitled <title level="m">Britons: Forging the Nation,
                     1701-1837</title> (1992), Linda Colley describes the difficult cultural trick
                  of fusing England, Scotland, and Wales into a single nation, the United Kingdom.
                  National unity became possible through three powerful, shared experiences:
                  Protestantism, commerce, and near perpetual war (against the Dutch, the Spanish,
                  and the French). The United Kingdom as a nation arises as a solidarity of belief,
                  exchange, and struggle literally grounded in the insular territory of the British
                  Isles (Ireland constituting its reviled other).</p>
                  <p>This geographic territoriality of Britain receives endless endorsement from a
                  sustaining fantasy of community. A complementary account of the emergence of
                  national culture occurs in Benedict Anderson’s influential <title level="m">Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of
                     Nationalism</title> (1994; rev. 2006). In the now familiar argument, Anderson
                  views the nation as “an imagined political community—imagined as both inherently
                  limited and sovereign” (6). Members of such a community may never meet each other,
                  but they live their communion imaginatively. Three conditions produce this
                  imagined solidarity: capitalism, print, and a language of power. Nations emerge
                  where print advances trade in geographies administrated by such a language: the
                  British Isles, for instance, or the Spanish new world. That makes the nation the
                  solidarity of a linguistically configured imagination. No wonder that culture,
                  particularly literary culture, becomes nationally configured. It’s the brainchild
                  of a language of power that configures the nation.</p>
                  <p>Finally, an important corrective occurs in the work of Srivinas Aravamudan. His
                     <title level="m">Tropicopolitans: Colonialism and Agency, 1688-1804</title>
                  (1999) insists that any account of the nation must consider the role of colonies
                  in its emergence, or more specifically the decisive relationship between the
                  imperial and colonial subject. In his view the “tropicopolitan” names the
                  colonized subject as both an imperial fiction and a colonial fact, “object of
                  representation <emph>and</emph> agent of resistance” (4). Against Colley,
                  Aravamudan argues for the decisive role “xenophobia, Orientalism, colonialism, and
                  racism” (10) play in the production of national identity. The nation is not
                  exclusively a solidarity of domination. The colonial subject can flip the script,
                  appropriating its language of power for unimagined ends. The tropicopolitan thus
                  invents a counter-literacy to disrupt that language, imagining a new solidarity,
                  creating its own nation. As the creation of a linguistically configured
                  imagination, the nation proves its own undoing, promoting in a neat Hegelian way
                  new national possibilities in the tropical space of colonial domination.</p>
                  <p>All three of these potent accounts of the nation share assumptions that get built
                  into the study of national cultures such as British Romanticism. They are
                  geographically territorialized: Colley’s United Kindom, Anderson’s imagined
                  community, and Aravamuda’s Empire are all grounded physically in territories with
                  borders and colonial satellites. They are linguistically territorialized too: in
                  each instance a language of power (the King’s English, printed discourse, imperial
                  literacy) sustains national boundaries and legitimates cultural production.
                  Finally, they are racially territorialized, albeit less obviously. Colley’s
                  Britons may be ethnically diverse, but they are racially homogenous, congealing
                  into the plump white body of beef-eating John Bull. Anderson’s imagined
                  communities are only as racially diverse as a Eurpoean language of power will
                  admit, which is to say not at all, judging from the written record of the Spanish
                  conquest. While Aravamudan at least acknowledges the racial difference of the
                  tropicopolitan, his emphasis on imperial literacy as the preferred means of
                  resistance makes whiteness the cultural standard against which the colonial
                  subject must react. Casting the other in this role of reaction devalues agencies
                  (outside literacy, for instance) incommensurable with whiteness. The
                  tropicopolitan occupies the queasy position of affirming whiteness to assert
                  racial difference. The brutal history of decolonization illustrates the difficulty
                  here. Where nation sets the terms for agency—whether of resistance or
                  criticism—territory, literacy, and whiteness determine the means and ends of
                  cultural production.</p>
                  <p>Black Romanticism subverts those imperatives by conjuring spirits they ignore,
                  specters of the Atlantic vortex that haunt the nation and its presumed unities.
                  Cultural critics and radical historians of the last decade have forged new methods
                  of calling them up and querying their wisdom. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Important contributions other than those we mention include
                     Edward Kamau Brathwaite, Ian Baucom, Stuart Hall, W.M. Verhoeven, and Kevin
                     Hutchings. </note> Paul Gilroy’s groundbreaking (in the literal sense of
                  shattering territory as the foundation of cultural criticism) <title level="m">The
                     Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness</title> (1993) dislocates
                  the <emph>space</emph> of cultural criticism. Gilroy replaces the nation as stable
                  ground of cultural production with the dynamic swirl of the Atlantic. Mobility
                  becomes the new condition of agency. No longer rooted but routed, identities turn
                  fluid. Cultures split, cross, and recombine. Nationality falls to hybridity as
                  economic and cultural exchanges produce new forms of cultural production that mix
                  high and low, literate and illiterate, white, black, and every shade of brown.
                  Gilroy’s work recovers the cultural <emph>multiplicity</emph> that unitary notions
                  of nation, language, and race forget. It remembers too the <emph>terror</emph>
                  built into the nation as imagined community. The displaced blacks of the Black
                  Atlantic lived the full horrifying force of cultural investments in commerce,
                  print, and language. The Enlightenment looks different from the perspective of the
                  living death sentence of slavery. As Gilroy insists (to the great promise of
                  studies in Romanticism), slaves and other displaced people respond by creating
                  counter-cultures that disrupt and transform the nation and its unities. The true
                  cultural vanguard of the Romantic era belongs not to bourgeois word-worthies
                  speaking as Man to men but to those displaced people forging new ways of life
                  under circumstances of enlightened barbarity from blood, sweat, and vision.</p>
                  <p> Black Romanticism summons the spirits of those visionaries. In this it follows
                  the lead of cultural historians who navigate the complex network of exchanges
                  circulating people, ideas, practices, and things throughout the Atlantic. In
                     <title level="m">Cities of the Dead</title> (1996), Joseph Roach traces the
                  circulation of cultural exchanges throughout the “circum-Atlantic” world. Roach’s
                  emphasis on the <emph>circle</emph> in circulations is key here. There is little
                  inherently progressive about current scholarly preoccupation with
                     <emph>trans</emph>-national (or <emph>trans-</emph>Atlantic) literature. Nation
                  grounds a linear exchange, and the stunning lesson learned is that America readers
                  read British books. Roach’s emphasis on the circulation of surrogated cultural
                  practices puts the stress on <emph>transformation</emph>. Cultures hybridize as
                  they move. The Atlantic transforms identities and practices as it circulates them. </p>
                  <p>The radical prophets of this position are Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker.
                  Their monumental history of Atlantic radicalism, <title level="m">The Many Headed
                     Hydra: The Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic</title> (2001),
                  politicizes what could too easily be taken for a purely cultural phenomenon: the
                  production of new identities, hopes, visions, and communities through myriad
                  economic and cultural exchanges throughout the Atlantic. They start at the bottom
                  of that economy, with the displaced commoners—from Africa, Ireland, England,
                  France, Scandinavia, the Americas, India, the Far East—who dredged the harbors and
                  built the docks and worked the ships to make the Atlantic <emph>pay</emph>. A
                  “radical diaspora” of expropriated laborers—slaves and servants, peasants and
                  plebs—a “motley crew” came bodily together to drive that economy. They traded
                  words and songs, ideas and dreams as they worked. Their labor forged new cultures
                  and communities. Their common politics was a politics of the commons, for they
                  were driven from their common property to work alien worlds. This displaced,
                  circulating proletariat was culturally mixed and racially heterogeneous. In
                  Linebaugh and Rediker’s words, “It was <emph>multitudinous, numerous</emph>, and
                     <emph>growing</emph>. [. . .] It was <emph>cooperative</emph> and

                  (332-33). Atlantic circulations of people, ideas, and things create new
                  possibilities for collective living irreducible to the prim unities of territory
                  and language. This motley crew of slaves, servants, and sailors multiply cultures
                  and imagine communities beyond the territorial limits of the nation.</p>
                  <p>Black Romanticism summons and celebrates their example. It deterritorializes
                  British national identity and the culture of the Romantic era, reimagining them as
                  the <emph>effect</emph> of myriad economic and cultural exchanges circulating
                  throughout the Atlantic. Economic workers are cultural workers too. Where there is
                  economic production there is cultural production. Where there are economic
                  exchanges there are cultural exchanges too. Beneath the honorific of the Briton
                  seethes a prolific cultural multiplicity irreducible to the imperatives of
                  territory, trade, and languages. Black Romanticism remembers this forgotten
                  ancestry of British culture, recovering the vital role Africans and other
                  diasporic commoners play in the cultural production called Romanticism. Black
                  Romanticism conjures these ancestors by practicing counter-literacy, reading the
                  works of nation, empire, and colony against themselves to liberate the common
                  cultures they occlude. Black Romanticism does not speak truth to power, but
                  channels truths that power devalues, multiple truths that lived and died with
                  economic and cultural workers throughout the West Indies and the larger Atlantic
                  world. </p>
                  <p>A word about that word, “black.” It acquires a threefold valence in our usage.
                  First, there is the obvious racial trace: black as in African, black as in slave.
                  But read warily. The “black” in Black Romanticism is not a new and darker purity
                  to counter British whiteness. On the contrary, it bespeaks the multiple and mixed
                  identities that arise through the circulation of people, ideas, and things
                  throughout the Atlantic. This, then, is the second valence of our usage: black as
                  mixed, hybrid, creolized cultural production. We want a Romanticism that is black
                  in the same sense as Gilroy’s Atlantic: “The fractal patterns of cultural and
                  political exchange and transformation that we try and specify [. . .] indicate how
                  both ethnicities and political cultures have been made anew in ways that are
                  significant not simply for the peoples of the Caribbean but for Europe, for
                  Africa” (15)—and for Britain too. “Black” marks those transformations. Then there
                  is the darkest valence of all, black as “occult”—black magic, black market, the
                  black arts. Black Romanticism acquires insurgence here. Counterforce to whiteness,
                  black in our usage summons mute specters that haunt British Romanticism: the
                  slaves driving it, the terror sustaining it, the common cultures challenging and
                  transforming its superiority. Black Romanticism sets those spirits free to feed
                  upon pure dreams of mastery. It gives them voice and communicates their vitality.
                  In this it follows the example of Joan Dyan, whose imposing <title level="m">Haiti, History, and the Gods</title> (1996) portends a new kind of criticism
                  that takes seriously the cultural lives of the unlettered to reveal their
                  indelible influence on and transformation of European culture. Black Romanticism
                  invokes those transformations to advance them. We conjure the ancestors. We
                  practice black arts. How black is Romanticism? As black as we can make it.</p>

                  <p>When Jean-Jacque Dessalines tore the white band from the French
                     <foreign>tricolour</foreign> in 1803, he issued a decree that would resonate in
                  Haiti’s 1805 inaugural constitution. This constitution pronounced all Haitians
                  “black,” including Polish and German mercenaries who remained on the island.
                  Arguably the first ideological deployment of the term “black,” this revolutionary
                  tactic ultimately foundered in practice when Dessalines applied the methods of the
                  French to the whites of the island and ordered the massacre of those who
                  threatened the new nation. In so doing he, as Lindsey Twa has suggested, “sealed
                  for Haiti a lasting reputation as a nightmare republic in the eyes of the greater
                  white world” (2). However, Dessalines’ incongruous legacy as both hero and villain
                  attests to the sheer vitality and uneasy complexity of his proclamation of a
                  “Black Haiti.” He was, in retrospect, both the perpetrator and the victim of the
                  violence that can and did accompany the exchange and transformation of new world
                  culture. Out of this carnage, new cultural, spiritual and socio-economic
                  identities emerged: “great spirits on earth” sojourned to create a “brave new
                  world” with “such people in it.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">This line
                     is famously spoken by Miranda at the conclusion of the Tempest. We here also
                     evoke Keats’ perhaps equally renowned quotation, “Great spirits on earth are
                     now sojourning” (from the sonnet of that title, in “To John Reynolds, 17 &amp;
                     18, <title level="m">Poetical Works of 1884</title>, which in turn invokes
                     Wordsworth.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such people include in addition to Dessalines, Juan Manzano, Jack Mansong, Mary
                  Prince, and John Gabriel Stedman: an emperor, a poet, a bandit, a slave, and a
                  soldier. Although these five figures emerged from different geopolitical
                  environments in the Caribbean, they share a complex historical and literary
                  trajectory: a circum-Atlantic labyrinth of shifting, intersecting, and
                  metamorphosing narratives. Four of them were, but did not remain, enslaved, and
                  the fifth simultaneously condoned and condemned the institution. Despite occupying
                  literal and figurative margins, each of these persons claimed the spotlight in
                  metropole, hinterland, and colony. Their stories—and variations of their
                  stories—traveled through and around the Black Atlantic during the Romantic era and
                  after. </p>
                  <p>Writings from within as well as about the Caribbean offer insight into the
                  construction of European texts. The African-Briton binary employed by
                  traditionally white Romanticism does not accommodate the history and reality of
                  the West Indies. The inclusion of voices and stories from Jamaica, Suriname,
                  Haiti, Bermuda, and Cuba, for example, underscore the African legacies so often
                  marginalized in European stories; in so doing it irrevocably alters the narratives
                  of the metropole. It is perhaps little surprise that narratives emerging from the
                  creolized culture of the New World would change the way both African- and
                  European- descended people understand and represent themselves and their others
                  (to themselves and their others). Kathleen M. Balutansky and Marie Agnes Sourieau
                  have identified in these creole cultures “a syncretic process of transverse
                  dynamics that endlessly reworks and transforms the cultural patterns of varied
                  social and historical experiences and identities (3). In other words, narratives
                  emerging from the Caribbean are both pre-mediated and pre-meditated. </p>
                  <p>Although recent scholarship has called attention to the many (and legitimate)
                  problems of historical transmission in the Black Atlantic world--especially to
                  narrative and mnemonic gaps—this collection of essays considers how the
                  circulation of radically different adaptations of the “same” stories provides new
                  ways to understand the colonial Caribbean. <note place="foot" resp="editors">In addition to the work of Joseph Roach, Diana Taylor provides a fantastic
                     study of the relationships between the archive and the repertoire—between
                     written and embodied histories. Saidya Hartman urges us to “brush history
                     against the grain” as a critical element of the “struggle within and against
                     the constraints and silences imposed by the nature of the archive—the system
                     that governs the appearance of statements and generates social meaning” (11).
                  </note> We pay particular attention to the transatlantic exchange and
                  transformation of stories about slavery, colonialism and their aftermaths in
                  efforts to piece together the fragments of an elusive and violent past.</p>

                  <p>Stories about Jean-Jacque Dessalines, Jack Mansong, Juan Manzano, John Gabriel
                  Stedman, and Mary Prince have over the past two centuries become part of a
                  constellation of stories about slavery and colonialism, following a circuitous
                  route that began in Africa and traveled from Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Suriname,
                  Bermuda, and Antigua to corresponding points in England, America, and the
                  continent. Each narrative has endured transformations that render the “original”
                  story less significant than the ways they have changed, been changed, or changed
                  the stories connected with them. Each of these figures has acquired multiple and
                  contradictory reputations in part due to changing audiences and media.</p>
                  <p>Jean-Jacques Dessalines, for example, has been represented as both despot and
                  deity. Formerly enslaved, Dessalines rose to power with violence and bloodshed,
                  christened himself Emperor of Haiti, and triumphed over an oppressive European
                  rule. Although Dessalines meant for the newly-independent Haiti to function
                  without slavery, he eventually resorted to related despotic measures in what
                  Michel-Rolph Trouillot has termed <foreign>caporalism agraire</foreign>, or
                  agrarian militarism. When he ordered the massacre of the remaining French
                  colonists in Haiti after a reign of terror echoing that of revolutionary France,
                  he incited the wrath of his own soldiers who ambushed and executed him. Though
                  Dessalines has sustained a reputation as an autocratic despot, he has also been
                  deemed a heroic founding father of Haiti. In other words, he was both oppressed
                  and oppressor—slave and emperor—in a constantly shifting social order. </p>
                  <p>Slave rebel “Three-Fingered Jack” Mansong, has been known in England and the
                  Caribbean as both the “Robin Hood of the Tropical Forest” and the “Terror of
                  Jamaica.” Narratives about his life emerged in England, the United States, and
                  Jamaica, offering different interpretations to varying audiences over the course
                  of two centuries. To this day, he remains a shadowy and ambiguous hero-villain in
                  Jamaica. As both an emblem of freedom and a murderous thug with a history
                  inextricably linked to the likewise elusive (and entirely oral) Maroon history, he
                  embodies the contradictions that characterize life under and on the margins of
                  plantation life.</p>
                  <p>Stories by and about the Afro-Cuban Juan Manzano provide a rich but contradictory
                  narrative landscape. Manzano was, like Dessalines and Jack Mansong, once enslaved,
                  but he achieved his freedom by pen rather than machete. After his escape from
                  slavery, he worked for planter Domingo Del Monte who allegedly helped him raise
                  funds to buy his own freedom. Del Monte gave Manzano’s poems and autobiography to
                  his friend, Robert Madden, who translated Manzano’s work from Spanish, added
                  several appendices, and prefaced the resulting volume with his own poems before
                  sending them out in print. In addition, Manzano—a renowned storyteller—circulated
                  his own stories orally in Cuba and Jamaica. These overlapping and stories and
                  genres create a space to explore different geopolitical systems and approaches to
                  slavery and abolition.</p>
                  <p>John Gabriel Stedman’s <title level="m">Narrative of a Five Years Expedition
                     Against the Revolted Slaves of Suriname</title> (1796) sits precariously within
                  an archive that includes a web of re-printings, editorial mediations, and
                  images—most notably William Blake’s engraved illustrations. The Dutch-Scots
                  Stedman wrote about his life in Suriname and his relationship with its
                  inhabitants, particularly his alliance with his concubine Joanna and their son,
                  Johnny. Like Manzano’s narrative, Stedman’s reaches a much wider audience than he
                  anticipated however different from him in taste or agenda. Despite the disparities
                  among the texts, reading between and across the narratives offers a prismatic look
                  at life in eighteenth-century Surinam. Stedman’s fascination with Maroons, for
                  example, provides a valuable resource to understand a history that has few written
                  texts in its repertoire. Although Stedman sustained a reputation as an authority
                  on Suriname, he b ecame, arguably, an exotic object of consumption to be enjoyed
                  by audiences in Europe and the Americas. </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave, Related by
                     Herself</title>, emerged in 1831, the first account of a Black woman to be
                  published in England. Born into slavery in Bermuda, moved to Antigua, and then
                  taken to London by her master, John Wood, Prince found employment with Thomas
                  Pringle, the secretary to the Anti-Slavery society and the eventual editor of her
                  (transcribed) narrative soon after landing upon English soil. Prince’s highly
                  mediated account has invited critical conversations about the authenticity of her
                  text since it first appeared, including two libel suits that attest to its
                  polemical nature. Prince’s multi-layered narrative captures the trauma and
                  dispossession that characterizes her transatlantic experience, and its
                  history—like hers—offers a unique opportunity to examine the exigencies of life
                  under and after slavery.</p>
                  <p>In the first essay of this volume, “Jean-Jacques Dessalines: Demon, Demigod, and
                  Everything in Between” Lindsey Twa traces representations of Dessalines in
                  literary and visual texts from Haiti, the United States, and Europe to examine how
                  these representations shape his fascinating legacy. Twa’s essay insightfully
                  proposes that Dessalines’ legacy—like his physical body—was both torn asunder and
                  restored, “rendering his complex legacy piecemeal.” Twa explores his journey from
                  abject slave to revolutionary hero and locates his ultimate status as
                     <foreign>Iwa</foreign> (spirit) in Vodou practice as a cultural space that
                  “recognizes and celebrates the contradictory nature of this mercurial figure” (3).
                  She notes that Kreyol (French Creole) folk songs and ritualistic practice focus on
                  the liberty he brings, “through a body that is both powerful and dismembered,
                  heroic and corrupt, living and dead” (16). </p>
                  <p>In our second essay, “Rewriting the History of Black Resistance: The Haitian
                  Revolution, Jamaican Maroons and the ‘History’ of ‘Three-Fingered Jack’ in English
                  Popular Culture, 1799-1830,” Lissette Szwydky examines British adaptations of the
                  history of the notorious rebel. She argues that the popular history of Jack
                  Mansong can be read as part of a larger colonial history that misrepresents black
                  resistance in the Caribbean and the Americas. Particularly concerned with erasure
                  of Maroon history from these adaptations, she shows how they demonstrate that “an
                  instance of collective rebellion could be sensationalized to the point of being
                  rendered politically insignificant.” By stripping Jack of his gang of followers
                  and by changing the identity of his captor from a Maroon to a slave, she suggests,
                  the British stage and print versions deny the actual history of black resistance
                  and independence in Jamaica. </p>
                  <p>In our third essay, "Translating a Slave’s Life: Richard Robert Madden and the
                  Post-Abolition Trafficking of Juan Manzano’s <title level="m">Poems by a Slave in
                     the Island of Cuba</title>,” Joselyn Almeida examines the translations of Juan
                  Manzano’s <title level="m">Poems</title>, a manuscript that followed a
                  labyrinthine route before its eventual publication. Almeida suggests that the
                  translation provided British abolitionists with the cultural capital necessary to
                  “ensure a future beyond 1840 given the realignment of geopolitical and economic
                  power in the Atlantic” (11). Madden’s translation functions, she argues, “as a
                  sign of appropriated cultural labor, and performs an ideological accommodation of
                  slavery within the free market/free labor system” (3). </p>
                  <p>In the fourth essay, “Going Viral: Stedman's <title level="m">Narrative</title>,
                  Textual Variation, and Life in Atlantic Studies,” Dustin Kennedy argues that the
                  Stedman archive functions as a new “interpretive unit of cultural-community
                  formation” that “re-directs attention to revolt and insurrection as divergent (and
                  raced) social/political factors in the eighteenth-century.” Identifying Stedman as
                  one of many authorial voices that are <emph>disseminated</emph> through the
                  archive of the <title level="m">Narrative</title>, Kennedy reveals how the many
                  iterations of the account create a “cross-pollination” or circulation of
                  revolutionary ideas throughout the Caribbean, the Americas and Europe. </p>
                  <p>Our final essay, Michele Speitz’s “Blood Sugar and Salt Licks: Corroding Bodies
                  and Preserving Nations in <title level="m">The History of Mary Prince, a West
                     Indian Slave, Related by Herself</title>,” uses the brutal work of the salt
                  flats to link the British colonial project with the revolutionary history of the
                  United States. Exploring the material and metaphoric significance of Prince’s
                  narrative she argues that the “realities of salt production under slavery corrode
                  the liberatory claims of both nations.” In so doing, her essay extends critical
                  conversations about slave narratives to include the largely overlooked relevance
                  of salt raking to the economies and politics of the Black Atlantic.</p>
                  <p>Taken together, these five essays advance a criticism attuned to the multiplicity
                  that sleeps and seethes beneath “Romanticism.” If the vortex of the Atlantic
                  creates new cultures—then and now—Black Romanticism makes them visible and
                  promotes their interminable circulations. We’re conjuring spirits here, the
                  voluble but hitherto silenced spirits of the diasporic people whose labor drove
                  the Atlantic economy and whose creativity infected and inflected the culture of
                  their so-called masters. It would be easy to do so as benefactors, but we hope to
                  avoid that presumption. Dayan defines terror as whipping with one hand while
                  comforting with the other: “You harm, and then you alleviate the harm you have
                  caused: the executioner also gets to be the savior; the benevolence continues the
                  brutalization, while claiming otherwise” (206). The trick to conjuring spirits
                  such as those of the slaves that haunt Romanticism is interrupt the legacy of
                  terror that brutalized them. </p>
                  <p>That means resisting the tendency to situate their messages in advance: as
                  primitive, occult, untutored, “African.” The powerful creative force of enslaved
                  peoples in the West Indies gave rise to cultural forms through which they affirmed
                  their lives under terms of subjection: Obeah, Myal, Voodoo, medicine, cooking,
                  gardening, handicraft, and the like. These were not the customs of distant
                  primitives. They arose in curious and productive contact with European cultures
                  dislocated from their respective metropoles, dominant cultures for which the
                  process of domination produced occasions too for change.</p>
                  <p>Black Romanticism is a double listening. It respects the spirits of the subjected
                  peoples and tries to hear their shouts and cries and whispers. The Assembly of
                  Jamaica heard only superstition and resistance in Obeah. Sharper ears discover a
                  politics there, an economics, the proud affirmation of dislocated lives creating
                  forms of culture from a mix of inherited, borrowed and found materials. The second
                  register of listening, then, involves the culture of the colonists. Constant
                  exposure to the contagion of slavery infects it to the point of sometimes subtle,
                  sometimes significant mutation. It’s a notorious cliché, but one worth pondering:
                  colonists go native in the West Indies—well, not <emph>native</emph> but creole.
                  They start to speak a slack patois. They begin to enjoy the local cuisine. They
                  sleep with slaves. In a different but no less decisive way than that of the people
                  who sustain their lives, colonial culture changes. </p>
                  <p>Kamau (Edward) Brathwaite calls this process <emph>creolization</emph> and argues
                  that it and not subjection describes the interaction between European and African
                  cultures in the Caribbean. Creolization presumes “a way of seeing the society, not
                  in terms of white and black, master and slave in separate nuclear units, but as
                  contributory parts of a whole” (307). It would be a mistake, then, to view the
                  complex cultures produced in the West Indies as the product of slave societies.
                  Rather, they arise out of a difficult process whereby different peoples “adapt
                  themselves to a new environment and to each other”(307). Creolization in this
                  sense is the heart and soul of Black Romanticism. We conjure spirits to hear the
                  changes they ring on Caribbean and European cultures.</p>
