			<!-- Long volume abstract goes here -->
				<p rend="noCount">The whiteness of Romantic studies is a symptom of amnesia. It bespeaks a massive act of forgetting on the part of contemporary scholarship, an institutional disavowal of the economic conditions that help make cultural production during the Romantic Era possible: the maritime economy of the Atlantic. Black Romanticism deterritorializes British national identity and the culture of the Romantic era, reimagining them as the effect of myriad economic and cultural exchanges circulating throughout the Atlantic. It remembers the forgotten ancestry of British culture, recovering the vital role Africans and other diasporic commoners play in the cultural production called Romanticism, and practices counter-literacy, reading the works of nation, empire, and colony against themselves to liberate the common cultures they occlude. This volume focuses on Jean-Jacque Dessalines, Jack Mansong, Juan Manzano, John Gabriel Stedman, and Mary Prince, Caribbean figures whose biographies have over the past two centuries become part of a constellation of stories about slavery and colonialism, following a circuitous route that began in Africa and traveled from Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Suriname, Bermuda, and Antigua to corresponding points in England, America, and the continent. Each narrative has endured transformations that render the “original” story less significant than the ways they have changed, been changed, or changed the stories connected with them. Each of these figures has acquired multiple and contradictory reputations in part due to changing audiences and media.</p>

				<div type="section"><head>About the Romantic Circles Praxis
					Series</head>
				
				<p rend="noCount">The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is devoted to
					using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
					investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and
					theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of
					Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge,
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world
					where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a
					period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on
					the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the
					intellectual and theoretical discussions of today.
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain with
					the best and most exciting critical writing of
					contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p></div>
