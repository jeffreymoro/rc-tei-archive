               <p>John Gabriel Stedman's <em>Narrative of a Five Years' Expedition Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</em> (1796) is a very complicated text. It tells the story of an officer in the Scots
                  Brigade deployed in 1772 to the Dutch-controlled colony of Surinam to suppress an
                  armed black revolt against plantation slavery. It also exposes the cruelty of both
                  slavery and military authority, while providing a rare account of a wide spectrum
                  of colonial society. It takes advantage of Stedman's role as a colonial authority,
                  writing from the privileged perspective of the colonial gaze, but it also challenges
                  many assumptions and prejudices natural to the colonizer's world view. Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> is gaining importance in Atlantic Studies, because it both reflects the larger experience
                  of circum-Atlantic circulation in the Age of Revolution and provides a unique perspective
                  that differs from other primary material from the period. It should be possible to
                  differentiate between what is typical of society and what is particular to an individual's
                  perspective in Stedman's <em>Narrative</em>, right? There is just one problem: there is more than one Stedman's <em>Narrative</em>.</p>
               <p>Today's reader is in a position to understand the role that variation plays in the
                  construction and interpretation of Stedman's <em>Narrative</em>. Contemporary culture is comfortable with the idea of media going “viral,” taking
                  on a life of its own as it is experienced and altered by users on the net. Likewise,
                  a type of reading that is attentive to reference and mutation is necessary for Stedman's
                  <em>Narrative</em> because of the proliferation of versions that have emerged over the more than two-hundred
                  year history of its publication legacy.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> is gaining critical attention in Atlantic Studies, a close look at its textual history
                     reveals that it has never been out of the public's consciousness for long. The current
                     multiplex configuration of Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> emerged in 1988, the result of Richard and Sally Price's new scholarly edition. The
                     Prices' text transcribed Stedman's 1790 manuscript version for the first time, aiming
                     to restore his original authorial intent and exposing the extent to which the text
                     had been altered by Stedman's first editor, Joseph Johnson. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>To add to this confusion, the Prices' restored text exists in both a full transcription
                              complete with original orthography and spellings (1988) and a modernized, abbreviated
                              version (1992). </span></div>
                     </div> The original, 1796 published version of the <em>Narrative</em> was successful, resulting in several editions in multiple languages. It contained,
                     however, views on race, slavery, social justice and inter-racial sex that were very
                     different than those found in Stedman's manuscript. Upon seeing these alterations,
                     Stedman reflected in his journal, “receive the 1st vol. of my book quite mard oaths
                     and Sermons inserted etc” (June 24, 1795). These changes coalesce around the description
                     of Stedman's relationship with Joanna, a woman in bondage. To briefly give a sense
                     of what is at stake in the competing texts, in their introduction to the revised manuscript
                     edition the Prices note that “the edited version, saying nothing of her beauty, emphasizes
                     Joanna's pitiable condition (bathed in tears rather than bathing with her companions)
                     and makes Stedman her protector and patron, rather than her lover-aspiring-to-be-her-husband”
                     (lxi). If the editorial imperative to cloak Joanna in the modest garb of a sentimentalized
                     relationship with Stedman protects her, in a sense, from being the <em>Narrative</em>'s object of sexual desire, it also obscures the nature of Stedman and Joanna's relationship
                     by defaulting to the confines of gender hierarchies: paternal protection and female
                     emotional dependence. Both versions of the <em>Narrative</em> are troubled by what they cannot contain, whether it be the sexual exploitation made
                     possible by plantation-slavery, or the inter-racial desire that would eventually mark
                     Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> as a singular example of resistance to the exploitations inherent in the eighteenth-century
                     Atlantic world.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The Prices' edition made Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> available to contemporary critics, enabling its increasing importance for literary
                  and historical scholarship in Atlantic studies. It also introduced the complexity
                  of having two texts sharing the same name in a field that emphasizes the material
                  production, publication, and dissemination histories of primary sources. The difference
                  between the original published version and the recovered manuscript raises an essential
                  question: how should we read Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> now that there are two of them? On one hand, it is a text that is similar to a planter's
                  journal, a record of colonial society that can be read for silences and echoes of
                  life under plantation slavery. On the other, it is a text that crosses social boundaries
                  between master and slave, white and black, colonizer and colonized, wealthy and poor,
                  in ways that make even the comparatively conservative first publication version appear
                  radical. For scholars interested in reading Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> as a reflection of history, Stedman's manuscript version <em>might</em> offer a closer depiction of his perceived experience. And yet, focusing on the Prices'
                  recovered manuscript edition leaves out the prevailing cultural biases that Johnson's
                  1796 version reflects. Choosing one edition over the other is no longer an option
                  for scholars who turn to Stedman's writings as a gateway to eighteenth-century life.
                  Both are essential for triangulating Stedman's particular experience and the larger
                  cultural biases that mediated that experience in print.</p>
               <p>I will confess now that it is not my intention to map the differences between the
                  two versions of Stedman's <em>Narrative</em>. The Prices' introduction to their revised manuscript edition describes these changes
                  in extensive detail. Instead, I take up the task of understanding the ramification
                  of the Prices' edition not only on criticism that has emerged as a result of their
                  recovery work, but also to understand the recent revival of Stedman's writings in
                  the context of a much longer process of cultural appropriation that has been ongoing
                  since the <em>Narrative</em>'s first publication in 1796. In essence, this is an effort in tracking: in tracking
                  knowledge circulating in the Atlantic; in tracking the cultures that respond to and
                  appropriate Stedman's account of his time in Surinam for their own purposes; and in
                  tracking the significance of alterations made to the text. It is clear from the two
                  versions of Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> that authorship is only one force at work in shaping the text, and not necessarily
                  the most powerful force, either. In order to bring the cultural forces at work in
                  the construction of Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> to light, it is necessary to expand the notion of authorship to include not only
                  the figure of a single author, but also the acts of referencing, printing, and reprinting.
                  Rather than arguing for a definitive edition of the <em>Narrative</em>, I argue that the work can best be understood by considering it simultaneously as
                  manuscript, editorialized publication, and re-telling. All together, this plurality
                  of authorship and edition forms the core of what I call the Stedman Archive: the collectively
                  produced text. The Stedman Archive is a convenient shorthand denoting the many documents
                  that have Stedman's experience in colonial Surinam as their center. In one way or
                  another they each recount that experience from a perspective unique to the type of
                  writing each document undertakes, and together they reveal the incomplete understanding
                  that any one in particular is able to capture.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The central texts of the archive are the <em>Narrative</em>'s original publication and the Prices' restored manuscript edition, produced from
                     the rare manuscripts and journals first recovered by antiquarian Stanbury Thompson.
                     In the 1960s, Thompson published Stedman’s journals and letters, as well as a biographic
                     history of the Stedman family refined from these sources and interviews conducted
                     with Stedman's living descendants. (Thompson found these important documents in a
                     junk shop, and is ultimately responsible for their preservation.) While Thompson's
                     publications offer a fair reading copy for readers unused to working with hand-written
                     manuscripts, they are at times unreliable in their transcription and translation,
                     and can usefully be checked against the originals held by the James Ford Bell library
                     at the University of Minnesota lest Thompson's bias be mistaken as Stedman's.

                     </div>The same is true of the <em>Narrative</em>, which went through many editions, abridgments, and translations. Until the Prices'
                     recovered manuscript edition in 1988 the biases of his many editors were mistakenly
                     attributed to Stedman.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It should be noted that the Prices' introduction includes a meticulously researched
                     list of the textual variations that the <em>Narrative</em> underwent over the course of two hundred years, including descriptions of the changes
                     made to the text in each case. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> Indeed, the only limitation to their research is that it ends with the addition of
                     the restored version of the text. In 1988 they could not foresee the effect that their
                     edition would have in scholarship or the arts over the following two decades. Critics
                     have since assessed Stedman's account of Surinam as imperial travelogue, as a vector
                     of revolutionary knowledge, as a carrier of the hidden history of women in slavery,
                     or as colonial pornography, and in the process have re-written the <em>Narrative</em> into current scholarly paradigms of the eighteenth-century Atlantic world. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                              (4)

                              revolutionary knowledge), Jenny Sharpe (hidden history of women in slavery), and Marcus
                              Wood (colonial pornography). </span></div>
                     </div> Alongside this renewed scholarly attention, Beryl Gilroy re-wrote Stedman's experience
                     from his first-person perspective in <em>Stedman and Joanna - A Love in Bondage</em> (1991) . Drawing on the <em>Narrative</em>, as well as Stedman's private journals and letters, Gilroy focuses on Stedman and
                     Joanna's relationship even while expanding the length of the tale to include Stedman's
                     pre- and post-Surinam life. All of these texts maintain an important fidelity to Stedman's
                     account, but their strategic changes leave authorship in the archive indeterminate.
                     During the two centuries since its original publication, Stedman's account has resurfaced
                     repeatedly alongside the struggle against slavery, colonialism, and racism. As a result,
                     the full scope and importance of the Stedman Archive only becomes clear from a critical
                     perspective instructed by the black Atlantic; it is an archive endowed with both the
                     conventions of British culture and print apparatus in the eighteenth century, and
                     productive of post-colonial re-writings emerging in diverse political and national
                     contexts.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In its original form the <em>Narrative</em> is a more or less chronological account of Stedman's time spent in Surinam, ranging
                  over a wide variety of subjects including ethnographic observation, colonial history,
                  military engagements, a naturalist's attention to flora and fauna, and Stedman's relationships
                  with the people he encounters in every strata of plantation society. It is an example
                  of what Mary Louise Pratt has described as travel writing, in which the imperialist
                  perspective of the traveler has the power to render what it observes as legible in
                  the scientific, racial, and economic consciousness of the imperial observer. The travel
                  writing genre privileges the author as individual, granting the power of interpretation
                  over the events and peoples related in the account. Stedman's writing, in the case
                  of the <em>Narrative</em>, mirrors the function of his imperial subjectivity. It is the written analogue of
                  his other positions of authority: as a military officer who suppresses a slave revolt,
                  and as a white European male who is able through local/colonial custom to temporarily
                  take a slave woman as his wife to increase his domestic comfort while in Surinam.</p>
               <p>Stopping there would be stopping short. Stedman was more than a traveler in Surinam,
                  and he was also more than a colonial agent and oppressor. The <em>Narrative</em> can be read as the outgrowth of social subjectivity categories that typify the operation
                  of the larger plantation slavery system in the West Indies and South America, but
                  it must also be recognized in its particularity. In the following sections, I will
                  consider what happens when Stedman's authorship becomes displaced in the larger archive
                  – how critics rewrite what they read, how an author becomes a character, and above
                  all else, how textual changes challenge criticism's reduction of Stedman to imperialist.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Viral History</span></h2>
               <p>As Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> goes viral, the logic of the transmission vector becomes useful in thinking about
                  how knowledge can be tracked through an archive. Disease marks the transgressed boundary
                  of the body, as suffering is passed from one subject to the next. It is often associated
                  with myriad cultural interactions and social stigmas, and has become one of the primary
                  organizations of body control in our current time via management, prevention, and
                  treatment. Extending this metaphor to the viral transmission of a text emphasizes
                  the split between “agent” and “effect”; the text-as-virus becomes the vehicle for
                  disseminating the knowledge-as-disease. The subversive quality of the transmitted
                  knowledge remains true to today's viral media, which typically spreads its information
                  prior to official media coverage.</p>
               <p>In terms of today's criticism, the primary conceptual category for the subversive,
                  or alternative, interpretation of a text is the act of producing a “hidden history,”
                  a re-telling of a familiar history or narrative from below. The effect of this critical
                  effort is to empower new social consciousnesses by revealing versions of the past
                  that destabilize the “always-already” logic of currently dominant and hegemonic social
                  configurations. If something happened once, after all, it could happen again. Peter
                  Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker's <em>The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary
                     Atlantic</em> helped define the field of Atlantic Studies by envisioning a model of one continuous
                  and ongoing resistance throughout the Atlantic world to expanding global capital during
                  the early modern era and throughout the Age of Revolution. By reading the silences
                  of texts for the experience of the mass of humanity that did not have the privilege
                  of producing the materials that now define our historical archives, Linebaugh and
                  Rediker describe a counter-history to one inundated by ruling-class assumptions.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> plays a crucial role in <em>The Many-Headed Hydra's</em> perspective of history, but his dual-natured character and text seemingly do not fit
                     in its conception of history from below. In order to understand the relative “silencing”
                     of Stedman that takes place in Linebaugh and Rediker's history, it will be useful
                     to consider one of Rediker's later essays, 
                     “The Red Atlantic,”
                      that describes Stedman's role as a carrier of knowledge. Rediker reads William Blake’s
                     poetic protagonist, Red Orc, from <em>America, a Prophecy</em> to continue his project of tracing resistance from below in the Age of Revolution.
                     (Blake engraved sixteen illustrations for the <em>Narrative</em> from watercolors and sketches done by Stedman while in Surinam.) Rediker argues that
                     a link between Red Orc and Stedman's narration of the execution on the rack of a slave
                     named Neptune “show[s] how the knowledge of both violence and resistance circulated
                     around the red Atlantic – how African rebels in America influenced Blake, who in turn
                     represented their struggle to a metropolitan public” (125). For Rediker, Stedman takes
                     on the role of mercenary-observer, recording the stoicism of Akan-speaking people.
                     Their revolutionary spirit moves through the middle passage, to gallows resistance
                     in Surinam, and eventually to the pages of Blake's poem. Stedman remains a colonial
                     oppressor while Blake, the artist, gets the creative glory. While focusing on the
                     circulation of revolutionary knowledge through the Neptune-to-Red Orc transformation,
                     Rediker acknowledges Stedman as the source for more of Blake's material, particularly
                     as the inspiration for 
                     “The Tyger.”

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The Prices' introduction discusses the Stedman / Blake interplay (xxxix). </span></div>
                     </div> Taking up this particular moment of exchange at the end of <em>The Many Headed Hydra</em>, Linebaugh and Rediker demarcate their roles as follows: “Stedman respected the creature,
                     but only with the hunter's wish to kill it. Blake also wondered about the relation
                     between hunter and hunted, but he widened it to include the larger social forces of
                     oppressor and the oppressed” (349). By considering the role of each in these terms,
                     Linebaugh and Rediker tend to align Stedman with a sort of colonial realism, in which
                     he becomes the predator par excellence and his writing becomes bare record. Blake,
                     whose vision is limited to what Stedman reports, gains the artistic and romantic receptivity
                     to the latent content – the disease-as-knowledge that Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> carries.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Considering Stedman's experience in the larger context of the Stedman Archive reveals
                  the extent to which the <em>Narrative</em> exceeds the function of being a bare conveyor of history; the text's self-conscious
                  construction of Stedman's character and the plurality of authorial and editorial influence
                  over the many versions of the <em>Narrative</em> argue against the stability of Stedman-as-recorder of a particular historical-material
                  moment. Yet even considering the <em>Narrative</em> as a stable text (Linebaugh and Rediker use the Prices' restored manuscript edition)
                  can yield a literary interpretation as well as a historical-materialist treatment
                  of the text. M. Allewaert considers Stedman to be representative of colonial writing
                  that is conscious of the “swamp sublime,” the ecological characteristic of the swamp
                  which undermines Enlightenment notions of the subject that she sees emerging as a
                  response to the author becoming a “citizen-subject of print culture.... [The] shift
                  from subjectivity to agency [in the swamp] testifies to an organization of political
                  life that is not dependent on the separation of subjects from the world.... [A]t precisely
                  the moment citizen-subjects were emerging in metropolitan centers, the plantation
                  zone gave rise to an ecological practice closely linked to <span class="foreign">marronage</span>, a process through which human agents found ways to interact with nonhuman forces
                  and in so doing resisted the order of the plantation” (341). For Allewaert, the swamp
                  becomes a manifestation of the sublime in its dangerous indeterminacy, penetrating
                  and altering the isolated subjectivity of the colonial master-class. It also becomes
                  the figurative reservoir for revolutionary resistance on behalf of the escaped and
                  revolting black populations of the plantation zone. Drawing upon Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> (again, the Prices' 1988 edition), Allewaert focuses on Stedman's appreciation of
                  the rebel's ability to use the terrain to their strategic advantage, closely reading
                  a Blake image to show the white colonial's discord with nature as juxtaposed to the
                  black assimilation to the natural landscape. While many other aspects of the text
                  speak to exchanges that undermine romantic notions of subjectivity (disease and inter-racial
                  sex particularly), Allewaert's discussion of Stedman emphasizes that Stedman's text
                  is an outgrowth from plantation zone experience rather than the preserved master-colonialist
                  gaze presumed by Linebaugh and Rediker.</p>
               <p>Stedman's personal experience is erased from Linebaugh and Rediker's hidden history
                  of the Revolutionary Atlantic, leaving only his role as a carrier and transmitter
                  of subversive history. Plates from Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> open and close <em>The Many Headed Hydra</em>, and indeed one figure graces its cover. The meditation of how Stedman impacted the
                  revolutionary Blake serves as the afterword to the text. Yet because Stedman fought
                  against the revolted slaves, he remains in Linebaugh and Rediker's critical estimate
                  synonymous with the forces of colonial domination. Stedman's ambiguous dexterity in
                  crossing plantation culture's social barriers, experience of inter-racial love, and
                  the specifics of his response as a witness to marroon resistance and the horrors of
                  slavery are all silenced in their history. Stedman's politics partly explain this
                  choice. He remained “moderate” on the issue of slavery following his return from Surinam,
                  and while his sympathies were against the brutality of the institution even to the
                  point of professing racial equality, he also, as the Prices' introduction puts it,
                  “rehearsed [in his manuscript] the whole panoply of already well-worn arguments in
                  favor of the continuation of slavery and the trade...” (lxii). Yet it is also necessary
                  to recall that it was Stedman, not Blake, who witnessed the colonial violence in Surinam,
                  and that his writings exhibit a profound difference between his own mindset and that
                  of the Surinam planters.</p>
               <p>Stedman's importance as a transmitter of Akan and other cultural legacies (with both
                  origins in Africa and new spontaneous cultural formations of the West Indies and other
                  Atlantic sites) should be considered as a sign of how the plantation zone had affected
                  his subjectivity. Although associated with the dominant military power, Stedman is
                  for that reason an importantly destabilizing vector for the transmission of African
                  diasporic culture. Speaking through Blake's plates and editorial muffling, Stedman's
                  mediated voice warns that the spread of knowledge about the Atlantic might always
                  require the flexibility of sounding through the very apparatus that would deny that
                  voice, passing the message on with the merest trace of an Akan accent. Witnessing
                  the spread of Stedman's knowledge through text necessarily requires flexibility in
                  relation to authorship, and speculation about the cultural saturation of the ideas
                  he helped to transmit must therefore trace both silences and echoes. </p>

               <p>What, then, is hidden in the Stedman Archive that makes it such a persistently engaged
                  group of texts in the long effort to overthrow slavery and racism? As versions and
                  variants of Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> proliferated over the course of two centuries, each new writer repeated Joseph Johnson's
                  original editorial effect by imposing their own emphasis on Stedman's experience.
                  While recent critical attention has treated Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> as a bearer of history and carrier of resistance in the Revolutionary Atlantic, a
                  distinct genealogy has emerged in both primary and secondary retellings of the <em>Narrative</em> that focuses on the relationship between Stedman, Joanna, and their son, Johnny.
                  For hidden history, the act of producing a genealogy is everything; it is the tool
                  by which alternate archives of historical possibility become visible. While this sense
                  of genealogy certainly applies, there is a quality to the Stedman Archive that exceeds
                  the act of revelation. The problem with genealogy, as a word, is that it is implicitly
                  associated with a system of reproduction and family that assumes many things about
                  the appropriateness of family, love, and childbearing. All of these assumptions of
                  typicality work against the transgressive aspect of Stedman and Joanna's relationship
                  – if, that is, it does exceed the ongoing exploitation of people under slavery. If
                  Stedman's text contains something that is passed on through its viral reproduction,
                  another term from the rhetoric of disease can be useful for understanding the limitations
                  inherent in the concept of genealogy. A virus is also a pathogen, a word that combines
                  the concepts of pathos and genesis, suffering and passion given birth. As the Stedman
                  Archive takes shape under the guidance of editors and re-writers, Stedman, Joanna,
                  and Johnny form the passionate center driving reproduction of Stedman's text.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Many people have been drawn to this aspect of Stedman's text. In 1834, prominent U.S.
                     abolitionist Lydia Maria Child excerpted the material related to Joanna from the <em>Narrative</em> for inclusion in the gift-book, <em>The Oasis</em>. Child's reasons for drawing on Stedman's experience were strategic; the abolitionist
                     movement in the United States had experienced a series of violent anti-abolitionist
                     riots fueled by the mob's fear and repulsion of inter-racial marriage. By returning
                     to a British source, Child was able to include an example of inter-racial desire among
                     the many other anti-slavery pieces of <em>The Oasis</em>, a collection including poems, factoids, short stories, dramatic sketches, personal
                     narratives, legal summaries, and a biography of William Wilberforce, the British abolitionist
                     who led the parliamentary effort to abolish the slave trade in 1807. As the first
                     abolitionist gift-book in the U.S., its purpose was to describe abolitionism to a
                     diverse audience unfamiliar with the growing movement.

                              was well received as the first abolitionist gift-book, but its sales disappointed
                              Child, who had the volume published at her own expense. The more successful abolitionist
                              gift-book The Liberty Bell, edited by Maria Chapman and published for several consecutive
                              years, was printed more modestly, was funded by donation, and sold at anti-slavery
                              bazaars. Child's involvement with the later Liberty Bell includes the stories 
                              “The Quadroons,”

                     writing directed at both adult and young readers. Inter-racial desire remained a fixture
                     of Child's fiction throughout her career, and including Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> allowed her to broach the topic amid the storm of racist violence of the 1830s. Child's
                     redacted version reveals the wide scope of Stedman's <em>Narrative</em>, for while his relationship with Joanna becomes one of the major components of his
                     account, it makes up only forty pages when extracted and reprinted in <em>The Oasis</em>. Although it is by far the largest portion of Child's gift-book, this accounts for
                     a relatively small portion of the sprawling two volume, eight-hundred page original
                     edition of the <em>Narrative</em>.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Child's redacted version of the <em>Narrative</em> highlights how emphasizing the positive aspects of Stedman and Joanna's relationship
                     can have a silencing effect of its own. The anti-abolitionist politics of Child's
                     time required a de-emphasis of inter-racial sexuality, resulting in an even further
                     refiguring of Joanna into what Jenny Sharpe identifies as the universal model of womanhood.
                     In trying to use the sexual degradation of women as an argument against slavery, abolitionists
                     sought to extend their contemporaneous culture's conceptions of womanhood across racial
                     lines in an empowering way. The problem of this logic, as Sharpe reminds us, is that
                     “[b]y defining slave women's lives as simply the negation of the domestic happiness
                     that white women enjoyed.... this discourse fails to contend with the kind of domesticity
                     white men established with their concubines in the colonies≵ (85).

                              domesticity, Sharpe is too quick to condemn Child as complicit with the race prejudices
                              of her time. Speaking directly to her period's intense and violent response to inter-racial
                              marriage, Child quips ironically to reassure her readers that “should any fastidious
                              readers be alarmed, I beg leave to assure them that the Abolitionists have no wish

                     </div> Working from the editorialized 1796 version of the <em>Narrative</em>, Child's version remains true to the text, but furthered Johnson's removal of Stedman's
                     sexual attraction to Joanna and other enslaved women by altering the image of Joanna
                     for her gift-book, covering Joanna's exposed breast.

                     of the picture" (97). By emphasizing the domestic relationship between Stedman, Joanna,
                     and Johnny, Child's edition calls attention to an inter-racial marriage while silencing
                     the sexual content of the wider <em>Narrative</em>. Images of torture and bondage that Marcus Wood has read as colonial pornography
                     are shed, leaving an example of inter-racial domesticity that has been modestly clothed.

                     example of universal womanhood in the nineteenth century. Rather than read Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> for the reflection of colonial exploitation and silence, Gilroy emphasizes Stedman
                     and Joanna's love as a condition that shapes Stedman's and his readers' consciousness
                     of slavery. The cover illustration for <em>Stedman and Joanna – A Love in Bondage</em> (1992) provides a good example of the type of re-writing the original undergoes in
                     Gilroy’s text.

                     </div> Standing side by side, Stedman appears in his Scott's Brigade uniform, while Joanna
                     is posed with one arm wrapped around his waist. The miniature inset in the image’s
                     bottom left corner depicting Joanna and Johnny is emphasized by Stedman's pointing
                     hand. Palm fronds and rope provide the mixed-media background, and Gilroy's dependence
                     on Stedman's private journals and letters is emphasized by the overlaid manuscript
                     writing. Stedman and Joanna's image juxtaposition enacts the same overall effect achieved
                     in Gilroy's rewriting. Stedman retains his significance as a colonial officer, but
                     has been removed from the iconography of colonial domination (Stedman’s figure is
                     cropped from an image in which he stands over the corpse of a maroon rebel). Instead,
                     Gilroy depicts Stedman as an introspective protagonist struggling to come to terms
                     with the ill effects of colonial slavery from well before his deployment until long
                     afterwards. Joanna has been returned to her sexualized state (her breast is again
                     uncovered), but has gained the agency of being a desiring subject herself. She has
                     the ability to touch Stedman sexually, undoing in part the ubiquitous degradation
                     of women under slavery. The sum total of the image shows another way of reading the <em>Narrative</em>, that its sexual content is both exploitative and transgressive. For as much as Gilroy's
                     image manipulation decontextualizes its figures, it also is able to show visually
                     the content of the <em>Narrative</em> that had drawn readers for two centuries. Using their portraits from the original
                     text, the cover depicts Stedman and Joanna's fraught domesticity.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In <em>The German Ideology</em>, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels describe the family as the original location for
                  the alienation of labor as private property. Their description is interesting for
                  the imaginative work that it must do as Marx and Engels transplant the family as it
                  existed in the nineteenth century back in time as an original, and eerily timeless,
                  first stage of human social organization. They write: “the first form [of private
                  property and unequal distribution] lies in the family, where wife and children are
                  the slaves of the husband. This latent slavery in the family, though still very crude,
                  is the first property, but even at this early stage it corresponds perfectly to the
                  definition of modern economists who call it the power of disposing of the labour-power
                  of others” (159-60). A few necessary points need to be made. First, in projecting
                  the heterosexual, monogamous, indeed the strangely <em>nuclear</em> family structure, Marx and Engels are not describing the early dependence of human
                  society on the power relations contained in the family structure, but rather their
                  own time's simultaneous dependence on the family, <em>as well as</em> the dependence on investing that structure with the labels primitive and “natural.”
                  The ideology of the family, then, constructs the family as an incredibly old and unchanging
                  set of relationships capable of replication but not alteration, when in fact it is
                  a series of relationships that are modern, rather than ancient. A second point to
                  note is the reflection of slavery within their description of the family. Acknowledging
                  the power that one form of social organization has to reflect in another is useful
                  for understanding the revolutionary potential of the Stedman household. If Marx and
                  Engels' logic is troublesome because it imagines the growing up of slavery from within
                  the family to a global state of race-based plantation slavery as a modern, “natural”
                  outgrowth of the most intimate human relationships, then Stedman's example shows the
                  opposite potential of the domestic as a way to deny race as the primary feature of
                  his son's identity. Instead of calling backward to make the family into an origin,
                  Stedman recognizes the simultaneity of the family and slavery. The importance of the
                  mixed-race Stedman household stems not from any attempt of Stedman to interfere with
                  the system of slavery, which he did not, but rather emerges from Stedman's refusal
                  to let the relations of colonial slavery dictate his relations of domesticity.</p>

                  <p>Stedman altered the conventions of British society both in his daily life and in his
                     public writings by incorporating new experiences of eighteenth-century life within
                     the familiar narratives of experience. Following his return to Europe, Stedman produced
                     his <em>Narrative</em> for print while keeping a journal that records his exceptional family’s experience
                     in British society. In order to make sense of his time in Surinam, Stedman drew from
                     literary conventions, characters, and narratives to tell his story. His private writings
                     from the same period record his mixed-race, mixed-nationality household from the domestic
                     perspective, depicting both the strained relationship between Stedman's Dutch wife,
                     Adrianna, and Johnny, as well as Stedman’s emphatic inclusion of Johnny within traditional
                     familial relationships. If Stedman “re-wrote” his and Joanna's relationship into the
                     normative codes of domesticity, then his journalistic evidence of an analogous effort
                     to establish Johnny socially within the codes of relation and inheritance tempers
                     the critical assumption that such re-writing is necessarily aligned with a system
                     of colonial domination.

                              construction of Joanna in terms of sentimentality and the ongoing violence of slavery:
                              "While Stedman intermittently represses the evidence of Joanna's incorporation in
                              slave society in order to define her as an interlude or a relief from torture for

                              and in fact, many of his effects depend precisely on her endangered status. The sentimentalized
                              description of Joanna that Stedman produces, with its dematerialized eroticism, …</span></div>
                     </div> Stedman’s readiness to bend the normative forces of domesticity to include the potential
                     for legitimized inter-racial relationships is a radically destabilizing social scenario.
                     While the racial power dynamics of plantation slavery made Joanna sexually available
                     to Stedman in Surinam, his continual effort to endow their relationship with consent
                     and love in his writings generated cultural tension by denying Joanna's reduction
                     to a sexual commodity. Stedman's “cleaning up” of the sexual relations in the colonial
                     system by scripting them within the codes of the British middle class family is then
                     both at once a problematic erasure of colonial power and a powerful challenge of the
                     homogenous constitution of the nation-state. Stedman's re-writing of Joanna denies
                     her reduction to a sexual commodity, implicitly denying his own association as a white
                     male consumer of subjugated women. The mitigating quality of this particular recorded
                     relationship is that the denial does not transpire in silence as so many others did.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At the end the five years expedition, Stedman left Joanna and Johnny in Surinam to
                     return to Europe. In the <em>Narrative</em>, Joanna is depicted as having the agency to decide not to return with Stedman “first
                     from a Consciousness that with propriety she had not the disposal of herself - &amp; Secondly
                     from pride, wishing in her Present Condition Rather to be one of the first amongst
                     her own Class in America, than as she was well Convinced to be the last in Europe
                     at least till such time as fortune should enable me to establish her above dependance”
                     (1988, 603). The only record of Joanna’s choice is inundated with Stedman’s narrative
                     authority, and in itself is at best a compromised version of what grounds their domestic
                     relationship may have entailed. Joanna's choice in this moment signals a much wider
                     comprehension of what her and Stedman's relationship would mean in the wider context
                     of colonization, rather than being limited to the local plantation society. When the <em>Narrative</em> gives Joanna agency, however, it exonerates Stedman of not only his role as a colonial
                     exploiter of women (Joanna's choice of separation is made on other grounds), but also
                     his abandonment. If the Stedman Archive was limited to the core texts, it would be
                     difficult to argue that Stedman has been judged unfairly as a practitioner of the
                     colonial romance and the mystification that authorship has the power to produce over
                     any scene. By reading this moment in the <em>Narrative</em> against the wider collection of journals and textual variation in the archive, it
                     becomes clear that their domestic relationship remained in place even while they were
                     separated by vast geographic distance. Following Joanna's death three years later
                     (reputedly by poisoning), Johnny, who had been manumitted before Stedman’s return,
                     traveled to Europe to live with his father.

                              bondage, Johnny’s manumission, and Stedman’s return to Europe, Sharpe observes that
                              Joanna’s agency in the scenario likely opened the way for her son’s freedom as much
                              or more than Stedman’s efforts and finances would allow (75-77).</span></div>
                     </div> The Stedman family in Europe was then composed of Stedman, his Dutch wife Adrianna
                     (whom he married while Joanna was yet alive), and Johnny.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The relationship between Stedman and Joanna evokes the unequal social agencies produced
                  by colonial slavery between white men and women of color. In <em>Ghosts of Slavery</em>, Jenny Sharpe draws on the differences between Stedman’s <em>Narrative</em> and his journal accounts of his time in Surinam to uncover probable moments of agency
                  that Joanna would have had working within the social practice of concubinage in colonial
                  Surinam. In an effort to de-sanctify Stedman’s account of their relationship, Sharpe
                  emphasizes the removal of any mention of monetary exchange from the public telling
                  of their relationship in the <em>Narrative</em>, even though the negotiation of payment is a process recorded in the comparatively
                  private journal entries. While Stedman made this change in an effort to construct
                  his relationship with Joanna outside of the practice of concubinage and within the
                  normalized conceptions of marriage, Sharpe locates Joanna's not-quite-agency not as
                  the decision-making self control of the liberal subject but rather as a generalized
                  social position experienced by women in her position in slave society. Rather than
                  privilege the idea of universal womanhood by which Joanna as an individual transcends
                  the larger degraded experience of slavery, Sharpe finds her silenced choice at the
                  moment when her sexual availability becomes a negotiable social relationship through
                  the practice of contractual prostitution. Joanna’s limited complicity with slave society’s
                  social practices allows her to partially navigate among sexual relationships (being
                  raped, paid, or consenting to concubinage), but Sharpe reminds us that Joanna’s choice
                  does not equate to a resistance, for there was no position for refusal (xvii-xviii).</p>
               <p>Sharpe argues that Stedman’s <em>Narrative</em> constructs Joanna as an early version of the tragic mulatto figure, fulfilling the
                  social role of wife within the custom of concubinage only until replaced by a white
                  wife in the future. Stedman, notoriously, did precisely this by marrying Adrianna
                  while Joanna was still alive. However, the journal legacy of his later domestic life
                  counters an outright dismissal of Joanna within the narrative and social codes of
                  marriage. The Stedman archive provides a text in which the silence of sexual exploitation
                  is provocatively read, but only with the foreclosure of long-term family relationships.
                  Johnny's inclusion in the multi-national Stedman household reconstitutes the domestic
                  as a location for social change capable of supplementing the prevailing truths of
                  colonial domination.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Accounting for Johnny’s continued inclusion in the Stedman family draws attention
                     to the changing social disapprobation of inter-racial relationships in Europe over
                     the longer scale of the archive. While Stedman’s relationship to Johnny is a major
                     focus of the journals, antiquarian Stanbury Thompson editorializes throughout his
                     print edition of these materials to remind the reader of the race difference between
                     them by steadily footnoting Johnny as “quadroon,” and leaving him off Stedman’s family
                     tree at the opening of the book.

                              tutor of Stedman's quadroon son" (267). To open his discussion of Johnny's death in
                              his biography of Stedman, Thompson begins, "Major John Gabriel Stedman's last letter
                              to his quadroon son Johnny, is well known" (62). Unaware of his ironic reproduction
                              of his own demarcation of Johnny's race, Thompson concludes: “How easy it is to perceive
                              from the above lines, that the quadroon was a victim of slander, calumniation, what
                              we call today, the colour bar, or class distinction in a sense. Man is only equal

                     </div> Thompson's alterations produce a distinction in the Stedman household based on race,
                     which the journals themselves steadily refute.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Taken together, Sharpe and Thompson's usage of the journals illustrate two key interpretive
                  assumptions. First, since the journals are more record-like than the <em>Narrative</em>, they are assumed to contain more truth than Stedman's other writings. Their authenticity
                  becomes revelatory particularly in the case when they record the monetary negotiations
                  of his relationship with Joanna which are entirely written out of the sentimentalized
                  version found in the <em>Narrative</em>. For criticism attentive to this discrepancy, their relationship becomes an exchange
                  of prostitution in the last resort. Extending the emphasis placed on the journal as
                  the record of a hidden, private reality, Stedman's depiction of his relationship with
                  Johnny in the journals should be judged on the same grounds. Second, Thompson's editorialization
                  represents a lingering critical and social uneasiness surrounding Stedman's relationship
                  with both Joanna and Johnny, as well as racial integration in general. Linebaugh and
                  Rediker's uneasy dependence on Stedman's text (Stedman being an enemy of the commons
                  revolution) and Sharpe's adamant emphasis on his complicity with gendered colonial
                  power relations define important ways that Stedman's subject position is shot-through
                  with condemnable affiliations. In spite of this, Stedman's subsequent writings continue
                  to transmit a fundamental disconnection from the colonial dominant subjectivity. Though
                  Johnny's origins are troublesome to contemporary critical assessment, his role within
                  society resulting from his inclusion within the domestic relationships of Stedman's
                  family remains resoundingly opposite to that of the majority of social relations between
                  white male and enslaved females. Rather than accept the convoluted logic of the slave
                  system, Stedman instead chose the domestic as the major narrative for his relationship
                  with his son.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Stedman’s journal reveals to us that Johnny’s life was one filled with school, tutors,
                     trips to the local fair, and practical jokes. There is also an unmistakable tension
                     between Johnny and his stepmother, and there are many entries in which Stedman defends
                     Johnny from her anger or sends him out of the house. The following series of relevant
                     entries from 1784 through the New Year narrate the difficult navigation of Johnny’s

               <p>Stedman's journals mix a day to day record of household expenses with short descriptions
                  of the events transpiring in his family's life. This section, narrowed down to a sequence
                  of events that links the birth of Stedman and Adrianna's first child together with
                  a series of painful illnesses, offers a compelling opportunity to speculate on how
                  the material could take shape if it were re-written as narrative in the Stedman Archive.
                  Beryl Gilroy draws from this material twice as she adds Stedman's post-Surinam life
                  as context for her interpretation of his relationship with Joanna, using both Johnny's
                  gift to George and his swallowing of the pin to locate him in the household. Gilroy
                  disassociates the two moments into isolated events, rather than narrate their unfolding
                  as an intertwined sequence of events (171-2). Taken as a linear sequence, these journal
                  entries depict the destabilizing threat that the birth of George represented to Johnny's
                  role in the household. Stedman's first socially legitimized (in wedlock and in race)
                  son arrives to much fanfare. Johnny swallows a large pin, and whether intentionally
                  or not, is forced back into the household's attention, even if it is a negative attention.
                  Johnny's gesture toward George, along with Stedman's insistence on their brotherhood,
                  navigates the domestic crisis; Johnny's gift of money symbolically negates the race
                  relations of the larger capital system, rendering Johnny both a position of agency
                  in economic exchange, and a recognized location within the Stedman household's relations
                  of reproduction.</p>
               <p>If the Stedman household acted as a space for a different system of relationships
                  than those typically resulting from colonialism, the journals also suggest Stedman's
                  continuing concern over British society's acceptance of racialized violence. Stedman
                  records on Febuary 10th, 1785 that one “Capt. Kenneth Mackenzie [was] reprieved from
                  being hanged, for killing a man on the coast of Africa, by blowing him off from the
                  mouth of a cannon” (<em>Journal</em> 251). Five years later, at fifteen, Johnny went before the mast, making two voyages
                  to the West Indies. During his last (and fifth total) voyage, Johnny died off the
                  coast of Jamaica; the only direct record of Stedman's response remains a letter to
                  his brother, William George, while in Holland. Stedman clearly expected a juridical
                  investigation into Johnny's death: “There being but two men with him at the time,
                  they are, by all, suspected guilty of his death, and now upon their trial in London
                  before Sir Sampson Wright”(Thompson 65). In crafting his biography of Stedman, Thompson
                  researched English court records, but was unable to locate any judicial proceedings
                  in Johnny's case.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>If Stedman lacked a legal resolution in the death of his son, his <em>Narrative</em> provided him a public forum for representing its meaning. Stedman's journals from
                     the time of this letter are missing, but his effort to memorialize Johnny results
                     in an essential variation between the <em>Narrative</em>'s first edition and the Prices' revised manuscript edition. Critics and readers now
                     encounter Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> through the Prices' edition, which consistently allows Stedman's original authorial
                     intent to separate himself from prevailing cultural biases toward race and slavery.
                     And yet, by reverting to the 1790 manuscript, the Prices’ edition significantly alters
                     the legacy of Johnny Stedman. Johnny's death off the coast of Jamaica was marked in
                     the first print edition by the inclusion of 
                     “An Elegy on My Sailor”
                      as the conclusion of the text. Reverting, in this case, removes an update which likely
                     had Stedman’s support, and which stressed the legacy of race in Stedman’s re-writing
                     of his time in Surinam. In this sense, the Prices’ excellent edition, responsible
                     for recalling Stedman's reputation from the pro-slavery editorialization of the 1796
                     edition, also edits the legacy of Johnny and the text via the absence of the elegy.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For the Prices' discussion of this alteration, see their introduction (lv-lvii). </span></div>
                     </div> <br/> While the two endings follow a similar trajectory, the difference between the final
                     images oscillate between a hopeful endorsement of colonial Britain (both in the <em>1790</em> manuscript and the Prices' 1988 edition based on the manuscript) and a tragic foreclosure
                     of Stedman's happiness resulting from continued colonial activity (the first and subsequent
                     print editions until 1988). Both endings record the news of Joanna's death by poison,
                     and Johnny's removal to Europe to be with his father. The manuscript account carefully
                     includes Stedman's marriage to Adrianna as a response to this news: “now a young Lady
                     whom I thought nearest Approach'd to her [Joanna] in every Virtue help'd to Support
                     my Grief by becoming my Other Partner.... I Sought no other Fortune &amp; with this Amiable
                     new Companion &amp; my boy, whom she tenderly Loves, I peacably Retired to the Fruitful
                     Country of <em>devon</em> in England...” (1988, 625). While Stedman had married Adrianna before this news, his
                     effort to construct the sequence of events according to a proper narrative furthers
                     his project of legitimizing his relationship with Joanna and Johnny within the parameters
                     of traditional domestic relations. Adrianna is directly compared to Joanna in virtue,
                     contrary to Sharpe's description of concubinage as a scenario wherein women of color
                     hold the place which will be occupied by a proper white woman in the future.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The manuscript version offers continuity between Stedman's two families, and continues
                  by briefly narrating a scene of domestic bliss in which Johnny is saved by way of
                  his position within the family. Thinking he had already had the smallpox, Johnny gets
                  inoculated with the rest of the family “only to encourage his Brother,” but becomes
                  unexpectedly ill with the rest of the family, having only had the waterpox before.
                  A brief anecdote, Stedman nevertheless uses the concept of inoculation to present
                  Johnny as a fellow sufferer in the family's precautions rather than an “immune” inhabitant
                  of the West Indies. After briefly relating Johnny's later service to “the Kingdom
                  of Great Britain” in the merchant fleet and navy, Stedman closes his manuscript with
                  a depiction of Britain's future: “While, long, long, may you live &amp; be happy in the
                  Bless'd Island, accumulating wealth with honor &amp; Surrounded with victory, till the
                  Lowest subject amongst you shall have Ascended to the highest pinnacle of unfading
                  Glory -- Finis” (1988, 626). In relation to the long description of Stedman's own
                  service in the colonies, the insularity of this last line rings at least somewhat
                  ironic. Offering a vision which places the colonial center at the pinnacle of glory,
                  Stedman bases that vision on an advancement of the “lowest subject.” Taking Stedman's
                  own household as the benchmark of this accumulated glory, the colonial power's ascendancy
                  is predicated on Johnny's happy inclusion in the domestic realm. </p>
               <p>The 1796 edition follows the news of Joanna's death not with a transition to Stedman's
                  integrated family, but instead turns quickly to Johnny's death and elegy. The exclusion
                  of social integration serves to demarcate Johnny firmly within the realm of the colonial
                  periphery, rather than acknowledge his position within British society or the domestic
                  sphere. Yet while the conservative first edition forecloses both the acknowledgment
                  and acceptance of Johnny within British society, it also emphasizes the importance
                  of Stedman's relationship to his son and Joanna. Markedly, the elegy allows Stedman
                  to describe the domestic unity with Joanna displaced by his return to Europe:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p>The departed Johnny's body, poetically praised for its "blooming age" and "olive-beauty,"
                  offsets the two lines containing the "rage" of the ocean and the "scorn" of European
                  racial biases. The evidence for Stedman's alternate understanding of the world – a
                  different sort of "optics" in the poem's terminology -- is contained in the poem's
                  logical inversion of the colonizers as "European slaves." In 1792, at the time of
                  his son's death, Stedman viewed the world quite differently than the way enshrined
                  in the ending of the 1790 manuscript. </p>
               <p>The belief that Stedman had found a space for Johnny within British society at the
                  apex of colonialism is displaced by the material (and racial) poetics of the elegy.
                  He could look at his son and see both himself and the "sterling" worth of life that
                  the economic drive to accumulate guineas made invisible. The elegy concludes with
                  an image that completes the exclusion of Stedman's Surinam family from the domestic
                  space of the British nation, but in so doing emphasizes the <em>Narrative</em>'s purpose in describing the familial-social aspect of his time in Surinam:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">Fly, gentle shade – fly to that blest abode,</div>
                     <div class="l">There view they <em>mother</em> – and adore thy GOD:</div>
                     <div class="l">There, Oh! My Boy!--- on that celestial shore,</div>
                     <div class="l">Oh! May we gladly meet-and part no more!!!</div>
                     <div class="l">A Parent. (2: 403)<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Rather than the long-term accumulation of wealth, Stedman's 1796 ending subverts
                  his return to Europe by imagining the heavenly reunion with Joanna and Johnny. The
                  foreclosure of racial mixture within British society is only enacted through the emphatic
                  presentation of Stedman's inter-racial family in heaven, and the erasure of Adrianna
                  and the other children from the account.</p>
               <p>Though Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> reached a wide audience, appearing in multiple editions and languages, the revolutionary
                  domestic relationship between Stedman and his son found another, spontaneous vector
                  of dissemination among the larger culture. Forms of popular publication including
                  periodicals and epistolary sample books gave Stedman’s writings a perpetual access
                  to the household ramparts of British middle-class ideology. Stedman composed a letter
                  to his son intending it as a portion of Johnny’s inheritance to be delivered after
                  the elder Stedman's death. A journal entry from January 14, 1787 reports that Stedman
                  showed the letter to Johnny once, before sealing it up with several important documents,
                  including Johnny’s manumission certificate, baptism record, and other legal detritus
                  from the Surinam court. Following Johnny's death off the coast of Jamaica, this letter
                  found its way into print, receiving sustained republication (sometimes sourced, other
                  times not) as an example of the highest sentiment of the father-son relationship.</p>
               <p>For the many editors of the various publications which reprinted Stedman’s letter
                  to Johnny as an example of the epistolary art, the prevailing trend was to reprint
                  it without too much bother about either the stability of the text or its original
                  context. While these eighteenth and nineteenth-century editors typically maintain
                  Stedman's name, the re-printings (other than <em>The Weekly Entertainer</em>) lack any mention of a race context, and instead slip into the naturalizing assumption
                  that the sentiment of the father-son relationship on display is as socially typical
                  as it is well expressed. By this assumption, the colonial context of Stedman and Johnny’s
                  relationship is forgotten, consummating the inclusion of the legacy of colonial race
                  relations within the domestic codes of British middle-class ideology. While the meaning
                  of race for the readers of this letter is not directly challenged, this nevertheless
                  represents how an unmarked and subtle counter-example to the hegemony of an assumed
                  British homogeneity came to be absorbed within the boundaries of normalcy.</p>
               <p>The letter reached print twice before coming to Stedman’s attention. The first printing,
                  in <em>Gentleman’s Magazine</em> (Sept 1793) is typical of later printings; the brief introduction lacks any specification
                  of race, focusing instead on the context of Stedman’s military gentility and recovery
                  from illness. (Many subsequent letters would get even this fact wrong, presuming Stedman
                  to have died before his son, further naturalizing the letter into presumptions about
                  genealogy and descent.) The publishing history of the letter continues in <em>The Weekly Entertainer</em>, the only printing accompanied by an introduction from Johnny’s tutor which specifically
                  polices race by marking Stedman’s son as “mulatto.” By 1796, the letter appeared three
                  more times, in <em>The Correspondent</em> as a reprint from <em>The European Magazine</em> (April, 1795), and also in <em>Town and Country Magazine</em> (July 1795). Following this spate of publication, the letter circulates well into
                  the nineteenth century, appearing in the <em>Journal of Health Conducted by an Association of Physicians</em> (Feb 1833), the <em>Parlor Letter Writer, and Secretary’s Assistant</em> (1845), and the <em>American Fashionable Letter Writer</em> as late as 1850. These many printings attest to the popularity of the letter’s sentiment,
                  and unlike the legal documents of emancipation it was once sealed with, Stedman’s
                  letter records and transmits a version of history that willingly inverts and forgets
                  the racial hierarchies of his time. The letter took on a life of its own, but it also
                  marks a propagation of sentiment between Stedman and his son.</p>
               <p>Knowing the historical specificity of the circumstances of its composition allows
                  current readers to understand the truly provocative nature of the letter, and the
                  extent to which Stedman’s writing inverts the hierarchies of racism within its message.
                  Stedman implores Johnny: “love Mrs. Stedman [his step-mother] and her little children
                  from your heart… thou are a brother to her helpless little ones”. The letter imagines
                  a unity of Stedman’s British household on earth, but the story is different in heaven,
                  recalling the elegy's ending of the <em>1796</em> edition. Stedman writes that he and Johnny might, “together with your beloved Mother
                  my Dear Johanna - have a chance once more to meet where in the presence of our Heavenly
                  Benefactor - our Joy - and Happiness shall be Eternal and Compleat” (January 14, 1787).
                  Stedman’s heavenly family, then, is once again his Surinam family. Without the colonial
                  specificity, this sentiment of reunion operates within the context of a heavenly reward,
                  and within the traditional narrative structures of the domestic sphere. Stedman’s
                  imaginative effort to value his relationship with Joanna inverts the hierarchies of
                  race on which his contemporary world depended. This sentiment disseminated throughout
                  culture at large, spreading the inversion of black and white wives to an unknowingly
                  accepting public.</p>

               <p>Stedman's pen sent the message that he considered his relationships with Joanna and
                  Johnny to be equitable and meaningful within the social patterns of his contemporaneous
                  culture. Whether through editorial distortion, free appropriation to other ends, or
                  strategic re-tellings, Stedman's record of inter-racial relationships has proven invaluable
                  to studies of colonialism. The line between public and private writing has dimmed
                  as authors and critics return to previously unpublished material for analysis, but
                  the archive itself illustrates that the instability of authorial intent is a vital
                  characteristic of circulating knowledge. Stedman's influence on Blake does more than
                  connect the legacy of Akan speaking peoples of Africa to a radical poetics distributed
                  to British culture. Tracking the circulation of revolutionary ideas fundamentally
                  destabilizes authorship, and the notions of identity and ownership associated with
                  it. Between Stedman, Blake, the sundry editors who either mediated or appropriated
                  Stedman's writings over more than two centuries, critics, and contemporary writers
                  who re-tell his story, treating Stedman as the sole authorial agency at work in constructing
                  the material in the archive would be to ignore the web of social connections also
                  at work contributing to the text's meaning over time. </p>
               <p>Many agencies have supported the distribution of Stedman's writings, with various
                  ideological reasons for doing so. The original imperialist perspective of an account
                  of life in the colonies (emphasized by Johnson in the first edition) is never isolated
                  from the domestic sentiment of the archive highlighted by the fashionable magazines,
                  nor from the nineteenth-century abolitionist attraction to Joanna's domesticity in
                  Lydia Maria Child's re-production of the family elements of the <em>Narrative</em> in her gift-book <em>The Oasis</em>, nor Beryl Gilroy's post-colonial incorporation of Stedman's early and later life
                  in her retelling of their story in <em>Stedman and Joanna - A Love in Bondage</em>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As a publicly traded (and supplemented or de-historicized) text, the Stedman archive
                     brings to attention the transformation of Stedman from author to character. Deidre
                     Lynch's <em>The Economy of Character</em> identifies fictions of social circulation as a key component of mass British culture's
                     literary self-fashioning in the eighteenth century. From the familiar narratives of
                     items (most often money) circulating in society and tales of social pretension such
                     as Henry Fielding's <em>Tom Jones</em> or Tobias Smollett's <em>Roderick Random</em>, Lynch identifies the key binary between sameness and singularity underlying the
                     social function offered by fictions of circulation. The difference of character is
                     between the uniqueness of the “bland handsomeness” of the generalized, exchangeable
                     gentleman (even on the face of the coin) and the uniqueness of everyone else. Marking
                     both the “high” and the “low” of society, the difference “between those qualified
                     to observe and those who are objects of others' observation” in these stories of circulation,
                     Lynch's critique of character identifies the social use such narratives had for rendering
                     society as an economically comprehensible whole (82). Stedman's <em>Narrative</em>, and hence the archive, begins with a determined self-fashioning by way of direct
                     references to Jones and Random. If these characters allude to the cultural picaresque
                     narrative which Lynch describes as the accumulation of experience in preparation for
                     the attainment of the privileged social position of the gentleman, they also mark
                     Stedman's own incomplete inhabitation of the dominant male-imperial perspective. Unlike
                     Jones and Random, Stedman does not only accumulate social experience or wealth, he
                     accumulates intimate domestic relationships. As a result, the Stedman archive represents
                     an effort to define character at odds with the logics of capital exchange – a character
                     that circulates, rather than accumulates, knowledge.

               <p>Standing at the edge of his own transmogrification from an author to a character,
                  Stedman defines himself through the complex idea of singularity. Singularity is unlike
                  the uniqueness deployed in Lynch's analysis. For her model, uniqueness polices the
                  boundary between the category of the exchangeable, bland gentleman-observer who does
                  not bear the weight of having a distinct identity (and therefore being unmarked as
                  an “other” from the colonial perspective) and everyone else who has been isolated
                  from power by their uniqueness not as a category, but as a subject of the capitalist-male-imperial-gaze.
                  Stedman's singularity is not an isolating adjective, though it is limiting. The phrase
                  “studying to be singular” originates in Stedman’s journal entry from November 29,
                  1785. The Prices use Stedman’s phrase in their introduction when introducing his character,
                  and focus on the portion of the entry that is self-reflective. The following is the
                  whole entry, produced as a conglomeration of the original format and spelling of the
                  diary, and the Prices’ {entry}, whose glosses appear in [brackets]: <span class="quote">‘I again dine with Smale - and write to Watson with sarge samples - I call on Capt.
                     Farguson. What is remarkable is that {in all places I have been beloved by the inhabitants
                     when known but at first cald mad in Scotland, mased [confused] in England, fou [crazy]
                     by the namurois [Belgians], gek or dol [crazy or mad] by the Duch, and law [Sranan
                     for insane] by the negros in Surinam, owing intirely to my studying to be singular
                     in as much as can be so} - Ma family consists of 4 people only, yet four different
                     nations viz Scotch – Dutch – English - and American, who speak no less than 6 different
                     languages --- The people in Devonshire never Swear, nor have I heard one speak ill
                     of another during almost 9 months I have lived in it. (November 29 1785)’</span> Stedman’s singularity is, in the Prices’ quote, a method by which Stedman has recursively
                  become known and accepted by various cultural groups, in spite of his initial strangeness.
                  The context for this process is also important. The everyday matter which precedes
                  Stedman’s contemplation is typical for other entries in the journal, insomuch as they
                  record day to day events and accounting tables. Whatever caused Stedman to record
                  this reflection, whether linked to his visits or letter writing or no, is not specified.
                  Importantly, though, his thoughts on “being singular” are not limited to his own character,
                  but also extend to his family. The four people mentioned are Stedman and Adrianna,
                  his second son, George William, and Johnny. The final line completes the thought;
                  Stedman’s family have been in Devonshire for nearly a year, and have grown used to
                  their English neighbors. Presumably, the mased, or confused, perception of the Stedmans
                  is wearing off.</p>
               <p>According to Samuel Johnson’s dictionary from 1785, there were two main meanings of
                  “singular” in common use when describing a person’s character or an event. While in
                  a strict sense singular can mean "Alone; that of which there is but one," this falls
                  short of the way in which Stedman uses the term. The second definition in use is more
                  apt: "Having something not common to others.” Johnson’s definition goes further to
                  say that singular “is commonly used in a sense of disapprobation, whether applied
                  to persons or things,” yet also provides a usage example from the Archbishop John
                  Tillotson contradictory to this assertion: “It is very commendable to be singular
                  in any excellency, and religion is the greatest excellency: to be singular in any
                  thing that is wise and worthy is not a disparagement, but a praise.” Being singular,
                  then, is a way to name a certain deviation from what is expected as normal. As a marker
                  of behavior or thinking that is atypical of a prevailing expectation of eighteenth-century
                  colonial ideology, being singular is officially inflected as a negative appellation,
                  yet qualified in certain cases that are deemed “wise and worthy.” Perhaps the most
                  startling revelation of this thought is the alteration of the notion of the “common.”
                  Rather than reference the system of social organization by which a group of people
                  share either material or land wealth, or even band together in common for political
                  protection as is the case for Lockeian notions of private property protected through
                  social association, the common has already at this early stage stabilized linguistically
                  as commonly held perceptions of the world, including commonly held notions of race.
                  </p>
               <p>Stedman’s singularity is not a case of exerting his unique personality as an individual,
                  but rather is a technique that willingly asserts that things marked as socially disreputable
                  can be reinvested with a positive regard. Both in his <em>Narrative</em> manuscript and elsewhere in his writings, Stedman conjures the title characters of
                  Henry Fielding’s <em>Tom Jones</em> and Tobias Smollet’s <em>Roderick Random</em> as models for his own behavior. By studying other “singular” characters, Stedman
                  illustrates the reproducibility of his own particular world view as well as the potential
                  of published material to spread ideas. Stedman employs them as examples that foreground
                  his own rewriting of his colonial experience. While being singular often manifests
                  as a sexual licentiousness with women of all races, or the propensity to get drunk
                  and fistfight, Stedman also is “singular” in more ways than those which re-value rowdy
                  behavior. Whereas Roderick Random, for example, will eventually rely on the rags-to-riches
                  narrative when his long lost father re-enters his life with a fortune made via colonial
                  slavery, Stedman instead uses his singular character to exceed the normal forms of
                  colonial relations. In numerous instances, Stedman engages with enslaved members of
                  Surinam society on equal footing. He takes their advice on how to survive and prevent
                  the diseases which devastate the other colonial troops, settles disputes with those
                  under his military command on equal footing with his white subordinates, and eventually
                  uses his singularity of character to stabilize the atypical makeup of his family in
                  later life.</p>
               <p>By linking his own character with Roderick Random and Tom Jones, Stedman also intended
                  to recode their characters within his own project of revaluing race and familial relationships
                  in his <em>Narrative</em>. Stedman relates how many of his messmates rebuke him for his attempt to secure the
                  freedom of his son, Johnny: “Do as we do / say’d they / Stedman and never fear, if
                  our Children are Slaves they are provided for, and if they die… may they be damn’d
                  into the bargain, thus keep your Sighs in your Belly, and your Money in your Pocket
                  my Boy” (1988 289). Stedman is incensed at this sentiment, and accordingly relates
                  a sympathetic, non-military audience shortly thereafter. A few days pass, wherein
                  Stedman gains the assurance of assistance in buying Johnny's manumission from Mr.
                  De Graav, who attains guardianship over the plantation held in absentee which claimed
                  both Joanna and Johnny. Stedman relates that: <span class="quote">‘The weight of a Millstone was removed from my labouring breast… Soon after this I
                     was surrounded by several Gentlemen, and Ladies, / to whom my friend had Communicated
                     this very romantic adventure/ Some of whom pleased to Call me <em>Tom Jones</em>, and the others <em>Roderick Random</em>-They all congratulated me on my Sensibility, and my having met with so valuable an
                     Acquaintance, all seem'd to partake in the pleasure that I now felt. (1988 291)’</span> In the edited first edition of 1796, the passage remains, but the literary allusion
                  is expunged. Stedman’s original choice to anchor this event around popular literary
                  characters indicates the extent to which literary production could spread such atypical
                  and incendiary stances. By associating Jones and Random to the sentiment generated
                  by the promise of attaining freedom for his son, Stedman’s rhetorical strategy attempts
                  to generate an audience both in his text and in the larger literary print sphere.
                  By removing the reference to Jones and Random, the editor of the 1796 edition isolated
                  Stedman’s sentiments in his own text. Yet within the <em>Narrative</em>, this instance nevertheless produces the re-coding of literary techniques- adventure
                  and romance - across cultural lines of taboo, extending the approval of the “gentlemen
                  and ladies” of polite society to the circumstances of his inter-racial relationship.
                  If the removal of such references to popular literary characters stymied the connections
                  Stedman tried to construct between his own singular experience and the larger cultural
                  examples available in the print sphere, other forms of popular publication such as
                  periodicals and epistolary sample books gave Stedman’s writings a perpetual access
                  to the household ramparts of British middle-class ideology.</p>
               <p>The reproducibility of Stedman as a character in the larger archive maintains an important
                  symbolic link to the revolutionary domestic space that the Stedman household created
                  in British society. While each retelling of the story resurrects his character in
                  the hands of a new author, the likeness of character between Stedman and Johnny exemplifies
                  the concept of singularity. Quite aside from the confusion of having two “characters”
                  with the same name, the reproduction of the father in the son becomes the condition
                  by which Stedman is lastingly disassociated from the colonial perspective while in
                  Surinam and onward for the remainder of his life. The domestic is no longer the space
                  for the continuance of Marx and Engels' understanding of slavery (through gender,
                  race, or class) but rather becomes the space through which the father is re-produced
                  as a singular subject alongside of and in relation to people alive in the Atlantic
                  world. </p>

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Gift-books were a popular form of publishing in the mid-nineteenth century. <em>The Oasis</em> was well received as the first abolitionist gift-book, but its sales disappointed
               Child, who had the volume published at her own expense. The more successful abolitionist
               gift-book <em>The Liberty Bell</em>, edited by Maria Chapman and published for several consecutive years, was printed
               more modestly, was funded by donation, and sold at anti-slavery bazaars. Child's involvement
               with the later <em>Liberty Bell</em> includes the stories 
               “The Quadroons,”
               
               “Slavery's Pleasant Homes,”
               and 
               “The Emancipated Slaveholders,”
               among others. For more on Child's involvement with abolitionist gift-books, see Carolyn
               Karcher's <em>The First Woman in the Republic</em> (208-9), Valery Levy's 
               “Lydia Maria Child and the Abolitionist Gift-Book Market”
               in <em>Popular Nineteenth-Century American Women</em>, and Ralph Thompson's 
               “The <em>Liberty Bell</em> and Other Anti-Slavery Gift-Books”
               in <em>The New England Quarterly</em> 7 (March 1934).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Although Sharpe's reservations concerning the unintentional effects of Child's depiction
               of Joanna are essential for understanding the dangers of focusing on Stedman and Joanna's
               domesticity, Sharpe is too quick to condemn Child as complicit with the race prejudices
               of her time. Speaking directly to her period's intense and violent response to inter-racial
               marriage, Child quips ironically to reassure her readers that “should any fastidious
               readers be alarmed, I beg leave to assure them that the Abolitionists have no wish
               to induce any one to marry a mulatto, even should their lives be saved by such an
               one ten times” (<em>The Oasis</em>, 65). Sharpe represents this chiding comment from a writer who would serially forefront
               inter-racial marriage as a path to overcoming society's antagonistic relationships
               as a straight description of her beliefs concerning race and marriage.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               construction of Joanna in terms of sentimentality and the ongoing violence of slavery:
               "While Stedman intermittently represses the evidence of Joanna's incorporation in
               slave society in order to define her as an interlude or a relief from torture for
               the reader and narrator, the seepage from the surrounding text undermines his efforts,
               and in fact, many of his effects depend precisely on her endangered status. The sentimentalized
               description of Joanna that Stedman produces, with its dematerialized eroticism, cannot
               entirely be divorced from the horrifyingly mutilated bodies that people the text"
               (655).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">Jenny Sharpe offers an interpretation of Johnny’s manumission. Interpreting the alteration
               between the diary and <em>Narrative</em> version of the events surrounding Joanna’s continued bondage, Johnny’s manumission,
               and Stedman’s return to Europe, Sharpe observes that Joanna’s agency in the scenario
               likely opened the way for her son’s freedom as much or more than Stedman’s efforts
               and finances would allow (75-77).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">For example, from Thompson's edition of Stedman's journal: "Francis Gloyns was the
               tutor of Stedman's quadroon son" (267). To open his discussion of Johnny's death in
               his biography of Stedman, Thompson begins, "Major John Gabriel Stedman's last letter
               to his quadroon son Johnny, is well known" (62). Unaware of his ironic reproduction
               of his own demarcation of Johnny's race, Thompson concludes: “How easy it is to perceive
               from the above lines, that the quadroon was a victim of slander, calumniation, what
               we call today, the <em>colour bar</em>, or class distinction in a sense. Man is only equal to Man in the eyes of God” (67).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">The other dominant allusion in Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> is the tale of Inkle and Yarico. This story depicts an early explorer's treachery
               toward a native woman. Having married her during a lengthy ship-wreck, Inkle sells
               Yarico and their unborn child into slavery after their rescue and return to Barbados
               (British territory). Werner Sollors summarizes the account as a “brief and simple
               moral tale represent[ing] slavery as the betrayal of a beloved, combining a mild antislavery
               sentiment with a critique of the merchant as a type” (195). Sollors also describes
               the literary genealogy of the tale from Richard Steele's <em>Spectator</em> version (March 13, 1711) through Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> and subsequently the logic of the “tragic mulatto” that emerged in the writing of
               Lydia Maria Child in dialogue with William Wells Brown's novel <em>Clotel; or the President's Daughter</em> (1853). Beryl Gilroy also re-wrote <em>Inkle and Yarico</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
