                     “Introduction: Black Romanticism: Romantic Circulations”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The whiteness of Romantic studies is a symptom of amnesia. It bespeaks a massive act
                  of forgetting on the part of contemporary scholarship, an institutional disavowal
                  of the economic conditions that help make cultural production during the Romantic
                  Era possible: the maritime economy of the Atlantic. Black Romanticism deterritorializes
                  British national identity and the culture of the Romantic era, reimagining them as
                  the effect of myriad economic and cultural exchanges circulating throughout the Atlantic.
                  It remembers the forgotten ancestry of British culture, recovering the vital role
                  Africans and other diasporic commoners play in the cultural production called Romanticism,
                  and practices counter-literacy, reading the works of nation, empire, and colony against
                  themselves to liberate the common cultures they occlude. This volume focuses on Jean-Jacque
                  Dessalines, Jack Mansong, Juan Manzano, John Gabriel Stedman, and Mary Prince, Caribbean
                  figures whose biographies have over the past two centuries become part of a constellation
                  of stories about slavery and colonialism, following a circuitous route that began
                  in Africa and traveled from Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Suriname, Bermuda, and Antigua to
                  corresponding points in England, America, and the continent. Each narrative has endured
                  transformations that render the “original” story less significant than the ways they
                  have changed, been changed, or changed the stories connected with them. Each of these
                  figures has acquired multiple and contradictory reputations in part due to changing
                  audiences and media.</p>

                     “Jean-Jacques Dessalines: Demon, Demigod, and Everything in Between”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay examines how popular representations of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a Haitian
                  Revolutionary general and Haiti’s first head of state, have shaped his legacy for
                  various political, creative, and ritualistic purposes. After an overview of Dessalines’s
                  biography, the essay examines negative representations of Dessalines, from nineteenth-century
                  pro-slavery tracts, to twentieth-century publications during the U.S. Occupation of
                  Haiti. These representations are then compared against those created by African American
                  writers who, in particular, represent Dessalines as a dramatic and powerful black
                  hero, but omit from their accounts his more brutal actions. The essay concludes with
                  an examination of the Haitian folk religion, Vodou, and how it is one of the few arenas
                  that actually recognizes and celebrates the contradictory nature of this mercurial
                  historic figure.</p>

                     “Rewriting the History of Black Resistance: The Haitian Revolution, Jamaican Maroons
                     and the 'History' of Three-Fingered Jack in English Popular Culture, 1799-1830”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The story of Three-Fingered Jack (the escaped slave who terrorized the British colonists
                  in Jamaica from 1780 to 1781) appeared in England in at least five major versions
                  between 1799 and 1830. These adaptations included Benjamin Moseley’s <em>Treatise on Sugar</em> (1799), William Earle’s novella <em>Obi; or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack</em> (1800), a pantomime by John Fawcett titled <em>Obi; or, Three-Finger’d Jack</em> (1800), a sixty-page pamphlet by William Burdett titled <em>Life and Exploits of Mansong, Commonly Called Three-Finger’d Jack, the Terror of Jamaica</em> (1800), and finally <em>Obi; or , Three-Fingered Jack</em>, a melodrama by William Murray (1830). Although different in their respective politics
                  and approaches, these five nineteenth-century version of the story deemphasized the
                  collective threat that underlies Three-Fingered Jack’s exploits in 1780-81, during
                  an time of several slave uprisings in the Caribbean, including the Haitian Revolution.
                  The English adaptations misrepresented the history of collective resistance in Jamaica
                  in two major ways. First, Three-Fingered Jack, the leader of a gang of sixty rebels,
                  became a lone rebel. Stripping Jack of his followers made the story appear to be an
                  isolated incident, as opposed to a collective effort. The second way that Three-Fingered
                  Jack’s popular history in England ignored the actual history of black resistance and
                  independence in Jamaica was by changing the identity of Jack’s captor from a Maroon
                  to a slave. All of the nineteenth-century adaptations of the story of Three-Fingered
                  Jack misrepresent the identity of Jack’s killer. Whether intentional or not, this
                  change completely distorted the story of Three-Fingered Jack by ignoring the role
                  that free blacks played in restoring order to the island.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Almeida examines the translations of Juan Manzano’s <em>Poems</em>, a manuscript that followed a labyrinthine route before its eventual publication.
                  Almeida suggests that the translation provided British abolitionists with the cultural
                  capital necessary to “ensure a future beyond 1840 given the realignment of geopolitical
                  and economic power in the Atlantic” (11). Madden’s translation functions, she argues,
                  “as a sign of appropriated cultural labor, and performs an ideological accommodation
                  of slavery within the free market/free labor system” (3).</p>

                     “Going Viral: Stedman's <em>Narrative</em>, Textual Variation, and Life in Atlantic Studies”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The current multiplex configuration of Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> emerged in 1988, the result of Richard and Sally Price's new scholarly edition. The
                  Prices' text transcribed Stedman's 1790 manuscript version aiming to restore his original
                  authorial intent and exposing the extent to which the text had been altered by Stedman's
                  first editor, Joseph Johnson. Both versions of the <em>Narrative</em> are troubled by what they cannot contain, whether it be the sexual exploitation made
                  possible by plantation-slavery, or the inter-racial desire that would eventually mark
                  Stedman's <em>Narrative</em> as a singular example of resistance to the exploitations inherent in the eighteenth-century
                  Atlantic world. Stedman was more than a traveler in Surinam, and he was also more
                  than a colonial agent and oppressor. The <em>Narrative</em> can be read as the outgrowth of social subjectivity categories that typify the operation
                  of the larger plantation slavery system in the West Indies and South America, but
                  it must also be recognized in its particularity. In the following sections, I will
                  consider what happens when Stedman's authorship becomes displaced in the larger archive
                  – how critics rewrite what they read, how an author becomes a character, and above
                  all else, how textual changes challenge criticism's reduction of Stedman to imperialist.</p>

                     “Blood Sugar and Salt Licks: Corroding Bodies and Preserving Nations in <em>The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave, Related by Herself</em>”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Speitz demonstrates how Prince’s narrative attests to the importance of salt, a central
                  product of slave labor in the British-held West Indies. Although its overall value
                  is largely ignored in literary scholarship, Speitz demonstrates how harvesting salt
                  proved harmful enough to inspire Prince’s rendition of a horrific contortion of being.
                  Her repeated detrimental exposure to salt transforms Prince’s body, consciousness,
                  and ultimately, of course, her narrative--making it tantamount to a material history
                  and psychological case study of a forced merger of landscape, labor, body, and mind.
                  Prince’s text records how lethal amounts of salt seep through the skin, forging a
                  visceral, literal, and grotesque union between salt, the commodified substance, and
                  the slave, the commodified worker. Further, buttressing the vast amount of scholarship
                  on the historical significance of luxury consumables which could easily impede international
                  or regional revenue streams if boycotted, Speitz brings to light the unacknowledged
                  history of Caribbean salt raking relative to not only British colonial economies and
                  politics, but also to the revolutionary history of the United States, in which it
                  plays a pivotal role.</p>
