            <p>The World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840 featured a &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; of
               abolitionists who rose to prominence during the Romantic period. Joseph Sturge
               envisioned &#8220;a Society for the abolition of slavery throughout the world&#8221;
               (Richard 204), and was the prime mover behind the formation of The British and
               Foreign Anti-Slavery Society and the convention. Such notables as Lady Byron, Amelia
               Opie, and Benjamin Robert Haydon, John Keats&#8217; longtime friend, witnessed Thomas
               Clarkson give the opening oration and prayer. Reflecting on the <ref
                  target="http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=sp&amp;sText=Anti-Slavery+Society&amp;rNo=0"
                  >commemorative portrait</ref> he painted afterwards, Haydon wrote &#8220;I have
               seen the most afflicted tragedies, imitative and real; but never did I witness in
               life or in the drama, so deep, so touching, a pathetic an effect produced on any
               great assembly as by the few unaffected, unsophisticated words of this aged and
               agitated person&#8221; (qtd. in Richard 218). For as much as the Convention was
               ostensibly launching a new chapter for British abolitionists, they were also
               witnessing the end of an era, symbolized in Clarkson&#8217;s &#8220;aged and agitated
               person.&#8221; As David Turley shows, Clarkson was as much of symbol of continuity as
               a representative of the &#8220;growing divergences&#8221; within the anti-slavery
               movement after the goal of the abolition of slavery in the West Indies had been
               achieved. Clarkson &#8220;seemed too attached to reputation … embarrassed or
               irritated Wilberforce, Stephen, and Macaulay, who all also doubted his judgment on
               some issues&#8221; (Turley 93).<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Turley
                  adds: &#8220;However, these occasional tensions had been kept private until Robert
                  and Samuel Wilberforce chose to make some of them public in the life of their
                  father they published in 1838. In the view of private and public critics of the
                  Wilberforce sons there was more than filopietism at issue in their charge that
                  Clarkson claimed leadership in the cause when their father was entitled to it;
                  they suggested that Clarkson had been to all intents and purposes an agent of the
                  Abolition Committee. Sara Coleridge saw the Wilberforce sons claiming antislavery
                  for their brand of Clapham evangelicnism against Clarkson&#8217;s historical
                  interpretation which had literally offered a diagram of numerous branches
                  contributing to the cause.&#8221; See David Turley, <title level="m">The Culture

               Against these internecine struggles, the Convention became a rallying point and a
               potent reaffirmation of the abolitionist mission. In reciting the milestones of the
               abolitionist movement, the Secretary of the Committee reminded fellow abolitionists
               that &#8220;notwithstanding their joy and thanksgiving for the events they had been
               permitted to witness&#8221; in the &#8220;freedom of every descendant of Africa in
               the British Colonies,&#8221; they &#8220;could not forget that in the nations of the
               American Continent and its adjacent islands, upwards of five millions were still
               groaning under the oppression, and subject to the cruelty of slavery&#8221; (<title

            <p>One of the speakers at the convention was Richard Robert Madden, an Irish physician
               and civil servant with literary ambitions, who delivered a thirty-page report on the
               status of Cuban slavery. He is best known perhaps for his 7 volume <title level="m"

            <p>This essay examines the translation of Manzano&#8217;s <title level="m">Poems by a
                  Slave in the Island of Cuba, Recently Liberated: Translated from the Spanish by

                  Himself</title> (1840) within the moment that traditionally has been read as a
               transition between slave labor and free market capitalism. The complicity of Cuban
               planters with Madden, an avowed abolitionist, to disseminate a translation of
               Manzano&#8217;s life invites us to think further about the circumstances of
               production of a text that has received ample critical attention. Madden generates the
               translation as part of the cultural capital that the British abolitionist movement
               needed to ensure a future beyond 1840 given the realignment of geopolitical and
               economic power in the Atlantic during the 1830s, one that included British support
               for the Latin American Wars of Independence.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"

               corresponded with a &#8220;new international division of labor [that] provided
               important industrial raw materials and foodstuffs for industrializing core
               powers&#8221; (Tomich 69). Notwithstanding Clarkson&#8217;s insistence that free
               labor in a free market would reward those who employed it, in this new order British
               consumption did not suddenly switch from plantocratic monopolies to the free market.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">One of the priorities of British
                  abolitionists at this time, as Thomas Clarkson reminded the Anti-Slavery
                  Convention delegates, was to demonstrate that abolition was an economically sound
                  proposition, and that a free market would reward &#8220;free men&#8221; and those
                  who had liberated them. Clarkson stated &#8220;Now that this [worldwide abolition]
                  is <emph>possible</emph>, that <emph>this may be done</emph>, there is no
                  question. The East India Company alone can do it of themselves, and they can do it
                  by means that are <emph>perfectly moral and pacific, according to your own
                     principles</emph>, namely, by the <emph>cultivation of the earth</emph> and by
                  the employment of <emph>free labour</emph>. They may, if they please, not only
                  have the high honour of abolishing Slavery and the Slave Trade, but the advantage
                  of increasing their revenue beyond all calculation; for, in the first place, they
                  have land in their possession twenty times more than equal <emph>to the supply of
                     all Europe with tropical produce</emph>; in the second place, they can procure,
                  not tens of thousands, but tens of millions of free labourers to work; in the
                  third place, <emph>what is of the greatest consequence in this case</emph>, the
                  price of labour with these is only from a penny to three-halfpence per day. What
                  slavery can stand against these prices?&#8221; [Emphasis Clarkson]. See Thomas
                  Clarkson, <title level="m">The Opening of the General Anti-Slavery
                     Convention</title> (London: 1840) 2. &#8220;The tens of millions of free
                  labourers to work&#8221; and &#8220;the advantage of increasing revenue beyond all
                  calculation&#8221; drive the logic of Clarkson&#8217;s argument for humanitarian
                  capitalism. Measured against the systematized violence of slave production, nearly
                  next-to-nothing wages &#8220;only from a penny to three-halfpence a day&#8221;
                  appear as just compensation for &#8220;free&#8221; labor. </note> Rather, Britons
               continued to consume the products of slaves from Cuba, Brazil, and the United States
               even as they sought national rehabilitation from their own participation in the slave
               trade.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">See Catherine Hall, <title level="m"
                     >Civilizing Subjects: Metropole and Colony in the English Imagination,
                     1830-1867</title> (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2002) 338-379.</note> The free
               market actually integrated both slave and free labor into the circulation of capital
               through the mechanism of credit, which can also be read as &#8220;the scene of
               exchange between the linguistic and the economic&#8221; (Derrida, <title level="a"
                  >White Mythology,</title> 216). Within translation&#8217;s economy of linguistic
               indebtedness, Madden&#8217;s text functions paradoxically as a sign of appropriated
               cultural labor, and performs an ideological accommodation of slavery within the free
               market / free labor system. He &#8220;imports&#8221; the &#8220;raw material&#8221;
               of Manzano&#8217;s life and reflects the double bind of an abolitionism intimately
               bound up with free market beneficence. </p>
            <p>In <title level="m">The Ear of the Other</title>, Derrida suggests that
               &#8220;Translation can do everything except mark this linguistic difference inscribed
               in the language, this difference of language systems inscribed in a single
               tongue&#8221; (100). In the case of Madden and Manzano, the fraught relationship
               between a translator and his source &#8212;the impossibility of complete fidelity to
               the original&#8212; acquires added levels of complexity given the asymmetry of power
               between translator and author. Madden&#8217;s position as representative of the
               British government placed him in a quasi-diplomatic role, and his authority to
               mediate between his own government, planters like Del Monte, and slaves who were sold
               in violation of the 1835 treaty between England and Spain inflects his translation
               with ventriloquizing and distancing voices.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"
                  >The treaty &#8220;declared (Articles 1 and 2) the Spanish slave traffic abolished
                  in all parts of the world, and promised that as soon as the treaty was ratified,
                  Spain would adopt within two months the most efficacious measures against
                  participation of her subjects in the slave trade. Article Three declared severe
                  punishments for shipowners, captains, and crew members involved.&#8221; See Arthur
                  Corwin, <title level="m">Spain and the Abolition of Slavery in Cuba,

               defines the ventriloquizing voice as one that is written for &#8220;the party to whom
               the translator is reporting&#8221; and the distancing one as &#8220;the manner of
               writing of the party who has already written a text in the source language&#8221;
               (19); in Madden&#8217;s case, this would be an abolitionist&#8217;s voice. His choice
               of tailoring the translation to the expectations of British readers or highlighting
               the provenance of the text and his own role as translator has generated a range of
               critical responses to Madden&#8217;s agency. Sylvia Molloy has read a kind of
               betrayal in Madden&#8217;s omission of Manzano&#8217;s name from the English
               translation, the changes Madden makes to the chronology of events, and the removal of
               individuating biographical details, such as Manzano&#8217;s constant hunger.<note
                  n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Lorna Williams adds &#8220;The altered status
                  of Manzano&#8217;s experience is clearly not due entirely to the process of
                  translation, which can only be an approximation to the original, for Madden also
                  exercises editorial judgment by suppressing family names, place names, and dates,
                  thereby producing a less socially grounded text than Manzano seemingly
                  intends.&#8221; See <title level="m">The Representation of Slavery in Cuban
                     Fiction</title> (Columbia: U of Missouri P, 1994) 32.</note>
               &#8220;[Madden&#8217;s] translation was presented not as the life story of one
               individual but as the generic account of &#8216;the Cuban slave&#8217; […] The claim
               for representativeness that led Madden to the excision of the particular […] tell us
               as much about Madden and his practice of reading as it does about the generic Cuban
               slave&#8221; (Molloy 405-6). More recently, Gera Burton counters Molloy by suggesting
               that there was a friendship between the two men, and that Madden&#8217;s abolitionist
               credentials, amply documented, place him above the suspicion of
               &#8220;unauthorizing&#8221; Manzano&#8217;s text, and filtering the narrative for a
               British audience through colonialist lenses.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> 
                  It is also a view shared by Fionnghuala Sweeny. &#8220;Though the text
                  certainly underwent ideological conditioning in Madden&#8217;s hands, thereby
                  exceeding the ethical debate typically invoked in Anglo-American narratives,
                  Madden was after all a committed abolitionist, and a representative of British
                  humanitarian interests in Cuba&#8221; (406). See <title level="a">Atlantic

               the sequence of events, as Madden capturing the &#8220;ambivalence&#8221; of the
               colonial condition Madden and Manzano shared. &#8220;Surmounting the odds, Manzano
               and Madden each succeeded in effecting agency by forming an alliance of sorts. As a
               counter-discursive strategy, the Irishman &#8216;united his voice&#8217; with that of
               the Cuban&#8221; (Burton 50).<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Burton&#8217;s
                  research uncovers a letter that Madden wrote in 1844 and the draft of an elegy he
                  wrote after he wrongly believed Manzano had been killed in the Escalera
                  conspiracy. In the letter, Madden wrote &#8220;I cannot tell you how grieved I am
                  about poor Manzano, the Cuban poet. Many a time the poor fellow came to my house
                  and talked over his trouble and those of his unfortunate tribe with me. I think
                  there ought to be a monument erected in Jamaica as a man of the African race who
                  was an honor to it and a victim to the tyranny of its oppressors.&#8221; Burton
                  reads the letter and the poem as intense &#8220;involvement&#8221; on
                  Madden&#8217;s part. See Gera Burton, <title level="m">Ambivalence and the

            <p>The unmediated way in which Burton presents this union, however, points to the
               abolitionist relationship to power, one in which humanitarians emphasized the
               complete abjection of enslaved peoples in order to speak and act on their behalf.
               Randall McGowen suggests that this strategy &#8220;obscured the process by which this
               identification [with power] was achieved, and the cost it might occasion for a
               victim. The appeal to humanity made it easier to imagine a sympathetic link that
               leapt across cultural differences. . . But the precondition to such an appeal to be
               made was the denial of its own power&#8221; (108). In stressing the friendship
               between Manzano and Madden, Burton minimizes the collaboration between Madden and Del
               Monte in getting the original from Manzano. The abolitionist content of
               Madden&#8217;s translation conceals the site of cooperation between the planter and
               Madden, yet it is crucial in understanding how Madden&#8217;s translation performs an
               ideological accommodation of Cuban slavery in the new Atlantic economy while it
               overtly condemns it. The collusion between Madden and Del Monte creates a problem
               space where Manzano&#8217;s cultural capital is appropriated first by Del Monte and
               subsequently by Madden, since both the planter and the civil servant could see their
               respective causes advanced through the translation of Manzano&#8217;s life into
               English. During the 1830s, Del Monte and other Cuban abolitionists were concerned
               that too many Africans had been imported to Cuba, and feared that the imbalance
               between blacks and whites would precipitate a second Haiti (Sarracino 103-4). Del
               Monte saw British vigilance against further trade in slaves as a means of controlling
               Cuba&#8217;s African population, and he was a willing collaborator with Madden. As
               Del Monte complained to a correspondent in the United States: <quote><foreign

               &#8220;enlightenment&#8221; of the Cuban patriots hinted at a eugenicist program,

                  between the races of America</title>]. Del Monte&#8217;s abolitionism is thus
               mixed with an implicit policy to whiten the overall population of Cuba, and to
               maintain power concentrated in a ruling elite. Ironically, his friendship with Madden
               and other British Superintendents eventually implicated Del Monte in the notorious
               Escalera conspiracy in 1843.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">In yet another

            <p>For his part, Madden banked on the abolitionist familiarity with autobiography as a
               literary form to sell the novelty of the story by a &#8220;Cuban slave, &#8221; one

               responds to the distancing voice that reveals Madden&#8217;s assumptions about a
               British abolitionist audience after 1839, and the desire of such an audience to read
               slavery as foreign and not as an occurrence that had been deeply familiar until 1838.

            <p>Most critics accept that Del Monte acted as Manzano&#8217;s literary patron, yet it
               is clear that the relationship between master and slave that pervaded Cuban society
               underwrote the solicitation of the manuscript and its subsequent edition. Del Monte solicited
               the autobiography from Manzano after the Afro-Cuban poet recited the sonnet <title

               associates, edit the Spanish manuscript, and give it to Madden (Luis 83). There is no
               evidence in the narrative or his letters to Del Monte that Manzano is ever offered
               any remuneration for writing it (except for the facilitation of his manumission), and
               Manzano did not know the details of what Del Monte planned for it beyond a vague
               notion that his master at the time &#8220;ten&#237;a inter&#233;s de que biesen en

               (Manzano, <title level="m">Obras</title>, 87). If, as Burton claims, Madden

               circumscribe Manzano&#8217;s sense of audience to men who have direct power over him.
               By contrast, Equiano saw himself addressing the British nation; as Sonia Hofkosh has
               argued, &#8220;Equiano&#8217;s <title level="m">Interesting Narrative</title> claims
               its place in the public sphere, as a political intervention in a vital national
               debate, as an &#8216;insrument&#8217; in the formation of public opinion and
               legislative policy&#8221; (334).<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  signification of Equiano&#8217;s autobiography, as those of Mary Prince and
                  Ottobah Cugoano, is then incorporated into the larger national narrative, as the
                  commemorations of the abolition of the trade in Britain last year have done. For

               intervention that Manzano could envision for his text and the range his voice and
               story could have: a Cuban freedman speaking to other freedmen, slaves, and
                  <emph>criollo</emph> abolitionists; a man whose life story would reach the

               the convention, and Madden dedicated it to Joseph Sturge. The social and economic
               relations that allowed Del Monte to appropriate the manuscript from Manzano and gift
               it to Madden, who then repurposed it for his own ends, emerge in Madden&#8217;s own
               account of the circuitous route of the text: <quote>A Collection of Poems written by
                  a slave recently liberated . . . was presented to me in the year 1838 by a
                  gentleman at Havana, a Creole . . . some of these pieces had had fortunately found
                  their way to Havana, and attracted the attention of the literary people there,
                  while the poor author was in slavery in the neighborhood of Matanzas. The
                  gentleman to whom I have alluded . . . redeemed this poor fellow from slavery . .
                  . [and] induced him to write his story. (Madden 37, 39)</quote> If Manzano and
               Madden had a friendship &#8212;an alliance, as Burton suggests&#8212; why is it Del
               Monte who &#8220;presents&#8221; the text to Madden, and who also
               &#8220;induces&#8221; Manzano into the labor of writing it? Manzano&#8217;s free will
               is subject to Del Monte as the man who &#8220;redeemed&#8221; him from slavery;
               besides the religious connotations of saving someone from sin, the second definition
               of the word suggests to &#8220;gain or regain possession of something in exchange for
               payment&#8221; (OED). The relationship of indebtedness that Del Monte creates when he
               &#8220;redeems&#8221; Manzano entitles him to Manzano&#8217;s labor without
               remuneration. Manzano thus has to suffer &#8220;inducement&#8221; to write as payment
               for Del Monte&#8217;s role in buying him out of slavery. The labor that Manzano is
               compelled to do for Del Monte does not get remunerated, unless Manzano&#8217;s
               manumission itself is a form of payment, a loan that Manzano must repay. Del Monte
               thus practices a kind of usury to extract the literary value of Manzano&#8217;s life,
               one that Madden continues in his translation by staging Manzano&#8217;s invisibility
               in the text. In Derridean terms, this relationship of usury is one of &#8220;erasure
               by rubbing, exhaustion, crumbling away, certainly; but also the supplementary product
               of a capital, the exchange which far from losing the original investment would
               fructify its initial wealth, would increase the return in the form of revenue,
               additional interest, linguistic value&#8221; (<title level="a">White
                  Mythology</title> 210). The omission of Manzano&#8217;s name as author, and the
               attribution in the Preface to Del Monte <emph>and not</emph> Manzano as the
               originator of the text, multiply the relation of indebtedness that induces labor.
                 <note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">Manzano is said to have composed a second
                  half to the narrative, one which Madden reported as lost. Yet even in discussing
                  the lost manuscript, Madden returns to Del Monte as its source. &#8220;[The

                  of persons connected with his former master, and I fear it is not likely to be
                  restored to the person to whom I am indebted for the first portion of this
                  manuscript&#8221; See R.R. Madden, <title level="m">Poems by a Slave in the Island
                     of Cuba</title>, ed. Edward J. Mullen (Hamden: Archon Books, 1981) 39. </note> By accepting the manuscript from Del Monte, Madden assumes Manzano&#8217;s debt. </p>
            <p>Madden&#8217;s stated aim in performing the translation is to &#8220;vindicate in
               some degree the character of the negro intellect, at least the attempt affords me an
               opportunity of recording my conviction, that the blessings of education and good
               government are only wanting to make the Natives of Africa, intellectually and
               morally, equal to any people on the surface of the globe&#8221; (37). Like Del Monte,
               Madden seeks to &#8220;redeem&#8221; Manzano before a mostly white audience, like the
               &#8220;God of all light and truth&#8221; on whom Madden calls to &#8220;Reprove the
               despot and redeem the slave&#8221; (<title level="a">The Slave-Trade Merchant</title>
               l. 259). Redemption, however, involves a taking of possession of Manzano through the
               translated text and Madden&#8217;s appropriation of Manzano&#8217;s cultural labor.
               The translation codifies the commodification of the Cuban worker&#8217;s labor for a
               British market and the complicity of the Cuban elite, collapsing the labor of the
               &#8220;recently liberated&#8221; with the work of the slave. The symbolic investment
               of the translation reproduces the transformation of the two kinds of labor into
               credit and debt that mirrored the workings of the free market and finance capital. In
               1834, for instance, British banks financed the first Cuban railroad with a loan of
               &#163;400,000, and its construction relied &#8220;on local journeymen and mainly
               rented slaves and freemen&#8221; (Zanetti and Garc&#237;a 26, 29).<note n="18"
                  place="foot" resp="editors">Financing for other projects continued throughout the
                  century. John Hardy, British Consul in Havana in 1837 while Madden acted as
                  Superintendent of Liberated Africans, intervened to get investment for the
                  Sociedad Minera del Cobre, which introduced another railroad for mining interests
                  in Cuba. Zanetti and Garc&#237;a add &#8220;the first foreign loan in Cuban
                  history, was contracted with the banking firm of Alexander Robertson who not only
                  took care of the issue and placement of the bonds but also acted as agent for the
                  Junta de Fomento (Development Board) in purchasing equipment and other railroad
                  material. This first contract marked the beginning between Robertson and Cuban
                  railroad companies that would extend itself over two decades . . . When the new
                  railroads of Matanzas and J&#250;caro needed financial assistance, nothing was
                  easier for them than to follow the path already taken by the Junta de Fomento and
                  contract two loans with the Robertson bank.&#8221; 113-14</note>

               the position of the British subject as interpreter and consumer of the lives of
               others. Within the <title level="m">Poems by a Cuban Slave</title>, Manzano&#8217;s
               life serves as documentation for Madden&#8217;s poems, a proto-appendix that
               foreshadows the appendices that follow. One contemporary reviewer noted the
               imbalance: &#8220;The major part of [<title level="m">Poems by a Cuban Slave</title>]
               is occupied by a poem of Dr. Madden&#8217;s own&#8221; (<title level="a"
                  >Anthology</title> 403). Madden crowds out Manzano, and turns the translator,
               usually the marginal, anonymous figure, into the author. Even as he explains the
               translation, Madden manages to highlight his poems. &#8220;I have given a literal
               translation of it [Manzano&#8217;s life], and that translation, revised by a
               Spaniard, will be found at the end of these poems&#8221; [<title level="a">The Slave
                  Trade Merchant</title> and <title level="a">The Sugar Estate</title>] (39). </p>
            <p>The signifying relation between Madden&#8217;s framing poems and appendices and
               Manzano&#8217;s work in the volume becomes the &#8220;exchange&#8221; that will
               &#8220;fructify … the wealth&#8221; of Madden&#8217;s investment in Manzano, since
               Madden uses the Cuban writer&#8217;s life to draw both veracity and value for his own
               enunciations&#8212;both the poetic and the documentary. Besides performing the
               abolitionist gesture of showing the world that Africans had intelligence and
               feelings, Madden self-consciously presents his work as part of a literary
               abolitionist tradition. He places himself alongside a canonical list of British
               anti-slavery poets such as Hannah More, James Montgomery and William Cowper on the
               grounds that Cuban planters have only been written about &#8220;by travelers who have
               judged their humanity by the curteousness of their manners&#8221; (38), and he
               intends to rectify the record. With the &#8220;The Slave Merchant&#8221; and
               &#8220;The Sugar Estate,&#8221; Madden &#8220;determined, therefore, to give a short
               but faithful sketch of the Cuban slave-trade merchant and planter in verse&#8221;
               (38). These poems have been overlooked in commentary about Madden&#8217;s
               translation, which has focused on Manzano&#8217;s life and poems given contemporary
               critical interests. Yet the poems are as much a part of the translation as
               Madden&#8217;s pledged fidelity to Manzano&#8217;s original since they situate Madden
               in an aesthetic, cultural, and political landscape that abolitionist readers could
               understand and through which they could read Manzano&#8217;s life.</p>
            <p>As McGowen points out, &#8220;The discourse of the anti-slavery movement revolved
               around three figures&#8212;the slave, the slave owner, and the humanitarian&#8221;
               (104). Madden recasts these figures through the cultural Otherness of Cuba and the
               foreignness of Spanish. He differentiates the humanitarian through his depiction of
               the Cuban slave-merchant and the planter as personifications of extreme greed and his
               exposure of the dissonance between the planter&#8217;s gallant code of conduct to
               foreigners <foreign xml:lang="fr">vis-&#224;-vis</foreign> his inhumanity to the
               slaves. The need for translation, given Cuba&#8217;s exotic setting, makes the
               silence of the slaves more pronounced since there is an added layer between the
               British abolitionist reader and the Cuban enslaved person&#8212;that of a
               &#8220;foreign&#8221; language. In <title level="a">The Slave-Trade Merchant</title>,
               the figure of effictio serves to draw a portrait in contrasts between the surface
               appearance and the truths that Madden as abolitionist and cultural insider can
               reveal. Effictio is forensic as it is descriptive, and it allows Madden to distance
               himself clinically from the slave merchant as he catalogues the &#8220;trade&#8221;
               (l.39) and denounces the crimes that support it. The deference that people have
               towards the merchant&#8217;s &#8220;solemn features&#8221; (l.2), and conspicuous
               wealth, &#8220;those gay saloons, this banquet hall&#8217;s array&#8221; (l.13),
               ignores his real identity, which Madden can disclose as privileged observer. He
               instructs the reader:<quote>

                  </lg></quote> Greed infects the merchant&#8217;s &#8220;heart&#8221; and
               &#8220;core,&#8221; corrupting and ultimately destroying his ability to feel for
               others. Madden asks his readers to weigh the merchant&#8217;s material well-being and
               desire for profit against his diseased morality &#8220;To human suffering, sympathy
               and shame, / His heart is closed, and wealth is all his aim&#8221; (l. 218-9). The
               heroic couplets reinforce the opposition between the public persona of the planter
               and his rotten internal self. The heart is &#8220;not all that&#8217;s fair,&#8221;
               and &#8220;the calmest breast&#8221; burns with the &#8220;lust of gold.&#8221; </p>
            <p>Madden attributes society&#8217;s acceptance of the planter to his seeming lack of
               connection to the violence of slavery because of the physical distance between the
               businessman and slavers in the African coast. Scenes of a writing slave merchant do
               not occur often in abolitionist poetry; their appearance in Madden&#8217;s poem call
               attention to writing as an instrument of the trader, one that he uses to manage his
               business across continents. The merchant &#8220;Sits at his desk, and with composure
               sends / A formal order to his Gold-coast friends / For some five hundred
               &#8216;bultos&#8217; of effects&#8221; (l.44). The writing of the merchant enables
               the conversion of credit, &#8220;the formal order,&#8221; into &#8220;bultos,&#8221;
               a conversion reversed once the slaves reach their expected destination.
               As Ian Baucom explains, &#8220;slaves were thus treated not only as a type of
               commodity but as a type of interest bearing money. They functioned in this system
               simultaneously as commodities for sale and as the reserve deposits of a loosely
               organized, decentered, but vast trans-Atlantic banking system&#8221; (61).<note
                  n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">Referring to the <emph>Zong</emph> massacre,
                  Ian Baucom writes, &#8220;That the money truths of the transatlantic slave trade
                  could attach themselves not only to the slaves who reached the markets of the
                  Caribbean alive but also to those who drowned along the way; that a sufficiently
                  credible imagination could see in a drowned slave a still existent, guaranteed,
                  and exchangeable form of currency; that a British court could hold the majesty of
                  the law to endorse this act of the imagination; that the attorneys for William
                  Gregson and his partners could convince a jury that by drowning 132 of the
                  Zong&#8217;s less desirable slaves into the sea Captain Hollingwood had not so much
                  murdered a company of his fellows as hurried them into money, is also, as we shall
                  see, unsurprising&#8212;perhaps even the inevitable consequence of that
                  epistemological revolution (most commonly expressed as an accounting procedure)
                  which had permitted Britain&#8217;s capital houses to convert &#8216;their&#8217;
                  slaves into paper money.&#8221; See <title level="m">Specters of the Atlantic:
                     Finance Capital, Slavery, and the Philosophy of History</title> (Durham: Duke
                  UP, 2005).</note> The Spanish term <foreign xml:lang="es">bultos</foreign> casts
               into relief the symbolic transacting of the merchant&#8217;s credit and its
               concatenation of value to slaves both as commodities and as potential capital in the
               bodies that will be forced to labor. Later, Madden indicates &#8220;The pen does all
               the business of the sword, / On Congo&#8217;s shore, the Cuban merchant&#8217;s word
               / Serves to send forth a thousand brigands bold&#8221; (125).</p>
            <p>Madden uses English as a marker of cultural and national difference in order to
               disentangle the process of his own literary translation of &#8220;bultos&#8221; into
               &#8220;slaves&#8221; from the mechanisms of credit that perform the transformation of
               these symbolic values into commodities. According to Madden, the Cuban merchant, the
               &#8220;proud&#8221; and &#8220;excellent Se&#241;or,&#8221; has a counterpart in the
               African agents who &#8220;foment the strife / of hostile tribes&#8221; (ll. 129-30)
               in order to obtain slaves, and not in the London merchants and bankers with whom the
               Cuban elite also transacted, as observed earlier. The word <foreign xml:lang="es"
                  >Se&#241;or,</foreign> usually a title of respect, denotes the merchant&#8217;s
               cultural separateness with contempt, an othering that is enforced through the
               seamless continuity that the poem posits between the greed of the merchant and the
               violence of the African slavers. Greed thus becomes culturally othered, province of
               &#8220;The tribe of Cuban traders, linked in crime,&#8221; and geographically
               situated in &#8220;Havana and its joys&#8221; (ll. 191). The Se&#241;or and Cuban
               culture, including the Spanish language, belong to a world of corruption that the
               British abolitionist, by virtue of being an outsider, can denounce in English. He
               laments as much when he asks:<quote>

               up to Madden to then become the agent who denounces, who warns, who becomes the
               &#8220;new Las Casas.&#8221; Madden thus invests British culture and the English
               language with moral authority, developing a parallel, if unstated, narrative of the
               British abolitionist as a virtuous figure who stands in opposition to his Cuban
               counterparts, the merchant and Manzano, who here is not counted among the voices that
               could &#8220;bid these horrors cease,&#8221; though his autobiography is included in
               the volume. Madden displays intense indignation on behalf of &#8220;human
               flesh&#8221;; &#8220;victims&#8221;; &#8220;human cargo&#8221;; &#8220;slaves&#8221;;
               &#8220;naked wretches&#8221;; &#8220;Specters of men&#8221;; and an anaphoric
               enumeration of nameless victims, &#8220;how many wretched beings,&#8221;
               &#8220;infants,&#8221; &#8220;defenseless mothers,&#8221; &#8220;struggling
               hands,&#8221; &#8220;sick,&#8221; &#8220;creatures,&#8221; and &#8220;negroes&#8221;
               (ll. 75-108). He catalogues the victims of slavery as a means of producing them to
               expose the merchant&#8217;s crime.</p>
            <p>Madden expands the cultural inscription of greed and cruelty as Cuban in &#8220;The
               Sugar Estate,&#8221; the companion poem to <title level="a">The Slave-Trade
                  Merchant,</title> in which an English traveler narrates his journey from Havana
               through the Cuban countryside. He visits a plantation, where he enjoys the
               hospitality of a Cuban Conde [Count], and converses with him and the
                  <emph>mayoral</emph> [overseer] regarding the state of Cuban slavery. What he
               finds there pales in comparison to &#8220;All to the charge of British planters laid
               . . . And yields the bad pre-eminence in crime / To Spanish guilt in ev&#8217;ry
               tropic clime&#8221; (69). The comparison with West Indian slavery, which has been
               abolished, contains a message of absolution that serves to reconstruct the national
               narrative of British slavery. According to Madden, British planters were not as bad
               as their Cuban or Spanish counterparts, since in Cuba &#8220;the grasping master must
               still have / Just thrice the produce from each working slave&#8221; (ll.93-4). Yet
               the contrast is more than moral; it also pits temporalities and national histories
               against one another. Madden locates the present of the Cuban plantation in relation
               to the guilty past of British slavery and the contemporaneity of post-abolition
               Britain. The play of temporal frames underscores the retrograde character of the
               Cuban system, whereas Britain&#8217;s historical edge corresponds with the moral
               leadership that abolitionists claim.</p>
            <p>The Conde combines the worst traits of British planters and aristocrats
               alike. Following James Montgomery, who calls the Creole planter &#8220;The bloated
               vampire of a living man&#8221; (26), Madden defines the Conde as a figure whose
               ostentatious wealth, like the planter&#8217;s, points to the misery of the slaves
               under his control:<quote>

               frivolity. The linking of the Conde&#8217;s appetite and &#8220;excess&#8221; invokes
               the sin of gluttony, and the identification between the bodies of enslaved laborers
               and consumption that an earlier wave of abolitionists, such as William Cowper and
               S.T. Coleridge, had popularized.<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors"> For an

                  2000) 171-206.</note> The moral condemnation of the menu corresponds to the
               traveler&#8217;s abolitionist objections to the Conde&#8217;s arguments for slavery,
               which by 1840 had been popularized on both sides of the Atlantic. These included the
               relative well-being of slaves in comparison to the poor of other countries, the
               familial loyalty of slaves, and the planter&#8217;s insistence that the slaves would
               have been worse off in Africa.</p>
            <p>The Conde politely shows the traveler out after discovering his abolitionist
               sympathies; as he&#8217;s leaving the plantation, the traveler runs into the mayoral,
               who gladly corrects his impressions of Cuban slavery and inadvertently completes the
               portrait of the Conde&#8217;s dissipation. The mayoral, &#8220;almost frank and civil
               in his way,&#8221; (l. 56) focuses on the profit motive as the driving force behind
               slavery. &#8220;With twenty hours of unremitting toil . . . believe me few grow old,
               / but life is cheap, and sugar sir,&#8212;is gold . . . Our interest is to make the
               most we can / Of every negro in the shortest span&#8221; (ll. 163-70). He calmly
               explains how the &#8220;unremitting toil&#8221; of the enslaved laborers is directly
               connected to their high mortality rate, and the almost instant replacement of dead
               workers with new ones, implicating the United States in supplying Cuba with slaves.
               &#8220;There&#8217;s stock abundant in the slave bazaars, / Thanks to the banner of
               the stripes and stars&#8221; (l. 157-8). Family relationships are non-existent in
               what amounts to a sugar-cane gulag. There are no civil or religious marriages, and
               low birth rates are accompanied by infanticide &#8220;they [mothers] preferred to see
               / Their children dead before their face, ere they / Would give their young
               &#8216;negritos&#8217; to the kind / Indulgent masters which they are said to
               find&#8221; (ll. 83-6). During the first part of the mayoral&#8217;s explanation, he
               details the use of whips, stocks, and other physical punishments with a precision and
               casualness that appear to leave the traveler speechless. As if to answer the
               traveler&#8217;s silence, the mayoral continues in a monologue, and attempts to
               distance himself from the daily cruelty he inflicts: <quote>

                  </lg></quote> This passage is somewhat odd within abolitionist poetry which, in
               all the impersonations it offers, does not feature overseers as commentators on
               slavery. The mayoral argues that since he does not directly &#8220;profit,&#8221; he
               is exonerated him from the pain he inflicts on the Conde&#8217;s behalf. The denial
               of his role would appear as rationalization were it not for his momentary
               indentification with the powerlessness of the slaves, imagining a situation where the
               master is &#8220;to toil compelled.&#8221; This insubordinate and potentially
               revolutionary scenario is rooted in the mayoral&#8217;s resentment of the
               Conde&#8217;s gambling and dissipation in Havana, which results in heavier demands on
               him and the slaves he oversees. He recognizes that in being an instrument of the
               Conde, he is part of a system that is regulated by &#8220;oppression&#8217;s iron
               hand,&#8221; yet is unable to imagine himself outside of it. </p>
            <p>Though the traveler finds himself in a plantation, the slaves remain strikingly
               silent once again. Their only representation is through a brief allusion to Manzano.
               The indirect reference to Manzano illustrates the supplementary function that his narrative
               plays in connection to Madden&#8217;s framing poems. Describing &#8220;the proud
               Havana infamous renown&#8221; (l. 20), Madden notes &#8220;those ladies, foreigners,
               and all / Whose wretched negroes tremble at their call […] Their home spent passions
               and their smiling lips, / Their out-door meekness and their in-door whips&#8221; (ll.
               33-8). The description is based on one of Manzano&#8217;s sequences of his tenure as
               a page for the Marquesa in Havana, where he attended her at <foreign xml:lang="es"
                  >tertulia</foreign> and card tables. &#8220;<foreign xml:lang="es">Yo no me podia
                  separar detras del espaldar de su taburete hasta la ora de partir que era por lo
                  regular las dose de la noche … si en el inter duraba la tertulia me dormia si al
                  ir detr&#225;s de la bolante por alguna casualidad se me apagaba el farol . . . yo
                  iba a dormir al sepo</foreign>&#8221; [I could not quit the side of her chair till
               midnight . . . If during the <foreign xml:lang="es">tertulia</foreign> I fell asleep,
               or when behind the volante, if the lanthorn went out by accident . . . I was put up
               for the night in stocks] (Manzano, <title level="m">Obras</title>, 15; Madden 86).
               Manzano&#8217;s account serves as corroboration for Madden and heightens the location
               of debt in the freed subject, just as interest is located in the body of the slave.
               Manzano&#8217;s account &#8220;cannot quit the side&#8221; of Madden&#8217;s poems,
               just as he could not leave the Marquesa at the playing table.</p>
            <p>Manzano&#8217;s text and its translation signify a relationship of usury that
               problematizes the revelatory paradigm of Madden&#8217;s condemnation and the forensic
               authority of the accusation of dissimulation that Madden levels at the merchant and
               the planter. The paradigm depends on the opposition of values between the merchant
               and the abolitionist, one in which the abolitionist favors the value of humanity over
               the Cuban merchant&#8217;s greed. This opposition results in a narrative of liberal
               values that eschew economic ones, and &#8220;put people first.&#8221; The writing of
               the merchant &#8212;the letters of credit that exchange for &#8220;merchandise&#8221;
               and expected returns in monetary interest&#8212; bears an economic value derived from
               the legal negation of the enslaved person as an agent and his or her economic
               exploitation through violence. Madden pits abolitionist writing against the
               merchant&#8217;s as writing that has a positive relationship to value as it affirms
               the enslaved person&#8217;s humanity morally and legally. Yet if the merchant&#8217;s
               letters of credit signify people as commodities and bearers of interest,
               Madden&#8217;s writing codifies the relationship of debt involved in
               &#8220;redemption.&#8221; The freedom of the enslaved subject therefore is also
               figured in terms of credit; once free, the former slave becomes a debtor to the
               &#8220;credit&#8221; that the establishment is willing to extend. Through
               Madden&#8217;s Wordsworthian purification of Manzano&#8217;s autobiography,
               Manzano&#8217;s freedom is construed in terms of its relationship to debt and the
               credit that Madden and Del Monte lend. </p>
            <p>Madden&#8217;s instinct to translate and elicit empathy for the suffering of Cuban
               slaves participates in the Romantic impulse to intervene that Lee identifies in the
               dialectic between humanitarianism and capitalism at the heart of the abolitionist
               movement (36). Yet with the end of the struggle for abolition, slaves were no longer
               the &#8220;Others&#8221; directly connected to Britain&#8217;s colonial apparatus in
               the West Indies who demanded such ethical commitments. Rather, slaves in Cuba, Brazil
               (and to a lesser degree the United States) were the Other once removed. In the new
               Atlantic economic order that demanded primary materials for the metropole, the labor
               of those Others was increasingly out of view. The liberation of British slaves made
               it easier for Britons to refigure their slaveholding past and distance themselves from connections to other
               slave-holding countries. In that climate, Madden returned to the stock characters of
               the &#8220;aged and shaking&#8221; abolitionist poetry and rhetoric: the cruel,
               primped, and pilfering creole planter; the exploited and exploiting overseer, the
               tortured slave&#8212;types that in 1840 seemed to belong to a distant past rather
               than the present, before presenting Manzano, an example of the last type. </p>
            <p>&#8220;Translation generates the comfortable expectation of stating a relative truth
               lighter than absolute truth: the claim to be truthful at least to the truth
               propounded in the source language,&#8221; suggests Tullio Maranh&#227;o (65). If
               Madden was &#8220;truthful at least&#8221; to the &#8220;truth&#8221; in
               Manzano&#8217;s original, it was in exposing the relations that made Manzano&#8217;s
               a twice trafficked life. </p>
