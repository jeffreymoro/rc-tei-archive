                     “Jean-Jacques Dessalines: Demon, Demigod, and Everything in Between”
                     </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>On October 17, Haiti commemorates the assassination of its revolutionary hero and
               first head of state, Jean-Jacques Dessalines (ca. 1758-1806). Haiti dignifies no other
               individual with an official national holiday. Haiti’s <span class="foreign">Père de la Patrie</span> was born a slave in what was at that time France’s most valuable colony, Saint-Domingue.
               There are few extant details of his personal life and thoughts. In his early life,
               he seems to have been most noted for his ugliness and the extent of his scars. And
               most accounts agree that within the strictly stratified society of Saint-Domingue,
               Dessalines began life at the absolute bottom: he had the infinite misfortune of being
               the black slave of a black master who brutalized him with frequent floggings (Harvey,
               21; Heinl, 88). All this would change for Dessalines, however, when the enslaved laborers
               organized and rebelled.</p>
            <p>The complexities and amazing extremes of this slave-to-emperor’s biography cannot
               be separated from the extraordinary times and place in which he lived. It would not
               be hyperbole to proclaim that the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) was the most signal
               and transformative event in the Age of Revolution. Saint-Domingue’s astounding journey
               from a French sugar colony of nearly a half million enslaved to an independent black
               nation is a convoluted tale. With the slave uprising, the colony erupted into battles
               that fell along economic and racial fault lines. At one point there were as many as
               six factions warring at once, with alliances formed and dissolved in rapid succession
               between the various groups: rich white planters, poorer white laborers, French troops
               trying to restore order in the colony, the opportunistic armies of England and Spain,
               free persons of color (most of mixed-race ancestry, “mulattos”), and the enslaved
               majority with its own internal divisions between African and Creole born. During the
               long years of fighting, most sides at one point courted the rebel blacks with offers
               to arm and then to emancipate. A “born soldier,” Dessalines became known as a courageous
               fighter and a fear- and fealty-inspiring commander in his own right. He ascended rapidly
               through the ranks, becoming a key and indefatigable general under the famous Toussaint
               L’Ouverture, fighting for the royalist Spanish army, then for the French republican
               army fighting against the Spanish and British. In 1799, Toussaint entrusted Dessalines
               with putting down a civil war, which has been typically understood as a conflict between
               mulattos in the south against the blacks, who were aided by a U.S. Navy blockade.
               With the revolts crushed, Toussaint needed to stabilize the black armies and eliminate
               officers and soldiers loyal to his rival, the defeated southern leader Andre Rigaud.
               Dessalines’s reprisals led to many executions, to which Toussaint is said to have
               chastised, “I said to prune the tree, not to uproot it.” Some scholars have suggested,
               however, that Toussaint had ordered these killings but had his generals take responsibility
               in order to keep his hands and reputation (relatively) clean (James 236; Dubois 236).
               Regardless of the veracity of the claims of such political underworkings, the war’s
               events have allowed most histories to treat Dessalines as Toussaint’s brutal foil.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, Dessalines was the soldier that the battlefield and times necessitated,
               a general willing to see plainly what was needed and not hesitating to respond accordingly
               if bluntly. Military expediency, not diplomacy, distinguished Dessalines. After Toussaint’s
               capture and deportation in 1802, Dessalines deemed that the war was now a revolution
               for total independence rather than colonial autonomy with emancipation. And he succeeded
               in completing history’s most successful slave revolt, leading the colony to national
               independence, though Haiti’s subsequent instabilities have and continue to call into
               question how well this dream was achieved. Historian Laurent Dubois’s cogent assessment
               of Toussaint just as easily applies to Dessalines: “Though his ultimate inability
               to construct a multiracial, egalitarian, and democratic society in Saint-Domingue
               might strike us as particularly tragic, given his origins, this was a failure he shared
               with the leaders of every other postemancipation society in the Atlantic world” (174).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>History and legend link Dessalines with several signal acts in the birth of this first
                  modern independent black nation. In May 1803, he tore the white band from the French <span class="foreign">tricolour</span>, uniting the blue and red in a new flag. This became the symbol of racial unity between
                  blacks and people of color in the face of France’s final attempts to retake the colony
                  through a desperate war of extermination (Dubois, 292-3). The symbol of the flag would
                  later be made concrete in the nation’s 1805 inaugural constitution, which proclaimed
                  that all citizens would henceforth be designated “black.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Haiti’s constitution pronounced all Haitians “black,” even the Polish and German mercenaries
                           who had remained on the island after defecting from the French and British armies.
                           Dessalines and his advisors were well aware that Haiti’s precarious independence and
                           the freedom of the self-liberated slaves depended on not allowing the tensions of
                           skin color, with its underlying meaning of caste, to weaken the fledgling nation.
                           David Nicholls has suggested that this may be one of the earliest, if not the first,
                           time that the term “black” was employed ideologically (36). </span></div>
                  </div> Dessalines’s “indigenous army” and a growing coalition of guerilla fighters, aided
                  by a yellow fever epidemic, decimated the remaining French forces, who ultimately
                  surrendered in December, 1803. On January 1, 1804, Dessalines proclaimed national
                  independence and severed colonial ties by replacing the name Saint Domingue with the
                  Amer-Indian word Haiti (<span class="foreign">ayti</span>). As Dubois has noted, the re-christening of the nation with its original Taino name
                  attempted to symbolically disrupt centuries of European empire and brutality (299).
                  More ominously, the declaration also chided the new black citizens for not fully avenging
                  their dead by allowing some French planters to remain on the island. Later that spring,
                  rhetoric moved to action. Convinced that the French who had remained in the colony
                  in the hopes of reclaiming some of their land and property were already plotting to
                  destabilize the young nation, Dessalines ordered their execution. Ignoring the hideous
                  atrocities of France’s campaign of extermination at the close of the revolution, popular
                  accounts describe Dessalines’s orders as a barbarous aberration. By ordering the remaining
                  colonists’ doom, Dessalines sealed for Haiti a lasting reputation as a nightmare republic
                  in the eyes of the greater white world.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Dessalines’s meteoric rise from abject slave to iron-fisted emperor willing to preserve
               his fledgling nation’s freedom by any means necessary seems only fit to engender an
               even more dramatic downfall. Dessalines’s despotism, draconian labor policies, and
               enforced land reform plans soon disillusioned the peasants, fair-skinned elite landowners,
               and military alike. On October 17, 1806, Dessalines’s soldiers ambushed their leader
               and rendered his body to pieces. Legends state that the madwoman Défilée, possibly
               Dessalines’s spurned lover and a sutler to his troops, gathered, buried, and guarded
               the emperor’s remains in a final act of restorative devotion. </p>
            <p>At his death, Dessalines was both torn asunder and repaired. His complex legacy suffered
               a similar fate. Over two centuries of Haitian, European and U.S. American popular
               representations of Dessalines reconstruct this leader, though often by eliminating
               his contradictions, thus rendering his complex legacy piecemeal. Haiti’s revolutionary
               heroes, especially the black triumvirate of Toussaint L'Ouverture, Henri Christophe
               and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, are important not only in political histories but also
               cultural storytelling. And not surprisingly, their biographical narratives are often
               conflicting and depend greatly on who is enacting the telling. In this essay, I will
               examine some of the many ways that popular representations of Dessalines have shaped
               his legacy—politically, creatively and ritualistically. I will begin with an overview
               of representations of the demonic Dessalines, which continued into the twentieth century,
               particularly during the U.S. Occupation of Haiti. Next, I will outline how African-American
               writers in particular have recovered Dessalines as a dramatic and powerful black hero,
               though one unburdened from his more extreme actions. I will conclude my discussion
               with the Haitian folk religion of Vodou, which is one of the few spaces that recognizes
               and celebrates the contradictory nature of this mercurial figure. </p>
            <p>Early Haitian histories with accounts of Dessalines largely do not appear until around
               the mid-nineteenth century, during the waning years of the Revolutionary generation
               and a growing economic divide that tended to fall along color distinctions. These
               written accounts were largely put forward by the economically and politically powerful
               educated mulatto elite who, perhaps not surprisingly, privileged mulatto revolutionary
               leaders like André Rigaud over black leaders like Dessalines and Christophe. Historian
               David Nicholls gives one of the most comprehensive meditations on the divide between
               racial and color identities within Haitian culture and its importance in the construction
               of its history for political purposes. He notes, “Mulatto historians developed a whole
               legend of the past, according to which the real heroes of Haitian independence were
               the mulatto leaders…. The black leaders were portrayed as either wicked or ignorant,
               and the legend was clearly designed to reinforce the subjugation of the masses and
               the hegemony of the mulatto elite” (11; see also 85-101). </p>
            <p>These early Haitian historians who chose to demonize Dessalines found good company
               with an already established and ever increasing body of European and U.S. accounts
               that established the vocabulary and interpretive lens through which this founding
               father and all of Haiti would be judged: African savage, diabolical, inhuman, ferocious,
               base and sanguinary, cruel and brutal, vain and capricious, lustful and insatiable
               (Barskett; Chazotte; Dubroca, Franklin; Harvey). In his literary analysis of narratives
               of the Haitian Revolution, Matt Clavin argues that the ubiquitous published histories
               and biographies that circulated throughout the nineteenth-century trans-Atlantic world
               commodified the Haitian Revolution and its principal actors. This flood of writing
               captured the attention of and titillated a growing boom of readers in a competitive
               literary market. Clavin argues that this was accomplished through the use of standard
               literary techniques, especially the conventions of Gothic literature, such as crumbling
               and exotic scenery, characters seemingly outside the bounds of Enlightenment rationality,
               and, above all, descriptions of “indescribable” violent and brutal acts (14-29). Dessalines
               provided the most direct and titillating example of exotic barbarity, the Enlightenment
               turned on its head but corrected with the equally brutal downfall of the black emperor,
               an example of horrific history that far outpaced Gothic fiction and found an eager
               audience. </p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, these numerous accounts of the Haitian Revolution can also be sorted
               based on the ideologies of their authors: abolitionist or pro-slavery. Abolitionist
               accounts tended to diminish the role of Dessalines in lieu of Toussaint L’Ouverture,
               who in turn was presented as gentle, educated, Christian and compromising. Captured
               and deported before the extremely brutal final revolutionary period, where both sides
               waged a desperate war of extermination, Toussaint as martyr could become a positive
               symbol of black potential and enlightened character. What the Abolitionists downplayed,
               the pro-slavery side sought to exploit: Dessalines’s killings, portrayed as the sanguinary
               finale of blacks’ mercurial treachery, served as the shining example of the disasters
               that awaited sudden and complete emancipation. Pierre Etienne [Peter Stephen] Chazotte,
               who claimed to be one of the few eyewitnesses to survive Dessalines’s ordered massacre
               of French whites in 1804, published an English translation of his experiences in 1840,
               based, as he claimed, on notes he had written during the events. His work was meant
               to discredit what he saw as the abolitionist lies particularly propagated by the English.
               For Chazotte, Dessalines was a mindless executioner, a puppet of the English Wilberforce
               Society (41, 48, 69). Over several detailed pages, Chazotte regaled his readers with
               his direct observations of the executions (46-51), adding voyeuristic passages of
               pathos for the killings in the night that he overheard but did not see from his guarded
               residence: “Cries of murder, defiance, despair, rage, and vociferations, intermixed
               with the groans and lamentations of the wounded and the dying, resounded through the
               whole place” (50). Chazotte used his narrative to produce a damning account of the
               English as the main force who spurred the barbaric yet simplistic blacks towards violence,
               while also concluding that this merely shows the imitative nature of all persons of
               African descent and that a modern self-rule was well beyond Haitians’ capabilities.
               </p>
            <p>Building upon earlier descriptions like Chazotte’s, the British Minister Resident
               to Haiti Sir Spenser St. John wrote the most popular and widely circulated of nineteenth-century
               descriptions of Haiti’s history and religion, <em>Haiti or the Black Republic </em>(1884), a work <em>intended</em> to prove the inferiority of blacks, especially regarding self-government. According
               to St. John, although Dessalines had been a revolutionary hero, what truly “endears
               his memory to the Haytians” was his inaugural act of white massacre (77). St. John
               notes that Dessalines suspected that some of his generals, out of “interest or humanity,”
               may not have carried out his orders fully and took it upon himself to tour the country
               and “pitilessly massacred every French man, woman, or child that fell in his way.”
               St. John continued, “One can imagine the saturnalia of these liberated slaves enjoying
               the luxury of shedding the blood of those in whose presence they had formerly trembled;
               and this without danger; for what resistance could those helpless men, women, and
               children offer to their savage executioners?” (77) (St. John, however, did allow that
               more properly enlightened and educated Haitians were at least “in truth utterly ashamed
               of the conduct and civil administration of their national hero” (79).) St. John’s
               work remained highly influential into the twentieth century, becoming one of the most
               frequently cited sources behind early accounts justifying and supporting the U.S.
               military invasion and occupation of Haiti. Two days after the initial U.S. Marine
               invasion of what would become a nineteen-year occupation (1915-1934), the <em>New York Times</em> outlined the Black Republic’s “customs” of corruption, despotism, revolution, and
               assassination, noting that this has held true since Haiti’s founding father had ordered
               the massacre of the country’s remaining whites (“Latest Revolution” 8). By invoking
               the terrifying events of 1804, the <em>New York Times</em> assured its readers of the vital importance of a strong U.S. military presence in
               1915.</p>
            <p>Five years later and in direct response to damning revelations of the U.S. Occupation’s
               financial and military abuses, the December 1920 <em>National Geographic Magazine </em>defensively presented the benefits of occupation in a lavishly illustrated, three-article
               suite which cited St. John’s 1880s work frequently. British explorer and photographer
               Sir Harry Johnston contributed one of the articles, presenting a picturesque Haiti
               greatly improved under U.S. guidance. Johnston, however, takes issue with a few lingering
               details. In Port-au-Prince, Johnston describes the great expanse of the Champ de Mars:
               “In the middle of this open space is a preposterously vulgar statue of Dessalines,
               who is regarded as the national hero of Haiti, the people having, with typical ingratitude,
               put on one side the real great man of their history, the remarkable and noble-hearted
               Toussaint L'Ouverture” (“Haiti” 496). The monumental honoring of a monster, rather
               than the more beneficent and accommodating Toussaint, underscored the <em>National Geographic</em>’s presentation of Haitians, particularly the peasants who dared to resist their U.S.
               occupiers, as petulant children who neither appreciated what was good for them, nor
               showed proper gratitude or respect.</p>
            <p>Importantly, the information within this article was gathered during Johnston’s six-month
               trip through the Caribbean and United States in 1908-9, <em>before</em> the U.S. occupied Haiti. The <em>National Geographic</em>, therefore, has shifted the meaning and context of Johnston’s text to coincide with
               a vision of Haiti as newly cleaned-up and “regenerated” by the United States. Originally
               publishing his findings in <em>The Negro in the New World</em> (1910), Johnston did note at that time the ugly nature of the statue of Dessalines
               on the Champ de Mars and called for its removal (177). Johnston described the massacring
               Dessalines to be an “abominable monster of cruelty” and an example of “the Negro at
               his very worst” (159). Additionally, he argued, “It is a <em>disgrace</em> to Haiti that amidst all her monuments, good, bad, and indifferent, none has been
               raised to commemorate the character and the achievements of Toussaint Louverture,
               whose record is one of the greatest hopes for the Negro race” (158-9, italics in original).
               Johnston’s pronouncement mirrors Englishman Hesketh Prichard’s lament of 1900 that
               Haitians have consciously selected the barbarous Dessalines over the noble (and probably
               not “full-blooded negro”) Toussaint for their national hero (279-80). For both authors,
               Toussaint is the exception that proves Dessalines’s bloody rule. Moreover, outside
               observers continued to be incredulous of contemporary Haitians’ choice of Dessalines
               as the country’s highest honored national hero, a sure indication of the faulty and
               incompetent progress of the black nation.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>What these outside observers failed to acknowledge, however, was that the honoring
                  of Dessalines had and continued to be rigorously deliberated by the Haitian elite.
                  The beginnings of the official recovery of Dessalines began in the 1840s. As the revolutionary
                  generation passed away, Dessalines’s legacy was rehabilitated enough to allow for
                  a modest grave marker, and an even more modest pension for his aging widow. In 1861,
                  Haitian newspapers heatedly debated a proposal for the creation of a monument to Dessalines.
                  As historian David Nicholls has pointed out, Haitians chose sides in this “acute controversy”
                  based on political and racial allegiances; blacks and those espousing a <span class="foreign">noiriste</span> ideology supported the creation of the monument, while most mulattoes opposed it.
                  The few supportive mulattoes carefully advocated honoring Dessalines the “liberator,”
                  not Dessalines the “despot” (86). Not surprisingly, French diplomats in Haiti actively
                  campaigned against a monument in honor of one who had killed so many French citizens.
                  No major monument resulted from this debate. Perhaps more fitting, Haiti had a gunboat
                  named after Dessalines long before any memorial.

                           president’s rebelling opponent. Dessalines, however, surely would have disapproved
                           of the fact that an American commanded the boat (Heinl 270).</span></div>
                  </div> Full and official state-sponsored recovery of Dessalines as the liberator of the Haitian

                  a <em>French</em>-made marble mausoleum erected, and more importantly, rhetorically linked himself
                  to the revolutionary hero to strengthen his own political agendas (Brutus 246-65).
                  Nord Alexis, president during the 1904 centennial, completed the recovery of Dessalines’s
                  patriotic legacy by unveiling the national anthem, “La Dessalinienne,” and commissioning
                  the leading Haitian sculptor of the day, Normil Charles, to create the Champ de Mars

                  forward and holding aloft a saber in his right hand, and a scabbard in the left, which
                  Johnston identified as an excessive second sword (“Haiti” 496) [fig. 1]. Dessalines
                  braces a painted metal national flag permanently unfurled with the national motto,
                  “Liberty or Death!” and “To die rather than be under the domination of Power.”

               <p>While nearly every history outlines Dessalines’s fierce and brutal character, there
                  are very few contemporary descriptions of what he physically looked like. ‘A short,
                  stout Black,’ seems to be the most thorough description left and no likenesses taken
                  from life have been authenticated (Heinl 126). Rather, a range of likenesses from
                  nineteenth-century engravings abound, with a few becoming privileged, and one accepted
                  as a correct representation by state-sponsored commissions in the twentieth century:
                  the portrait of Dessalines from the series of paintings displayed in the national
                  palace, <em>Heros de l’independence d’Haiti</em> (1804-1806) (fig. 2). Several Haitian administrations promoted this particular likeness
                  of Dessalines and had it copied into medallions, engravings, and even a 1949 commemorative
                  postage stamp by famed Haitian designer Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noël. A new Dessalines
                  monument now dominates Port-au-Prince’s Champ de Mars, this one created by famed African-American
                  sculptor Richmond Barthé and installed in 1953. In this commission, Barthé worked
                  directly from a photograph of the national palace painting.

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Perceptions of Dessalines’s character proved even more malleable than his image. Dessalines
                  expected and embraced the fact that the greater world would find him horrific and
                  blood thirsty. The January 1, 1804 declaration of independence was proclaimed before
                  a crowd at Gonaïves. It is clear, however, that Dessalines and his secretary, an educated
                  officer of color named Louis Félix Boisrond-Tonnerre who authored and read the proclamation
                  on Dessalines’s behalf, understood the proclamation’s audience to include not only
                  the new citizens of Haiti, but also the greater international community. The declaration
                  rebukes Haiti’s new black citizens for failing to avenge their dead by allowing some
                  French to still remain in the country. The elimination of these French would serve
                  not only as the final step in completing the war of emancipation, it would also ensure
                  that no remaining foreigner would continue to plot “to trouble and divide us” (Dubois
                  and Garrigus 189). More importantly, Dessalines/Boisrond-Tonnerre prods that a final
                  act of massacre would send the most dramatic message possible to dissuade France and
                  any other power that this fledgling nation could ever be reclaimed for slavery: <span class="quote">‘…know that you have done nothing if you do not give the nations a terrible, but just

                     French whose profane foot soils the land of liberty (Dubois and Garrigus 189).

                              greater transatlantic powers with ameliorating lines for the nations within Haiti’s
                              immediate region: “Let us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy

                     </div>’</span> Importantly, in the declaration’s closing lines, Dessalines also claimed his own legacy:
                  “Recall that my name horrifies all those who are slavers, and that tyrants and despots
                  can only bring themselves to utter it when they curse the day I was born…” (Arthur
                  and Dash 44). In April 1804, following the actual killings of the remaining French
                  planters, Dessalines proclaimed: <span class="quote">‘‘We have rendered to these true cannibals, war for war, crime for crime, outrage for
                     outrage. Yes, I have saved my country; I have avenged America. The avowal I make in
                     the face of earth and heaven, constitutes my pride and my glory. Of what consequence
                     to me is the opinion which contemporary and future generations will pronounce upon
                     my conduct? I have performed my duty; I enjoy my own approbation: for me that is sufficient’
                     (Barskett 183). ’</span> Dessalines carefully posited his acts against a history of the French slave system
                  notorious for its excessive cruelties, tortures and rapes, and he orchestrated the
                  executions to be a signal to the greater world of an unrepentant blackness that grounded
                  the newly created Haitian identity.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Amazingly, despite his extreme rhetoric and actions, Dessalines’s character lent itself
               not only to disparaging accounts, but also dramatic and even morally uplifting representations.
               Since there are few records of Dessalines’s own accounting of his thoughts and actions,
               his life has been used as a blank canvas for more romantic inscriptions. Indeed, given
               how he proclaimed his own legacy, Dessalines probably would have been shocked by the
               numerous representations that attempt to sanitize his legacy, especially those examples
               put forth by fellow blacks. Several prominent African-American writers have attempted
               to recover a revolutionary hero without the accrued weight of his harsher actions.
               In 1863, former slave William Wells Brown published <em>The Black Man</em>, a collection of biographical sketches designed to refute stereotypes of black inferiority.
               For Brown, the courageous Dessalines “was a bold and turbulent spirit, whose barbarous
               eloquence lay in expressive signs rather than in words” (111). Brown, however, does
               not describe Dessalines’s “expressive signs,” stating that enough historians have
               noted them, but without rightly considering the circumstances under which he lived
               and led.</p>
            <p>Three decades later, African-American publisher and activist William Edgar Easton
               out-distanced Brown’s positive portrayal in his play <em>Dessalines</em> (1893). In the play, Dessalines awakens from his excessive brutality when he rescues
               his mulatto enemy’s sister, Clarisse, from a voodoo witch and then falls in love with
               her. The fair Clarisse converts Dessalines to Christianity and the play ends without
               even a hint of massacres or political despotism. In the play’s preface, Easton openly
               admits to taking factual liberties in creating a play that would highlight the rich
               possibilities of uplifting racial drama. Yet his preface also laments the lack of
               African Americans writing and staging black history, implying the importance of historical
               fact. Easton believes drama to be the perfect medium for teaching both history and
               moral virtue. He prefers ultimately, however, to skew history and reconstitute a sanitized
               Dessalines in order to fulfill the higher purposes of serious moral drama and race
               pride: “Let the critic with a charitable hand separate its [the play’s] history from
               romance and give the author the credit, at least, of seeking, in the way he knows
               best, to teach the truth, that ‘minds are not made captive by slavery’s chains, nor
               were men’s souls made for barter and trade’” (vii).</p>
            <p>Indeed, the debut staging of Easton’s interpretation of Haiti’s history was actually
               about the visibility and control of African-American self-presentation. <em>Dessalines</em>’s debut has been called the “most note worthy African-American event” during the
               1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, even though it did not actually occur on
               the fairgrounds or with Exposition sanctioning. Rather, it was produced privately
               at the Chicago Freiberg’s Opera House as a part of the African-American protest against
               the Exposition’s exclusion of African Americans in its planning and the rejection
               of many proposals for exhibits to display the accomplishments of African Americans
               (Hill and Hatch 88-9, 138-9). Dessalines, therefore, needed first and foremost to
               represent black heroic accomplishment, and not the gray zone of a complex and violent
               historical reality.</p>
            <p>Prominent twentieth-century African-American writers continued Easton’s belief in
               racial uplift through black historical drama, with Haiti frequently providing exciting
               material and inspiring heroic figures. And like Easton before them, those who staged
               their work around Dessalines as their lead character did so by ignoring the more contradictory
               and violent aspects of his actions. For example, writer and linguist John Matheus
               wrote the libretto to the opera <em>Ouanga: a Haitian Opera in Three Acts</em> (c.1929; copyrighted 1938) centered on Dessalines’s 1804-1806 rule, but omitted his
               ordered killings. Rather, <em>Ouanga</em> portrays the emperor’s greatest crimes as forsaking his true love Défilée and attempting
               to outlaw voodoo, with both directly causing his assassination. Matheus preferred
               to have his romantic protagonist in dramatic confrontation with voodoo, rather than
               admit the terrorizing and tyrannical aspects of his hero.</p>
            <p>Famed writer Langston Hughes also had an abiding fascination with Haiti, its revolutionary
               history, and the character of Dessalines. In February 1928, Hughes began work on an
               opera on the Haitian Revolution, first sketched as a “singing play” entitled <em>Emperor of Haiti</em>. His plot traces the rise and fall of a fierce Jean-Jacques Dessalines, whom he envisions
               as a key leader of the initial uprising. He revised his text into a play entitled
               <em>Drums of Haiti</em>, which was first performed in 1934; he continued to revise (and rename) the work,
               premiering <em>Troubled Island</em> in 1936. It was this later version that would be finally turned into an opera with
               music by William Grant Still, debuting in 1949 (Hughes Papers, boxes 536, 539; see
               also Rampersad 165-6, 175-9). Like <em>Ouanga</em>, Hughes’s play and opera dramatize the life and downfall of Jean-Jacques Dessalines,
               and provide another example of a sanitized Dessalines as main character. <em>Troubled Island</em> begins on the eve of the revolutionary uprising in 1791. Act II then jumps forward
               over two decades to the end of Emperor Dessalines’s reign, thus omitting both the
               bloody fight for independence and Dessalines’s ordered massacres. While alluding to
               Dessalines’s military exploits, the heart of the later acts present Dessalines’s failures
               as a statesman, his rejection of the country’s African roots in voodoo, and his assassination
               as a betrayal by his treacherous mulatto assistants and consort.</p>
            <p>In one final example of Dessalines’s extreme sanitization at the hands of African-American
               writers, Helen Webb Harris composed <em>Genifrede: The Daughter of L’Ouverture, a Play in One Act</em> (1923) as part of a drama class at Howard University. In her example, Harris centers
               the play around the iron-will of Toussaint L'Ouverture, but presents Dessalines as
               a moderator to Toussaint’s extreme sense of justice, which included executing his
               daughter’s fiancé. All of these productions present the Haitian revolutionary as a
               figure of heroic black masculinity, reflecting an African-American focus on representational
               figures to instill race pride.</p>
            <p>These African-American writers portrayed Dessalines as a simplified and somewhat thuggish
               saint. Interestingly, within the Haitian folk religion of Vodou, Dessalines actually
               has become a saint. Vodou is a highly syncretic, African-derived, complex New World
               religion that has vibrantly adapted (and continues to adapt) to the needs and struggles
               of Haitians. Like Dessalines, this much maligned religion has been distilled in the
               popular imagination outside of Haiti in the form of a highly circumscribed stereotype.
               The religion is known more popularly by the moniker “voodoo”; histories, sensationalized
               travelogues, and, especially, horror films present “voodoo” as a demonic, brutal,
               and blood- and zombie-driven cult of death and debauchery. While many Haitians believe
               in a single supreme God, they also believe in a pantheon of intermediary spirit-saints,
               or <span class="foreign">lwas</span>, who actually intercede within their lives through personal encounter. Vodou’s dominant
               spirit and warrior is Ogou. Within the Vodou pantheon, Ogou splits into multiple manifestations,
               creating a family of spirits tied to war and, since the army is never far removed
               from government in Haiti, politics and social power. Vodou’s adaptability means that
               new historical events and leaders can be incorporated into this divine army. The historic
               Jean-Jacques Dessalines, like most elite blacks and mulattos of his era, probably
               opposed and even worked to suppress Vodou (Nicholls 170). In death, however, Haitian
               adherents incorporated him into the Vodou pantheon as Ogou Desalin. Like his historical
               counterpart, Ogou Desalin is a powerful guardian and fierce conqueror. He is also
               vainglorious with a notorious sexual appetite, a penchant for blind rage, and an equivocal
               nature (Dayan 139; Largey 328).</p>
            <p>Vodou rituals involve what religious scholar Karen McCarthy Brown has termed “performance-possession”:
               the dramatic moment when a Vodou spirit possesses (or mounts) an adherent (<em>Mama Lola </em>6). Through the possessed individual, the <span class="foreign">lwa</span> bodily displays his personality, and interacts with those present at the ceremony.
               His physical likeness shifts, therefore, with each person possessed, transcending
               the visual representations of Dessalines codified by the state’s various commemorative
               and political projects. In Haiti’s highly visual and oral culture, such ritual performances
               become bodily manifestations where past histories meet present problems, helping to
               create meaning and solutions.</p>
            <p>All manifestations of Ogou poignantly model the constructive and destructive uses
               of power. Brown has described the ritual dance performed by those possessed by Ogou.
               First, Ogou takes a ritual sword and wields it against an invisible enemy. Before
               long, however, his aggressive swipes and jabs become directed towards people present
               at the ceremony. Finally, Ogou turns the sword upon himself. Ogou performs the paradox
               at the center of Haitian military and political history, where leaders heralded as
               heroes have time and again turned upon their own people while also instigating their
               own destruction (<em>Mama Lola</em> 95-6). Dessalines proclaimed himself the avenger of the former slaves, yet he considered
               his people ungrateful and unruly, and used his standing army to enforce draconian
               labor policies. In establishing a national identity centered on blackness and land
               ownership, Dessalines also threatened the fairer-skinned elite, contributing to his
               assassination.</p>
            <p>Historian Joan Dayan has provided one of the most extensive analyses of Dessalines’s
               leap from revolutionary leader to <span class="foreign">lwa</span>. Kreyol folk and ritualistic songs, which may be as old as the revolutionary era,
               focus on the liberty that Dessalines brings, yet through a body that is both powerful
               and dismembered, heroic and corrupt, living and dead. The songs’ Kreyol words embody
               multiple meanings and necessarily duplicitous, interpretations. Likewise, in Vodou
               ritual, when Ogou possesses an adherent and makes himself manifest to worshippers,
               his ritualistic actions and pronouncements are also duplicitous, revealing both his
               multiple nature and the contradictions inherent within power structures: ritualistic
               actions show both devotion and vengeance, efficacy and blind rage railing against
               insurmountable odds (Dayan 31). As we have seen, and much to the chagrin of nineteenth-
               and twentieth-century outside observers, many Haitians claim Dessalines as their most
               revered national hero despite his dramatic faults. Perhaps this is because Dessalines
               goes beyond his fighting for and founding of independence; now as Ogou Desalin, he
               both resists oppression and displays how power can corrupt. This is a prescient model
               for understanding the personal and political injustices found within the adherent’s
               contemporary world.</p>
            <p>Within Vodou, remembered histories possess the power to shape and interact with contemporary
               problems. The worship of Ogou Desalin performs an important revolutionary history
               and embodies contemporary relationships with power structures. Ogou Desalin shows
               that liberation is never complete, while teaching that the most powerful can be the
               most vulnerable and vice versa. Ogou Desalin also shows that power in general is always
               corruptible, and that the dispossessed must always be wary of whom they call hero.
               Rendered to pieces at his death, Dessalines’s spirit and legacy has only grown more
               powerful as representations continuously reconstitute, rework and repair this mercurial
               hero. Most popular representations circumscribe him to the space of either demon or
               saint. Vodou, however, provides a model that accepts and even finds necessary Dessalines’s
               equivocal nature. </p>

               who had remained on the island after defecting from the French and British armies.
               Dessalines and his advisors were well aware that Haiti’s precarious independence and
               the freedom of the self-liberated slaves depended on not allowing the tensions of
               skin color, with its underlying meaning of caste, to weaken the fledgling nation.
               David Nicholls has suggested that this may be one of the earliest, if not the first,
               time that the term “black” was employed ideologically (36). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the ship of the president’s rebelling opponent. Dessalines, however, surely would
               have disapproved of the fact that an American commanded the boat (Heinl 270).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Dessalines, here, does not present the flag that flew under his reign. While he is
               credited with first creating the blue and red national flag, with its vertical bands
               from the removal of the white from the French flag at a ceremony at Arcahaie on 14
               May 1803, Dessalines changed the blue to black soon after independence. These early
               flags also included Haiti’s national emblem, the palm tree surmounted by a Phrygian
               cap, with flags and cannons at its base. Alexandre Pétion, Haiti’s first mulatto leader,
               returned the black band to blue, though switched the bands to a horizontal orientation,
               which is what is used for this 1904 statue. Extreme <span class="foreign">noiriste</span> François Duvalier changed the blue back to black in 1966, with the blue returning
               after the fall of the Duvalier regime in 1986 (Heinl 109; Nicholls, 234-5).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Barthé with a copy of the painting from which to work. During this period, the national

               greater transatlantic powers with ameliorating lines for the nations within Haiti’s
               immediate region: “Let us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy
               our work; let us allow our neighbors to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under
               the laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary firebrands,
