               <p><em>The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave, Related by Herself</em> is a particularly slippery narrative. Published in 1831, it appeared well after the
                  1807 Act of Parliament that had abolished the slave trade, but just two years before
                  the Crown’s 1833 Emancipation Bill.

                           In addition, unlike the work of Equiano or Wheatley, Prince’s narrative is not self-penned,

                  prefatory remarks disavow any biased editorial work.

                  an almost epic catalogue of physical, sexual, and mental violations; scenes of forced,
                  degrading, and painful familial separation; accounts of “going from one butcher to
                  another” when being sold and passed on to new slave owners; and apostrophic appeals
                  given up to a Christian deity that both establish the speaker as righteous and call
                  attention to the contrastingly “ungodly” acts perpetrated by masters, overseers, and
                  plantocrats alike (71-2).

                  </div> However, this essay seeks to move beyond regarding this text as a record of the horrific
                  realties of the institution of slavery in some abstract sense. Instead, it turns to
                  the material and metaphoric significance of salt in Prince’s autobiography in order
                  to recover a lost history of the Caribbean slave economy and to recognize types of
                  rhetorical and artistic nuance overlooked in critical discussions about slave narratives.</p>
            </div>
            <p>A focus on salt allows us to see in more complicated ways how the narrative of Mary
               Prince figures in the popular imagination, especially when considering the ways in
               which histories of Caribbean slave economies have been and continue to be influenced
               by academic scholarship on the Caribbean, the Americas, and the British Empire. Prince’s
               account of slavery in the Bermudan salt flats bespeaks a commercial diversity not
               often acknowledged in scholarly accounts of slave economies. Current critical dialogues
               seem to have let our Romantic predecessors set the boundaries of our considerations
               of the Caribbean and, like Coleridge, Shelley, or William Fox, we tend to speak widely
               about sugar and tobacco, two generally expendable or superfluous goods, and grant
               little attention to more essential consumables harvested by enslaved laborers. This
               concentration on the sweet or smoky has occluded the Caribbean salt industry’s material
               significance and covered over this particular slave commodity. Further, buttressing
               the vast amount of scholarship on the historical significance of luxury consumables
               which could easily impede international or regional revenue streams if boycotted,
               this paper brings to light the unacknowledged history of Caribbean salt raking relative
               to not only British colonial economies and politics, but also to the revolutionary
               history of the United States, in which it plays a pivotal role. </p>
            <p>Prince’s narrative attests to the importance of salt, a central product of slave labor
               in the British-held West Indies. Although its overall value is largely ignored in
               literary scholarship, harvesting salt proved harmful enough to inspire Prince’s rendition
               of a horrific <em>contortion of being</em>. Her repeated detrimental exposure to salt transforms Prince’s body, consciousness,
               and ultimately, of course, her narrative — making it tantamount to a material history
               and psychological case study of a forced merger of landscape, labor, body, and mind.
               Prince’s text records how lethal amounts of salt seep through the skin, forging a
               visceral, literal, and grotesque union between salt, the commodified substance, and
               the slave, the commodified worker.</p>
            <p>William Fox’s 
               “An Address to the People of Great Britain, on the Utility of Refraining from the
               Use of West India Sugar and Rum”
               exemplifies the general scope and reach of British abolitionist rhetoric, which was
               often linked only to the sugar trade. He describes the West Indies as “a world of
               groans, tears and blood, where the body is externalized, turned into the environment
               in which it is tortured” (131). For transatlantic slavery economies, it is precisely
               the salt marshes of the West Indies where such a transformation was possible; where
               the body is beyond a doubt “externalized” in the manner Fox mentions above as it blends
               and metamorphosizes into a state of dreadful hypersalinity, increasingly absorbing
               and resembling the salt-drenched landscape within which it labors. Critic Timothy
               Morton cites Fox’s speech in his wonderful collection <em>Radical Food</em>, but in keeping with contemporary discourse on slavery and British colonial commodities
               he applies the statement to sugar only, though it can also offer a point of origin
               for the complex array of Caribbean slave commodities, both excessive and essential
               (6-7, 13).</p>
            <p>In his influential exploration of what he identifies as the Blood Sugar topos, Morton
               explains how British subjects wrote, read, and parodied an association between the
               sugar in their tea and the blood of the slaves forced to harvest it, linking notions
               of guilt and shame to the consumption of sugar obtained from the West Indies. Building
               upon the ways that Morton catalogues the various cash crops produced by British holdings
               in the Caribbean, I would add to this list the interim period when Turks Island functioned
               as a source of salt, not a luxury good but a survival commodity. By providing a necessary
               substance and sacrificing their lives in the salt ponds, these enslaved subjects preserved
               the colonies by preserving the colonists’ food.</p>
            <p>Tellingly, salt does not meet the criterion of superfluousness that foments a sentiment
               of shameful consumption back in England and drives Romantic authors to decry slavery
               in droves. Morton’s project reminds us of the type of self-righteous remarks Coleridge
               integrates into his lectures against slavery, which are as follows:<span class="quote">‘Surely if the inspired Philanthropist of Galilee were to revisit earth and be among
                  the feasters as at Cana he would not change Water into Wine but haply convert the
                  produce into the things producing, the occasioned into the things occasioning! Then
                  with our fleshly eye should we behold what even now truth-painting Imagination should
                  exhibit to us – instead of sweetmeats Tears and Blood, and Anguish – and instead of
                  Music groaning and the loud Peals of the Lash. (13-4)’</span> Coleridge’s critique depends upon not just Christian notions of transubstantiation.
               It also turns upon the ironic fluctuations coursing between his depiction of the horrifying
               affect generated by the suggestion of the slave body “groaning” under the “loud Peals
               of the Lash” and the celebratory sensations registered by the “feasters” of opulent
               and inessential “sweetmeats.” But the slave-based economy was more diverse than this,
               as the salt trade demonstrates. The Blood Sugar discourse never broadly acknowledges
               colonial profiteering reaped by the salt trade and includes only the most easily expendable
               of slave commodities; however, keeping this in mind, it is also important to consider
               how it would be difficult, if not unjust on various levels, to shame someone for consuming
               an item essential to life. In addition, the boycott of any luxury good engendered
               great economic consequences within the whole of the slave trade, bringing in larger
               tax revenues per item than common goods like salt.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Further complicating the history of this discourse, Prince repeatedly refers to the
                  “sweetness” of freedom in her text, but the fact that she works in the salt flats
                  instead of sugarcane fields problematizes the textual figuration of the “image of
                  sugar-as-revolution, of rebellion-as-sweet, which holds these two meanings so delicately
                  in (dis)solution” (Morton 102).

                           J. Kitson (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1998) 87-106.</span></div>
                  </div> Pertaining to the sugar trade, the association between sweetness and freedom hybridizes
                  the qualities of the sugar trade and of sugar the commodity: sugar signifies the pain
                  and harm slavery incurs, while standing as a celebrated consumable with a taste so
                  palatable that it can represent slavery’s opposite, freedom. In contrast, sweetness
                  for Prince is only ever the antithesis of salt; salt is not her preservation. Her
                  slave status denies her even the dietary benefits salt yields for those classed high
                  enough to consume salt-preserved meat. For her corn-fed and meat-deprived existence,
                  salt only and exclusively helps others such as the American revolutionaries, whose
                  support of economic and political independence figures conversely to her imprisonment.
                  As she concludes her history, Prince repeats one of her main claims: “All slaves want
                  to be free—to be free is very sweet” (85, 93). Although Prince was born in Brackish
                  Pond, Bermuda, a site named after the intersection between salt water and fresh water,
                  her text displays not one kind word devoted to the world of the savory; there is no
                  such salient, silver-lined nostalgia or ironic wordplay attributed to salt. She goes
                  on record as contrasting, insisting, repeating that “to be free is very sweet.” Unlike
                  the Blood Sugar topos, which allowed literary giants to dabble in its ironic aesthetic,
                  Prince’s daily encounters and direct material relationship with the savory commodity
                  that is salt drive the ironic inflections embedded in her allusions to human liberty
                  rendered “sweet.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Salt is the linguistic linchpin of Prince’s narrative just as it was the all-consuming
                  force behind her existence on Turks Island. Thus, salt offers a poetic as well as
                  material significance to Caribbean history. According to figures compiled by the National
                  Museum on Turks Island, salt production began in the Bermudas by default. At the close
                  of the seventeenth century, the greater expanses of the North American mainland dwarfed
                  Bermuda’s tobacco output, so Bermuda needed “another export, and they found it in
                  salt production on Grand Turk Island” (3).

                  </div> Beginning in 1660, and continuing for 300 years, the salt trade was the foundation
                  of the island’s economy (2). By the time of the American Revolution, the colonies
                  on the North American mainland had greatly increased the demand for salt. At this
                  point maritime law decreed that any “American vessel carrying salt was automatically
                  subject to seizure,” but Bermuda “was at the same time dependent on the mainland for
                  survival and so continued an illegal trade with the colonies” (10). During the period
                  when European North America stretched from the Atlantic coast to the Appalachians,
                  mainland salt sources were scarce. Merchants had to turn to Europe and the West Indies
                  for salt, and Grand Turk and Salt Cay in fact provided roughly one-sixth of the salt
                  British North Americans consumed before the American Revolution (15). Museum sources
                  trumpet the point that “salt imports [were] vital to the success of the American Revolution
                  and [that] the United States was dependent upon the salt imports . . . until almost
                  the end of the nineteenth century” (16).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Unlike most historical surveys produced today that focus almost exclusively on the
               Bermudan sugar trade, various historical texts from the colonial period evidence the
               Bermudan salt works, and the impact of its respective slave economy. A chronicle entitled
               
               “Salt”
               from John Holroyd, the Earl of Sheffield’s 1783 <em>Observations on the Commerce of the American States with Europe and the West Indies</em>, confirms the Turks and Caicos National Museum’s claims in the following remarks:
               <span class="quote">‘A great part of the salt consumed in the American States especially for butter and
                  pork, was imported from the salt islands in the West Indies; but the planters had
                  no concern with it; it was no production of their labor, but of the heat of the sun,
                  was collected by the Bermudans, and sold at a low price to the ships from the continent.
                  (25)’</span> The Earl of Sheffield not only documents the large amount of salt North American
               colonists demanded, but further displays the commodity as a source of easy profit
               for entrepreneurial British colonials. This passage also reveals the labor stratification
               involved in salt production, which relied on “Bermudan” labor, or, in other words,
               slave labor that would in time evolve into wage-slave labor. Adding greater detail,
               in the 1796 publication, <em>An Historical, Geographical, Commercial, and Philosophical View of the United States
                  of America, and of the European Settlements in America and the West-Indies</em>, William Winterbotham records Bermudan migratory labor practices, marking a seasonal
               influx of three to four hundred men who would leave Bermuda proper to rake salt on
               Turks Island. Winterbotham relates how the salt garnered from such projects was later
               “carried to America for provisions” (290). Additional evidence of an early North American
               dependence upon West Indian salt exists in the vast annals of George Washington’s
               letters. In various epistles Washington discusses Bermudan imports essential to pre-
               and post-revolutionary America, and in a letter drafted in 1779 he directly refers
               to the exchange of American-made flour for salt procured from the Bermudan Isles (436).</p>
            <p>These historical documents evidence the foundational trade relationship that bound
               the North American colonists to West Indian salt colonies; however, the scant amount
               of extant scholarship that touches upon this economic relationship presents almost
               no information covering the excruciating day-to-day realities involved in the processes
               of salt production. Even though the Turks and Caicos Islands’ Museum offers a nod
               to the salt industry and its legacy as a slave economy, it nevertheless replicates
               the popular focus on the sugar trade, providing just one brief paragraph detailing
               salt raking as “brutal labor,” and a few asides addressing how no colonists or planters
               would trouble themselves with the harsh business of harvesting salt from the ponds
               of Turks Island or Salt Cay. The Museum’s literature does, however, explain how standing
               in “brine all day or walking barefoot over chunks of salt crystal made the work drudgery.
               Cuts failed to heal and boils developed on skin constantly exposed to brine. The bright
               sun reflecting off salt water, white sand, and salt crystals contributed to the onset
               of blindness” (12). More nuanced and complete renderings of such labor-induced deformations
               do not exist in the archival depositories or in the holdings of the Turks and Caicos
               National Museum, but they frequently emerge in Prince’s narrative.</p>
            <p>Prince allows us to bridge a gap in our understanding of the history of salt production
               even though, as Moira Ferguson rightly notes, the Bermudan salt industry was in decline
               by the time Prince became involved in it (8). Prince’s experience in the salt ponds
               provides her the means to display the material horrors of this specific mode of slave
               labor, and also enables her to create a personal metaphor or trope for the moral corruption
               that slavery was spreading well beyond the salt works of Turks Island. On a material
               level, American revolutionaries either had no access to or had to turn their backs
               on British imports, making them dependent upon the salt harvested in the brackish
               Bermuda. This made salt mining on Turks Island as lucrative as it was inhumane, and
               in various passages Prince strives to unveil the atrocities salt imposes on the bodies
               forced to rake it. Ultimately, Prince molds her many references to the salt industry
               of Turks Island into a compelling trope, grafting her figurations of a body and mind
               transformed by labor onto narratives of a British body politic and its ideological
               claims that purport to be working for freedom. Further, Prince’s testimony acknowledges
               how even though the enslaved salt rakers had to dedicate the majority of any twenty-four
               hour day to laboring in the salt flats, these were not the only moments in which slaves
               on Turks Island were dosed with deadly amounts of salt.</p>
            <p>Prince describes a typical day of salt raking as one beginning at 4 a.m. with labor
               continuing until dark, interrupted solely by rushed breaks—the only point at which
               she could eat (71). She explains that she stood “up to (her) knees in the water” and
               because they “worked through the heat of the day ... salt blisters [formed] in those
               parts [of the body] which were not completely covered” (71-2). Speaking for herself
               and other members of this enslaved population, she recounts how “[o]ur feet and legs,
               from standing in salt water for so many hours, soon became full of dreadful boils,
               which eat down in some cases to the very bone” (72). Thus pickled, they would return
               to the salt ponds every day except for Sunday. “On Sundays,” she narrates, “we went
               into the bush and cut the long soft grass, of which we made trusses for our legs and
               feet to rest upon, for they were so full of salt boils that we could get no rest lying
               upon the bare boards” (72). Even her supposed day of rest is spent in reaction to
               the salt she would otherwise be laboring to produce. It cannot be overemphasized that
               upon Prince’s arrival at Turks Island, nearly every moment of her waking life centered
               on salt. Compounding the extent to which salt eats away at the majority of Prince’s
               wakeful hours spent on Turks Island, the bodily wounds she incurs from salt mining
               prohibited even the prospect of healing sleep.</p>
            <p>Alongside Prince’s gruesome catalogue, spawned out of an almost ubiquitous physical
               presence of and proximity to salt, are the seemingly unconscious references to a salt-based
               existence that penetrates much more than her flesh. Sodium chloride invades her being
               and narrative like a virus. On a level far beyond the possible morphology or contortion
               of being perpetrated by any number of inhumane slave labor practices embedded within
               Caribbean or North American mainland sugar production processes, salt laborers are
               consumed by the commodity they labor to produce; as the salt wounds fester, deepen,
               and increasingly mutate the body, these laborers become hypersalinated humans, undergoing
               a cruel sea change, mentally as well as physically. Not only does salt become the
               crux of Prince’s existence on Turks Island—she is literally a slave to salt and rarely
               allowed to pursue anything outside fostering its production—but, additionally, she
               frames her existence through the lens of salt. </p>
            <p>Discussions of various moments throughout her life often disclose how this decade
               as a salt laborer marks her psychically. As she laments being separated from her family,
               a rupture that took place long before she worked salt but which she narrates after
               slaving on Turks Island, she discloses how the “trials” of her life as a slave “make
               the <em>salt water</em> come into my eyes when I think of the days in which I was afflicted—the times that
               are gone; when I mourned and grieved with a young heart for those whom I loved” (64;
               emphasis added). The same commodity that corrodes this enslaved body of labor also
               assumes a descriptive placeholder for Prince’s tears and consumes her emotionally.
               After she leaves Turks Island and serves as a domestic slave on the island of Bermuda,
               Prince describes how she finds her “master beating his daughter,” and how she attempts
               to intercede until he “began to lick (her) [with a lash]. Then (she) said, ‘Sir, this
               is not Turk’s Island’” (77). Revisiting Prince’s narrative with special attention
               to the salt trade, the term “lick” bears an especially disturbing resonance because
               of the traditional place of a salt lick, being what hunters set out to lure game.
               However, this particular moment also marks how Prince associates the place name of
               Turks Island with a space of exceptional and irregular wrongs—an alternate moral universe
               where travesties of justice become admissible. Likewise, in a poignant but brief consideration
               of salt in Charlotte Sussman’s book on commodities of consumption, she notes how Prince’s
               diction links the “sentimental recollections [that] ‘make salt water’” spring from
               the eyes to the “physical labor involved in producing salt, and the physical pain
               of being made to drink saltwater.” Sussman acknowledges that this phenomenon implies
               a close tie between “sentimental affect and the material conditions of Caribbean slave
               women,” a tie, further, that surpasses that of other abolitionist texts (153-4).</p>
            <p>Within a critical tradition that refuses to imbue Prince’s narrative with the truth-value
               granted to self-penned slave narratives, critics like Gillian Whitlock have nevertheless
               uncovered how this text carries the historical heft that it has long enjoyed. Whitlock
               underscores how those passages dedicated to figurations of the body and bodily harm
               have fared better historically, and have been readily taken as true or truthfully
               representative of Prince’s lived experience. Whitlock notes the following: “[u]ltimately,
               the inscriptions of flogging on the body of the Caribbean woman, a body made grotesque
               and painful by abuse, are what speak authentically to the good people of England”
               (<em>Intimate</em> 23). I would like to suggest that the audience might not read the bodily images incorporated
               into this narrative as exclusively as Whitlock implies, or with a truth value different
               to that which they grant to other elements of Prince’s text. But regardless, Whitlock’s
               observations prove valuable to my project because they reveal how Prince’s record
               of bodily horrors did and may still ring true for many readers, which in turn, could
               then add substance and authority to those metaphors and associations she links to
               salt-induced transfigurations of the body.</p>
            <p>Adding to the various examples that demonstrate how Prince’s time as a salt laborer
               becomes a metaphoric or associative touchstone, emotional disclosures are in fact
               continually linked to detrimental bodily encounters with salt. As Prince launches
               into her final account of the ten years she slaves in the salt marshes she completes
               her chronicle of Turks Island with a portrayal of a brutally mistreated old slave
               named Sarah, who was “beaten severely,” and “flung … among the prickly-pear bushes,
               which [were] all covered over with sharp venomous prickles. By this,” Prince continues,
               “her naked flesh was so grievously wounded, that her body swelled and festered all
               over, and she died a few days after” (75). This specific scene of a slave woman’s
               death, brought on by wounded flesh paired with a swollen and festering body, does
               not complete Prince’s dictation of the life of a salt laborer by accident. Rather,
               this narrative arrangement displays a subtle link functioning in Prince’s mind and
               propelling her narrative, a train of thought that fuses images of paramount and painful
               bodily transformations and punishments with the space and labor of the Turks Island
               salt ponds. Much in the same way, and not more than a sentence later, she remarks,
               <span class="quote">‘I think it was about ten years I had worked … at Turk’s Island, when my master left
                  off business, and retired to a house in Bermuda, leaving his son to succeed him in
                  the island. He took me with him to wait upon his daughters; and I was joyful, for
                  I was sick, sick of Turk’s Island, and my heart yearned to see my native place again,
                  my mother, and my kindred. (75-6)’</span></p>
            <p>The fact that Prince so enthusiastically embraces a different mode of slave labor
               underscores the especially compromising conditions she endures raking salt. Additionally,
               the confession that she is “sick, sick of Turk’s Island” can signify not only on the
               level of the figurative, but also in the literal sense, especially when paired with
               the following information regarding the type of medical treatment Prince and other
               slaves were granted there. In a sadly ironic turn, Prince discloses how her overseer
               at Turks Island attempts to treat illness with a supposed salt-cure. Prince explains,
               “when we were ill, […] the only medicine given to us was a great bowl of hot salt
               water, with salt mixed with it, which made us very sick” (73). In stating that their
               only “medicine” is salt, Prince successfully portrays a complete merger of labor,
               land, and body. </p>
            <p>Shortly after these reflections, Prince remembers a moment taken from “the time [that
               she] was a slave on Turk’s Island” when she finally gets to see her mother (76). A
               ship arrives in port loaded with more slaves imported to work the salt flats, and
               her mother happens to be aboard the ship. Prince divulges that she “could scarcely
               believe” this news, “but when [she] saw [her] poor mammy [her] joy was turned to sorrow,
               for she had gone from her senses.” She then narrates how her mother “began to talk
               foolishly, and said that she had been under the vessel’s bottom” (76). Salt water
               quite obviously not only stands in ponds for raking salt, but encompasses the oceans
               that all slaves were forced to travel when they were brought to work in the colonies.
               Although Prince’s enslaved mother does not work in the salt ponds, she too reaches
               her compromised state from within a damaging cocoon of oceanic salt water. This fluid
               series of connections is paralleled literally by the porous nature of the skin and
               psyche which for Prince have both been soaked in salt—a process that opens physical
               and psychic wounds as it exposes both her exterior and interior body to the potentially
               threatening substance. </p>
            <p>Prince characterizes a tortured life lived in saline, but she also narrates salt-related
               mortification and death—a slow manifestation of dying also instigated by crystals
               of salt—and so figures a complete circle of salt-saturated life, a trajectory of being
               filtered almost entirely through the commodity she is forced to slave for. Prince
               writes: <span class="quote">‘Work—work—work—Oh that Turk’s Island was a horrible place! The people in England,
                  I am sure, have never found out what is carried on there. Cruel, horrible place! ’</span> <span class="quote">‘Mr. D— had a slave called old Daniel, whom he used to treat in the most cruel manner.
                  Poor Daniel was lame in the hip, and could not keep up with the rest of the slaves;
                  and our master would order him to be stripped and laid down on the ground, and have
                  him beaten with a rod of rough briar till his skin was quite red and raw. He would
                  then call for a bucket of salt, and fling [it] upon the raw flesh till the man writhed
                  on the ground like a worm, and screamed aloud with agony. This poor man’s wounds were
                  never healed, and I have often seen them full of maggots, which increased his torments
                  to an intolerable degree. He was an object of pity and terror to the whole gang of
                  slaves, and in his wretched case we saw, each of us, our own lot, if we should live
                  to be as old. (73-4)’</span> In <em>Sucking Salt</em> Meredith Gadsby identifies how ‘“seasoning,’ or the agony of a whipped slave whose
               bleeding wounds are rubbed with salt or washed with brine—and the simultaneous necessary
               dependence on salt for sufficient seasoning of foods speak to the notions of balance
               and excess” (10). Prince characterizes Daniel’s torture by salt-lash, which Gadsby
               reminds us is termed “seasoning” in the colonial Caribbean vernacular, as a feasible
               future for the “whole gang of slaves,” who go through excessive and brutal salt-induced
               reconfigurations of body and mind in order to provide the “sufficient seasoning of
               foods” that meets the needs of multiple national projects and kitchen tables. Moreover,
               Prince’s disturbing narrative of how “poor. . . Daniel’s . . . wounds were never healed”
               parallels the course of her own life both in the West Indies and later in England.
               When she reports her story to her amanuensis, and although she is nominally “free”
               in England, at least a decade after her salting days, she has not healed either bodily
               or psychologically. Like Daniel’s story, hers does not end in death or any substantive
               freedom, but in suffering, both of them possessing transformed bodies abandoned to
               a narratological limbo or an eternal hell, where their mutilated external forms perpetually
               display a tormented subject within.</p>
            <p>Prince, who narratologically expresses her knowledge of the mental and physical abuses
               her masters inflict upon her, also depicts what could amount to a type of bodily speech
               or protest during the latter years of her life, which take place in England. Notably,
               withstanding the fact that England held slavery to be illegal since the 1772 Mansfield
               decision in the Somerset case, and that Prince adopts the name of Molly Wood, accompanying
               her West Indian master (Mr. Wood) and mistress across the Atlantic with future freedom
               in mind, she was not granted any such liberty upon arrival (86). As Ferguson’s masterful
               archival work avers, in 1829 and after Prince’s <em>History</em> was drafted, she unsuccessfully petitioned the House of Lords for her freedom (127).
               Now living in England and under the last master she introduces in her narrative, Prince
               details how she is now “quite cripple;” “I soon fell ill of the rheumatism, and grew
               so very lame that I was forced to walk with a stick . . . . I was ill a long long
               time; for several months I could not lift [a] limb” (79). Prince’s body revolts, refuses
               to continue to submit to the demands laid down by impossible labor expectations. The
               relation of Prince’s own bodily disfigurement suggests that she ought to have put
               down her toil no matter what sort of system of labor required it. The intense labor
               Prince performs wreaks havoc upon her flesh, propelling her to her “crippled” state.
               However, Prince’s <em>History</em> is rarely examined as a critique of damaging labor practices, although the inhumane
               salt raking processes presented in her narrative would outlast chattel slavery.</p>
            <p>The troubling encounters Prince recites heighten the specificity and novelty of salt
               labor simply because this commodity merges with the laboring body to such a great
               extent— perhaps comparable only to those arduous and intrusive tasks born by coal
               and lead miners who were likewise compromised by their work environments. Salt literally
               breaches the boundary between the commodity and the laboring body. After Prince works
               in the salt flats of Turks Island, she emerges from her labor greatly changed. She
               is cannibalized by salt; she exists as a human commodity, a slave, and harvests a
               commodity, salt, that devours her flesh. This economy of cannibalism and corporeal
               alteration entails an existential transformation. Tales of raw, grated flesh incurred
               from brutal labor or slavery practices are not new, but here we are introduced to
               a story that serves as a critique not simply of slave labor, but also of what would
               prove to be standard labor practices found in the Caribbean salt industry even after
               slavery was abolished. Prince’s narrative underscores the particularity of this unique
               historic and geographic context as the body loses a contest of differentiation with
               salt, its co-commodity.</p>
            <p>Prince seeks to escape this threatening saline world in an idealized Britain; according
               to her history, the sheer horror of her salt-drenched state drives Prince to evoke
               her definition of Anglo-Saxon values, which she juxtaposes against what qualify as
               distinctly un-English acts perpetrated by who those who crossed the Atlantic. When
               Prince invokes a singularly English ethical code and exclaims that the “people in
               England,” surely, “have never found out what is carried on” at Turks Island, she rehearses
               an abolitionist view, purporting these enslaved populations to be systemically dependent
               upon British subjects. Moreover, the rhetorical charge she lofts upon a particularly
               English ethos fantastically subordinates not only the slaveholders and abolitionists
               but also the enslaved populace in the colonies to an idealized public across the sea,
               as she reinvests powerful authority in a body of English people who, by this line
               of reasoning, could feasibly halt the brutalization that American abolitionists, or
               any enslaved individuals, seemingly cannot. Prince appeals to her English readership,
               announcing, “I am often much vexed, and feel great sorrow when I hear some people
               in [England] say, that the slaves do not need better usage, and do not want to be
               free. They believe the foreign people who deceive them, and say slaves are happy.
               I say, Not so” (93). Prince attempts to use her identity—not that of a British subject
               but that of a “freed” slave on British soil—to include her pleas within a national
               popular fantasy, one of an inherently freedom-centric “English people” (93, 94). Jenny
               Sharpe’s consideration of Prince’s <em>History</em> provides a particularly instructive discussion on the deployment of strategic tropes
               and omissions within various abolitionist-backed slave narratives. Prince’s text enacts
               this type of rhetorical move, especially where she paints the fate of any and all
               enslaved bodies of people in the British-held West Indies as being exclusively determined
               by citizens living in England. Sharpe compellingly argues that such narrative devices
               covered over and ignored the agency exhibited by slaves who ran away, revolted, or
               escaped slavery without nationalized or outside aid of any kind (124-127).</p>
            <p>In addition to Sharpe’s foundational work, a more recent article by Kremena Todorova
               also recognizes Prince’s nationalized rhetoric and how her narrative plays into British
               exceptionalism. Todorova writes, “[i]n the discourse originated by [Prince’s] <em>History</em>, the English character and identity are consistently shielded from implications of
               immorality. Even though plantocrats and abolitionists [were] divided over the question
               of slavery, both sides avow[ed] their endorsement of a glorious English national identity”
               (299). However, Prince’s story subtly interrogates just how well England measures
               up to this ideal by depicting the horrors that British men and women perpetrate on
               both sides of the Atlantic. Even as she relates how her mistress “stripped and flogged
               her,” which she follows with a report of her master “abusing [her] with every ill
               name he could think of,” she censors herself and does not repeat any of these damning
               expletives, deeming them to be “(too, too bad to speak in England)” (68). Through
               such reticence she pays homage to an idealized version of an upright English nation,
               and Prince suggests, by definition, that even unjust words, let alone acts, cannot
               be pronounced or performed upon its righteous soil. By extension, such passages beg
               the question of why these expletives are somehow permissible on British-held soil,
               and implore one to question the practices and qualities of the English men and women
               who operate in this way.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Prince’s work as a salt laborer, status as a female slave, and affiliation with the
                  British West Indies allow her to import startling eyewitness testimony to her now
                  nearby English readers. She retrieves and salvages stories amassed from the very realms
                  that contorted her subjectivity and human form, delivering them to English citizens
                  who are complicit with the abuses exacted within Britain’s colonial holdings. She
                  absorbs even the bodily impact of the oceanic voyage many English subjects never took,
                  in addition to the tolls exacted in and out of the salt marshes. “This is slavery”
                  she explains: “I tell it to let the English people know the truth” (94). In moments
                  like these, Prince also helps to define what English morality is or should be. Strikingly
                  similar to Hegel’s analysis of the 
                  “Lord and the Bondsman,”
                   this unchosen yet pivotal role tasks Prince in a way that transforms her physically
                  and mentally under slavery. In addition, it confirms Prince’s position as a black
                  female orator or narrator and occupant of what Paul Gilroy has established as the
                  black diaspora’s inside/outside locality within Modernity, enabling her narrative
                  to carry special weight.

                           by those populations that have been largely excluded or deemed to be outsiders. He

                           constructed by alien outsiders like Carlyle, Swift, Scott, or Eliot should augment

                           counter cultural patriotisms are perhaps better understood as having been generated
                           in a complex pattern of antagonistic relationships with the supra-national and imperial

            <p>Read in light of the historical documents compiled here, we can see how the fruit
               of Prince’s torturous labor filled the pockets of British colonial investors, and
               fed scores of American colonists during that nation’s quest for revolutionary freedoms.
               But, although its extraction was beneficial materially, the realities of salt production
               under slavery corrode the liberatory claims of both nations. This, I have attempted
               to argue, is the type of implicit critique produced in the numerous occasions where
               Prince juxtaposes British idealism with harrowing tales of the everyday drudgery she
               experiences on Turks Island and even back in Britain. Indeed, Prince contributes to
               absolutist visions of British exceptionalism, replete with discourses of British liberty,
               justice, and righteousness, but her version of this exceptionalism insists on recognizing
               that these laudable standards be necessarily counterpoised to those propagated in
               the salt works in which she slaved. In her narrative, Prince, like others forced into
               the salt industry, materially preserves two nations while the very salt she unwillingly
               rakes continually corrodes and eats at her flesh and soul. The various trials of unfreedom
               and the psychological and physical injury Prince endures not only produce a deformed
               body and a reformulated consciousness, but also spawn her multivalenced testimony.
               Such physical and mental legacies emerge from her intimate knowledge and experience,
               and like the material history of salt in this Caribbean slave economy and its crucial
               place in North American revolutionary life, they might be lost to us without her narrative.</p>

               by those populations that have been largely excluded or deemed to be outsiders. He
               writes, “The fact that some of the most potent conceptions of Englishness have been
               constructed by alien outsiders like Carlyle, Swift, Scott, or Eliot should augment
               the note of caution sounded here. The most heroic subaltern English nationalism and
               counter cultural patriotisms are perhaps better understood as having been generated
               in a complex pattern of antagonistic relationships with the supra-national and imperial
               world for which the ideas of ‘race,’ nationality and national culture provide primary
               (though not the only) indices.” Paul Gilroy, <em>The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness </em>(Cambridge: Harvard UP 1993) 11.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
