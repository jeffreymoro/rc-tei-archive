         <p>There is no outside: —this is the main watchword of our time; the second one is that

                  </sup></a> My hypothesis is that there is a secret complicity between the foreclosure (<span style="font-style:italic">Verwerfung</span>) of the outside, which causes a psycho-political illness that I call <span style="font-style:italic">exophobia</span> (the fear of the outside), and the rejection of nature, the <span style="font-style:italic">anaturalism</span> constituting the technophilic basis of the Anthropocene and its geo-engineering fantasies.
            Romanticism could be used as a cure for both exophobia and anaturalism.</p>
         <p>Leaning on a genealogy that extends from Heraclitus and the Greek atomists to Friedrich
            Nietzsche, I first want to offer a metaphysical explanation of the healthful rejection,
            by the philosophies of immanence, of the idea of a transcendent outside. Devoted to
            this ontological rejection, the first section of my essay will especially focus on
            the way Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels tied the rejection of the outside to the disappearance
            of nature, a rejection and a disappearance that could not be understood without considering
            the rise of capitalism and its social, industrial anthropization of nature. In the
            second section, I will shed some light on a crucial difference between thinkers of
            the first post-structuralist wave (amongst others: Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze,
            Jean-François Lyotard, and Luce Irigaray) and those who belong to the second post-structuralist
            one (Bruno Latour and Antonio Negri) –— a difference that is, to me, not underlined
            enough in contemporary debates striving to evaluate post-structuralism in order to
            go beyond it and to develop a new kind of theory, be it under the name of new materialism,
            object-oriented philosophy, speculative realism, or the anthropology of ontological
            turn. The thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave strengthened and developed
            the calling into question of the great divides (between nature and culture, male and
            female, and so on) and the rejection of any kind of transcendent Outside, a rejection
            and a questioning that was initiated by thinkers of immanence (as we will have seen
            in the first section of my essay). The second poststructuralist wave, on the other
            hand, put things this way: 1) Yes, there is no transcendent Outside, and, <span style="font-style:italic">consequently</span> there is no outside at all <a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                  (2)
                  </sup></a>; 2) Yes, nature and society are indistinguishable, and <span style="font-style:italic">consequently</span> nature does not exist any longer.<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                  (3)
                  </sup></a></p>
         <p>In the three last sections of my essay, I will object to these two problematic consequences
            that, I argue, underpin the Anthropocene and its disastrous environmental consequences.
            To support my philosophical objection, I will devote the third section to an explanation
            of what I call the <span style="font-style:italic">field of existential differences</span>, a concept leaning on the following thesis: indeed, there is no <span style="font-style:italic">absolute</span> Outside, but there is an<span style="font-style:italic">infinity of outsides</span>, as innumerable as there are singular existences. Each outside opens itself inside
            each existing being – —“chose inouïe, c’est au-dedans de soi qu’il faut regarder le
            dehors” (surprisingly, it is inside yourself that you can look at the outside),” argues
            Victor Hugo (<span style="font-style:italic">Préface</span>PO, 699).<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                  (4)
                  </sup></a> This internal outside is the condition of the possibility of relationality, or more
            accurately of communication: existing beings can communicate thanks to their internal
            openness. Communication occurs between different beings – —that is to say, beings
            defined by their existential difference; furthermore, each existential difference
            (each existing being) reveals a field to which it belongs. This field is not a pre-existing
            substance, but an ontological domain transformed by the appearance of new forms of
            existence.</p>
         <p>Once my existentialist proposition is explained, I will be able to revisit the concept
            of nature. Instead of liquidating nature – —killing it;, turning it into asubstantial,
            fungible things, resources for human “progress” – —I will lean on several Romantic
            writers to describe, in the fourth and fifth sections, nature as a field of existential
            differences. As a form of thought, Romanticism was always subject to several metaphysical
            oscillations: between the natural and the supernatural, between revolutionary stances
            and reactionary retractions, and between a militant optimism (Percy Shelley’s “If
            Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” in his “Ode to the West Wind" and a dark
            pessimism (Lord Byron’s “better not to be” at the end of “Euthanasie"). Instead of
            too quickly favoring only one dimension of Romantic thought, I’d rather argue in this
            essay that these oscillations draw a space of fundamental polarities that still help
            us to understand our contemporary situation. Romanticism is of course historically
            datable, and we can track its origins, its forerunners, and its acme; but Romanticism
            also constitutes an event, à la Alain Badiou, that is to say, a figure of truth that
            is still available, a “surviving Romanticism” –— to borrow from Sara Guyer (18-–20)
            —that we can still solicit for our present. </p>
         <p>In this sense, I agree with Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre when they define Romanticism
            as a transhistorical vision having as its center “a reaction against the way of life
            in capitalist societiesy” (17) – —a reaction giving rise to revolutionary statements
            <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> to Gérard de Nerval’s “black sun of Melancholia.” We thus must not forget that, insofar
            as society is still capitalist, Romanticism is still topical. For Löwy and Sayre,
            “Far from conveying an outsiders’ view, far from being a critique rooted in some elsewhere,
            the Romantic view constitutes modernity’s self-criticism. ” (21). Yet I claim that
            it’s only because Romanticism reveals or produces outsides <span style="font-style:italic">from within</span> that Romanticism can—still—constitute an alternative to capitalism. When the present
            is too compact, too immanent, too anthropomorphized, too enclosed in itself, we need
            thinkers and activists risking an elsewhere – —revealing, building, and, in the end,
            communicating an outside to everyone, at least potentially. My hypothesis is that
            it’s possible to save the concept of nature, not as a stable transcendent entity on
            which racist and sexist politics could be built, but as an element of disruption.
            Leaning on Victor Hugo and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, I will define nature as 1). something
            that can neither be reduced to a transcendent part nor to an immediate and visible
            aspect and 2. ) a plural mediation enabling a political critique of society. Nature
            is plural; , but this plurality does not lead to considering the world as a collection
            of ontologically equivalent entities; rather, natures are profoundly different, profoundly
            different, sometimes contradictory, always deceiving our expectations along with our
            unfortunate attempt to reduce them to something or to nothing. Natures disrupt both
            the human/non-human divide and the attempt to erase it in a peaceful liberal world
            that a Parliament of humans orand/and or things could govern. If we want to prevent
            the Anthropocene from becoming cosmophagic – —from eating, swallowing, destroying
            the non-human universe - —and in the end from becoming anthropophagic for lack of
            otherness, then we must leave a place for an updated concept of nature that could
            foster an anti-Anthropocenic politics.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">End of the Outside, End of Nature</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>Here is my opening question: what has motivated the radical reconsideration of any
               figure of otherworldliness or outer-worldliness? With such a question, the name of
               Friedrich Nietzsche comes to mind. In <span style="font-style:italic">Twilight of the Idols</span>, he showed “how the ‘true world’ finally became a fable” (17). This Nietzschean detonation
               tends to extinguish not only the Christian religion but also Plato, insofar as Christianity,
               Nietzsche says in <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond Good and Evil</span>, was nothing more than a “Platonism for the people” (3). If this destruction affects
               both God and the so-called platonic intelligible world, our investigation should on
               the one hand look for the historical, religious, and philosophical sources of the
               theme of the Death of God, and on the other hand grasp the way in which many thinkers
               kept trying to avoid the ontological separation between the here-below and the beyond
               that Plato is said to have opened.</p>
            <p>Regarding the topic of the Death of God, I will note that this is already present
               in many authors before Nietzsche. Jean Paul writes in 1796: “‘’Christ, is there no
               God?’ And he answered: ‘There is none!’,” (336). In fact, the death of God was only
               a nightmare, not a reality, for this early German Romantic; but this bad dream will
               haunt Romanticism -— as I will explain again at the end of my essay -— and beyond
               it all of German Idealism.<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                     (5)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>The question of ontological separation would require an investigation that cannot
               be completed in this essay: I would have to show how Baruch Spinoza defines substance
               as “indivisible,” how Denis Diderot argues that everything is “sentient,” shifting
               without discontinuity from inertia to living bodies, and how Heraclitus, Epicurus,
               and Lucretius argue that everything flows.<a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                     (6)
                     </sup></a> All these authors, from Heraclitus and the Greek atomists to the Nietzsche of the
               <span style="font-style:italic">Gay Science</span>, produced an ontology of nature —or an ontology of life — rejecting the idea of a
               transcendent Outside. Yet it’s only with Marx and Engels that the world was, for the
               first time, defined as <span style="font-style:italic">practically</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">historically</span> one, enclosed on itself. The diagnosis of these two authors still determines our
               contemporary relation with nature and the outside, which is why I want to shed some
               light on their theoretical matrix.</p>
            <p>Indeed, starting with the<span style="font-style:italic">Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts </span>of 1844, Marx argued that nature and society are concretely indistinguishable: Nature,
               he wrote, is inserted into the “self-generation” of Humanity (356). In other words,
               Nature is “man’s <span style="font-style:italic">inorganic body</span>” that is to say not only “a direct means of life” but first and foremost “the matter,
               the object and the tool of his life activity” (328). In <span style="font-style:italic">The German Ideology</span>, which was written in the wake of the 1844 <span style="font-style:italic">Manuscripts</span>, Marx and Engels explain that the transformation of Nature is the effect of a global
               industrial process: capitalism is but a megamachine turning the whole world into a
               gigantic Marketplace, reducing nature to a mere product. During this process, Nature
               lost any kind of exteriority: <span class="quote">‘Of course, in all this the priority of external nature remains unassailed, and all
                  this has no application to the original men produced by <span style="font-style:italic">generatio aequivoca</span> [spontaneous generation]; but this differentiation has meaning only insofar as man
                  is considered to be distinct from nature. For that matter, nature, the nature that
                  preceded human history, is not by any means the nature in which Feuerbach lives, it
                  is nature which today no longer exists anywhere (except perhaps on a few Australian
                  coral-islands of recent origin). (<span style="font-style:italic">The German Ideology</span> 63)’</span> <span style="font-style:italic">Capital</span> will show how, with the reign of commodities, every terrestrial reality loses its
               singularity and becomes an element of a specific immanence: the equivalence of everything
               with everything, which is not so far away, according to Alexander Galloway, from the
               world flat ontologies —and object-oriented philosophies that strive to go beyond the
               post-structuralist mode of thinking - —describe. In 1863, in a famous unpublished
               chapter of <span style="font-style:italic">Capital</span> Marx proposes two important concepts for our inquiry: “formal subsumption” of labor
               to capital - ( when capital subordinates preexisting productive forces) and “real
               subsumption” (when capital becomes able to produce its own means, its own machines
               and methods of production, reshaping everything on the basis of its own requirements)
               (128–36). Real subsumption is the capitalist name for the end of the outside, the
               process through which capitalism reconfigures everything on Earth –in other words,
               the beginning of geo-capitalism and its anthropocenic effects.</p>
            <p>In this regard, we could say that the (celebrated or wished-for) end of the Great
               divides between nature and society/culture/technology, the disappearance of the Outside,
               and the melting of nature into anthropogenic activities, are not new ideas coming
               from 20<sup>th</sup> twentieth-century constructivist thinkers, or Actor-Network Theory promoters, but
               from Marx and Engels, 150 years ago. Like Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Epicurus, Marx and
               Engels were thinkers of immanence who fought against transcendence (of God, of “Man,”
               of commodities and their fetishism, etc.) and against the divisions opened up by transcendence.
               However, unlike Democritus, Diderot, Spinoza, or Nietzsche, Marx and Engels did not
               anyno longer needed an ontology of nature to destroy the great divides and absolute
               transcendence. Instead of ontology, they appealed to economics: they wanted to grasp
               the <span style="font-style:italic">nomos</span> of our capitalist <span style="font-style:italic">oikos</span>, the rules of an industrial globalization in the process of swallowing the Earth,
               regurgitating it as <span style="font-style:italic">partes extra partes</span> commodities. Since the advent of modernity and its geo-capitalist scaffolding, we
               could say, parodying Wittgenstein,: if nature could talk, only commodities would understand
               it.</p>

            </header>
            <p>From cybernetics to object-oriented philosophies through post-structuralism, a theoretical
               challenge has been advanced: who will be able to definitively erase the difference
               between living and non-living beings, nature and artifacts, organisms and machines?
               What will be – —please, forgive my irony - —the best theory able to justify in ontological
               terms what capitalism already began to perform in the nineteenth century? During the
               last 30 years, sociologist Ulrich Beck, meta-sociologist Bruno Latour, and cyber-feminist
               Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour –— authors who belong to what I call the second post-structuralist
               wave –— have blurred the theoretical division between nature and society, human beings,
               animals, and artificial beings.<a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                     (7)
                     </sup></a> French anthropologist Philippe Descola —a proponent of what I have called in the
               introduction the anthropology of ontological turn, which aims to replace the concept
               of structure inherited from Claude Levi-Strauss with ontological propositions about
               cultures —has recently shown that we have to think “beyond nature and culture." And
               so? Is there anything here that is theoretically objectionable?</p>
            <p>Certainly not. The critique of the Great divides was necessary because these divisions
               were based on the concept of a transcendent Outside. This Outside, as I explained,
               was demolished by the attacks of Lucretius, Spinoza, Diderot, Nietzsche, and Marx.
               Besides, I find incredibly thoughtful and generous the way Donna Haraway thinks, the
               relations she produces between split domains of thought, and the capacity that she
               has to follow and tie different scientific, social, philosophical, political threads
               together. I still learn a lot from her, from her last theorizations about what she
               calls the “Chthulucene” (an Anthropocene conceptually reconfigured from a non-human,
               non-Western, non-phallocentric perspective), and I enjoy translating her work.<a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                     (8)
                     </sup></a> But many contemporary thinkers belonging to the second post-structuralist wave drew
               these two very problematic conclusions. First, if there is no absolute Outside, then
               there is no outside at all. Let us listen to Michael Hardt’s and Antonio Negri’s voices,
               in <span style="font-style:italic">Commonwealth</span>: “One primary effect of globalization is the creation of a common world, a world
               that, for better or worse, we all share, a world that has no ‘outside’” (vii). Second,
               if nature and society are indistinguishable, then nature does not exist any longer.
               “Thank God, nature is going to die,” Bruno Latour writes in <span style="font-style:italic">Politics of Nature</span> (25): “There is no rupture” between the world of the so-called “things ‘as they are’
               and human ‘representations’ of these things” (12). This lack of rupture was theorized
               by Ulrich Beck in<span style="font-style:italic">Risk Society</span> (the French edition of this book being prefaced by Latour). Like Marx and Engels,
               Beck speaks about “the end of the antithesis between nature and society”: nature is
               “a historical product,” a “second nature” (80-–81).</p>
            <p>What is wrong here? The fact that the theorists I have just quoted have melted two
               distinct concepts: cleavage (split, <span style="font-style:italic">Spaltung</span>) and difference. Thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave, like Derrida, Deleuze,
               or Irigaray, were thinkers of difference: they fought against cleavages, that is to
               say, <span style="font-style:italic">absolute </span>separations whose goal is to avoid any real relation between the considered terms.
               An <span style="font-style:italic">absolute</span> difference is nothing but the denial of difference itself, the denial of the relation
               that a difference is itself able to produce, even through its repetition, as Deleuze
               argues in <span style="font-style:italic">Difference and Repetition</span>. Actually, a cleavage is always an attempt to shape and to preserve, as I will explain
               in the next section, an identity, an imaginary “pure” identity, and not a difference.
               To shed some light on my last statement, let’s focus on philosopher and feminist Luce
               Irigaray’s 1977 influential book <span style="font-style:italic">This Sex Which is Not One</span>, where she develops her radical approach to sexuality and male/female “difference.”
               The phallocentric cleavage poses, on the one hand, the only existing sex, the male
               One-sex, its identity and its norms (to be active, to not cry, to master nature, etc.),
               and on the other hand a sex “which is not one,” the female sex that is <span style="font-style:italic">un sexe qui n’en est pas un</span>, to re-establish the French original text and its main meaning: <span style="font-style:italic">this sex that is not a sex</span>, that is to say, this sex that does not really <span style="font-style:italic">exist</span>. In other words, the phallocentric cleavage produces the absolute gap between a (male)
               identity=1 and a (female) non-identity=0. In this respect, the fight against phallocentrism
               consists less in overcoming a Great divide —between two (id)entities —than in uncovering
               the Great annihilation of a difference (the female one) in favor of the only recognized
               identity (the male one).</p>
            <p>We see the same logics of annihilation in the way modernity sets the (non)relation
               between nature and culture/technology/human society: if we want to understand this
               (non)relation, that is to say, this cleavage, we have to begin our investigation not
               with Romanticism and its so-called idealization of nature (I will question this weak
               idea in the fourth section), but with the fact that nature was reduced, since the
               seventeenth century, to nothingness. It is because René Descartes at first said that
               nature is not a “deity” but a mathematizable area that we can use nature –— or the
               Earth –— at will, digitalizing, reprogramingreprogramming, and printing it in 3D:
               "By ‘Nature’ here, Descartes wrote in 1630’s, I do not mean some deity or other sort
               of imaginary power. Rather, I use the word to signify matter itself” (25). Since nature
               is nothing by itself –according to Descartes, but we could add Francis Bacon, and
               Galileo Galilei –it is a mere quantity without qualities and can therefore be turned
               into anything humans want.<a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                     (9)
                     </sup></a> The scientific revolution of the seventeenth century paved the way to the enchanted
               world of commodities – —that we studied with Marx and Engels in the last part of the
               first section -— and its anaturalist basis. In this modern world, only technologies,
               sciences, cultures, and human values are considered as real, active, and capable of
               giving an identity –<span style="font-style:italic">their</span> identity –to the rest of the world. To sum up: Humans = identity = 1; nature = non-identity
               = 0.</p>
            <p>Yet it is not the same thing to say that two things are <span style="font-style:italic">separated</span>, as opposed to saying that two things are <span style="font-style:italic">split</span>. The difference produced by a separation does not prevent a relation—quite the contrary.
               I argue that separation is the condition of possibility for relation. Separation precedes
               communication, an ontological statement that Romanticism exemplifies as I will show
               below. In this respect, I argue that exophobia - —the fear of the outside - —is an
               effect of a misunderstanding of what it means to connect, a misunderstanding that
               I attribute to the second wave of post-structuralism. It was believed that, in order
               to render relations possible, one had to ward off the outside; my argument is that
               in warding off the infinity of outsides, one renders relations impossible – —one merely
               overexposes everything to an oppressive light under which relations become irons.
               Let us develop this point.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">The Field of Existential Differences</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>The lesson of the former section is the following: let us think twice when we plan
               on ending the Great divides, as they may hide Great annihilations: —the first ones
               need to be contested in light of the second ones. Along with contemporary philosopher
               Catherine Malabou, I argue that it is necessary nowadays to “change difference” in
               the name of a radical existentialism able to challenge the Great annihilations and
               the divides underpinning them. Strategically, the goal of the existentialism I propose
               is to insert a sort of retroactive bifurcation between the first and the second post-structuralist
               waves , in order to avoid the mere proliferation of theories – —like OOO – —that,
               under the cover of an ontological equality that erases the Great divides, maintains
               the social, political, and environmental inexistence that these dominant systems produce.
               In doing so, I will avoid the ontological indifferentiation that follows from the
               rejection of differences and separations in the name of the abolition of cleavages.
               </p>
            <p>But the radical existentialism I offer also needs to avoid a second danger (which
               is symmetrical to ontological indifferentiation): a bad reaction against the necessary
               fight against the Great divides, a reaction I call <span style="font-style:italic">the morals of symbolic identities</span>. Let us think about the way some French psychoanalysts and anthropologists have used
               the notion of the sSymbolic oOrder, which they have reshaped through a very restrictive
               reading of Jacques Lacan and Claude Levi-Strauss, in order to justify rigid sexual
               identities, the prohibition of gay marriage, and the refusal of the adoption of children
               by non-heterosexual parents.<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                     (10)
                     </sup></a> These thinkers, who participated in the building of a reactionary discourse that
               is nowadays well established in France, use the concept of a fixed sSymbolic oOrder
               in order to legitimate the worst reactionary splits (between, for example, the good
               symbolic-born parents and the bad natural ones). In order to avoid at once ontological
               indifferentiation and the morals of symbolic identities, I argue in favor of a field
               of existential differences that will be able to describe what links singularities
               without obliterating their separation, their reciprocal extraterritoriality.</p>
            <p>Let us briefly discuss what constitutes the field of existential differences. First,
               a field is not a substance: asubstantial, invisible, “potential,” the field only reveals
               itself after bodies have emerged. Only existing beings can attest to the ontological
               field: before they exist, there is no difference between the field and nothingness,
               and in this sense –— against any sort of ontological turn trying to re-establish,
               in contemporary anthropology and philosophy, the preeminence of a metaphysics <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span> uttering what should be said on cultures, politics, and aesthetics -— there is no
               possible ontology prior to any existentialism, understood as what gives priority to
               the emergence as such of entities. Yet when object-oriented philosopher Graham Harman
               argues, on the basis of his reading of Latour, that there are only “actants” and no
               “potential,” no “virtual,” no “pre-individual” reality, he actually erases the dynamic
               difference between existences and the ontological field that we need to recognize
               retrospectively —– that is, only after the fact of existence.<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                     (11)
                     </sup></a> This erasure could lead to the idea of a “flat” immanent world that –, I argue -,
               denies existence and its depth of field. Flatness or depth: this is the crucial philosophical
               alternative of our time.</p>
            <p>Second, coming into existence is only possible through an internal separation leading
               to polarities (left/right, high/low, inside/outside, but also visible/invisible, light/dark,
               etc.) that are not initially splits, but rather constitute a depth of field that wherein
               a subject experiments with her or his reason or senses. In this regard, a subject
               can be defined as an instance of mediation, as a moment of communication, the last
               term signifying, à la Bataille, the excess through which polarities reveal their unfathomable
               difference.</p>
            <p>At the core of the existentialism that I argue for lies the term “existence.” Etymologically,
               <span style="font-style:italic">ek-sistere</span> means: to be outside, or more precisely to constitute oneself from the outside. The
               outside –— each outside —acts as a fundamental disjuncture, something that we might
               call, with Lucretius, a <span style="font-style:italic">clinamen</span>.<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                     (12)
                     </sup></a> A clinamen is a deviation vis-à-vis straight lines, social norms, ethograms (that
               is to say, the inventory of all behaviors or actions exhibited by an animal), or thermodynamic
               equilibriums. At the beginning - of the universe, as of each thing, - was the clinamen.
               A clinamen is the opening onto an outside -— a break, an empty space, a non-functional
               element, all the existential spacings that can appear, for instance, in the form of
               a non-signifying signifier in a poem, in an act of political resistance, or in André
               Breton’s “amour fou,” etc. The outside is the mark of the singularity of each crucial
               experience, each notable artistic or political event, and, in the end, each existing
               being. Any ordinary life is the singular way through withwhich an existing being experiences
               her own depth of field.</p>
            <p>The outside also explains why philosophy is always disoriented, displaced by the contingency
               of the clinamen. For an existence-disoriented philosophy, there is no Outside; but
               there is an infinity of outsides, as innumerable as there are singular existences.
               Each outside opens itself inside each existing being, and this internal exteriority
               is the condition of possibility for relations. Existing beings can communicate thanks
               to their internal openness. Conversely, if immanence were compact, full, and substantial,
               there would be no gap, no separation between existing beings, and consequently no
               relations. Relations require separation –an idea that Bataille kept repeating: we
               communicate, we really communicate not because we are connected, but first and foremost
               because we are “<span style="font-style:italic">discontinuous</span> beings,” that is, because of the impossibility of an absolute fusion of what would
               be the definitive erasure of differences (12).<a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">
                     (13)
                     </sup></a> In the event of such fusion, there would not be any communication, but a magmatic
               lack of relation and of difference in favor of an identity preventing any possible
               singularization from happening.</p>
            <p>To sum up, the field of existential differences is activated by the presence of existing
               beings that are opened up by their internal outside, which is neither a subtracted
               substance, nor an object hidden behind its expressions, but the contingent effect
               of an event.</p>

            </header>
            <p>In the two final parts of my essay, I want to examine what I said about nature and
               the field of existential differences in relation to Romanticism. For many contemporary
               thinkers who attempt to get rid of the concept of nature and to create an ecology
               without or against nature, Romanticism is the target. Let us take the example of contemporary
               thinker Timothy Morton who argues that, in our “ecological age,” “we are realizing
               that absolutely everything is absolutely connected to absolutely everything else”
               (“Ecology after Capitalism” 47). Timothy Morton argues that nature is an “ideological
               construct”: “What if, finally, Nature as such, the idea of a radical outside to the
               social system, was a capitalist fantasy, even precisely <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> capitalist fantasy?” (57).</p>
            <p>Yet this statement raises two difficulties. First, it is, unfortunately, possible
               to reverse Morton’s statement: what if, finally, the lack of a radical outside to
               the capitalist system was precisely <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> capitalist fantasy, the technological-capitalist program informing the financial
               sphere? Second, I am not at all sure that the main strategy of romanticism was to
               turn nature into a transcendental principle. The fact, quoting Morton, that nature
               “wavers between the divine and the material,” between “essence” and “substance,” has
               to be understood not as a theoretical weakness or a dead end, as Morton thinks but
               as a problem ( <span style="font-style:italic">Ecology without Nature</span> 14, 16); etymologically speaking, what is thrown (<span style="font-style:italic">ballein</span>) before (<span style="font-style:italic">pro</span>) us is what we have to deal with. Maybe the reduction of nature to a pure material
               product or to the supernatural, namely the divine, represents two bad solutions to
               this problem; maybe nature is a milieu encompassing these two extreme existential
               states. In order to highlight my approach, I would like to focus on two figures of
               Romanticism: Victor Hugo, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
            <p>Hugo’s works illustrates my definition of romanticism as a space of fundamental polarities:
               the last lines that the poet wrote were “c’est ici le combat du jour et de la nuit”
               (here is the struggle between day and night) — “here” being a place such as the Earth
               or Hugo himself (<span style="font-style:italic">Essential</span> 464–65). <a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                     (14)
                     </sup></a> All of Hugo’s poetry is the affirmation of an infinite darkness, redeemed in extremis
               by the superior infinity of God: we are “lost in the deep unfathomable night;” but
               “fleetingly,” we can “glimpse, lit up by some flare of light, / The glass pane of
               Eternity” (E 271). In a text titled “Préface philosophique,” Hugo situates humankind
               as a milieu between two forms of darkness: the “impenetrable” Earth and the “immeasurable”
               sky. Yet darkness also constitutes humankind’s interiority and, in this sense, humankind
               is a “microcosmos” (<span style="font-style:italic">Œuvres Complètes</span> 340, 370).<a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">
                     (15)
                     </sup></a> In the dark universe through which rare illuminations persist, everything is continuous,
               “immanent” (a term Hugo keeps repeating); there is no gap between life and death:
               “Everything, even rot, is mixed with vitality . . . Nothing comes to an end; everything
               that ends one thing sketches another one; all the dead give birth” (OC 346). Yet the
               following lines disrupts this feeling of continuity: <span class="quote">‘Nothing amalgamates, everything is balanced . . . the interstice is the law of being;
                  more or less density, that’s the whole difference between the stone and the cloud;
                  granite is a fog; the ax that cuts a head is a vapor; between two atoms, as between
                  two universes, there is space; and the interval is as impassable from the molecule
                  to the molecule in the infinite from below as from the sun to the sun in the infinite
                  from above. Explaining is not more possible than denying (OC 346).’</span> This is Hugo’s ontology: 1) Everything communicates, immanence reigns, in a fundamentally
               dark form. 2) Yet communication is not fusion: a spacing – —recall the terms “space,”
               “intervals,” or “interstices” -prevents entities from melting into an indistinct magma.
               3) In this regard, what is communicated is not a common substance, but a common interval.
               As with everything else, —the Earth, the ocean, or the sky, —nature is subjected to
               a form of polarization through which a non-melting communication occurs, that is to
               say, the communication of darkness, of the immeasurable. In a text entitled “Préface
               de mes œuvres et post-scriptum de ma vie” (Preface of my Works and Post-Scriptum of
               my Life), Hugo argues that nature <span class="quote">‘exists alone and contains everything. Everything is. There is the part of nature
                  that we perceive, and there is the part of nature that we do not perceive. Pan has
                  one visible side and one invisible side. Because on this invisible side, you contemptuously
                  throw the word <span style="font-style:italic">supernaturalism</span>, will this invisible part less exist? X remains X. The Unknown withstands your vocabulary.
                  To deny is not to destroy. Supernaturalism is immanent. (PO 703)’</span> Thus even supernaturalism is natural, immanent, the opposite of transcendent —“Le
               surnaturalisme, c’est la nature trop loin,” that is to say, supernaturalism is nature
               too far away (PO 699). Hugo enables us to understand that there are two bad ways to
               deal with nature: the first one is to detach a transcendent part; the second one is
               to reduce nature to its immediate and visible aspect. To explain the effect of such
               a reduction, Hugo uses a marvelous formula: “Vous n’avez pas voulu voir le visage
               de l’Inconnu; vous verrez son masque” (you refused to see the face of the Unknown;
               you will see its mask)” (PO 704). A too quick reading might make us think that here
               Hugo opposes nature (the face) and the mask as man-made, in the same way that Romantic
               writers are supposed to oppose “here” (where we are) and “elsewhere” (another world).
               However, Hugo actually says something very different: he argues that the mask is still
               an emanation of nature, but in the guise of the denial of its invisible part. A mask
               is not <span style="font-style:italic">absolutely </span> detached from nature, in the sense that a communication between them is still possible.
               That is why Hugo writes, in his poem <span style="font-style:italic">Ce que dit la bouche d’ombre</span> (What the Mouth of Darkness Says): “le dedans du masque est encore la figure” (the
               inside of the mask is still a figure) ( <span style="font-style:italic">Les Contemplations</span> 365). <a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">
                     (16)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Of course, it would be easy to show that Hugo’s writing is haunted by the desire to
               surpass nature. In “Magnitudo Parvi," the poet defines contemplation as a way to detach
               oneself from matter: “contempler les choses, / c’est finir par ne plus les voir. La
               matière tombe détruite” (to contemplate things, / it is eventually to see them no
               longer. Matter falls apart) (LC 183). But the poem does not finish on these words
               and Hugo writes: “La matière tombe détruite / devant l’esprit aux yeux de lynx" (matter
               falls apart / before the spirit with the eyes of a lynx). Spirit, Hugo tells us, needs
               animal abilities to go beyond matter. In the same line, even if Hugo, in <span style="font-style:italic">Ce que dit la bouche d’ombre</span>, associates matter with evil, he adds that a stone is not only a “hideous blind,”
               but also something “pensif,” pensive, on the verge of thinking (LC 364). “Everything
               speaks,” Hugo writes, as if the Universe was structured like a language (LC 362).
               That is why <span class="quote">‘sous ces épaisseurs de matière et de nuit, Arbre, bête, pavé, poids que rien ne soulève,
                  Dans cette profondeur terrible, une âme rêve” (roughly speaking: souls of the trees,
                  beasts and cobblestones dream under depths of matter and night). (LC 371).’</span> Even as immanent, even getting out of a transcendent division, nature seems to be
               theorized by Hugo only on the basis of a dual perspective. Can we imagine a Romanticism
               going beyond this dualism? What might be a romantic pluralistic nature? This question
               is especially important in the contemporary context of anthropologists who, aware
               of the dangerous dead end of anaturalism, claim that, instead of getting rid of nature,
               we should rather consider its multiplicity: I think here exemplarily to Eduardo Viveiros
               de Castro who invented the term “multinaturalism,” which does not mean a multiplicity
               of representations of nature, but rather multiple natures as variation without a unity
               (65–-75). However, Rousseau’s philosophy might be read as an earlier exemplification
               of Viveiros de Castro’s multinaturalism, and I will use Rousseau’s approach toward
               nature to temper Hugo’s excessive ontological polarizations. To understand this approach,
               it is useful – —as a theoretical detour that will help us to identify Rousseau’s originality
               - —to see first how Paul de Man saw Rousseau’s conception of nature. In the first
               chapter of<span style="font-style:italic">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</span>, Paul de Man notices in Hölderlin’s, Wordsworth’s, and Rousseau’s writings, the same
               tendency to pass “from a certain type of nature, earthly and material, to another
               nature which could be mental and celestial” (13). To establish his hypothesis, de
               Man highlights the fact that, in Letter XXIII of the first part of <span style="font-style:italic">La Nouvelle Héloïse</span>, Rousseau says “nature seems to take pleasure in self-opposition”: “radical contradictions
               abound in each of the passages” of this letter, de Man adds (14). <a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">
                     (17)
                     </sup></a> Here again, as in the case of Hugo’s poetry, an excessive polarization prevails,
               – and we seem far away from any sort of multinaturalism.</p>
            <p>Indeed, Rousseau uses the word “contradiction,” but just after he mentions this word
               he speaks about difference. He says that nature is “différente en un même lieu sous
               divers aspects” (nature is different in the same place under various aspects) (NH
               44). For Rousseau, contradiction is just one possibility amongst others and not the
               only determination of nature. Just before this paragraph, Rousseau actually describes
               a multiplicity of natures: mild nature, cultivated nature, and “un mélange étonnant
               de la nature sauvage et de la nature cultivée” (a surprising melding of wild nature
               and cultivated nature)” (NH 44) —the sort of inextricable naturecultures ( to use
               the concepts of Latour and Haraway) that postmodern thinkers like to describe. But
               de Man does not quote this paragraph; he also does not mention the fact that this
               strange multiplicity of natures interrupts the Rousseau’s meditation: “Je voulais
               rêver, et j’en étais toujours détourné par quelque spectacle inattendu” (I wanted
               to dream, but I was always diverted by an unexpected spectacle) (NH 44). A spectacle
               or a “vrai théâtre” (a real drama), as Rousseau says at the end of his description,
               occurs when natures appear in their multiplicity becoming a sort of weird, natural,
               man-made scene. </p>
            <p>Polarizations, contradictions, differences, a multiplicity, and an interrupting force:
               are these aspects of nature too different, too irremediably disparate? Should we then
               get rid of the category of nature?</p>

            </header>
            <p>Getting rid of nature? My aim is quite different. I suggest the following hypothesis:
               nature is a milieu of communication subjected to its own power of interruption or
               darkness —the “impenetrable” and the “immeasurable” (Hugo, OC 340, 370) —since it
               is what relates and separates. To produce the ontological image of nature as a disruptive
               milieu, let’s try to superimpose Hugo’s perspective on Rousseau’s perspective,; let’s
               draw a diagram of natures, composed of 1) naturecultures, 2) the wild, and 3) technological
               beings.</p>
            <p>In the middle of this image stands an intertwining of nature, culture, and technology,
               exactly what Donna Haraway calls “naturecultures” (12). Subjected to what Ulrich Beck
               called its total “societalization,” the nature at stake here is a nature that “can
               no longer be understood <span style="font-style:italic">outside</span> of society, or society <span style="font-style:italic">outside</span> of nature” (80). Ventriloquizing Marx and Engels’s <span style="font-style:italic">The German Ideology</span>, Beck adds that “not a hair or a crumb of [nature] is still ‘natural’, if ‘natural’
               means nature being left to itself” (81). As we see, Beck’s risk society looks like
               what we today call Anthropocenic society; yet what Beck and the constructivist trend
               are sometimes unable to see, or to highlight, is that the entanglement of nature and
               culture only defines one aspect, one becoming of nature amongst others.</p>
            <p>On the left side of the picture, we can see nature without human intervention. Let
               us think, for example, about the burning core of the Earth, all the earthquakes that
               are not caused by hydraulic fracturing, or what speculative realist philosopher Quentin
               Meillassoux calls, in <span style="font-style:italic">After Finitude</span>, the “ancestral” realm: the “Great Outdoors” of the universe that precedes even our
               appearance on Earth, and in this sense has no relation of any kind to us (11-15).
               However, the problem with Meillassoux’s ancestrality is, to paraphrase Hugo, the following:
               ancestrality is an outside that is too far away. Wild, “inhuman” (Clark 2010), escaping
               our attempt to master it, nature’s otherness is also on Earth, in Earth, in every
               one of its components. Let us call this dimension of nature “the wild”; not wilderness,
               or what results from the displacement of Native Americans, but the wild as what has
               been really untouched by human beings (even though such an idea upsets any colonial
               drive).</p>
            <p>On the right side of the picture, we can identify all the machines, all the technology
               that, from synthetic biology to geo-engineering, strives to master, to replace, and,
               in the end, to erase nature. But why do I include technology in a diagram of natures?
               Is it not important to identify technological beings as existentially specific, as
               forms of being that cannot, or should not, be reduced to non-artificial entities?
               Certainly yes, but let us remember what I said in the third section about the field
               of existential differences: any ontological knowledge must only be retroactively constituted,
               after the reality of existing beings has being been recognized. In the same manner,
               it is only retroactively that we can argue that nature is ontologically everywhere,
               even in a computer or a smartphone. This is possible only retroactively because we
               first need to acknowledge existential differences. When this acknowledgment is assured,
               we can speak about a natural field and its ontological continuity (as Spinoza and,
               these days, the New Materialists do). We can then, but only then say with Lawrence
               Buell: <span class="quote">‘Even if people were to become as “posthuman” as the bionic characters of cyberpunk
                  fiction, they would likely remain physically embodied and permeable to the influences
                  of water cycle, photosynthesis, macroclimate, seismology, bacterial resistance to
                  pharmaceuticals, and the “natural” advantages and disadvantages of regional habitats.
                  (6)’</span> The problem is that sometimes we are not able to recognize nature in commodities,
               high-tech objects, or cyborgs – nature’s mask seems to have swallowed both flesh and
               face. However, it is not because we are not unable to see something that it does not
               exist. That is why we have to give some depth to the field of differences, which is
               anything but flat. So, if in our diagram we can see, horizontally, three specific
               areas – naturecultures in the middle, machines on the right, and wild nature on the
               left – we also need to acknowledge a vertical dimension severing naturecultures, wild
               nature, and technological beings from a dark, invisible, unknown nature: what I call
               <span style="font-style:italic">deep nature</span> is the encounter between the vertical and horizontal dimensions, – which reveals
               a depth of field.</p>
            <p>In the diagram of natures, the function of depth is to host the invisible, the unknown,
               the frightening darkness that Jean Paul has identified as the “empty, bottomless socket”
               of God (337), a metaphor that strongly influenced the French romantic tradition. In
               “Magnitudo Parvi,” Hugo exclaims: “L’oeil est crevé!” (the eye (of God) is punctured!)”
               – a gruesome deed that he attributes to Spinoza and Lucretius, those atheists who
               refuse to see God also in the “abyss,” in what — for Hugo —falsely appears as devoid
               of the divine (169). A few years after Hugo’s poem, Nerval writes in “Christ at Gethsemane”:
               </p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Seeking the eye of God, I’ve only seen a pit, </div>
               <div class="l">Huge, bottomless, black, from whence eternal night</div>
               <div class="l">Streams out over the world and ever deepens. (229)</div>
            </div>
            <p> All this distress should not conceal what Hugo completely understood: bottomless
               darkness is also the condition of possibility for freedom, that is to say, for an
               ontological chance. F. W. J. Schelling – who was maybe the decisive German Romantic
               philosopher explains this point in his <span style="font-style:italic">Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom</span>. In God, Schelling writes, there is an “inner ground” that is not God but “precedes”
               his existence. Schelling also calls this ground “nature” (27-28). If creatures can
               exist as such, different from God, it is thanks to the inner ground that, in God,
               is not God. In other words, the inner ground is what ontologically differentiates
               God from himself. Freedom thus comes from this interval, this separation between God
               and what Schelling also calls “the original ground” or the “non-ground,” in the sense
               that the inner ground does not exist, since it is what precedes any existence. In
               my terms, this inner ground is a pure field. The non-ground can be interpreted as
               a principle of ontological an-archy, an absolute freedom that, for Hugo, Satan, represents.
               In “The Plume of Satan,” God calls “freedom” the feather of Satan’s wings that did
               not fall (<span style="font-style:italic">Selected Poems</span> 104).<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">
                     (18)
                     </sup></a> This leather is “au bord du gouffre ténébreux” (on the edge of the dark abyss) (SP
               102), “près du puits de la chute infinite” (near the well of the infinite fall)” (SP
               104), that is to say, in between, in the interval.</p>
            <p>To sum up, natures constitute a plurality, a field in which we can pass from technology
               to naturecultures and from naturecultures to the wild and from the wild to technology.
               Every time an entity as such appears, be it a machine or a tree, a distinction retroactively
               appears in the field, a difference that any existing being traces. The condition of
               possibility of any existence is the darkness, the non-ground thanks to which the universe
               is not compact, deadly, or immanent. Bottomless, deep nature keeps composing an existential
               myriad that no ontology could have calculated <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span>.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">A Political Ccommunication of the Outside</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>If the universe coming from deep nature is a deep field of existential differences,
               then we can think anew the relation between nature and the outside; we can escape
               the enclosed world of the Anthropocene and its real subsumption of nature; we can
               cure exophobia. Instead of fearing nature or trying to erase it, we can leave it a
               place —or several places. This is the condition of possibility of an anti-Anthropocenic
               politics. Of course, this expression seems ridiculous, since the Anthropocene is supposed
               to last for millennia: is it not too late to be anti-Anthropocenic? Is it even still
               possible to speak in terms of political ecology? My answer is that we have no choice:
               yes, an anti-Anthropocenic ecopolitics is impossible, but it is exactly the impossible
               that we need to make happen, as soon as possible, if we want to avoid being swept
               away by global ecocide and its geo-technological ally. So, let us attempt to ascertain
               how the diagram of natures I sketched out can offer some philosophical help to imagine
               an anti-Anthropocenic ecopolitics.</p>
            <p>First, the diagram of natures that I propose enables the possibility of thinking of
               nature as a form of otherness –not a mother, or a father, not Gaia or Ouranos, but
               a foreign agent. Indeed, one of the fundamental dangers of the Anthropocene is to
               irremediably close humanity in upon itself. In the end, the anthropogenic eating of
               nature cannot but become anthropophagy. <span style="font-style:italic">Soylent Green</span>–Richard Fleischer’s famous 1973 environmental film -does not show the apocalypse
               that follows the collapse of the global civilization. Rather, it reveals that this
               collapse leans on the previous short-circuit of humankind that eats itself. Anthropophagy
               is not a post-apocalyptic practice. Rather, it defines the supreme condition of a
               civilization that ate –—destroyed –—the whole non-human world. If <span style="font-style:italic">Soylent Green’s</span> opening montage puts together standardization and the Industrial Revolution, it is
               less to insist on the problem of overpopulation than on the disappearance of non-human
               forms of life that I call cosmophagy. <a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">
                     (19)
                     </sup></a> In other words, anthropophagy is the last step of cosmophagy. At this point, when
               the Anthropos has swallowed the Earth, when nature is performatively said to no longer
               exist, when human beings and every form of life merge with one another, the face –
               to use Hugo’s words – is nothing but the mask.</p>
            <p>In this regard, to speak about the Unknown, à la Hugo, might be a way to leave some
               play between the mask and the face, in order to leave a place to other forms of existence.
               I will not resist the temptation to say that the more we refuse the face of the unknown,
               the more we risk several more Fukushimas. Here the unknown is not the “asylum of ignorance,”
               to quote Spinoza, but on the contrary an aware knowledge of the unpredictable. It
               does not dismiss engineers, companies, and political leaders from their responsibilities
               vis-à-vis ecological disasters like Katrina or Fukushima, rather it engages another
               relation with what is not us. Concerning the last point, I am not sure that the word
               <span style="font-style:italic">non-human</span> is good enough to deal with the unknown, because <span style="font-style:italic">nonhuman</span> is an adjective that leaves unscathed the notion of human centrality, through its
               negation. If we do not really and deeply take into account the Unknown, then the following
               alternative end to <span style="font-style:italic">The Novices of Saïs</span>, written by Novalis in 1798, might be our predictable fate: “One person succeeded
               — he lifted the veil of the goddess at Saïs — But what did he see? He saw - nightmare
               of nightmares — himself” (76).</p>
            <p>To be honest, I have made a small change in this quotation: instead of “nightmare
               of nightmares,” Novalis wrote: “wonder of wonders.” This friendly update leads to
               the political dimension of the deep field of existential differences. Such a field
               does not prevent the possibility of contradictions, understood as the extreme state
               of differences. When Rousseau, in <span style="font-style:italic">La Nouvelle Héloïse</span>’s Letter XXIII, uses the quasi-magic, supernatural nature that he feels in the high
               mountains as a means to contest a modern society consumed with greed, business, and
               earnings, and as a way to envisage what an egalitarian society should look like, this
               contradiction does not turn nature into a transcendental principle that we should
               save from reality, but rather uses nature as a necessary exterior able to engage a
               radical critique of society and call for a change in reality. “Once the social compact
               is violated,” that is to say, when a “master” deprives the people of its sovereignty,
               Rousseau explains in <span style="font-style:italic">On the Social Contract</span>, “each person then regains his first rights and resumes his natural liberty, while
               losing the conventional liberty for which he renounced it” (<span style="font-style:italic">Basic Political Writings</span> 140). In other words, “The very moment there is a master, there no longer is a sovereign,
               and thenceforward the body politic is destroyed” (<span style="font-style:italic">Basic Political Writings </span> 154). Nature is therefore, for Rousseau’s politics, the outside that can be generated
               and regenerated when the social order becomes its own negation, that is, when the
               “social contract” —which is the event thanks to which a people is constituted as a
               people —is broken. Nature is the Trojan horse able to blow a revolutionary wind into
               the core of the polis.</p>
            <p>This romantic revolutionary wind communicates the outside.<a class="note_back" href="#Note20" id="Note20_return"><sup class="super">
                     (20)
                     </sup></a> As I explained in this essay, the outside is not an object far away from us; it constitutes
               us. To <span style="font-style:italic">ek-sist</span>, as I said, means, literally, to stand out, to be outside, or, better, to <span style="font-style:italic">be</span> the outside. Thanks to Romantic poetry, the “immeasurable” of the sky and the “impenetrable”
               of the Earth is expressed as what is the most intimate share of the human, its inhuman
               core. With words, but also music, and paintings, the outside can be communicated as
               a reminder of the interval from which everything came into being –— each thing, and
               the universe itself, that rose up less from a Big Bang than from a Big Spacing. Not
               only is communicating the outside communicating the darkness or the unground — thanks
               to which singularities can appear —but this communication can also stay hidden, and
               preserved. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in 2019, I heard Anna Tsing explain
               how, in Indonesia, she saw some animals unable to hide any longer, forced to be visible,
               because of the deforestation caused by the settlement of plantations. These animals
               have lost the existential and vital experience to be hidden in forests.</p>
            <p>I was struck by Tsing’s powerful illustration of the global situation of overexposure
               – a situation touching all species, including the human. What must nowadays be preserved
               is as much biodiversity as psychodiversity. In a time of digital overexposure, when
               data mining reigns, when the empty eye of God is filled with FAANG’s marketing intrusions,
               it is crucial to be able to preserve the opacity of that which exists. Needless to
               say, Facebook should be deserted. That is the paradox of our time: to communicate
               the outside, we need to disconnect from the inside, to create what Deleuze called
               “vacuoles of non-communication” (175). We need to encrypt what we say, in the same
               way that “phusis kruptestai philein” (nature loves to hide) (Heraclitus).</p>

               It existed in the feeling that ‘God Himself is dead.’” (G.  W.  F. Hegel, <span style="font-style:italic">Faith and Knowledge</span>, Albany, SUNY Press, 1977, 190). I read the persistent nightmare of God’s death as
               the “return of the repressed”: Christianity is founded on the death of God as son,
               despite his resurrection and his supposed return at the end of times.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               that would exceed individual actors. Nor is there any ‘virtuality’ that exceeds them,
               just as potentiality does not exceed them. The much-discussed difference between potential
               and virtual, so often wielded like a billy club in our time by Deleuzian hooligans,
               is irrelevant here—both terms fail Latour’s standard for concreteness in exactly the
               same way” (<span style="font-style:italic">Prince of Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics</span>, 101). Elsewhere, he notes, “In short, I reject both the potential <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the virtual in favor solely of the actual” (Graham Harman, “on disappointing realisms,”).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
