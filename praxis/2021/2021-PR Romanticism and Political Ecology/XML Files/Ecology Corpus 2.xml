               <p> Romanticism’s relationship with ecology has been a lively topic of concern. In
                arguing that English Romantic poets discovered a new “holistic” paradigm that
                prefigured contemporary ecological thought and eco-criticism, John McKusick’s
                seminal <hi rend="italic">Green Writing </hi>(2000) set the
                stage for a renewed concern with the way Romantic-era authors form part of a
                genealogy of our own contemporary ecological concerns in the era of anthropocentric
                climate change. In <hi rend="italic">Ecology without Nature</hi>, Timothy Morton
                clarified that while the “holism” specific to the Romantic period concerns not
                just a feeling of enmeshment with “nature” or with the “non-human,” it also contains
                a burgeoning feeling of interconnection that dovetails with nationalism, a sense of
                belonging to “a whole greater than the sum of its parts that potentially underpins a conservative or reactionary
                politics (101). At the root of these concerns is the bugbear of organicism and
                “organic community”—a form of holism that implies an identity between members as
                well as their subsumption by a totality that remains irreducible to the differences
                contained within it. In contradistinction to this kind of organicism, Morton
                proposes a thinking of “collectivism,” which he argues rules out organic community
                by making the collective enmeshment of human and non-human un-subsumable by any
                discrete totality. As he puts it in <hi rend="italic">The Ecological Thought</hi>,
                with a nod to Saussure:
                
            <quote>The ecological thought permits no distance. Thinking interdependence involves
                dissolving the barrier between “over here” and “over there,” and more fundamentally,
                the metaphysical illusion of rigid, narrow boundaries between inside and outside.
                Thinking interdependence involves thinking difference. This means confronting the
                fact that all beings are related to each other negatively and differentially, in an
                open system without center or edge. (39)</quote>
                
            From holism to ecological collectivism, from nationalism to Morton’s “mesh,”
                Romanticism becomes a necessary touchstone not just for a genealogical account of
                our own sense of ecology, but also for how it necessarily presages a
                <hi rend="italic">political </hi>ecology—a conceptualization of
                the relations between the <hi rend="italic">polis </hi>and what
                it excludes or includes, what forms of collectivity it allows or disallows.</p>
               <p> However, the idea that Romanticism lays the groundwork for our own ecological
                preoccupations begs the question of exactly what <hi rend="italic">kinds</hi> of
                political ecologies it articulated. Nearly two decades ago, Nicholas Roe’s
                <hi rend="italic">Politics of Nature </hi>argued that Romantic
                authors concatenated their politics with a conception of the natural world that was
                bound up with notions of human nature and natural right, aimed largely at democratic
                or republican political commitments. In this way, Roe challenged earlier new
                historicist claims that Romanticism entailed a retreat from history to the
                supposedly ahistorical domain of nature or the imagination.<note place="foot" resp="author"> These
                            arguments find their clearest expression in Jerome McGann, <hi rend="italic">The Romantic Ideology</hi>.</note>
                As he puts it, “nature could never suffice as a Romantic escape from history because . . .
                nature as an idea and as a physical actuality was fundamental to contemporary interpretations of 
                history and to the political theory of an age of revolutions" (11). When Wordsworth suggests in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Prelude</hi> that the French
                Revolution seemed “nothing out of nature’s certain course,” this sense of nature can
                hardly be seen as indifferent to the political domain, since it figures as the very
                concept generative of a reading of historical change.</p>
               <p> Yet all of these Romantic tropes and themes remain firmly embedded within a
                particular reading of the liberal tradition, which maintains or even privileges the
                distinction between <hi rend="italic">human </hi>nature and a
                nature “out there” that it parallels, echoes, or separates itself from. And the
                notion that the political dimension of Romantic conceptions of nature is tied
                primarily to human-centered “natural rights” fundamentally limits the scope of the
                ways in which Romantic political ecology might be seen to contest not only
                purportedly natural formations such as the nation-state, but also the basic
                categories of liberal political philosophy, including its investment in universal
                figures of “the human” as the primary bearer of rights. This investment hardly
                constitutes a convincing bulwark against the ways in which the category of “the
                human” is both at the center of the period’s declarations of rights and sovereignty
                for a range of hitherto bereft members of the polity, <hi rend="italic">and
                    simultaneously</hi> at the center of a long history of violent de-humanizations
                and re-naturalizations of all kinds. As I will discuss below, among the issues that
                this volume explores is the question of whether the Romantic preoccupation with
                nature, and thus with questions surrounding what we now call political ecology more
                generally, can be reduced to these concerns.</p>
               <p> Recent theoretical work by thinkers of contemporary political ecology—Latour and
                Descola in particular — repeat a central tenet of contemporary eco-criticism: the
                need to relinquish any concept of a “nature” external to the political. Latour’s <hi rend="italic">Politics of Nature</hi>, for instance, argues that any political
                ecology worthy of its name must abandon the tradition’s great divide between the
                political domain on the one hand (where political “rights” are accrued and citizens
                are formed), and an ahistorical “nature” on the other (whose denizens remain outside
                the political domain, without “rights” or political standing). This divide not only
                separates politics into two houses, but also accounts for a variety of exclusions of
                non-human <hi rend="italic">as well as human </hi>non-citizens,
                relegating them all to the domain of nature. As Latour argues, modern political
                ecology must liquidate this opposition if it is to address adequately the current
                ecological crisis of the Anthropocene, wherein humans have now become the equivalent
                of a natural force, altering the Earth’s geological record and climate systems to
                such an extent that it is no longer possible to rigorously distinguish human-made
                from natural processes.</p>
               <p> Like many of its critical predecessors, this volume asks
                what kinds of political ecologies Romanticism devised and deployed in response to
                its own historical moment. However, <hi rend="italic">Romanticism and Political
                    Ecology</hi> does so without assuming either that Romantic political ecology
                can be reduced to the “holism” of organic community and its bedfellow nationalism,
                or that it prefigures Latour’s liquidation of the concept of the externality of
                nature in favor of a collectivity that includes both humans and non-humans. As the
                essays in this volume attest, the Romantic period abounded with multiple challenges
                to the seemingly simple division between nature and culture, human and non-human, as
                well as to the ways in which that division helped to inform a specific set of
                political motifs or concepts. Simply put, there is more Romantic experimentation
                with various kinds of political ecology than is dreamt of by liberal political
                philosophy. This includes, among other things, a crucial recognition that in lieu of
                a simple opposition between nature and culture, a complex
                interdependency exists that does not necessarily entail a complete immanence of one
                to the other. In other words, as Alan Bewell has argued in <hi rend="italic">Natures
                    in Translation</hi>, there was never a Romantic conception of nature in the
                singular, but rather multiple conceptions of nature and of the natural, each of
                which in turn entailed a different understanding of its connection to politics and
                the political. Bewell’s claim about John Clare is a case in point: even in the
                context of a poetry embedded in the language of rights that can be extended to
                non-human entities,<note place="foot" resp="author"> One of the clearest examples of this can be found
                            in John Clare’s poem, “The Lament of Swordy Well,” where the stone
                            quarry of the title is the lyric voice of the poem and laments, among
                            other things, that the system of profit or “gain” that has produced its
                            exploitation and destruction has usurped its “freedom”: 
                            <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>“Gain takes my freedom all away/ </l>

                we discover a poet marking the passage from the death of one conception of nature and
                world—the commons and the parish or locale which depended upon it— to the birth of
                another: privatized industrial agriculture and the system that depends on it. This
                suggests not just the mutual imbrication of nature with culture, but an acute
                recognition of the <hi rend="italic">historical specificity</hi> of any concept of
                nature. There is no nature “as such”—only a set of exteriorities specific to a given
                world or ecosphere constituted by its relationship to that exteriority. </p>
               <p> This is not to say, however, that nature, for the Romantics, is purely conceptual, an
                invention, or social creation. Rather, it functions as a domain of exteriority to
                the social-political as it is presently constituted. This volume offers what might
                be called an “alternative” understanding of Romantic political ecology, searching as
                it does for those elements within Romantic-era authors that re-situate dominant
                liberal conceptions of the relation between nature and politics. For this reason,
                the essays included here cover a wide range of canonical and non-canonical
                Romanticism: from its pre-figurations in Rousseau to the way the recently recovered
                work of Karoline von Günderrode sought to recast German <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi> in ways that challenged any human-centered notion of
                consciousness; from Hölderlin, whose conception of the Earth is interpreted as a
                figure for a transition from one conception of world and nature to another, to Mary
                Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, which challenges the racial
                hierarchies ensconced in the allegedly universal concept of “Man” by opening up
                forms of commonality predicated on a different mode of relationality; and finally to
                Erasmus Darwin’s pastoral ecologies, which directly challenge traditional natural
                law philosophy’s elision of the “non-human” resources (including human slaves) upon
                which their concept of human freedom depended. Each essay, in its turn, draws out an
                underground, unorthodox Romantic political ecology. As a result, our volume provides
                a novel genealogy for Romanticism’s pioneering role in contemporary politico-
                ecological concerns.</p>
               <p> The collection opens with Frédéric Neyrat’s “Communicating the Outside: Nature, the
                Outside, and Romanticism,” which engages in a critique of the “second wave” of
                post-structuralism, focusing on the way it argues for the liquidation of the concept
                of nature as a simple exteriority to the political. Analyzing the work of Bruno
                Latour and others, Neyrat reads the attempt to eliminate the distinction between the
                polis and its other—nature—as a symptom of the current ecological crisis. Rather
                than provide the conceptual matrix for addressing the new forms of collective action
                and solidarity that would be necessary to confront this crisis, Neyrat demonstrates
                how this approach ends up reasserting a form of community between entities—one that
                obliterates any sense of alterity that various forms of “nature” might be said to
                possess. This paves the way, Neyrat argues, for a neo-holism where all
                entities are reduced to a single shared plane of immanence, leading to a series of
                fantasies, including geo-engineering, which finally only exacerbates
                the crisis. In lieu of this approach, Neyrat argues for a “radical existentialism”
                that privileges a field of differences that cannot be reduced to one another. It is
                on this score that the Romanticisms of Victor Hugo and Jean-Jacques Rousseau
                become an important touchstone. Rather than understanding the Romantic period
                as reducing nature to a transcendent exteriority or to its immediate phenomenal
                characteristics, Neyrat understands Romanticism as a “producer of outsides.”
                “Nature” is not a single transcendent field, but something more akin to what Eduardo 
                Viveiros de Castro calls a “multi-naturalism”—the idea that there
                is not one nature in the singular, but a multiplicity of “natures” that includes
                among their various iterations a notion of something fundamentally untouched by
                humans (e.g., the Earth’s burning core). This diversely exterior “elsewhere” that
                constitutes Romantic “nature,” according to Neyrat, opens up a separation, a
                spacing, rather than an absolute divide. It thereby produces a relation between
                singularities, without abolishing their differences, and introduces a form of
                community that leaves the alterity of incompossible worlds intact.</p>
               <p> Anna Ezekiel’s essay “Earth, Spirit, Humanity: Community and the Nonhuman in
                Karoline von Günderrode’s ‘Idea of the Earth’” examines author and poet Karoline von
                Günderrode’s prose writings as a response to eighteenth- and
                nineteenth-century <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi>, particularly the version
                put forth by her contemporary, Friedrich Schelling. A neglected figure of German
                Romanticism whose work has only recently been translated into English (by Ezekiel
                    herself),<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Karoline von Günderrode,

                  </note>
                Günderrode is primarily known as a poet. Ezekiel
                takes up her brief text <hi rend="italic">The Idea of the Earth</hi>, and reads it
                in conjunction with her other writings, examining how Günderrode’s re-writing of
                idealist <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi> concepts works along different
                lines and with surprising results. Focusing on the concept of the Earth as that
                which both harbors “nature” in general but also surpasses it by including both
                human and non-human elements within it, Ezekiel’s essay shows how Günderrode’s
                cosmology implies no special status for the human. Rather, the human is embedded in,
                and of a piece with, the non-human. The results of this cosmology are far-reaching,
                questioning the unique sovereignty of humanity in relation to the natural world and,
                as a result, its domination over other non-human (and human) beings. If “spirit” or
                “mind” cannot rigorously be distinguished from its other, or from that which is not
                aware of itself as the unfolding of spirit, then “spirit” or “mind,” not to mention
                consciousness, are no longer the exclusive domain of human beings. Whereas idealist
                philosophies tend to understand self-consciousness as the emergence of spirit out of
                its exteriorization in the natural world, Günderrode’s cosmology, according to
                Ezekiel, implies that non-human entities can partake of “consciousness” (and even
                self-consciousness) alongside their human counterparts. The result, as the essay
                demonstrates, is a conception of community predicated on the notion of a form of
                harmony with the natural world— a kind of harmony wherein human and non-human
                entities enter into surprising connections with each other, producing a new form of
                sociality that Günderrode calls the “realized idea of the earth.”</p>
               <p> Whereas Günderrode’s cosmology effectively equates the Earth with “the world,” my
                own contribution, “Hölderlin’s Earth,” demonstrates the extent to which one of her
                German Romantic contemporaries — Friedrich Hölderlin — articulated a different notion
                of “the Earth” in terms not dissimilar to what Neyrat in his essay calls an
                “infinity of outsides.” Focusing on the interlocking thematics of the “alternation
                of poetic tones” that Hölderlin’s prose texts argue are basic structures of all
                poetry, I analyze how Hölderlin’s focus on the crucial interplay between the organic
                (a relatively consistent moment of stasis and harmony found within both nature and
                man’s creations) and the aorgic (the gradual dissolution of that temporary
                stability), separates Earth from world, culminating in what Hölderlin calls their
                “real separation.” The Earth thus comes to designate, in Hölderlin’s poetics, a
                moment between the dissolution of one world and its relation to nature, and the
                unfolding of another. In short, Hölderlin’s conception of the Earth constitutes a
                radical exteriority to any notion of the “world”
                <hi rend="italic">and </hi>to any cosmology or idea of “nature”
                upon which that world depends. It also, therefore, entails something other than an
                    <hi rend="italic">oikos</hi>, a “home” or “habitat” suggested in the etymology
                of the term “ecology,” which would be capable of reconstituting a shared sense of
                belonging or rootedness. Turning to one of Hölderlin’s shorter river poems, “The
                Main,” I analyze the way that he actually reverses the assumed relation between
                poetry and the Earth found in one of
                Heidegger’s favorite references to Hölderlin — “poetically Man dwells on this
                    Earth” (217). In fact, Hölderlin’s river poetry does not open up the possibility of a new “dwelling” on the Earth; instead, it
                witnesses poetry’s exposure to something so fundamentally exterior to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> world — the Earth as a <hi rend="italic">terra
                    incognita</hi> — that it inescapably destabilizes all senses of “dwelling,” along
                with any conception of native land or soil.</p>
               <p> Joseph Albernaz’s essay “Without Task: Abdication, Race, and Relation in Mary
                Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>” shifts the collection’s focus to
                British Romanticism with an examination of the way Shelley’s novel questions the
                supposedly universal category of “Man” by charting an “end of Man”<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    I draw the phrase from Derrida’s essay, “The Ends of Man.” See Jacques Derrida,
                            <hi rend="italic">Margins of Philosophy,</hi> 109–-136.</note> that is post-universal. 
                Grounding his analysis in long-standing critiques of “Man” as a universal category, as well as more recent
                critical race theory that understands this category as constituted by its racial and
                gendered gradations and exclusions, Albernaz reads Shelley’s novel as an
                investigation into the possibility of a form of community that would not be
                predicated exclusively on a “shared humanity.” Since the plague in the novel that
                ravages the globe undoes all the usual logics of human sovereignty or mastery, human
                progress and human futurity, Albernaz sees the novel as an exploration of the “end”
                of Man in another sense: the end of a universal category capable of generating
                solidarity with that which it excludes. What happens, Shelley’s novel seems to ask,
                in the absence of any goal or <hi rend="italic">telos</hi> concerning humanity or
                its future? Albernaz’s response to this question shows that <hi rend="italic">The
                    Last Man</hi> opens a space for what he calls a form of “relational life” that
                no longer has any <hi rend="italic">telos</hi> or task and that eschews any
                sovereignty predicated on shared belonging to a category that is both
                racially exclusive and falsely universal. Focusing his analysis on a key scene in
                the novel where the main character, Lionel Verney, is potentially exposed to the
                deadly virus when he comes to the aid of one of its victims — a black man dying from
                its effects — Albernaz contends that this scene, rather than appealing to some
                humanity they both share, presents a renunciation of the privileges of the universal
                category “Man” that the main character does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> share with
                the other. In Albernaz’s account, this scene presents most sharply what is at work
                in oblique ways throughout the novel: an entanglement with an other who, in this
                case, is “a (non)-person marked by slavery” and therefore by radical
                de-humanization. For Albernaz, this possibility points forward to a landscape
                without man that instead contains a solidarity with others whose otherness is no
                longer filtered through the category of the human and all its particular others,
                human or otherwise.</p>
               <p> Amanda Goldstein’s contribution, “Utopian Pastoral and the Inhuman Trade” extends
                Albernaz’s exploration of the way Romantic political ecology sets about questioning
                the centrality of human rights - bearing subjects and the universality of Man through
                the category of racial difference. She does so by focusing her attention on the
                genre of Golden Age pastoral in relation to Erasmus Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">The
                    Economy of Vegetation</hi> and by setting up her interpretation of Darwin as a
                riposte to various contemporary new materialisms and post-humanisms that tend to
                reduce the question of the human to a generality—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> human<hi rend="italic">—</hi>and its various non-human others. As Goldstein argues,
                Erasmus Darwin’s work centers around an ecology that recognizes how specific classes
                or groups of humans exploit <hi rend="italic">other humans</hi> and non-humans
                together — an exploitation that collectively becomes the basis of their mode of life.
                Darwin thus provides a needed corrective to, or politicization of, traditional
                political ecology by bringing the problem of slavery and colonialism into its
                account of the natural world and by figuring “nature” and its various non-humans
                (including dehumanized slaves) as active agents of rebellion against their own
                exploitation and enslavement. Whereas earlier versions of pastoral “ecological
                jubilee” depicted nature as taking sides with the laboring class, Goldstein’s argues
                that Darwin’s parables take the idea of “ecological retribution” further by
                depicting the supposedly extra-political domain of the Earth as released from its
                indifference, taking up arms against unfettered resource extraction and chattel
                slavery. These depictions, Goldstein argues, project emancipation and abolitionism
                not as the domain of enlightened (human, white) benefactors but as the direct and
                violent retribution of the enslaved. In short, Darwin projects a non-human agency
                found in the human, vegetal, and lithic “resources” upon which the rights-bearing
                colonial subject depends. The result, according to Goldstein, is a political ecology
                through and through, where the elemental forces of the Earth themselves become
                agents of justice rather than of indifferent necessity, and where both civil and
                natural law are seen as thoroughly malleable. </p>
               <p> The essays collected here examine the various modalities of Romantic political
                ecology as a “multi-naturalism,” treating the mutual imbrication of concepts of
                nature and the particular vision of the political that flows from it without
                reducing one to the other. As such, they demonstrate the breadth and possibility of
                Romantic political ecology that remains to be examined, along with the fecundity of
                the questions it continues to raise: How does one understand the relation between
                the human and the non-human? How does this very question elide the problem of race
                or colonialism? Is nature a transcendent backdrop for the sovereign rights-bearing
                subject or precisely that which potentially undermines it? How does a thinking of
                the Earth demonstrate the mutual imbrication of the human world with nature? In the
                midst of the current focus on the ecological fate of the planet, this collection
                hopes to offer some historical counter-examples of modes of thought that exceeded
                the dominant mode of politics (and ecology avant la lettre) of its time.</p>

               <p>There is no outside—this is the main watchword of our time; the second one is that
                there is no nature. <note place="foot" resp="author">Cyclonopedia : Complicity with
                                Anonymous Materials.</note> My hypothesis is that
                there is a secret complicity between the foreclosure (<hi rend="italic">Verwerfung</hi>) of the outside, which causes a psycho-political illness that I
                call <hi rend="italic">exophobia</hi> (the fear of the outside), and the rejection
                of nature, the <hi rend="italic">anaturalism</hi> constituting the technophilic
                basis of the Anthropocene and its geo-engineering fantasies. Romanticism could be
                used as a cure for both exophobia and anaturalism.</p>
               <p> Leaning on a genealogy that extends from Heraclitus and the Greek atomists to
                Friedrich Nietzsche, I first want to offer a metaphysical explanation of the
                healthful rejection, by the philosophies of immanence, of the idea of a transcendent
                outside. Devoted to this ontological rejection, the first section of my essay will
                especially focus on the way Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels tied the rejection of the
                outside to the disappearance of nature, a rejection and a disappearance that could
                not be understood without considering the rise of capitalism and its social,
                industrial anthropization of nature. In the second section, I will shed some light
                on a crucial difference between thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave
                (amongst others: Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard, and Luce
                Irigaray) and those who belong to the second post-structuralist one (Bruno Latour
                and Antonio Negri) — a difference that is, to me, not underlined enough in
                contemporary debates striving to evaluate post-structuralism in order to go beyond
                it and to develop a new kind of theory, be it under the name of new materialism,
                object-oriented philosophy, speculative realism, or the anthropology of the ontological
                turn. The thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave strengthened and developed
                the calling into question of the great divides (between nature and culture, male and
                female, and so on) and the rejection of any kind of transcendent Outside, a
                rejection and a questioning that was initiated by thinkers of immanence (as we will
                have seen in the first section of my essay). The second poststructuralist wave, on
                the other hand, put things this way: 1) Yes, there is no transcendent Outside,
                    <hi rend="italic">consequently</hi> there is no outside at all <note place="foot" resp="author"> Recently, Latour gave a
                            performance lecture in New York entitled “Inside” (<ref target="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/755">http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/755</ref>).</note>; 2)
                Yes, nature and society are indistinguishable, <hi rend="italic">consequently</hi> nature does not exist any longer.<note place="foot" resp="author">

               </p>
               <p> In the three last sections of my essay, I will object to these two problematic
                consequences that, I argue, underpin the Anthropocene and its disastrous
                environmental consequences. To support my philosophical objection, I will devote the
                third section to an explanation of what I call the <hi rend="italic">field of
                    existential differences</hi>, a concept leaning on the following thesis: indeed,
                there is no <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> Outside, but there is
                an <hi rend="italic"> infinity of outsides</hi> as innumerable
                as there are singular existences. Each outside opens itself inside each existing
                being—“chose inouïe, c’est au-dedans de soi qu’il faut regarder le dehors”
                (surprisingly, it is inside yourself that you can look at the outside), argues
                Victor Hugo (<hi rend="italic">Préface</hi> 699).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Henceforth cited as
                        (PO).</note> This internal outside is the condition of
                possibility of relationality, or more accurately of communication: existing beings
                can communicate thanks to their internal openness. Communication occurs between
                different beings — that is to say, beings defined by their existential difference;
                furthermore, each existential difference (each existing being) reveals a field to
                which it belongs. This field is not a pre-existing substance but an ontological
                domain transformed by the appearance of new forms of existence.</p>
               <p> Once my existentialist proposition is explained, I will be able to revisit the
                concept of nature. Instead of liquidating nature — killing it; turning it into
                asubstantial, fungible things for human “progress” – I will lean on
                several Romantic writers to describe, in the fourth and fifth sections, nature as a
                field of existential differences. As a form of thought, Romanticism was always
                subject to several metaphysical oscillations: between the natural and the
                supernatural, between revolutionary stances and reactionary retractions, and between
                a militant optimism (Percy Shelley’s “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” in
                his “Ode to the West Wind") and a dark pessimism (Lord Byron’s “better not to
                be” at the end of “Euthanasie"). Instead of too quickly favoring only one dimension
                of Romantic thought, I’d rather argue in this essay that these oscillations draw a
                space of fundamental polarities that still help us to understand our contemporary
                situation. Romanticism is of course historically datable, and we can track its
                origins, its forerunners, and its acme; but Romanticism also constitutes an event, à
                la Alain Badiou, that is to say, a figure of truth that is still available, a
                “surviving Romanticism” – to borrow from Sara Guyer (18–20) — that we can still
                solicit for our present. </p>
               <p> In this sense, I agree with Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre when they define
                Romanticism as a transhistorical vision having as its center “a reaction against the
                way of life in capitalist societies” (17) – a reaction giving rise to
                revolutionary statements <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to Gérard de Nerval’s “black sun of Melancholia.” 
                We thus must not forget that, insofar as society is still capitalist, Romanticism is
                still topical. For Löwy and Sayre, “Far from conveying an outsiders’ view, far from being a critique rooted in some
                elsewhere, the Romantic view constitutes modernity’s self-criticism” (21). </p>
               <p> Yet I claim that it’s only because Romanticism reveals or produces outsides <hi rend="italic">from within</hi> that Romanticism can — still — constitute an
                alternative to capitalism. When the present is too compact, too immanent, too
                anthropomorphized, too enclosed in itself, we need thinkers and activists risking an
                elsewhere – revealing, building, and, in the end, communicating an outside to
                everyone, at least potentially. My hypothesis is that it’s possible to save the
                concept of nature, not as a stable transcendent entity on which racist and sexist
                politics could be built, but as an element of disruption. Leaning on Victor Hugo and
                Jean-Jacques Rousseau, I will define nature as 1) something that can neither be
                reduced to a transcendent part nor to an immediate and visible aspect and 2) a
                plural mediation enabling a political critique of society. Nature is plural, but
                this plurality does not lead to considering the world as a collection of
                ontologically equivalent entities; rather, natures are profoundly different,
                sometimes contradictory, always deceiving our expectations
                along with our unfortunate attempt to reduce them to something or to nothing.
                Natures disrupt both the human/non-human divide and the attempt to erase it in a
                peaceful liberal world that a Parliament of humans and/or things could govern.
                If we want to prevent the Anthropocene from becoming cosmophagic – —from eating,
                swallowing, destroying the non-human universe - and in the end from becoming
                anthropophagic for lack of otherness, then we must leave a place for an updated
                concept of nature that could foster an anti-Anthropocenic
                politics.</p>

                  <head>End of the Outside, End of Nature</head>
                  <p> Here is my opening question: what has motivated the radical reconsideration of any
                figure of otherworldliness or outer-worldliness? With such a question, the name of
                Friedrich Nietzsche comes to mind. In <hi rend="italic">Twilight of the Idols</hi>,
                he showed “how the ‘true world’ finally became a fable” (17). This Nietzschean
                detonation tends to extinguish not only the Christian religion but also Plato,
                insofar as Christianity, Nietzsche says in <hi rend="italic">Beyond Good and
                    Evil</hi>, was nothing more than a “Platonism for the people”
                (3). If this destruction affects both God and the so-called platonic intelligible world, our investigation
                should on the one hand look for the historical, religious, and philosophical
                sources of the theme of the Death of God, and on the other hand grasp the way in
                which many thinkers kept trying to avoid the ontological separation between the
                here-below and the beyond that Plato is said to have opened.</p>
                  <p> Regarding the topic of the Death of God, I will note that this is already present
                in many authors before Nietzsche. Jean Paul writes in 1796: “‘Christ, is there no
                God?’ And he answered: ‘There is none!’” (336). In fact, the death of God was only
                a nightmare, not a reality, for this early German Romantic; but this bad dream will
                haunt Romanticism — as I will explain again at the end of my essay — and beyond it
                all of German Idealism.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            “Formerly, the infinite grief existed historically in the formative
                            process of culture. It existed in the feeling that ‘God Himself is
                            dead.’” (G.  W.  F. Hegel, <hi rend="italic">Faith and Knowledge</hi>,
                            Albany, SUNY Press, 1977, 190). I read the persistent nightmare of
                            God’s death as the “return of the repressed”: Christianity is founded on
                            the death of God as son, despite his resurrection and his supposed
                            return at the end of times.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> The question of ontological separation would require an investigation that cannot
                be completed in this essay: I would have to show how Baruch Spinoza defines
                substance as “indivisible,” how Denis Diderot argues that everything is “sentient,”
                shifting without discontinuity from inertia to living bodies, and how Heraclitus,
                Epicurus, and Lucretius argue that everything flows.<note place="foot" resp="author"> That is why, for Heraclitus, “One cannot step twice into the same river” 
                    (<hi rend="italic">The Art and Thought of Heraclitus</hi>). Concerning Spinoza, cf. <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> 227. Concerning Diderot, cf. (for example) “Spinozist.”</note>
                  All these authors, from Heraclitus and the Greek atomists to the Nietzsche of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gay Science</hi>, produced an ontology of nature — or an
                ontology of life — rejecting the idea of a transcendent Outside. Yet it’s only with
                Marx and Engels that the world was, for the first time, defined as <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> and <hi rend="italic">historically</hi> one, enclosed on
                itself. The diagnosis of these two authors still determines our contemporary
                relation with nature and the outside, which is why I want to shed some light on
                their theoretical matrix. </p>
                  <p>Indeed, starting with
                the <hi rend="italic"> Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts </hi>of
                1844, Marx argued that nature and society are concretely indistinguishable: Nature,
                he wrote, is inserted into the “self-generation” of Humanity
                (356). In other words, Nature is “man’s <hi rend="italic">inorganic
                    body</hi>” that is to say not only “a direct means of life” but first and foremost “the matter, the object
                and the tool of his life activity” (328). In <hi rend="italic">The German
                    Ideology</hi>, which was written in the wake of the 1844 <hi rend="italic">Manuscripts</hi>, Marx and Engels explain that the transformation of Nature is
                the effect of a global industrial process: capitalism is but a megamachine turning
                the whole world into a gigantic Marketplace, reducing nature to a mere product.
                During this process, Nature lost any kind of exteriority:
                
            <quote>Of course, in all this the priority of external nature remains unassailed, and all
                this has no application to the original men produced by <hi rend="italic">generatio
                    aequivoca</hi> [spontaneous generation]; but this differentiation has meaning
                only insofar as man is considered to be distinct from nature. For that matter,
                nature, the nature that preceded human history, is not by any means the nature in
                which Feuerbach lives, it is nature which today no longer exists anywhere (except
                perhaps on a few Australian coral-islands of recent origin). (<hi rend="italic">The
                    German Ideology</hi> 63)</quote>
                     <hi rend="italic">Capital</hi> will show how, with the reign of commodities, every
                terrestrial reality loses its singularity and becomes an element of a specific
                immanence: the equivalence of everything with everything, which is not so far away,
                according to Alexander Galloway, from the world flat ontologies — and
                object-oriented philosophies that strive to go beyond the post-structuralist mode of
                thinking — describe. In 1863, in a famous unpublished chapter of <hi rend="italic">Capital</hi> Marx proposes
                two important concepts for our inquiry: “formal subsumption” of labor to capital 
                (when capital subordinates preexisting productive forces) and “real subsumption”
                (when capital becomes able to produce its own means, its own machines and methods of
                production, reshaping everything on the basis of its own requirements) (128–36).
                Real subsumption is the capitalist name for the end of the outside, the process
                through which capitalism reconfigures everything on Earth – in other words, the
                beginning of geo-capitalism and its anthropocenic effects.</p>
                  <p> In this regard, we could say that the (celebrated or wished-for) end of the Great
                divides between nature and society/culture/technology, the disappearance of the
                Outside, and the melting of nature into anthropogenic activities, are not new ideas
                coming from twentieth-century constructivist
                thinkers or Actor-Network Theory promoters but from Marx and Engels, 150 years ago. 
                Like Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Epicurus, Marx and Engels were
                thinkers of immanence who fought against transcendence (of God, of “Man,” of
                commodities and their fetishism, etc.) and against the divisions opened up by
                transcendence. However, unlike Democritus, Diderot, Spinoza, or Nietzsche, Marx and
                Engels no longer needed an ontology of nature to destroy the great
                divides and absolute transcendence. Instead of ontology, they appealed to economics:
                they wanted to grasp the <hi rend="italic">nomos</hi> of our capitalist <hi rend="italic">oikos</hi>, the rules of an industrial globalization in the
                process of swallowing the Earth, regurgitating it as <hi rend="italic">partes extra
                    partes</hi> commodities. Since the advent of modernity and its geo-capitalist
                scaffolding, we could say, parodying Wittgenstein, if nature could talk, only
                commodities would understand it.</p>

                  <p> From cybernetics to object-oriented philosophies through post-structuralism, a
                theoretical challenge has been advanced: who will be able to definitively erase the
                difference between living and non-living beings, nature and artifacts, organisms and
                machines? What will be — please, forgive my irony — the best theory to
                justify in ontological terms what capitalism already began to perform in the
                nineteenth century? During the last 30 years,
                sociologist Ulrich Beck, meta-sociologist Bruno Latour, and cyber-feminist Donna
                Haraway — authors who belong to what I call the second
                post-structuralist wave — have blurred the theoretical division between nature and
                society, human beings, animals, and artificial beings.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Here post-structuralism becomes post-humanism. 
                    Consider two books of Donna Haraway’s: <hi rend="italic">Simians, Cyborgs, and Women:
                                The Reinvention of Nature</hi>, in which we can find in this book her famous “Cyborg Manifesto,” and 
                            <hi rend="italic">The Companion Species

                                agree with Haraway’s approach, I just question one of its
                                consequences.</note> 
                French anthropologist Philippe Descola — a proponent of
                what I have called in the introduction the anthropology of the ontological turn, which
                aims to replace the concept of structure inherited from Claude Levi-Strauss with
                ontological propositions about cultures — has recently shown that we have to think
                “beyond nature and culture." And so? Is there anything here that is theoretically objectionable? </p>
                  <p> Certainly not. The critique of the Great divides was necessary because these
                divisions were based on the concept of a transcendent Outside. This Outside, as I
                explained, was demolished by the attacks of Lucretius, Spinoza, Diderot, Nietzsche,
                and Marx. Besides, I find incredibly thoughtful and generous the way Donna Haraway
                thinks, the relations she produces between split domains of thought and the
                capacity that she has to follow and tie different scientific, social, philosophical,
                political threads together. I still learn a lot from her, from her last
                theorizations about what she calls the “Chthulucene” (an Anthropocene conceptually
                reconfigured from a non-human, non-Western, non-phallocentric perspective), and I
                enjoy translating her work.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See my
                            translation of her fabulous “Anthropocene, Capitalocene,

                But many contemporary thinkers belonging to the second post-structuralist wave drew
                these two very problematic conclusions. First, if there is no absolute Outside,
                then there is no outside at all. Let us listen to Michael Hardt’s and Antonio
                Negri’s voices, in <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi>: “One primary effect of
                globalization is the creation of a common world, a world that, for better or worse,
                we all share, a world that has no ‘outside’” (vii). Second, if nature and
                society are indistinguishable, then nature does not exist any longer. “Thank God,
                nature is going to die,” Bruno Latour writes in <hi rend="italic">Politics of
                    Nature</hi> (25): “There is no rupture” between the world of the so-called
                'things ‘as they are’ and human ‘representations’ of these things” (12). This
                lack of rupture was theorized by Ulrich Beck
                in <hi rend="italic"> Risk Society</hi> (the French edition of
                this book being prefaced by Latour). Like Marx and Engels, Beck speaks about “the
                end of the antithesis between nature and society”: nature is “a historical product,”
                a “second nature” (80–81).</p>
                  <p> What is wrong here? The fact that the theorists I have just quoted have melted two
                distinct concepts: cleavage (split, <hi rend="italic">Spaltung</hi>) and difference.
                Thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave, like Derrida, Deleuze, or Irigaray,
                were thinkers of difference: they fought against cleavages, that is to say,
                <hi rend="italic">absolute </hi>separations whose goal is to
                avoid any real relation between the considered terms. An <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> difference is nothing but the denial of difference itself, the
                denial of the relation that a difference is itself able to produce, even through its
                repetition, as Deleuze argues in <hi rend="italic">Difference and Repetition</hi>. 
                Actually, a cleavage is always an attempt to shape and preserve, as I will explain in the next section, an identity, an
                imaginary “pure” identity, and not a difference. To shed some light on my last
                statement, let’s focus on philosopher and feminist Luce Irigaray’s 1977 influential
                book <hi rend="italic">This Sex Which is Not One</hi>, where she develops her
                radical approach to sexuality and male/female “difference.” The phallocentric
                cleavage poses, on the one hand, the only existing sex, the male One-sex, its
                identity and its norms (to be active, to not cry, to master nature, etc.), and on
                the other hand a sex “which is not one,” the female sex that is <hi rend="italic">un
                    sexe qui n’en est pas un</hi>, to re-establish the French original text and its
                main meaning: <hi rend="italic">this sex that is not a sex</hi>, that is to say,
                this sex that does not really <hi rend="italic">exist</hi>. In other words, the phallocentric cleavage produces the absolute gap between a (male) identity=1 and
                a (female) non-identity=0. In this respect, the fight against phallocentrism
                consists less in overcoming a Great divide — between two (id)entities — than in
                uncovering the Great annihilation of a difference (the female one) in favor of the
                only recognized identity (the male one).</p>
                  <p> We see the same logics of annihilation in the way modernity sets the (non)relation
                between nature and culture/technology/human society: if we want to understand this
                (non)relation, that is to say, this cleavage, we have to begin our investigation not
                with Romanticism and its so-called idealization of nature (I will question this weak
                idea in the fourth section), but with the fact that nature was reduced, since the
                    seventeenth century, to nothingness. It
                is because René Descartes at first said that nature is not a “deity” but a
                mathematizable area that we can use nature — or the Earth — at will, digitalizing,
                reprogramming, and printing it in 3D: "By ‘Nature’ here, Descartes wrote in "
                <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Light</hi>", I do not mean some deity or other sort
                of imaginary power. Rather, I use the word to signify matter itself” (25). 
                Since nature is nothing by itself – according to Descartes, but we could add
                Francis Bacon, and Galileo Galilei – it is a mere quantity without qualities and
                can therefore be turned into anything humans want.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Hence the “death of nature” (Merchant). </note>
                The scientific revolution of the seventeenth century paved the way to the enchanted
                world of commodities — that we studied with Marx and Engels — and its anaturalist basis. In this modern world, only technologies,
                sciences, cultures, and human values are considered as real, active, and capable of
                giving an identity – <hi rend="italic">their</hi> identity – to the rest of the
                world. To sum up: Humans = identity = 1; nature = non-identity = 0.</p>
                  <p> Yet it is not the same thing to say that two things are <hi rend="italic">separated</hi> as opposed to saying that two things are <hi rend="italic">split</hi>. The difference produced by a separation does not prevent a
                relation — quite the contrary. I argue that separation is the condition of possibility
                for relation. Separation precedes communication, an ontological statement that
                Romanticism exemplifies as I will show below. In this respect, I argue that
                exophobia — the fear of the outside — is an effect of a misunderstanding of what
                it means to connect, a misunderstanding that I attribute to the second wave of
                post-structuralism. It was believed that, in order to render relations possible, one
                had to ward off the outside; my argument is that in warding off the infinity of
                outsides, one renders relations impossible — one merely overexposes everything to
                an oppressive light under which relations become irons. Let us develop this
                point.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Field of Existential Differences</head>
                  <p> The lesson of the former section is the following: let us think twice when we plan on
                ending the Great divides as they may hide Great annihilations — the first ones need
                to be contested in light of the second ones. Along with contemporary philosopher
                Catherine Malabou, I argue that it is necessary nowadays to “change difference” in
                the name of a radical existentialism able to challenge the Great annihilations and
                the divides underpinning them (5-40). Strategically, the goal of the existentialism
                I propose is to insert a sort of retroactive bifurcation between the first and the
                second post-structuralist waves to avoid the mere proliferation of
                theories — like OOO — that, under the cover of an ontological equality that erases
                the Great divides, maintains the social, political, and environmental inexistence
                that these dominant systems produce. In doing so, I will avoid the ontological
                indifferentiation that follows from the rejection of differences and separations in
                the name of the abolition of cleavages. </p>
                  <p> But the radical existentialism I offer also needs to avoid a second danger (which is
                symmetrical to ontological indifferentiation): a bad reaction against the necessary
                fight against the Great divides, a reaction I call <hi rend="italic">the morals of
                    symbolic identities</hi>. Let us think about the way some French psychoanalysts
                and anthropologists have used the notion of the symbolic order, which they have
                reshaped through a very restrictive reading of Jacques Lacan and Claude
                Levi-Strauss, in order to justify rigid sexual identities, the prohibition of gay
                marriage, and the refusal of the adoption of children by non-heterosexual
                    parents.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a critique of this misreading of Levi-Strauss, see Patrice Maniglier’s, “L’humanisme interminable de Lévi-Strauss.”</note>
                These thinkers, who participated in the building of a reactionary discourse that is
                nowadays well established in France, use the concept of a fixed symbolic order in
                order to legitimate the worst reactionary splits (between, for example, the good
                symbolic-born parents and the bad natural ones). In order to avoid 
                ontological indifferentiation and the morals of symbolic identities, I argue in
                favor of a field of existential differences that will be able to describe what links
                singularities without obliterating their separation, their reciprocal
                extraterritoriality. </p>
                  <p> Let us briefly discuss what constitutes the field of existential differences. First, a field is not a substance: a substantial, invisible, “potential,” the field
                only reveals itself after bodies have emerged. Only existing beings can attest to
                the ontological field: before they exist, there is no difference between the field
                and nothingness, and in this sense — against any sort of ontological turn trying to
                re-establish, in contemporary anthropology and philosophy, the preeminence of a
                metaphysics <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> uttering what should be said on
                cultures, politics, and aesthetics — there is no possible ontology prior to any
                existentialism, understood as what gives priority to the emergence as such of
                entities. Yet when object-oriented philosopher Graham Harman argues, on the basis of
                his reading of Latour, that there are only “actants” and no “potential,” no
                “virtual,” no “pre-individual” reality, he actually erases the dynamic difference
                between existences and the ontological field that we need to recognize
                retrospectively – that is, only after the fact of existence.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Graham Harman writes: “Recall that there is no such thing for Latour as a
                            ‘becoming’ that would exceed individual actors. Nor is there any
                            ‘virtuality’ that exceeds them, just as potentiality does not exceed
                            them. The much-discussed difference between potential and virtual, so
                            often wielded like a billy club in our time by Deleuzian hooligans, is
                            irrelevant here—both terms fail Latour’s standard for concreteness in
                            exactly the same way” (<hi rend="italic">Prince of
                                Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics</hi>, 101).
                            Elsewhere, he notes, “In short, I reject both the potential <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the virtual in favor solely of the actual”
                            (Graham Harman, “on disappointing realisms,”).</note>
                This erasure could lead to the idea of a “flat” immanent world that, I argue,
                denies existence and its depth of field. Flatness or depth: this is the crucial
                philosophical alternative of our time.</p>
                  <p> Second, coming into existence is only possible through an internal
                separation leading to polarities (left/right, high/low, inside/outside, but also
                visible/invisible, light/dark, etc.) that are not initially splits but rather
                constitute a depth of field wherein a subject experiments with her or his
                reason or senses. In this regard, a subject can be defined as an instance of
                mediation, as a moment of communication, the last term signifying, à la Bataille,
                the excess through which polarities reveal their unfathomable difference.</p>
                  <p> At the core of the existentialism that I argue for lies the term “existence.”
                Etymologically, <hi rend="italic">ek-sistere</hi> means to be outside or more
                precisely to constitute oneself from the outside. The outside — each outside
                — acts as a fundamental disjuncture, something that we might call, with Lucretius, a
                    <hi rend="italic">clinamen</hi>.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I have devoted a book to these questions: <hi rend="italic">Clinamen. Flux, Absolu et Loi
                                Spirale</hi>
                     </note> A clinamen is a deviation vis-à-vis
                straight lines, social norms, ethograms (that is to say, the inventory of all
                behaviors or actions exhibited by an animal), or thermodynamic equilibriums. At
                the beginning - of the universe, as of each thing - was the clinamen. A clinamen is
                the opening onto an outside — a break, an empty space, a non-functional element,
                all the existential spacings that can appear, for instance, in the form of a
                non-signifying signifier in a poem, in an act of political resistance, or in André
                Breton’s “amour fou,” etc. The outside is the mark of the singularity of each
                crucial experience, each notable artistic or political event, and, in the end, each
                existing being. Any ordinary life is the singular way through which an existing
                being experiences her own depth of field.</p>
                  <p> The outside also explains why philosophy is always disoriented, displaced by the
                contingency of the clinamen. For an existence-disoriented philosophy, there is no
                Outside; but there is an infinity of outsides, as innumerable as there are singular
                existences. Each outside opens itself inside each existing being, and this internal
                exteriority is the condition of possibility for relations. Existing beings can
                communicate thanks to their internal openness. Conversely, if immanence were
                compact, full, and substantial, there would be no gap, no separation between
                existing beings, and consequently no relations. Relations require separation – an
                idea that Bataille kept repeating: we communicate, we really communicate not because
                we are connected, but first and foremost because we are “<hi rend="italic">discontinuous</hi>
                beings,” that is, because of the impossibility of an absolute fusion of what would be the definitive erasure of
                differences (12).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Bataille, death, that which interrupts any life, appears to the eyes of discontinuous beings as “continuity” itself, that is to say, what makes possible a form of communication (<hi rend="italic">Death and Sensuality</hi> 13).</note> 
                In the event of such fusion, there would not be any communication but a magmatic lack of relation
                and of difference in favor of an identity preventing any possible singularization
                from happening.</p>
                  <p> To sum up, the field of existential differences is activated by the presence of
                existing beings that are opened up by their internal outside, which is neither a
                subtracted substance nor an object hidden behind its expressions but the
                contingent effect of an event.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Nature, Supernature, and Natures</head>
                  <p>In the two final parts of my essay, I want to examine what I said about nature and the field of existential differences in relation to Romanticism. 
                For many contemporary thinkers who attempt to get rid of the concept of nature and to create an ecology without or against nature, 
                Romanticism is the target. Let us take the example of contemporary thinker Timothy Morton who argues that, in our “ecological age,” 
                “we are realizing that absolutely everything is absolutely connected to absolutely everything else” (“Ecology after Capitalism” 47). 
                Morton argues that nature is an “ideological construct”: “What if, finally, Nature as such, the idea of a radical outside to 
                the social system, was a capitalist fantasy, even precisely 
                <hi rend="italic">the</hi> capitalist fantasy?” (57).</p>
                  <p> Yet this statement raises two difficulties. First, it is, unfortunately, possible to reverse Morton’s statement: 
                what if, finally, the lack of a radical outside to the capitalist system was precisely <hi rend="italic">the</hi> capitalist fantasy, 
                the technological-capitalist program informing the financial sphere? 
                Second, I am not at all sure that the main strategy of Romanticism was to turn nature into a 
                transcendental principle. The fact, quoting Morton, that nature “wavers between the divine and 
                the material,” between “essence” and “substance,” has to be understood not as a theoretical 
                weakness or a dead end, as Morton thinks but as a problem 
                (<hi rend="italic">Ecology without Nature</hi> 14, 16); etymologically speaking, what is thrown
                    (<hi rend="italic">ballein</hi>) before (<hi rend="italic">pro</hi>)
                    us is what we have to deal with. Maybe the reduction of
                    nature to a pure material product or to the supernatural, namely the divine,
                    represents two bad solutions to this problem; maybe nature is a milieu
                    encompassing these two extreme existential states. In order to highlight my
                    approach, I would like to focus on two figures of Romanticism: Victor Hugo and
                    Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
                  <p> Hugo’s works illustrate my definition of romanticism as a space of fundamental polarities: the last lines
                    that the poet wrote were “c’est ici le combat du jour et de la nuit” (here is the struggle between day and night) 
                    — “here” being a place such as the Earth or Hugo himself (<hi rend="italic">Essential</hi> 464–65). <note place="foot" resp="author"> Henceforth cited as (E).</note>
                All of Hugo’s poetry is the affirmation of an infinite darkness, redeemed in extremis by the superior 
                infinity of God: we are “lost in the deep unfathomable night;” but “fleetingly,” we can “glimpse, 
                lit up by some flare of light, / The glass pane of Eternity” (E 271). In a text titled “Préface philosophique,” 
                Hugo situates humankind as a milieu between two forms of darkness: the “impenetrable” Earth and the 
                “immeasurable” sky. Yet darkness also constitutes humankind’s interiority and, in this sense, humankind 
                is a “microcosmos” (<hi rend="italic">Œuvres Complètes</hi> 340,
                    370).<note place="foot" resp="author">Henceforth cited as
                    (OC).</note> In the dark universe through which rare illuminations persist, everything is continuous, 
                “immanent” (a term Hugo keeps repeating); there is no gap between life and death: “Everything, even rot, is mixed with vitality . . . Nothing comes to an end;
                everything that ends one thing sketches another one; all the dead give birth” (OC
                346). Yet the following lines disrupt this feeling of continuity:
                
            <quote> Nothing amalgamates, everything is
                    balanced . . . the interstice is the law of being; more or less density, that’s the 
                    whole difference between the stone and the cloud; granite is a fog; the ax that cuts a 
                    head is a vapor; between two atoms, as between two universes, there is space; and the 
                    interval is as impassable from the molecule to the molecule in the infinite from below as 
                    from the sun to the sun in the infinite from above. Explaining is not more possible than 
                    denying (OC 346).</quote>
                
             This is Hugo’s ontology: 1) Everything communicates, immanence reigns, in a fundamentally dark form. 
             2) Yet communication is not fusion: a spacing – recall the terms “space,” “intervals,” or “interstices” 
             prevents entities from melting into an indistinct magma. 3) In this regard, what is communicated is not 
             a common substance, but a common interval. As with everything else — the Earth, the ocean, or the sky — nature is 
             subjected to a form of polarization through which a non-melting communication occurs, that is to say, the 
             communication of darkness, of the immeasurable. In a text entitled “Préface de mes œuvres et post-scriptum 
             de ma vie” (Preface of my Works and Post-Scriptum of my Life), Hugo argues that nature 
            
                <quote> exists alone and contains everything. Everything is. There is the part of nature that we perceive, and 
                there is the part of nature that we do not perceive. Pan has one visible side and one invisible side. 
                Because on this invisible side, you contemptuously throw the word <hi rend="italic">supernaturalism</hi>, 
                    will this invisible part less exist? X remains X. The
                    Unknown withstands your vocabulary. To deny is not to destroy. 
                    Supernaturalism is immanent. (PO 703) </quote>
                
            Thus even supernaturalism is
                    natural, immanent, the opposite of transcendent — “Le surnaturalisme, c’est la
                    nature trop loin,” that is to say, supernaturalism is nature too far away (PO
                    699). Hugo enables us to understand that there are two bad ways to deal with
                    nature: the first one is to detach a transcendent part; the second one is to
                    reduce nature to its immediate and visible aspect. To explain the effect of such
                    a reduction, Hugo uses a marvelous formula: “Vous n’avez pas voulu voir le
                    visage de l’Inconnu; vous verrez son masque” (you refused to see the face of the
                    Unknown; you will see its mask)” (PO 704). A too quick reading might make us
                    think that here Hugo opposes nature (the face) and the mask as man-made in the
                    same way that Romantic writers are supposed to oppose “here” (where we are) and “elsewhere” (another world). 
                    However, Hugo actually says something very different: he argues that the mask is still an 
                    emanation of nature, but in the guise of the denial of its invisible part. A mask is not 
                <hi rend="italic"> absolutely </hi> detached from nature, in the sense that a communication 
                between them is still possible. That is why Hugo writes, in his poem <hi rend="italic">Ce que dit la bouche d’ombre</hi> (What the Mouth of Darkness Says): “le dedans du masque est 
                encore la figure” (the inside of the mask is still a figure) (
                <hi rend="italic">Les Contemplations</hi> 365). <note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Henceforth cited as (LC).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Of course, it would be easy to show that Hugo’s writing is haunted by the desire to 
                surpass nature. In “Magnitudo Parvi," the poet defines contemplation as a way to detach oneself from matter: “contempler
                les choses, / c’est finir par ne plus les voir. La matière tombe détruite” (to contemplate things, / it is eventually to see them
                    no longer. Matter falls apart) (LC 183). But the poem does not finish on these
                    words and Hugo writes: “La matière tombe détruite / devant l’esprit aux yeux de
                    lynx" (matter falls apart / before the spirit with the eyes of a lynx). Spirit, Hugo tells us, needs animal abilities to go beyond matter. 
                    In the same line, even if Hugo, in <hi rend="italic">Ce que dit la bouche d’ombre</hi>, associates matter with evil, he adds that a stone
                    is not only a “hideous blind,” but also something “pensif,” pensive, on the verge of thinking (LC 364).
                    “Everything speaks,” Hugo writes, as if the Universe was structured like a
                    language (LC 362). That is why
                    
            <quote> sous ces épaisseurs de matière et de nuit, 
                Arbre, bête, pavé, poids que rien ne soulève, 
                Dans cette profondeur terrible, une âme rêve”
            (souls of the trees, beasts and cobblestones dream under depths of matter 
            and night). (LC 371).</quote>
                
            Even as immanent, even getting out
                    of a transcendent division, nature seems to be theorized by Hugo only on the
                    basis of a dual perspective. Can we imagine a Romanticism going beyond this
                    dualism? What might be a romantic pluralistic nature? This question is
                    especially important in the contemporary context of anthropologists who, aware
                    of the dangerous dead end of anaturalism, claim that, instead of getting rid of
                    nature, we should rather consider its multiplicity: I think here exemplarily to
                    Eduardo Viveiros de Castro who invented the term “multinaturalism,” which does
                    not mean a multiplicity of representations of nature, but rather multiple
                    natures as variation without a unity (65-75). However, Rousseau’s philosophy
                    might be read as an earlier exemplification of Viveiros de Castro’s
                    multinaturalism, and I will use Rousseau’s approach toward nature to temper
                    Hugo’s excessive ontological polarizations. To understand this approach, it is
                    useful – as a theoretical detour that will help us to identify Rousseau’s
                    originality - to see first how Paul de Man saw Rousseau’s conception of nature.
                    In the first chapter of<hi rend="italic" resp="author"> The Rhetoric of Romanticism</hi>, Paul de Man notices in Hölderlin’s, 
                Wordsworth’s, and Rousseau’s writings the same tendency to pass “from a certain type of nature, earthly and material, 
                to another nature which could be mental and celestial” (13). To establish his hypothesis, de Man highlights 
                the fact that, in Letter XXIII of the first part of <hi rend="italic">La Nouvelle Héloïse</hi>, Rousseau says “nature seems to take pleasure in
                    self-opposition”: “radical contradictions abound in each of the passages” of
                    this letter, de Man adds (14). <note place="foot" resp="author">Henceforth cited as
                    (NH). </note> Here again, as in the case of Hugo’s poetry, an excessive polarization prevails, 
                and we seem far away from any sort of multinaturalism. </p>
                  <p> Indeed, Rousseau uses the word “contradiction,” but just after he mentions this word he speaks 
                about difference. He says that nature is “différente en un même lieu sous divers aspects” 
                (nature is different in the same place under various aspects) (NH 44). For Rousseau, 
                contradiction is just one possibility amongst others and not the only determination of nature. 
                Just before this paragraph, Rousseau describes a multiplicity of natures: mild nature, 
                cultivated nature, and “un mélange étonnant de la nature sauvage et de la nature cultivée” 
                (a surprising melding of wild nature and cultivated nature)” (NH 44) — the sort of inextricable 
                naturecultures (to use the concepts of Latour and Haraway) that postmodern thinkers like to describe. 
                But de Man does not quote this paragraph; he also does not mention the fact that this strange multiplicity of 
                natures interrupts Rousseau’s meditation: “Je voulais rêver, et j’en étais toujours détourné par quelque 
                spectacle inattendu” (I wanted to dream, but I was always diverted by an unexpected spectacle) (NH 44). 
                A spectacle or a “vrai théâtre” (a real drama), as Rousseau says at the end of his description, occurs when natures 
                appear in their multiplicity becoming a sort of weird, natural, man-made scene. </p>
                  <p> Polarizations, contradictions, differences, a multiplicity, and an interrupting force: are these aspects of
                    nature too different, too irremediably disparate? Should we then get rid of the category of nature?</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Deep Nature</head>
                  <p> Getting rid of nature? My aim is quite different. I suggest the following hypothesis: nature is a milieu of 
                communication subjected to its own power of interruption or darkness — the “impenetrable” and the “immeasurable” 
                (OC 340, 370) — since it is what relates and separates. To produce the
                    ontological image of nature as a disruptive milieu, let’s try to superimpose
                    Hugo’s perspective on Rousseau’s; let’s draw a diagram of natures,
                    composed of 1) naturecultures, 2) the wild, and 3) technological
                    beings.</p>
                  <p> In the middle of this image
                    stands an intertwining of nature, culture, and technology, exactly what Donna
                    Haraway calls “naturecultures” (<hi rend="italics">Cyborgs, Simians, and Women</hi> 12). Subjected to what Ulrich Beck called its total “societalization,” 
                    the nature at stake here is a nature that “can no longer be understood <hi rend="italic" resp="author">outside</hi> of society, or society
                    <hi rend="italic" resp="author">outside</hi> of nature” (80). Ventriloquizing Marx and Engels’s
                <hi rend="italic">The German Ideology</hi>, Beck adds that “not a hair or a crumb of [nature] is
                    still ‘natural’, if ‘natural’ means nature being left to itself” (81). As we
                    see, Beck’s risk society looks like what we today call Anthropocenic society;
                    yet what Beck and the constructivist trend are sometimes unable to see, or to
                    highlight, is that the entanglement of nature and culture only defines one
                    aspect, one becoming of nature amongst others.</p>
                  <p> On the left side of the picture, we can see nature without human intervention. 
                Let us think, for example, about the burning core of the Earth, all the earthquakes that 
                are not caused by hydraulic fracturing, or what speculative realist philosopher Quentin Meillassoux calls, 
                in <hi rend="italic">After Finitude</hi>, the “ancestral” realm: the “Great Outdoors” of the
                    universe that precedes even our appearance on Earth, and in this sense has no
                    relation of any kind to us (11-15). However, the problem with Meillassoux’s
                    ancestrality is, to paraphrase Hugo, the following: ancestrality is an outside
                    that is too far away. Wild, “inhuman” (Clark), escaping our attempt to
                    master it, nature’s otherness is also on Earth, in Earth, in every one of its
                    components. Let us call this dimension of nature “the wild”; not wilderness, or what results from 
                    the displacement of Native Americans, but the wild as what has been really untouched by human beings (even
                    though such an idea upsets any colonial drive).</p>
                  <p> On the right side of the picture, we can identify all the machines, all the technology that, 
                from synthetic biology to geo-engineering, strives to master, to replace, and, in the end, 
                to erase nature. But why do I include technology in a diagram of natures? Is it not important 
                to identify technological beings as existentially specific, as forms of being that cannot, or should not, 
                be reduced to non-artificial entities? Certainly yes, but let us remember what I said in the third section 
                about the field of existential differences: any ontological knowledge must only be 
                retroactively constituted after the reality of existing beings has been recognized. 
                In the same manner, it is only retroactively that we can argue that nature is ontologically everywhere, even in a computer or a
                    smartphone. This is possible only retroactively because we first need to
                    acknowledge existential differences. When this acknowledgment is assured, we can
                    speak about a natural field and its ontological continuity (as Spinoza and,
                    these days, the New Materialists do). We can then, but only then say with Lawrence Buell:
                    
                <quote> Even if people were to become as “posthuman” as the bionic characters of cyberpunk fiction, 
                    they would likely remain physically embodied and permeable to the influences of water 
                    cycle, photosynthesis, macroclimate, seismology, bacterial resistance to
                    pharmaceuticals, and the “natural” advantages and disadvantages of regional
                    habitats. (6)</quote>
                
             The problem is that sometimes we are
                    not able to recognize nature in commodities, high-tech objects, or cyborgs –
                    nature’s mask seems to have swallowed both flesh and face. However, it is not
                    because we are unable to see something that it does not exist. That is why
                    we have to give some depth to the field of differences, which is anything but
                    flat. So, if in our diagram we can see, horizontally, three specific areas
                    – naturecultures in the middle, machines on the right, and
                    wild nature on the left – we also need to acknowledge a vertical dimension severing naturecultures, 
                    wild nature, and technological beings from a dark, invisible, unknown nature: 
                    what I call <hi rend="italic">deep nature</hi> is the encounter between the vertical and horizontal 
                dimensions, which reveals a depth of field.</p>
                  <p> In the diagram of natures, the
                    function of depth is to host the invisible, the unknown, the frightening
                    darkness that Jean Paul has identified as the “empty, bottomless socket” of God
                    (337), a metaphor that strongly influenced the French romantic tradition. In
                    “Magnitudo Parvi,” Hugo exclaims: “L’oeil est crevé!” (the eye (of God) is
                    punctured!)” – a gruesome deed that he attributes to Spinoza and Lucretius,
                    those atheists who refuse to see God also in the “abyss,” in what — for Hugo — falsely appears as devoid of 
                    the divine (169). A few years after Hugo’s poem, Nerval writes in “Christ at Gethsemane”: 
                    
                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Seeking the eye of God, I’ve only seen a pit, </l>
                        <l>Huge, bottomless, black, from whence eternal night</l>
                        <l>Streams out over the world and ever deepens. (229)</l>
                     </lg>

                
            All this distress should not conceal
                    what Hugo completely understood: bottomless darkness is also the condition of
                    possibility for freedom, that is to say, for an ontological chance. F. W. J.
                    Schelling – who was maybe the decisive German Romantic philosopher - explains this point in his <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of
                    Human Freedom</hi>. In God, Schelling writes, there
                    is an “inner ground” that is not God but “precedes” his existence. Schelling
                    also calls this ground “nature” (27-28). If creatures can exist as such,
                    different from God, it is thanks to the inner ground that, in God, is not God.
                    In other words, the inner ground is what ontologically differentiates God from
                    himself. Freedom thus comes from this interval, this separation between God and
                    what Schelling also calls “the original ground” or the “non-ground,” in the
                    sense that the inner ground does not exist, since it is what precedes any
                    existence. In my terms, this inner ground is a pure field. The non-ground can be
                    interpreted as a principle of ontological an-archy, an absolute freedom that,
                    for Hugo, Satan, the fallen archangel, represents. In “The Plume of Satan,” God calls “freedom”
                    the feather of Satan’s wings that did not fall 
                (<hi rend="italic">Selected Poems</hi> 104).<note place="foot" resp="author">Henceforth cited as
                    (SP).</note> This leather is “au bord du gouffre ténébreux” (on the edge of the dark abyss) (SP 102), “près du puits de la chute infinite” 
                (near the well of the infinite fall)” (SP 104), that is to say, in between, in the interval.</p>
                  <p> To sum up, natures constitute a plurality, a field in which we can pass from technology to naturecultures and
                    from naturecultures to the wild and from the wild to technology. Every time an
                    entity as such appears, be it a machine or a tree, a distinction retroactively
                    appears in the field, a difference that any existing being traces. The condition
                    of possibility of any existence is the darkness, the non-ground thanks to which
                    the universe is not compact, deadly, or immanent. Bottomless, deep nature keeps 
                    composing an existential myriad that no ontology could have calculated <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>.</p>

                  <head>A Political Communication of the Outside</head>
                  <p> If the universe coming from deep
                    nature is a deep field of existential differences, then we can think anew the
                    relation between nature and the outside; we can escape the enclosed world of
                    the Anthropocene and its real subsumption of nature; we can cure exophobia.
                    Instead of fearing nature or trying to erase it, we can leave it a place — or
                    several places. This is the condition of possibility of an anti-Anthropocenic
                    politics. Of course, this expression seems ridiculous, since the Anthropocene is
                    supposed to last for millennia: is it not too late to be anti-Anthropocenic? 
                    Is it even still possible to speak in terms of political ecology? 
                    My answer is that we have no choice: yes, an anti-Anthropocenic ecopolitics is impossible, 
                    but it is exactly the impossible that we need to make happen as soon as possible 
                    if we want to avoid being swept away by global ecocide and its geo-technological ally. 
                    So, let us attempt to ascertain how the diagram of natures I sketched out can offer some 
                    philosophical help to imagine an anti-Anthropocenic ecopolitics.</p>
                  <p> First, the diagram of natures that I propose enables the
                    possibility of thinking of nature as a form of otherness – not a mother, or a father, 
                    not Gaia or Ouranos, but a foreign agent. Indeed, one of the fundamental dangers of 
                    the Anthropocene is to irremediably close humanity in upon itself. 
                    In the end, the anthropogenic eating of nature cannot but become anthropophagy. 
                    <hi rend="italic">Soylent Green</hi> - Richard Fleischer’s famous 1973 environmental film
                    - does not show the apocalypse that follows the collapse of
                    the global civilization. Rather, it reveals that this collapse leans on the
                    previous short-circuit of humankind that eats itself. Anthropophagy is not a
                    post-apocalyptic practice. Rather, it defines the supreme condition of a
                    civilization that ate – destroyed – the whole non-human world. If <hi rend="italic">Soylent Green’s</hi> opening montage puts together standardization and the Industrial Revolution, 
                it is less to insist on the problem of overpopulation than on the disappearance of non-human forms 
                of life that I call cosmophagy. <note place="foot" resp="author"> I explore the concept of cosmophagy and its 
                    relations with the eco-apocalyptical cinema in “Cosmophagie. Cinéma éco-apocalyptique, anthropocène et anthropophagie.”</note>
                In other words, anthropophagy is the last step of
                    cosmophagy. At this point, when the Anthropos has swallowed the Earth, when
                    nature is performatively said to no longer exist, when human beings and every
                    form of life merge with one another, the face – to use Hugo’s words – is nothing but the mask.</p>
                  <p> In this regard, to speak about the
                    Unknown, à la Hugo, might be a way to leave some play between the mask and the
                    face, in order to leave a place to other forms of existence. I will not resist
                    the temptation to say that the more we refuse the face of the unknown, the more
                    we risk several more Fukushimas. Here the unknown is not the “asylum of
                    ignorance,” to quote Spinoza (241), but on the contrary an aware knowledge of the unpredictable. 
                    It does not dismiss engineers, companies, and political leaders from their responsibilities 
                    vis-à-vis ecological disasters like Katrina or Fukushima, rather it engages another relation 
                    with what is not us. Concerning the last point, I am not sure that the word 
                <hi rend="italic">non-human</hi> is good enough to deal with the unknown because <hi rend="italic">non-human</hi> is an adjective that leaves unscathed the notion of human centrality 
                through its negation. If we do not really and deeply take into account the Unknown, then the following 
                alternative end to <hi rend="italic">The Novices of Saïs</hi>, written by Novalis in 1798, 
                might be our predictable fate: “One person succeeded — he lifted the veil of the goddess at Saïs — But what
                    did he see? He saw - nightmare of nightmares — himself” (76).</p>
                  <p> To be honest, I have made a small
                    change in this quotation: instead of “nightmare of nightmares,” Novalis wrote:
                    “wonder of wonders.” This friendly update leads to the political dimension of
                    the deep field of existential differences. Such a field does not prevent the
                    possibility of contradictions, understood as the extreme state of differences.
                    When Rousseau, in <hi rend="italic">La Nouvelle Héloïse</hi>’s Letter XXIII, uses the quasi-magic, 
                supernatural nature that he feels in the high mountains as a means to contest a modern society 
                consumed with greed, business, and earnings and as a way to envisage what an egalitarian society 
                should look like, this contradiction does not turn nature into a transcendental principle that we 
                should save from reality but rather uses nature as a necessary exterior able to engage a radical 
                critique of society and call for a change in reality. “Once the social compact is violated,” 
                that is to say, when a “master” deprives the people of its sovereignty, 
                Rousseau explains in <hi rend="italic">On the Social Contract</hi>, “each person then regains his first rights 
                and resumes his natural liberty, while losing the conventional liberty for which he
                    renounced it” (<hi rend="italic">Basic Political Writings</hi> 140). In other words, 
                “The very moment there is a master,
                    there no longer is a sovereign, and thenceforward the body politic is
                    destroyed”
                    (<hi rend="italic">Basic Political Writings </hi> 154). 
                Nature is therefore, for Rousseau’s politics, the
                    outside that can be generated and regenerated when the social order becomes its
                    own negation, that is, when the “social contract” — which is the event thanks
                    to which a people is constituted as a people — is broken. Nature is the Trojan
                    horse able to blow a revolutionary wind into the core of the polis.</p>
                  <p>This romantic revolutionary wind
                    communicates the outside.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the relation between Romanticism and 
                        revolution, see Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre, <hi rend="italic">Esprits de feu: Figures du
                                Romantisme anti-capitaliste.</hi>
                     </note>
                        As I explained in this essay, the outside is not an object far away from us; it constitutes us. To 
                <hi rend="italic">ek-sist</hi>, as I said, means, literally, to stand out, to be outside, or, better, to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> the outside. Thanks to Romantic poetry, the “immeasurable” of the sky and the “impenetrable” 
                        of the Earth is expressed as what is the most intimate share of the human, its inhuman core. 
                        With words, but also music, and paintings, the outside can be communicated as a reminder of the interval 
                        from which everything came into being — each thing, and the universe itself, that rose up less from a Big Bang than from a Big Spacing. 
                        Not only is communicating the outside communicating the darkness or the unground — thanks to which singularities can appear — but this 
                        communication can also stay hidden, and preserved. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in 2019, I heard Anna Tsing explain how, in 
                        Indonesia, she saw some animals unable to
                    hide any longer, forced to be visible, because of the deforestation caused by
                    the settlement of plantations. These animals have lost the existential and vital
                    experience to be hidden in forests.</p>
                  <p> I was struck by Tsing’s powerful
                    illustration of the global situation of overexposure – a situation touching all
                    species, including the human. What must nowadays be preserved is as much
                    biodiversity as psychodiversity. In a time of digital overexposure, when data
                    mining reigns, when the empty eye of God is filled with FAANG’s marketing
                    intrusions, it is crucial to be able to preserve the opacity of that which
                    exists. Needless to say, Facebook should be deserted. That is the paradox of our
                    time: to communicate the outside, we need to disconnect from the inside, to
                    create what Deleuze called “vacuoles of non-communication” (<hi rend="italics">Negotiations</hi> 175). We need to encrypt what we say, 
                    in the same way that “phusis kruptestai philein” (nature loves to hide) (Heraclitus 33).</p>

               <p> Karoline von Günderrode (1780–1806) has long been recognized as a poet and
                paradigmatic figure of the tragic Romantic, but recently her writing has begun to
                receive attention for its consideration of philosophical questions. Her work is
                especially promising for its original conceptualizations of death, selfhood, gender,
                and agency, which Günderrode sites within a metaphysics developed from readings of
                F. W. J. Schelling, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Early German
                Romanticism, and ancient Greek and Indian thought. Secondary literature has
                emerged on Günderrode’s engagement with Fichte and Schelling (Christmann; Dormann;
                Nassar), her reimagining of Early German Romantic themes
                (Heimerl; Hilger; Kuzniar), and her contributions to models of identity, especially
                female identity (Allingham; Battersby; Ezekiel “Metamorphosis”). This paper adds to
                the growing discussion of Günderrode's philosophical thought, unpacking the author's 
                metaphysics and arguing that the place she assigns human
                beings in her cosmology requires a reconceptualization of the relationship between
                human beings and the nonhuman world and the development of communities that include
                the nonhuman.</p>
               <p> That Günderrode’s work should be a potential source for re-imagining the
                human-nature relationship is hinted at by her connections with early German
                Romanticism and her influence on American transcendentalism. Her friend Bettina
                Brentano-von Arnim’s edited collection of their correspondence, <hi rend="italic">Die Günderode</hi>, was translated into English by Margaret Fuller, and Carol
                Strauss Sotiropoulos has argued that Fuller’s own model of friendship was informed
                by this text (81–110). Despite this, Günderrode’s work has not, so far, been much
                studied in relation to transcendentalism, environmentalism, or social or political
                theory (with the exception of work by Lucia Maria Licher [“Der Völker Schicksal”;
                “Du mußt Dich”; <hi rend="italic">Mein Leben</hi>]). In part, this may stem from
                Günderrode’s position as an intermediate figure between Early German Romanticism and
                the Heidelberg Romantics—she belongs to the broader circle of thinkers and writers
                associated with late Romanticism known as the Heidelberger Kreis. In particular, as
                Karl Heinz Bohrer has argued, there are parallels between Günderrode’s conception of
                the self and those of Clemens Brentano and Heinrich von Kleist (“Identität”;
                <hi rend="italic">Der romantische Brief </hi>75–84, 115–129).
                Brentano’s and Kleist’s focus on subjective experience is often viewed as part of
                Romanticism’s “turn inward,” that is, its move away from attempts to change
                social relationships towards a focus on the inner, emotional life and experiences of
                the individual (Bohrer “Identität”; Dallmayr 54; Sevin and Zeller 4–6). These links
                between Günderrode and later Romanticism have perhaps contributed to some
                commentators reading Günderrode as representative of this turn inward. For example,
                Ruth Christmann claims that Günderrode’s work was “in accord with developments after
                1800, which, after the failure of the Early German Romantic attempt at renewal,
                increasingly sought purchase in a retreat inwards and no longer aimed at connections
                to society” (119; see also Dormann 14, 240). <note place="foot" resp="editors">

                This paper argues that, rather than rejecting or neglecting social relations,
                Günderrode’s work presents an ideal of community. This ideal is embedded in the
                philosophical system that Günderrode was developing up until her death, which
                includes an account of what human beings are and how they relate to each other and
                to the nonhuman world.</p>
               <p> The first part of the paper provides an exposition of Günderrode’s cosmology and the
                place of human beings within it. Analysis of the unpublished essay “Idea of the
                Earth” and the closely related epistolary dialogue “Letters of Two Friends” shows
                that Günderrode presents human beings as embedded in, and the same in kind as, the
                nonhuman. Part two uses the philosophical dialogue “Story of a Brahmin” to argue
                that, consistent with this metaphysical picture, Günderrode denies that human
                beings are justified in adopting a dominating relationship to nature or the nonhuman
                (or each other). The third part of the paper explores Günderrode’s claim that human
                beings live in three ways— as animal, as human, and spiritually — and considers how
                these relate to Günderrode’s
                concept of earth. This part of the investigation reveals that, unlike many other
                philosophers of the time, who tended to strongly associate human beings and spirit,
                mind or consciousness, Günderrode disassociates these. </p>
               <p> The final part of the paper explores how Günderrode’s account translates into
                concrete ideas about community. I argue that Günderrode’s normative restraint, ideal
                of harmony, and view of human beings as part of and the same in kind as the rest of
                nature contribute to a vision of community in which genuine connections can flourish
                between human beings at the same time as connections to what is beyond the human.
                Rather than providing a program for ideal social relations or attitudes towards the
                natural world, Günderrode describes conditions for the emergence of small
                communities of friends in harmony with nature. On Günderrode’s model, these could
                potentially grow and eventually, perhaps, enable the emergence of the single,
                perfect organism she calls the “realized idea of the earth.”</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Idea of Earth</head>
                  <p> Günderrode’s unpublished fragment “Idea of the Earth” was probably written in 1805,
                based on references to this piece in her letters (III:272). This dense essay is an
                intermediate stage between Günderrode’s notes on Schelling, especially the passages
                “Idea of Nature” (II:398–99) and “The true idea of materialism…” (II:404–6), and the
                final letter of “Letters of Two Friends” in her collection <hi rend="italic">Melete</hi>. The latter repeats passages from “Idea of the Earth,” in places
                verbatim, elsewhere with important changes, and, taken together, the pieces show
                Günderrode moving progressively further away from Schelling’s thought as she
                developed her own. <hi rend="italic">Melete</hi>, Günderrode’s third collection of
                writings, had been sent to the publishers when she died, and “Letters” is therefore
                the most authoritative of these texts in terms of representing Günderrode’s own and
                considered position. Nonetheless, the exposition below takes its starting point from
                “Idea of the Earth,” which is more detailed and more closely focused on
                metaphysics.</p>
                  <p> In both “Idea of the Earth” and “Letters of Two Friends,” Günderrode claims that the
                world is comprised of “elements,” which join in temporary combinations to form
                individual entities. When these die or are destroyed, the elements are scattered and
                can then join together again in different combinations, creating new entities. For
                Günderrode, “life” is the combination of elements as these entities, while “death”
                is only a relative term applying to individual entities; by contrast, the elements
                out of which these are formed do not die:
                
            <quote>The most intimate mingling of different elements with the highest degree of contact
                and attraction we call life; to whatever perfection it may have developed it is
                still only the product of the synthesis of the elements that gestate life. With the
                dissolution of this synthesis the product also ends, but the life-principle in the
                elements is immortal; it requires only contact and connection again like before and
                new life blossoms with all the blooms that we call thought and sensation, and
                organism and body and soul.</quote>
                
               Thus life is immortal and surges up and down in the elements, for they are life
                itself. But determinate and individual life is only a life-form given through this
                determinate connection, attraction and contact, which can last no longer than the
                connection. (I:446–47; cf. I:359). According to Günderrode, the world we experience is thus comprised of entities that
                participate in a cycle of formation and destruction which, at all its stages,
                manifests the principle of life, just in different ways and forms. </p>
                  <p> Günderrode applies this model of living and dying to all entities, including objects
                we usually think of as devoid of life. For Günderrode, living beings such as plants
                and animals are only higher life-forms that exist on a continuum with supposedly
                inanimate objects. The beings that we think of as alive have developed from less
                animated forms of life through the process of repeated combination, dissolution, and
                recombination, which, Günderrode claims, gradually increases the “life” of the
                elements and, through these, of the whole: 
                
            <quote>Each mortal gives back to the earth a
                raised, more developed elemental life, which it cultivates further in ascending
                forms, and the organism, by assimilating ever more developed elements, must become
                ever more perfect and universal. Thus the All [<hi rend="italic">Allheit</hi>] comes
                to life through the downfall of the particular, and the particular survives
                immortally in the All whose life it developed while alive, and even after death
                elevates and increases, and so by living and dying helps to realize the idea of the
                earth. Thus however my elements may be dispersed, when they join to what is already
                living they will elevate it; when they join to those things whose life resembles
                death, they will animate them. (I:447–48; cf. I:360)</quote>
                
                At the end of this passage, Günderrode likens this process to
                reincarnation, adding: “The idea of the Indians of the transmigration of souls
                corresponds to this opinion.” I return to this claim below. Here, I only note that
                this suggests that Günderrode sees this model as allowing some form of personal
                survival beyond the death of the individual, although in an altered state.</p>
                  <p> Günderrode maintains that the process of increasing animation through the forming and
                re-forming of groups of elements can only stop when and if life has been fully
                actualized—that is, when all potential life has become real. This, she claims, would
                take the form of a single organism, which would constitute the realization of what
                she calls the “idea of the earth”:
                
            <quote>Each form that [the elements] produce is only a development of their
                life-principle. But the earth bears the life-material given back to it again in ever
                new appearances, until through ever new transformations everything capable of life
                in it has come to life. This would be when all mass would become organic; only then
                would the idea of the earth be realized. (I:447; cf. I:359–60)</quote>
                
            This model has clear connections to the work of Schelling, especially <hi rend="italic">Bruno</hi>, which Günderrode read in 1804. Several of the concepts
                featured in Günderrode’s metaphysics appear in this text, including “the idea of the
                earth” (or “idea of earth” as Michael Vater translates <hi rend="italic">Idee der
                    Erde</hi> [Schelling 125, trans. Vater]), although Schelling aligns this concept more clearly
                with Platonic ideas than Günderrode does. Günderrode, like Schelling in <hi rend="italic">Bruno</hi>, is concerned with explaining how the infinite relates
                to the finite world we experience. For Schelling, the organism is the closest
                available approximation of the way that individual things relate to the absolute,
                since the relationship between the parts of an organism is one of mutual,
                simultaneous conditioning rather than of cause and effect: “the best example we can
                find among familiar sensible things of the way the finite inheres in the infinite is
                the way individual parts of the animate body are tied into the whole organism”
                (Schelling 150). However, he adds that this is only an image or
                analogy, because “in the absolute this union of the finite and the infinite is
                infinitely more perfect than the living union of the parts of the body.”
                Similarly, Günderrode claims that the kinds of organisms we encounter in our
                ordinary lives are only approximations to the ultimate organism that would
                constitute the realized idea of the earth:
                
            <quote> The earth can therefore only attain its proper being when its organic and inorganic
                appearances dissolve in a collective organism,  [. . .]  where all body would also
                at the same time be thought, all thinking at the same time body, and a truly
                transfigured body, without lack or illness and immortal, and thus wholly different
                from what we call body or material and to which we attribute transience, inertia,
                illness and deficiency, for this kind of body is, as it were, only a failed attempt
                by nature to produce that immortal ideal body. (I:448; cf. I:360–61)</quote>
                
                Thus we should not think of the realization of Günderrode’s idea of the earth as an
                organism in the ordinary sense. Although the comparison to an organism and
                Günderrode’s emphasis on the increase of “life” through the progressive forms of its
                realization suggest that this realization would be some kind of living being, it is
                characterized most essentially by an identity of form and essence or body and
                thought. Günderrode makes this point explicitly: “This perfect unity of essence and
                form cannot be achieved in <hi rend="italic">separation</hi> and multiplicity 
                . . .  because the essence can only be one but the forms are various” (I:448).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In “Letters of Two Friends,” the
                            passage reads: “This perfect sameness of inner essence and form cannot,
                            it seems to me, be achieved in a multiplicity of forms. The essence of
                            the earth is only one, therefore its form may also only be one”
                            (I:360).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Günderrode also explicitly claims to be uncertain about whether this ultimate
                organism, that is, the realization of the idea of the earth, can or will ever in
                fact emerge: 
                
                <quote> I do not assert whether the earth will be altogether successful in organizing itself
                immortally like this; there may be a disproportion of essence and form in its primal
                elements that always hinders it from this; and perhaps the totality of our whole
                solar system is needed to resolve the task of such an equilibrium of essence and
                form, and perhaps even this does not suffice for it and it is a task for the entire
                universe. (I:448)<note place="foot" resp="author">In “Letters of Two Friends,” the phrase “is
                                needed to resolve the task of such an equilibrium of essence and
                                form” is replaced with “is needed to bring about this equilibrium”
                                (I:361).</note>
                     </quote>
      
                This statement is significant for a number of reasons, including its suggestion that
                the earth may itself form part of a larger organism such as the solar system or the
                universe (at another point, Günderrode refers to “the realized idea of the earth (or
                of the universe)” [I:449]), and the claim that a “disproportion of form and essence”
                may exist among the elements that constitute the earth. There is not space to
                explore the latter claim here, but the question of the role and status of the
                “earth” in Günderrode’s thought is considered below.</p>
                  <p> The picture that emerges from “Idea of the Earth” and “Letters of Two Friends” is of
                a world in which human beings are not profoundly different in kind from other
                entities, including objects we usually think of as inanimate. Instead, human beings
                are formed of the same basic building blocks (elements) as everything else in
                nature, and exist on a continuum of liveliness or animation with these other beings.
                Günderrode’s basic metaphysical picture therefore leaves space to imagine ways of
                relating to nature, or the nonhuman world, in non-oppositional terms. </p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Perfection versus Exploitation</head>
                  <p> Günderrode’s emphasis on increasing life or animation through the death and
                regeneration of finite beings works against the idea that the human characteristic
                of mind or consciousness is something that sets human beings apart from nature.
                Günderrode is not trying to explain how two disparate factors—essence or mind (or
                soul) and form or body—come to be joined; rather, she presents mind and
                consciousness as emerging within the material world. In other words, these occur on
                a continuum with aspects of the world that we usually think of as lacking
                consciousness. Günderrode explains this non-duality in the opening lines of “Idea of
                the Earth”:
                
            <quote>The earth is a realized idea, one that is simultaneously effective (force) and
                effected (appearance). It is thus a unity of soul and body, of which we call the
                pole of its activity that it turns outward extension, form, body; the one it turns
                inwards intension, essence, force, soul. Now, as the whole of the earth only exists
                through this unification of soul and body, so, too, the individual and smallest
                things only exist through it and cannot be conceived as split in two, for an outer
                without an inner, an essence without form, a force without some sort of effect, is
                not comprehensible. (I:446)<note place="foot" resp="author"> This passage is omitted from “Letters of Two Friends.”</note>
                     </quote>
                
                Similarly to Schelling, for Günderrode opposites are not originally separate; rather, they are
                dual aspects or poles of a single thing. This applies to the dualities we think of
                as essence and form and as mind or soul and body: at root, these are one, like the
                inside and outside of a single thing, and their full manifestation requires their
                complete commensurability. Thus, as we saw above, for Günderrode the fully realized
                idea of the earth is not one in which mind predominates over body, but a state of
                equilibrium in which these fully penetrate each other: “where all body would also at
                the same time be thought, all thinking at the same time body.”</p>
                  <p> Günderrode does imagine a role for human beings in the development of consciousness,
                and therefore in the emergence of mind or soul in material. However, we have to
                search outside “Idea of the Earth” and “Letters” to find support for this claim and
                for the application of Günderrode’s metaphysics to her ideas on social
                relationships. Like most of Günderrode’s work, “Story of a Brahmin” is consistent
                with the metaphysical picture presented in “Idea of the Earth” and “Letters,”
                although the language is more religious and less philosophical than in these other
                pieces. This is perhaps partly because “Story of a Brahmin” was published in 1803,
                before Günderrode’s detailed engagement with <hi rend="italic">Bruno</hi>; this fact
                should also warn against reading Günderrode’s work as too derivative of Schelling,
                despite the overt similarities between their work. Günderrode seems to have adapted
                Schelling’s ideas to fit a philosophical system that she was already in the process
                of developing when she encountered his thought.</p>
                  <p> In “Story of a Brahmin,” Günderrode claims that the development of “consciousness and
                thought” from bare matter through human beings and beyond is part of a process of
                increasing perfection and individuation that will ultimately allow the things of the
                world to be unified with what she calls, among other things, the “primal force”
                (Urkraft):
                
            <quote>[The Brahmin] taught me how in each part of the infinite spirit of nature lies the
                aptitude for eternal perfection, how the forces wander through all forms until they
                develop consciousness and thought in human beings; how from human beings on an
                infinite series of migrations that lead to ever higher perfection await souls; how
                eventually, through mysterious ways, they will all unite with the primal force from
                which they emanated and will become one with it, and still at the same time remain
                themselves, and thus unite the divinity and universality of the creator with the
                individuality of the creature. (I:312)</quote>
                
            As well as indicating that Günderrode views consciousness as developing within the
                material world, this passage helps clarify the claim in “Idea of the Earth” and
                “Letters” that “the idea of the Indians of the transmigration of souls corresponds
                to this opinion.” Günderrode views the dissolution of finite beings and their
                reconstitution in new forms as a kind of reincarnation. Human beings and their minds
                are not the unique pinnacle of existence but one form among many in a series that
                develops through and beyond human beings towards closer connection with the divine.
                According to Günderrode, human beings are not the ultimate or even penultimate form
                in this sequence but simply one stage of the development of the soul.</p>
                  <p> The idea that human beings are part of a development of the world to consciousness
                and/or towards the divine or the absolute is, of course, not unique to Günderrode.
                In this, she draws not only on Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, but also on work by her
                contemporaries and predecessors, including Schelling, Fichte, and the Early German
                Romantics. However, unlike many European philosophers, Günderrode draws the
                implication from siting consciousness within the world and developing within it that
                the nonhuman world should not be viewed as inert or as available for human
                exploitation. </p>
                  <p>The view of the nonhuman world as material that could or should be worked on by human
                beings, especially through the use of their reason, was widespread at the time
                Günderrode was writing (as well as before and since). For example, in
                    <hi rend="italic">The Vocation of Man</hi> Fichte states:
                
            <quote>Nature must gradually enter a condition which allows one to calculate and reckon
                safely on its regular pace, and which keeps its force steady in a definite relation
                with the power which is destined to control it — the power of man . . . 
                Cultivated lands shall animate and moderate the inert and hostile atmosphere of
                primeval forests, deserts, and swamps . . . [H]uman power, enlightened and
                armed by its discoveries, shall control [nature] without effort and peacefully
                maintain any conquest once it is
                made. (Fichte 83, trans. Preuss) </quote>
                
            In this passage, Fichte construes the natural world as “inert” and human beings as
                “destined” to “control” nature through the use of their reason. We can find similar
                claims by others, for example Herder (IV:239). Even Novalis and Schlegel, famously
                concerned with transforming Fichte’s “not-I” into a “you” (Novalis III:430), have
                been criticized for viewing the nonhuman world as something to be appropriated, or
                at least worked on and shaped, by a creative subject (Pnevmonidou 273–75; Roetzel
                370). </p>
                  <p> For Günderrode, by contrast, although human beings have a place in the development of
                both consciousness and the earth, their role is neither to master the nonhuman nor
                to shape it. Instead, human beings are part of nature and can work on themselves as
                part of nature’s internal movement towards perfection. In “Idea of the Earth” and
                “Letters,” we saw how this occurs through the enhancement or increase of life during
                periods when the elements are organized into living beings, including human
                beings: as Günderrode writes in these pieces, “each mortal gives back to the earth a
                raised, more developed elemental life.” </p>
                  <p> The narrator of “Story of a Brahmin” elaborates on the idea of the self-development
                of the individual within a developing whole:
                
            <quote>The philosophy that considers every individual as a means for the whole has now
                become hateful to me, [the philosophy] that always asks what use this or that is
                for the others and considers each as a fruit that has bloomed and ripened in order
                to be consumed by the whole; that plants the most various natures in one garden, and
                wants to grow the oak and the rose according to one standard. To me each individual
                is holy, it is God’s work, it is its own purpose. If it becomes what it can become
                according to its nature, then it has done enough, and what it profits the others is
                a side issue . . . Yes, a time of perfection must come, when each being will
                be harmonious with itself and with the others, when they flow into each other and
                become one in a great unison, when every melody throws itself into the eternal
                harmony. 
                
                
                Just like health, preservation, propagation are the highest for merely animal life,
                humanity [<hi rend="italic">Humanität</hi>] in the broadest sense of the word
                (according to which it also includes morality and culture) is the highest for human
                beings as human beings; as such, they have humankind [<hi rend="italic">Menschheit</hi>] as their object. Their pure relationship to it, morality,
                consists in itself, satisfies itself, and needs no other motive nor prospects than
                itself and humankind . . . Thus the human being lives in a threefold way:
                animally—this is its relation to earth; humanly [<hi rend="italic">menschlich</hi>]—this is its relationship to humankind; spiritually—this is its
                relationship to the infinite, divine. Whoever does not live in these three ways has
                a gap in their existence, and something is missing in their aptitudes.
                (I:310–311) </quote>
                
            In this passage, Günderrode emphasizes the intrinsic, non-instrumental value of all
                living (and, on the basis of “Idea of the Earth” and “Letters,” also non-living)
                things. On Günderrode’s model, while human beings are part of the development and
                perfecting of nature, their role is not to master the world, nor to cultivate or
                perfect it from a position of dominance (or even stewardship), but, rather, to be
                human (and animal) and to develop a relationship to the infinite. The harmony that
                the narrator of “Story of a Brahmin” claims will (hopefully) characterize the
                end-state of the world is not imposed on or cultivated in nature by human beings
                but, if it emerges, will do so through the full self-expression of each of the parts
                within it, including human beings. </p>
                  <p> One of the most striking characteristics of this model is its normative restraint:
                the project facing human beings is one of self-cultivation, not cultivation of
                others, whether human or nonhuman. Nonetheless, Günderrode clearly imagines this
                self-cultivation of the individual as part of a self-cultivation of the whole,
                capable of contributing to an enhanced and harmonious outcome. The last section of
                this paper explores the nature of this harmony and the means by which Günderrode
                believes certain kinds of human and nonhuman relationships can foster it. First,
                however, the next section investigates the “threefold way” of human life that
                Günderrode describes in “Story of a Brahmin” and the differences this reveals
                between Günderrode’s account and models that associate human beings uniquely with
                consciousness and spirituality.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Being Human </head>
                  <p> In the passage quoted above, Günderrode aligns the animal side of human nature with
                “relationship to (the) earth” (<hi rend="italic">Verhältniß zur Erde</hi>); the
                human side with “relation to humankind” (<hi rend="italic">Beziehung zur
                    Menschheit</hi>); and the spiritual side with “relation to the infinite, divine”
                    (<hi rend="italic">Beziehung zum Unendlichen, Göttlichen</hi>). Günderrode says
                the least about the animal side of human nature, and this section therefore
                considers her claims about the relationship of human beings to “humankind” and “the
                infinite” first, before returning to the animal side of human nature and its
                relationship to “earth.”</p>
                  <p> In the above passage, Günderrode claims that the human aspect of being human
                essentially involves, or essentially <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, relationship to
                other human beings — to humanity as a whole. As humans, she states, human beings “have
                humanity as their object.” She also aligns the human aspect of being human with
                morality (<hi rend="italic">Sittlichkeit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Moralität</hi>—she seems to use these terms interchangeably). To Günderrode,
                therefore, morality is specifically something that governs the relations of human
                beings to each other — in other words, morality does not apply to human
                relationships with “the earth” or with “the infinite, divine.” </p>
                  <p> Nonetheless, both of the latter relationships are also important on Günderrode’s
                account, as she describes in “Story of a Brahmin.” After turning from a worldly life
                of trade and pleasure, the narrator of this piece first engages in moral thought
                (I:305) before realizing that participation in the moral world cannot satisfy him:
                
            <quote>The struggle . . . of the individual with society, of freedom against freedom,
                of singularity against general laws, and of morals against their impediments,
                stopped occupying and tormenting me so much. For a long time it had already been
                clear to me that justice is the basis of civil society and morality the basis of
                human society. These two relations had once satisfied me; I had sought to bring all
                the points of my mind into contact with them. Now I discovered aptitudes within me
                that these finite relations would no longer satisfy. (I:307–8)</quote>
                
            The speaker claims that whereas social relationships are based on justice (in the
                case of “civil society”) or morality (in the case of “human society”),<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    There is not space here to explore the relationship between Günderrode’s ideas of “civil society” and “human society,” 
                    and Günderrode does not expand on her interpretation of these concepts. Günderrode was familiar with Kant’s moral thought 
                    and these categories may map on to Kant’s distinction between juridico-civil (<hi rend="italic">rechtlich-bürgerliche</hi>) society and ethico-civil (
                            <hi rend="italic">ethisch-bürgerliche</hi>) or ethical (<hi rend="italic">ethische</hi>)
                                society (Kant I.6:94). Whether or not this is the case, Günderrode
                                here marks a distinction between relationships between human beings
                                that are governed by different kinds of principles: on the one hand,
                                rules or laws, perhaps like those in the institutions of the
                                nation-state and, on the other, moral ideals of how individuals
                                should behave towards each other.</note> these matters
                do not exhaust the needs of human beings. In other words, not only is the mundane
                and materialistic business of everyday life not sufficient for a full human
                existence but neither is the moral life. </p>
                  <p> Günderrode’s account presents morality as unrelated to the spiritual side of human
                beings, that is, their relationship to the infinite. Her narrator explains that
                the aptitudes he has discovered within himself need connection with the infinite,
                which Günderrode situates beyond the “finite relations” of morals and human society.
                Her narrator identifies this infinite with “the spirit of nature”:
                
            <quote>My . . . appetite [sought] an infinite object for its striving; and my inner
                sense intimated an invisible and mysterious connection with something that I did not
                yet know, and to which I would gladly have given a shape and name. . . . In
                this longing, in this love the spirit of nature spoke to me. . . . The more I
                listened to it, the clearer it was to me that there was a fundamental force in which
                everything, visible and invisible, was connected. I named this force primal life,
                and sought to bring my consciousness into connection with it (for a mysterious and
                unknown descent from it seemed certain to me). (I:308)</quote>
                
            Günderrode’s narrator explicitly connects this kind of spiritual relationship with
                religion (I:309). He also explicitly
                <hi rend="italic">disconnects </hi>religion from morality,
                which, he emphasizes, belongs to the human realm and not the realm of
                the spiritual: “Anyone who needs some sort of religion as a buttress to their
                morality, their morality is not pure, for according to its nature this must consist
                in itself. Thus a human being can do without religion and, considered merely as a
                human being, does not attain its prospects in religion’s territory” (I:310).</p>
                  <p> The infinite with which Günderrode’s narrator seeks a relationship, and which he
                claims all the world’s religions attempt to disclose (I:309), does not correspond to
                what is peculiarly human in human beings, i.e. their moral and civic relations to
                other human beings. Instead, Günderrode’s narrator aligns this infinite/divine with
                the spirit of nature or “primal life” (<hi rend="italic">Urleben</hi>). This is the
                “fundamental force” (<hi rend="italic">Grundkraft</hi>) that connects everything
                that exists and from which the individual human being has emerged. This is, he
                claims, “an infinite force, an eternal life, that is everything that is, that was
                and will become, that engenders itself in mysterious ways, that remains eternal
                during all change and dying. It is at the same time the ground of all things and the
                things themselves, the condition and the conditioned, the creator and the creature”
                (I:309). </p>
                  <p> The references to this infinite as “life” and “force,” as well as the claim that it
                underlies and runs through all things, connect the infinite “ground” of “Story of a
                Brahmin” to the “All” that Günderrode describes in “Idea of the Earth” and
                “Letters.” In “Letters,” Günderrode explicitly associates the whole, or the “All,”
                with nature, asking, “What does it mean, that from the All of nature [<hi rend="italic">Allheit der Natur</hi>] a being cuts itself loose with such
                consciousness, and feels torn off from it?” (I:359). Thus, notwithstanding
                terminological differences, Günderrode articulates the same idea in all three
                pieces, i.e. that of an eternal, living whole that manifests itself in every
                aspect of the world. In “Story of a Brahmin,” Günderrode emphasizes the importance
                of cultivating a relationship to this “infinite spirit of nature” (<hi rend="italic">unendlicher Naturgeist</hi>) (I:312) or (as she calls it in “Idea of the Earth”
                and “Letters”) the “earth-spirit” (<hi rend="italic">Erdgeist</hi>) (I:360, 447,
                448).</p>
                  <p> The above points speak in favor of interpreting the terms “life,” “spirit of
                    nature,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Günderrode treats the
                            term “nature” as roughly synonymous with “spirit of nature,” i.e.that
                            is, not (like “earth”) to describe our world of finite entities, but to
                            refer to the infinite process that underlies it (i.e., like “spirit of
                            earth” or “earth essence”). For example: , in “Letters” the author
                            writes that “infinite nature will always reveal itself anew in infinite
                            time” (I:356; see also I:350, 355); in “Idea of the Earth,” Günderrode
                            claims that ordinary bodies are “a failed attempt by nature to produce
                            that immortal ideal body” (I:448); in “Story of a Brahmin,” the Brahmin
                            says as he is dying: “I would like to . . .  […] breathe my spirit
                            silently back into silent nature” (I:313); and in “Idea of Nature,”
                            Günderrode writes: , “Nature is an eternal activity, a self producing
                            product, an ever enduring becoming” (II:398). </note> and
                “earth-spirit” (as well as several other terms including “essence of the earth,”
                “god of the earth,” and “the infinite”) as fulfilling the same function in
                Günderrode’s philosophy. All these terms refer to a single principle or force
                running through the beings and processes of our world.</p>
                  <p> In some cases, Günderrode seems to attribute a narrower scope to the spirit or
                essence of the “earth” than to “life,” “spirit of nature,” or “the infinite.” The
                latter terms encompass the force, principle or spirit that is unfolding in the
                entire universe — in everything that exists. By contrast, at some points when
                Günderrode talks about “earth” she clearly means planet Earth, for example when she
                states that the idea of the earth may not be realizable by the Earth alone but may
                require the solar system or the entire universe (I:361, 448) or when she mentions
                “the realized idea of the earth (or of the universe)” (I:449). However, Günderrode
                also uses the terms <hi rend="italic">earth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">earthly</hi> (<hi rend="italic">irdisch</hi>) to mean “mundane” or “worldly,”
                referring to all aspects of the world we experience in ordinary life - that is, to
                what might be called “this life” (as opposed to any idea of a “beyond” or a
                “hereafter”). For example, in “Story of a Brahmin” she refers to “everything on
                earth” (I:305) and the narrator claims “I had already been on earth a long time”
                (I:304; see also I:306, 308, 355, 356, 358). In this usage, the meaning of <hi rend="italic">earth</hi> is expanded to include all aspects of ordinary
                existence, and is therefore similar to the meaning Günderrode ascribes to <hi rend="italic">world</hi> and <hi rend="italic">universe</hi>. This expanded
                meaning of <hi rend="italic">earth</hi> to encompass a more general sense of the
                whole world explains why Günderrode’s use of the term “spirit of earth” generally
                corresponds to “spirit of nature,” “life,” “the infinite” and the other terms she
                uses to describe the underlying principle or force that is manifested in the beings
                of the finite world. </p>
                  <p> This ambivalence is likely related to Günderrode’s stated uncertainty about whether
                the generative force underlying the succession of finite beings in the world is one
                that realizes itself in the Earth alone or in all the processes of the universe.
                This uncertainty causes her to shift back and forth between descriptions of a spirit
                or essence of earth and an infinite spirit or principle of life and nature in
                general. The association of the “idea of the earth” with Platonic ideas may also
                contribute to the confusion. Günderrode’s model does not include a realm of ideas,
                and she uses the notion of the “idea of the earth” as a regulative ideal rather than
                as an idea, archetype, or primal form such as we might find in the work of Goethe or
                Humboldt or in Schelling’s <hi rend="italic">Bruno</hi>. But the origins of the term
                    <hi rend="italic">Idee der Erde</hi> in Anselm’s Platonic account of the ideas
                in <hi rend="italic">Bruno</hi> may have brought with it some associations of an
                “archetypal nature” in which the ideas of finite things within the universe persist
                in a perfect form. For instance, Anselm claims that “The created earth . . . is
                not the true earth, but only an image of the earth which is uncreated, unoriginated,
                and never to pass away” (Schelling 125, trans. Vater). This is quite a different
                concept from Günderrode’s notion of “idea of the earth,” which is indeed a perfect
                and enduring entity but one that, if it ever appears, will be generated from the
                existing earth that we know and, furthermore, will emerge through the ordinary
                processes of temporal existence.</p>
                  <p> Despite the above complication, in general, we can take the terms “life,” “spirit of
                earth,” “spirit of nature,” “the infinite” etc. as they appear in Günderrode’s work
                to all refer to the same basic concept of a single principle or force that underlies
                the beings and processes of our world (whether we focus on the planet Earth alone or
                on the entire universe). On the other hand, the “idea of the earth” or “idea of
                nature” refers to something different. As Günderrode explains, unlike the
                “earth-spirit,” which is the living, generative, original, and infinite ground of
                the world we know, the idea of the earth is the putative end-point of the process of
                generation and re-generation: it is the “collective organism” in which “all body
                would also at the same time be thought, all thinking at the same time body, and a
                truly transfigured body, without lack or illness and immortal, and thus wholly
                different from what we call body or material” (I:448).</p>
                  <p> In the unpublished fragment “the true idea of materialism,” Günderrode uses
                different terminology that supports this point. In this piece, she explains that
                matter “is simple, unchangeable, eternal,” which “contains all things,” and she
                adds: “that through which they are all one is matter, while that through which they
                are different and separated from each other is their form” (II:404). “Matter” itself
                is yet another name for what Günderrode here calls the “principle of all forms” (<hi rend="italic">Prinzip aller Formen</hi>), “worldsoul,” and the “reality of the
                absolute” (<hi rend="italic">Würklichkeit des Absoluten</hi>) (II:405). </p>
                  <p> Günderrode contrasts this “principle of all forms” with something she calls the
                “totality of all forms” (<hi rend="italic">Totalität aller Formen</hi>). These terms
                correspond, respectively, to her later terms “spirit/essence of earth” and “idea of
                the earth,” as should be clear from the following quote, in which Günderrode again
                uses the analogy of the organism as the closest approximation to this totality that
                we can imagine. She writes that the “true essence [of finite things] eternally seeks
                the eternal and absolute form, which it would only find in the totality of all
                forms, i.e., at the end of all evolutions of the principle of form [<hi rend="italic">Formprinzip</hi>] . . . The organic body, the most complete
                synthesis of form and essence, thinking and being, spirit and body, is its most
                similar copy” (II:405–6).</p>
                  <p> The contrast between the “principle of all forms” and the “totality of all forms” (or
                the “spirit of earth” and the “idea of the earth,” or the “spirit of nature” and the
                “idea of nature,” etc.) is between the underlying driving force, principle, and
                unifying single origin of all the entities in our world (or, in other words, the
                fundamental process that is ongoing in these entities) and the end-point of this
                process in a single, perfectly balanced, and harmonious organism. </p>
                  <p> The relationship to the infinite/divine that Günderrode describes as part of human
                existence in “Story of a Brahmin” is a relationship to the first of these factors:
                to the infinite “spirit” of earth or nature. The idea of the earth, on the other
                hand—as explained in more detail below—is a projected end-state that human beings
                can work towards and begin to realize, especially through new forms of
                community.</p>
                  <p> There is a third term in this relationship: the “earth” itself. It is this term that
                Günderrode associates with the third and last aspect of being human described in
                “Story of a Brahmin”: the animal. While spirituality depends on a relationship to
                the infinite “life,” “nature,” or “earth-spirit” that exists in all things, the
                animal aspect of being human is the human being’s “relation to (the) earth.” In
                “Story of a Brahmin,” the narrator states that “health, preservation, propagation
                are the highest for merely animal life,” indicating that the animal aspect should be
                understood as a straightforward orientation to natural and bodily processes. This
                kind of relationship differs from the altered orientation to these processes that is
                experienced in the relationship to the infinite, self-producing force that underlies
                and inhabits them (i.e., the “earth-spirit”). In other words, the animal “relation
                to earth” is qualitatively different to the spiritual relation to the “earth-spirit”
                or the “essence of the earth”—that is, the emotional and intuitive experience of
                connectedness to the principle of life that runs through natural phenomena. </p>
                  <p>In some respects, this model reflects ideas current in German philosophy at the time
                Günderrode was writing. For example, Novalis calls for a change in how human beings
                relate to the things of the world, including natural forms, that involves perceiving
                the single divine spirit within them (Novalis I:79; II:454 #93, 461 #112, 594 #316).
                In <hi rend="italic">Bruno</hi>, Schelling describes a similar infinitude that can
                only manifest itself in finite forms, which are therefore necessarily incommensurate
                to it but that reflect this infinity in the unfolding of the whole in infinite time
                (Schelling 151). And Fichte describes human beings as combining characteristics of
                plants, animals, and a specifically human trait of thought, spirituality, or
                consciousness (Fichte 12).</p>
                  <p> However, as we saw above, unlike these philosophers Günderrode explicitly separates
                what is specifically human in human existence from spirituality and spirituality
                from consciousness and thought as well as from morality. Being human means,
                essentially, being moral, and this has no connection to either “earth” or the
                “earth-spirit” / “the infinite, divine.” Notably, Günderrode’s model also
                de-emphasizes the “human” aspect of human existence within the trifold structure
                described above. The development of a higher, spiritual relationship to the spirit
                of the earth does not seem to require a human element or human relationships at all
                but only a shift in how the animal relates to the earth or environment in which it
                is embedded. That is, this relationship requires a transition from relating to the
                beings and processes of the world in terms of their function for the animal’s
                survival and procreation, to a deeper connection with these beings and processes as
                reflecting an eternal life flowing through them all. Although it might be difficult
                to imagine how this would take place without a cognitive shift, at no point does
                Günderrode claim that it is through consciousness or human activity in particular
                that this shift takes place and a spiritual relationship develops. In fact, in
                places, she explicitly contrasts the revelation of an individual’s connection to the
                infinite with intellectual investigations, whether scientific or moral (I:49, 81–82,
                309; see Kastinger Riley 110). Rather, as we saw in the first section of this paper,
                Günderrode claims that all manifestations of “life” in finite entities have the
                potential to increase the liveliness of the whole, and hence contribute to its
                development. Thus for Günderrode, while human beings can certainly contribute to a
                raised, enhanced, and more animated universe by living and by developing themselves,
                they do this in essentially the same way as any other being.</p>
                  <p> Despite this decentering of what is specifically human in human existence, Günderrode
                in fact views certain kinds of human relationships as an important part of the
                process of the development of the world towards its ideal, that is, towards the idea
                of the earth. In order to understand this, we must turn to Günderrode’s idea of
                harmony and attempt to understand the role of this idea within her cosmology and her
                social thought.</p>

                  <head>Community</head>
                  <p> Several commentators have associated Günderrode’s emphasis on relationship to the
                infinite with a turn inwards and away from social relationships (Bohrer “Identität”
                79; Christmann 119; Dormann 14, 240). In the first place, this overlooks the fact
                that the infinite, for Günderrode, is not a purely spiritual absolute, but the
                unfolding of nature or life itself, including in human beings. At worst, then, this
                would involve a turn to nature, understood in this new and deeper way, rather than a
                turn towards an ineffable absolute — in other words, it would not be a form of
                “self-annihilation” or “disintegration in infinite space” (Nees 264; Borchardt and
                Wright 254). This turn to nature might perhaps be conceived of as similar to the
                turn that Bohrer attributes to Günderrode’s friend Clemens Brentano, which he
                criticizes for its basis in a view of personal experiences as incommunicable and
                social interactions as necessarily insincere (<hi rend="italic">Der romantische
                    Brief</hi> 120). </p>
                  <p> There is some support for this interpretation of Günderrode’s writing. On his way to
                understanding the true nature of existence, the narrator of “Story of a Brahmin”
                tells his listener that “I wrested myself away from all relations with human beings”
                (I:306), after which he enjoyed a contemplative life in the countryside. His
                interlocutor complains that this self-isolation, if adopted by many people, would
                destroy “human society” (<hi rend="italic">menschliche Gesellschaft</hi>), and the
                narrator (Almor) agrees: “I can, Lubar interrupted the storyteller, call this step
                good as little as I can suicide. Both are equally detrimental to human society, and
                what would become of [society], if everyone were allowed to kill themselves for it?
                / Young friend! responded Almor, not everyone can and will do what I did. It does
                not befit everyone” (I:307). </p>
                  <p> However, Almor does not remain in isolation for long, and the claims that Günderrode
                advocates a turn inward overlooks the new kinds of relationships and communities
                that she indicates are fostered by an altered relationship to the infinite. In
                “Story of a Brahmin,” the narrator explains that an old Brahmin “taught me how a
                community exists between human beings in whom the inner sense has arisen and the
                worldspirit” (I:312). It would be possible to interpret this statement as claiming
                that an individual who has become aware of the inner connections between things
                enjoys a sense of communion with the infinite, without necessarily entering into any
                kind of community with other human beings. However, the context suggests that
                Günderrode means that a community exists between those who understand these inner
                connections as well as between these individuals and what the Brahmin calls the
                worldspirit. The “wrest[ing] away from all relations with human beings” is only a
                stage the narrator passes through on his way to finding a true community—one that
                not only includes a closer relationship to the nonhuman world and the spirit that
                lies behind it but also involves especially close connections with other human
                beings. </p>
                  <p> For example, the narrator of “Story of a Brahmin” describes a community of priests
                into whose secrets he must be initiated in order to understand his intimations of
                infinitude (I:312). One of these priests has such a close connection to the Brahmin
                that he senses when the old man is dying. The narrator is, furthermore, telling his
                story to an interlocutor, Lubar, who is himself seeking initiation. And, at the end
                of the piece, the narrator has found his own community: he lives with the Brahmin’s
                daughter, accompanied by palm trees, a stream, and the immortal spirit of the
                Brahmin. </p>
                  <p> In other pieces, too, Günderrode indicates that an ideal community is formed: (1) on
                the basis of a relation to the infinite/divine; (2) outside the institutions of
                civil society or the state (see Licher “Du mußt Dich” 30;
                <hi rend="italic">Mein Leben </hi>49); and (3) outside a
                built-up environment, in proximity to the natural world. For instance, in <hi rend="italic">Muhammad, the Prophet of Mecca</hi>, Muhammad is banished from
                Mecca with his followers, during which period he appears as a wise and resourceful
                leader, guided by his faith, which he shares with his companions. After their
                conquest of Mecca and return to the city, his tyrannical impulses emerge, and some
                of the most sympathetic characters in the piece lament his domination of other
                people (I:193, 197; see Licher,
                <hi rend="italic">Mein Leben </hi>187–88). In other words, the
                ideal community created in the wilderness is lost when Muhammad founds a state with
                himself as its ruler.</p>
                  <p> In keeping with Günderrode’s normative restraint, she presents Muhammad’s autocracy
                towards the end of the play as both wrongful and antithetical to the good community.
                As noted above, Günderrode denies that the world is improved by mastering others,
                whether human or nonhuman. The earth cannot be cultivated through the action of some
                parts on others but must develop organically through the natural self-development
                of all its individual parts. </p>
                  <p> However, that does not mean that this self-development must occur in isolation.
                Günderrode is clear that friendship, love, and connections to others — including
                nonhuman others—are important to the emergence of a harmonious, organic whole. In
                the first place, this can involve sharing knowledge of the divine that underlies the
                everyday world we experience. In <hi rend="italic">Prophet of Mecca</hi>, Muhammad
                claims he will “inject” or “inoculate” the earth with a branch from “the tree of
                divine blessedness” (I:157), while the narrator of “Story of a Brahmin” describes
                the Brahmin as “a true priest, a mediator between God and human beings” (I:312). But
                this is not the most fundamental way that relationships between human beings can
                contribute to the development of the earth towards its organic end-point, as we can
                see if we return to Günderrode’s basic metaphysical picture. </p>
                  <p> In the first section of this paper, we saw that, on Günderrode’s model,
                entities are formed of constellations of elements that break apart as creatures die
                (or objects break down) and are then reformed into new entities. We also saw that,
                in this process, the elements, and through them the whole, become more animated,
                more alive. In “Idea of the Earth,” Günderrode claims that this process is driven by
                the dual factors of “struggle” (<hi rend="italic">Kampf</hi>) or “exercise” (<hi rend="italic">Übung</hi>) and “laws of affinity” (<hi rend="italic">Gesezen der
                    Verwantschaft</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]):
                
            <quote>When a person is dead, their mixture returns to the substance of the earth, but
                that within them that we called force, activity, or rather that of its materials in
                which the more active pole predominated, reverts to that which is related to it in
                the earth; the coarser elements likewise seek what is similar to them according to
                laws of affinity. But these elements have become different, after they have been
                forced up to life in the organism, than they were before they entered into this
                organic connection. They have become livelier, and increase the earth’s life in
                returning to the earth, like two who have hardened their strength in long struggle
                are stronger when the struggle has ended than they were before. The elements are
                like this, for they are alive, and the living force strengthens itself in every
                exercise. (I:447; cf. I:359)</quote>
                
            The first factor, struggle, explains how the elements become more animated over time
                (i.e., through their exercise, including in struggle with each other). The second
                factor, affinity—which Günderrode elsewhere refers to as “harmony” (<hi rend="italic">Harmonie</hi>) and “something homogenous” (<hi rend="italic">etwas
                    Homogenes</hi>) (I:33, 34)—explains not only the law according to which elements
                combine to form new entities but also love, friendship, and other feelings of
                connection that human beings experience with each other (and, perhaps, towards other
                beings). In the philosophical dialogue “The Manes,” the teacher explains: “As surely
                as all harmonious things are connected in a certain way, whether they are visible or
                invisible, just as surely we, too, are connected with <hi rend="italic">that
                    part</hi> of the spiritual world that harmonizes with us” (I:33).</p>
                  <p> The teacher adds that this connection is not destroyed by the death of individuals:
                “The death of a person connected with me in this way does not cancel out this
                connection. Death is a chemical process, a separation of forces, but no annihilator:
                it does not tear the bond between me and similar souls” (I:33). On this account, the
                characteristics of a dead person that harmonize with those of someone living
                continue to live on in the latter. This point underlies the deathbed scene in “Story
                of a Brahmin,” where the Brahmin anticipates continued life in Almor’s life with his
                daughter: “Live with her and tell her of me; I would like to live on in her love.
                You, Almor, farewell; I will not die for you because my spirit continues to have an
                effect in you” (I:313). This also explains why Almor’s community includes not just
                himself and the Brahmin’s daughter but also the dead Brahmin himself: the Brahmin
                has become part of them, surviving in the ways he has influenced them. Importantly,
                this model also applies to nonhuman entities, even inanimate beings, as well as
                humans. If a human being experiences a sense of affinity with nonhuman aspects of
                the world, this can be explained on the same basis as feelings of affinity between
                human beings: as an indication of harmony or homogeneity between them. For this
                reason, it is not surprising that Almor’s description of his community at the end of
                “Story of a Brahmin” includes not only the Brahmin’s daughter and the dead Brahmin
                but also a tree and a spring.</p>
                  <p> Günderrode’s claim that the dead live on in the living is meant literally: The
                ability to experience real connections with the dead, as well as nonhuman and even
                inanimate things (“those things whose life resembles death”), is underpinned by the
                metaphysical picture outlined above. According to Günderrode, after a person’s
                death, “their mixture returns to the substance of the earth,” after which it is
                divided up and re-assembled, together with other elements, to form new entities.
                Thus, in “Letters,” the writer, saddened by the thought of being separated from
                Eusebio by death, claims that “I consoled myself that our befriended elements,
                obeying the laws of attraction, would find each other even in infinite space and
                join with each other” (I:358; see also I:68). </p>
                  <p> A major implication of this model is that the “homogenous” elements in two people, or
                two beings of any kind, that harmonize with each other can join together after death
                according to the “laws of affinity” to create new, more harmonious forms of life
                (see, e.g., I:325). Consequently, the constitution of new entities out of the same
                elements according to laws of affinity should gradually contribute to a more
                harmonious world—and potentially to the harmonious, organic unity that Günderrode
                calls “the realized idea of the earth” (I:449). We saw above that, in “Story of a
                Brahmin,” the narrator claims that “a time of perfection must come, when each being
                will be harmonious with itself and with the others, when they flow into each other
                and become one.” The cultivation of friendships and other forms of connection to
                (human and nonhuman) others, as well as self-cultivation in order to be more capable
                of forming these connections, is the means by which the beings of the world can
                gradually come together into a harmonious whole.</p>
                  <p> Günderrode’s ideal for community is based on connections between individuals and
                includes connections with aspects of the world beyond the human — that is, both
                nonhuman entities and the universal principle, spirit, force, or life that is
                manifested in every finite being. This form of community cannot be imposed on people
                or things, for example through laws or institutions, educational systems, or methods
                for controlling, shaping, or cultivating the natural world. This community is
                instead bound by feelings of affinity, friendship, and love, and, if it grows, can
                only do so organically, as individuals develop to have more in common with each
                other. This growth of an ideal community—or of several, for there is no reason why
                these harmonies could not develop in several places at once and then converge (see
                Licher “Du mußt Dich” 31) — creates a gradual movement towards a more harmonious
                whole. In other words, by working on oneself in this kind of community of connected
                beings — that is, in developing together a deeper, shared connection to each other
                and to the infinite, productive “spirit of nature” that runs through all things
                — individuals cultivate themselves and thereby the earth, whose elements they are
                made of. In so doing, they not only increase their own “liveliness,” “animation,” or
                “spirit,” but begin to join together into the interconnected parts of the ultimate
                organism that would constitute the final order of the earth.</p>

                  <head>Concluding Remarks on Günderrode and Political Ecology</head>
                  <p>Despite its strong commitments to literary and philosophical tropes of its day,
                Günderrode’s account of human nature and of communities that include both humans and
                the nonhuman is not as outlandish or outdated as it might at first appear. We accept
                the principle of the conservation of mass, as well as the idea that human beings,
                like everything else, are made up of smaller elements—chemical and mineral
                substances and, beyond these, atoms, which are themselves comprised of protons,
                neutrons, and electrons carrying an electric charge. And we know that, upon our
                death, just like with the destruction of other living and non-living entities, these
                elements will decompose and go on to participate in different forms of life. What we
                find hard to accept is the idea that mind, awareness, experience, soul, or
                life—whatever we want to call our sense of ourselves as unique living
                beings—attaches to these atoms, sub-atomic particles, forces, or, in Günderrode’s
                terminology, “elements.” </p>
                  <p> But this is precisely where Günderrode’s account provides resources for rethinking
                our relationship, not just to the nonhuman things of the world but to each other
                and, ultimately, ourselves. In the first place, this is due to Günderrode’s denial
                that consciousness is something different to or outside the material world, or even
                a special and unique force within the material world that attaches to human beings
                alone. On Günderrode’s account, consciousness is present from the beginning in all
                parts of nature, in the elements that make up our world. As she writes in “Idea of
                the Earth,” “the life-principle in the elements is immortal; it requires only
                contact and connection again like before and new life blossoms with all the blooms
                that we call thought and sensation and organism and body and soul.” On Günderrode’s
                account, human beings are unique not because they are conscious but because of
                their specific orientation to “humanity” in their social and moral lives—and, she is
                clear, this is not sufficient for the good life. Günderrode’s account reveals the
                human overcommitment to the idea that we are special because of our consciousness,
                as well as to the idea that this gives us some kind of unique role in the world,
                even — historically in Europe and many forms of Christianity — a special relationship to
                the divine.</p>
                  <p> However, it must be admitted that, even if we can imagine consciousness in nonhuman
                animals, and, perhaps, plants, most of us find it a stretch to imagine consciousness
                attaching to inorganic objects such as rocks and certainly to atoms or forces.
                Nonetheless, if we focus on the importance of changing how we imagine the things
                around (and within) us, rather than on the attempt to develop an ironclad
                metaphysics, Günderrode’s rethinking of the relationship between humanity and
                consciousness or spirituality, as well as of the role of humans as moral beings and
                <hi rend="italic">vis-à-vis </hi>the development of our world,
                provides resources for efforts to rethink our relationship to nature. This may be
                particularly valuable in light of the current environmental crisis. The roots of the
                ongoing human-caused devastation of our world in an attitude of human exceptionalism
                and human domination is often noted in the environmental literature (e.g., Dallmayr
                1; Pattberg 1, 6), as is the need for new ways of conceiving of ourselves in
                relation to the nonhuman (Dallmayr 2; Schulz 133). As Jane Bennett remarks in <hi rend="italic">Vibrant Matter</hi>, “the image of dead or thoroughly
                instrumentalized matter feeds human hubris and our earth-destroying fantasies of
                conquest and consumption. It does so by preventing us from detecting (seeing,
                hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling) a fuller range of the nonhuman powers
                circulating around and within human bodies” (ix). In light of the serious, ongoing
                consequences of viewing non-living things as inert and unfeeling, a metaphysics that
                rejects this view is at least worth exploring. </p>
                  <p>Bennett views the task of her book, not as proving the agentic or conscious
                properties of matter but as a partly rhetorical strategy for inducing a less
                destructive orientation to nature in human beings, a task that she describes as both
                ontological and political:
                
            <quote>(1) To paint a positive ontology of vibrant matter, which stretches received
                concepts of agency, action, and freedom sometimes to the breaking point; (2) to
                dissipate the onto-theological binaries of life/matter, human/animal,
                will/determination, and organic/inorganic using arguments and other rhetorical means
                to induce in human bodies an aesthetic-affective openness to material vitality; and
                (3) to sketch a style of political analysis that can better account for the
                contributions of nonhuman actants. (x)</quote>
                
                This is a task to which Günderrode’s ontology, and the account of human sociality
                that she situates within it, can contribute. Günderrode’s emphasis on the intrinsic
                value of all entities, including human beings, works against an instrumentalizing
                view of nature as well as against totalizing social or political discourses that
                attempt to improve the world through imposing certain ways of being on (human and
                nonhuman) others. Together with the ideal of harmony, this provides both a goal that
                we can work towards and a valuable modesty about the extent to which we can bring it
                about.</p>

                  <p> Once various scientific societies and associations began to debate the use of the
                term “Anthropocene” as a geological time period on the same scale as the Holocene,
                what seemed to register was the paradox of a “shock of the new” that had been long
                prepared. However one dates the start of this period, it was as if an event had
                overtaken the “Anthropos” from behind, as if what was “new” in the “Anthropo”- cene
                (the “cene” deriving from the Greek “kainos” for “new”) had emerged suddenly in the
                present as a forgotten archaism, making it difficult to say exactly when the
                catastrophe began or to anticipate how it might end. This shock has launched a
                further set of reactions, from “new materialisms” to renewed attention to
                alternative cosmologies, in an attempt to have thought measure up to the seemingly
                unprecedented nature of the event we call the Anthropocene, and to mark the ways in
                which our current coordinates, concepts and concerns are no longer adequate to think
                it, much less to respond to its exigency. This in turn has proliferated a kind of
                post-mortem on a whole series of philosophemes or concepts deemed too complicit with
                the crisis. Bruno Latour’s <hi rend="italic">Politics of Nature</hi>, for
                instance, argues for a final liquidation of the main concept in its title — Nature —
                since it has authorized a whole set of power relations grounded on a constitutive
                exclusion. The notion of a “nature” separate from the “social,” for Latour,
                underpins a politics without due process for those elements of the collective
                (non-humans of various kinds, including non-human homo sapiens) whose externality to
                the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> withdraws them from the domain of the political
                itself. </p>
                  <p> From Timothy Morton’s notion of the “mesh”<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a full development of this term, see
                            Timothy Morton, “Thinking Big” in <hi rend="italic">The Ecological
                                Thought</hi>, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2010,
                        20-–58.</note> to Latour’s conception of “multi-naturalism” or the
                    “pluriverse,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Though this term is used in various places in
                            Latour, he develops it in the most detail in the first chapter of <hi rend="italic">Philosophy Politics of Nature</hi>, (titled “Why
                            Political Ecology Has to Let Go of Nature”), 9-–52.</note> the concept of the Anthropocene opens up a
                world of inextricable relation and intertwinement. Just as there is no “human”
                independent of the various forms of life on which it depends (bacterial or
                otherwise), so there is no “pure nature” devoid of humanity’s intervention. A new
                political ecology comes to replace, or at least supercede, political economy.
                However, it is precisely the question of the nature of the “collectivity” that lies
                on the hither side of this “death of nature” that this paper will interrogate. The
                “common world,” of which Latour speaks in <hi rend="italic">Politics of
                Nature</hi>, (drawing on his conception of actor-network theory) has as its
                explicit focus the notion that “humans and non-humans are engaged in a history that
                should render their separation impossible” (“Promise” 39). The result, for Latour,
                is a new form of collectivity, one predicated not on the model of the “one,”
                necessarily, but certainly on the absence of the two, the absence of a unitary
                border between nature and culture, human and non-human, etc. </p>
                  <p> What must be questioned, however, is exactly how one interprets the “death of nature”
                upon which Latour’s work is predicated. What exactly one means by it seems to
                alter the kind and nature of the intertwinements, and therefore the contours of the
                political ecology, that are grounded on it. What if the “death of nature” called
                for by Latour, Phillipe Descola, and others were an insufficient starting point for
                articulating the kind of collectivity capable of responding to the event or crisis
                of the Anthropocene? What if the “mesh,” the “pluriverse,” and all the other various
                names for this collectivity were threatened by something akin to what Jean-Luc
                Nancy, referencing Marx, calls the “equivalence of catastrophes,” where so-called
                “natural” disasters such as hurricanes and floods can no longer rigorously be
                distinguished from man-made disasters such as Fukushima. As Nancy insists, that very
                equivalence, and the totality of interdependences that constitute it, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the catastrophe itself, which acts as the limit condition
                against which any rethinking of collectivity or, to use Nancy’s term, any “communism
                of nonequivalence” (41) would have to be measured. As Frédéric Neyrat
                argues in <hi rend="italic">La Part Inconstructible de la Terre</hi> (The
                Inconstructible Part of the Earth),<note place="foot" resp="author"> Frédéric Neyrat,
                            <hi rend="italic">La Part Inconstructible de la Terre, </hi>Paris:
                            Seuil, 2016. This text was recently translated by Drew S. Burk as
                            Frédéric Neyrat, <hi rend="italic">The Unconstructible Earth</hi>
                            (trans. Drew S. Burk) New York: Fordham University Press, 2019.
                            Henceforth cited in text as (N) and, followed by French and then
                            English pagination.</note> the “death” of nature is far from a
                recent event; it has in fact occurred repeatedly in the history of the West. Neyrat
                names at least four deaths of nature (there are likely more), including the
                pre-Socratics’ transformation of nature into substance, monotheism’s conversion of
                nature into the medium through which God expresses his commandments, the
                    seventeenth century’s mechanization,
                quantification, and mathematization of nature, and our own current global
                financialization of nature into a tradeable resource (197–204; 108–12). If “Nature”
                has been dying for some time now, then its most recent entombment is perhaps more
                ambiguous than Latour admits, and correlatively, so is the new collectivity that
                emerges as a result.</p>
                  <p> One particular form that “death of nature” takes is in the increasing interest in
                the motif of the “Earth” in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as
                both irreducible to the natural world opened up by science, and to the world
                conceived either as the secular realm distinct from God’s kingdom, or as the arena
                of Man’s (or humanity’s) self-production. This motif emerges in several different
                contexts in the period in response to both the development of natural science and
                to the progressive reliance on natural right as the cornerstone for a reinvention of
                the political. It tends to enact a disorganization of the coordinates that define
                both the natural world “out there” as well as the politics of nature that underwrite
                social contract theory and other modern conceptions of political sovereignty. The
                Earth comes to signify something — a basic ground of the political — that remains
                irreducible to nature but also to any political theology or cosmology that would
                reduce it either to a particular place within the human “world” or to a sublunary
                natural “human habitat.” “The Earth,” rather, comes to stand in for an exteriority
                to the nature/culture divide that cannot be appropriated by any politics dependent
                on that distinction, and it begins to call into question the models of sovereignty,
                of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, and of nature that depend on it. Of the many
                Romantic-era writers that explicitly treat “the Earth” as a fundamental theme, it is
                arguably Friedrich Hölderlin who most explicitly places this motif at the heart of
                his poetics and thought. The motif of “the Earth” materializes in his work at nearly
                every juncture: when he articulates the structure and aim of poetry itself, when he
                articulates the specificity of modernity in relation to classical Greece, and when
                he attempts to articulate the specificity of the “world” that modernity enacts in
                contrast to the one it purports to leave behind. In each case, as I will argue, what
                is at stake is the development of a (poetic) political ecology, one that treats the
                Earth as the in-appropriable ground of poetry and politics and thus as an <hi rend="italic">event</hi> that undermines traditional forms of sovereignty,
                whether these take the form of the unified lyric voice or the form of the
                privileging of the human as the political actor par excellence. </p>
                  <p> Focus on the question of the role of the Earth in Hölderlin has tended by and large
                to be filtered through Heidegger’s appropriation of the concept for his own
                conception of the “fourfold.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> One of the first articulations of this distinction
                            is to be found in Martin Heidegger, “The Origin of the Work of Art” in
                                <hi rend="italic">Off the Beaten Track</hi>, (ed. Julian Young and
                            Kenneth Haynes) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002: 1-–56.
                            Henceforth cited in text as (WA) followed by the English translation).
                            This initially bipartite division is then later developed by Heidegger
                            into the notion of the “fourfold,” the play of revealing/concealing
                            between Earth, world, divinities, and mortals. For a close and detailed
                            reading of this development in Heidegger, see Andrew Mitchell’s, <hi rend="italic">The Fourfold</hi>, Evanston: Northwestern University
                            Press, 2015. </note> Whereas Heidegger positions the Earth in
                terms of the interplay between revealing and concealing, Hölderlin’s own interest in
                the motif of the Earth is centered instead on its
                <hi rend="italic">irreducibility </hi>to a given world or a
                given conception of nature. Heidegger effectively dismisses the notion that
                Hölderlin’s poetry is concerned with nature. When the word does occur in Hölderlin’s
                writings, Heidegger almost always emphasizes the extent to which it must be
                understood in its “original” Greek sense as <hi rend="italic">physis</hi>: the
                appearing of what is. Lacoue-Labarthe, by contrast, interprets the motif of the
                Earth in Hölderlin according to its opposition to (political) theology, suggesting
                that its significance has to do with Hölderlin’s renunciation of the divine and
                with what Lacoue-Labarthe calls the “caesura of the speculative” (208). Yet what
                both of these interpretations never quite arrive at is the question of how
                Hölderlin’s poetry specifically addresses what it means that “poetically, man dwells on this
                Earth” (Poems, 789) since this “dwelling” is not an origin or birthplace but a series of
                different interactions with something that remains irreducible either to “nature” or
                to phenomenality itself. Heidegger gives this Hölderlinian phrase a
                specific interpretation that emphasizes the way poetry makes the Earth a “dwelling”
                and the way language is the “house of Being”; poetry, in his interpretation, is what
                makes the dwelling a “home.” Hölderlin’s emphasis, however, is on the way “dwelling
                on this Earth” impacts the relation between poetry and the Earth. In other words,
                Heidegger’s emphasis on the poetic as the site of dwelling is reversed in Hölderlin;
                it is “dwelling on the Earth”—exposure to an irreducible, unappropriable
                externality— that produces the poetics. It is precisely because man
                “dwells” on the Earth that the variety of different representations of nature and of
                the Earth itself becomes possible. Hölderlin’s poetics, in short, does not
                presume a return to a native land. Instead, his poems articulate a <hi rend="italic">dürftiger-zeit</hi> or “between time” that marks a transition between two
                different forms of dwelling in, on, or with the Earth, developing what Carl Schmitt
                might call a new “nomos” of the Earth, provided that term does not mean a
                form of law created by the appropriation of land. Hölderlin develops a poetics that
                is itself “appropriated” by the Earth, that is, exposed to its irreducibility to
                representation or its being encapsulated within a schema in which it becomes an
                object or a foundation. We move from the Earth conceived as the realm
                of “nature” to something far stranger: Hölderlin’s Earth articulates a
                quasi-Latourian “death of nature” but only by assuming this death as a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> rather than as something that must be enacted.
                One can only call this a “political ecology” on the condition that the “<hi rend="italic">eco</hi>” derived from “<hi rend="italic">oikos</hi>” and
                designating a “home,” “habitat,” or “dwelling” is understood in relation to what
                Frédéric Neyrat calls an “ecology of separation,” (N 237-320; 133-177), which
                designates, among other things, the <hi rend="italic">withdrawal</hi> of the Earth
                from the status of an object into something more akin to an event or a trajectory.
                That withdrawal in turn not only destabilizes any sense of “dwelling” predicated on
                a shared belonging (to Being, say) but also invokes a poetics of the Earth no
                longer grounded on the nature/culture divide.</p>
                  <p> Hölderlin develops the motif of the Earth throughout his oeuvre, but the clearest
                tie between this motif and his conception of poetry is to be found in his difficult
                prose texts. These texts at once lay out the structures implicit in his poetics as
                well as define how the specificity of those structures relate to key thematics
                within his poetry, including the motif of the Earth. In “On the Difference of Poetic Modes,” for instance, the notion of the Earth is
                coupled with Hölderlin’s development of the idea of “alternating poetic tones,”
                which he claims characterizes not just his own but all forms of 
                poetic expression (<hi rend="italic">Essays and Letters</hi>).
                For Hölderlin, what distinguishes different genres are not their external forms but
                the relationship between what he calls their “underlying tone” (<hi rend="italic">Grundton</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bedeutung</hi>, a work’s significance or
                meaning) and its mode of presentation or <hi rend="italic">Darstellung</hi>. This
                relation varies from work to work, but it also varies <hi rend="italic">within</hi>
                each work through an internal oscillation of tone and presentation that never
                arrives at what one might call their “alignment.” In fact, as anyone reading
                Hölderlin’s prose can attest, this alternation appears to take the form of an
                interminable oscillation between two poles of an opposition, in what Lacoue-Labarthe
                has identified as the quasi-Heideggerian logic of <hi rend="italic">Ent-Fernung</hi>
                (231), a kind of hyperbolic logic of excess that takes the form of “the more x it
                is, the more y it is,” the closer it is, the more distant, the more interior it is,
                the more exterior and so on. </p>
                  <p> This logic comes into play, among other places, in his description of the interplay
                of tone and presentation in poetry, which oscillates between an underlying “tone”
                or mood and a form of presentation that in the end transforms that mood into its
                opposite. Regarding lyric poetry, for instance, Hölderlin writes: 
                
            <quote> In its basic mood (<hi rend="italic">Grundstimmung</hi>) the lyric poem is <hi rend="italic">more
                    sensuous</hi>, in that this
                [basic mood] contains a unity which lends itself most easily; precisely for that
                reason does it not strive in the outer appearance for reality, serenity and
                gracefulness; it evades the sensuous connection and presentation so much (because
                the pure basic tone (<hi rend="italic">Grundton</hi>) inclines precisely toward it)
                that it is rather miraculous in its formations and assembly of these. (<hi rend="italic">Essays and Letters</hi> 83)<note place="foot" resp="author"> Friedrich Hölderlin,

            The sentence continues, and as it does so, it passes through a series of further
                oscillations between tone and presentation. Yet the basic principle remains the same
                throughout its various permutations — the work’s very tendency toward one or another
                presentation or signification is the very means by which that tendency is refracted
                or displaced. The crucial aspect of this process is that the “basic mood” or <hi rend="italic">Grundton</hi> of a given poem is not refracted simply through the
                medium of its expression, as if tone and presentation were of different orders.
                Instead, the very “nature” of the “basic mood” overcomes itself, one might say, in a
                ceaseless oscillation, a continuous departure from itself.</p>

                  <p> What then, does this oscillation of poetic tones have to do with the Earth? Among
                the many forms of representation or “art character” that Hölderlin lists as
                characterizing a poem, one in particular is most pointedly associated with the
                tragic: what he calls the “idealistic image” (<hi rend="italic">idealischen Bilde</hi>) (PW 889; 1:83).
                In fact, it is not the content of a work that determines its genre but the
                oscillating interplay of a poem’s tone and presentation. “On the Difference of
                Poetic Modes” starts by providing a set of definitions: 
                
                <quote>"The lyric, in appearance idealistic poem, is naïve in its significance. It is a
                continuous metaphor of feeling. The epic, in appearance naïve poem, is heroic in its
                significance. It is the metaphor of great aspirations. The tragic, in appearance
                heroic poem, is idealistic in its significance. It is the metaphor of an
                intellectual intuition” (PW 889; 1:83). </quote>
                
                In each case, a poem’s presentation remains in a certain tension with its “basic
                mood,” yet the fact that the tragic form <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Schein</hi>)
                heroic, but is in fact “idealistic” in its significance (<hi rend="italic">Bedeutung</hi>), could be said
                to characterize a fundamental tension in much of Hölderlin’s poetics. That is, what
                first appears as a lament for the old gods, for a divine that has absconded, and as
                a reinvigorated desire for the invention of new god(s),<note place="foot" resp="author"> Martin Heidegger, “Only a God Can

                heroic representation instantiates a tragic return to an “Earth” that has begun to
                slip away from its moorings, its determination by a particular theological or
                ontological regime. In this moment, the opposition between the Earth and the divine
                ceases to operate, and a different understanding of the Earth comes to the fore, one
                predicated on its irreducibility to a given “world.” </p>
                  <p> Something of this irreducibility is in fact legible in the central tension between
                Earth and world found in Heidegger’s “Origin of the Work of Art” yet, as we will
                see, there remains an important divergence between Heidegger and Hölderin’s
                understanding of the relation between Earth and world. If, for Heidegger, the work
                of art is the “setting up of a world” (WA 170), this setting up occurs only against
                the backdrop of an Earth “sheltered” from this formation. Since neither animal nor
                plant “have” a world and are therefore deprived of a relation to beings <hi rend="italic">as such</hi>,<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a discussion of this dynamic, see Heidegger’s

                Heidegger is compelled to describe the specific “worldlessness” of stone, for
                example, in manifestly different terms, casting the Earth in the role of “that which
                comes forth and shelters”: “That into which the work sets itself back and which it
                causes to come forth in this setting back of itself we call the earth. Earth is that
                which comes forth and shelters . . . Upon the Earth and in it, historical man
                grounds his dwelling in the world” (WA 171-72). Heidegger here makes the Earth
                that which withdraws itself from the world. If animals are “poor in world,” the
                stone by contrast remains connected to a world only by its refusal of and by it. The
                stone’s “worldlessness” therefore pertains to its status as the “unconcealed,” as
                that which cannot be rendered by any form of measurement or calculation: “If we try
                to lay hold of the stone’s heaviness in another way, by placing the stone on a
                balance, we merely bring the heaviness into the form of a calculated weight. This
                perhaps very precise determination of the stone remains a number, but the weight’s
                burden has escaped us” (WA 172). The Earth, therefore, “shows itself only when it
                remains undisclosed and unexplained. Earth thus shatters every attempt to penetrate
                it” (WA 172). The setting forth of the Earth by the world is thus figured in
                Heidegger as a “strife” rather than an outright opposition; a strife that, moreover,
                functions as a metaphor for the movement of truth itself, the disclosure of the
                undisclosable in the movement of <hi rend="italic">aletheia</hi>, the simultaneous
                revealing and concealing that characterizes the “world” itself.</p>
                  <p> While Hölderlin’s conception of the relation of Earth and world clearly influenced
                Heidegger, his own interpretation of this relation nevertheless entails some crucial
                differences that do not allow the tension between Earth and world to unfold as “the
                intimacy of a simple belonging to one another” (WA 174). The main aspect of this
                difference pertains to the way Hölderlin weds the motif of the Earth to the
                unfolding oscillation of poetic tones. In other words, unlike for Heidegger, for
                whom poetics is more generally the “founding” of a world in the poetic word, which
                in turn “sets forth” what remains irreducible to that world (i.e. the Earth), for
                Hölderlin poetry remains caught in the continuous and irresolvable jointure of an
                oscillation between presentation and signification. This oscillation proves
                incapable of presenting the Earth as its hidden ground, as a single signification
                that presents itself through its absence, or as that which remains undisclosed
                “within” a given world, since any underlying signification is eventually overcome by
                yet another disjunction between presentation and signification without any single,
                unified sense emerging. In other words, the Earth’s non-disclosure, in Hölderlin, is
                no longer linked to a given “world” as its constitutive abandonment. Its emergence
                occurs as a result of an excessive striving for precisely its opposite: for the
                unearthly or for the divine. And the Earth “appears” in Hölderlin only as a result
                of that excess re-emerging as the irreducibility of the Earth to the “founding word”
                of the poet in a way neither the poet nor his poetry can fully account for.</p>
                  <p> These reflections are necessarily grounded in Hölderlin’s understanding of the
                relation between the productive capacities of poetry, and those of “nature,” since
                the latter provides the former with its most acute example of what it means to
                constitute a “world.” In one of Hölderlin’s earliest treatises, “The Ground for
                Empedocles” (in PW), he expressly takes up the question of the relation between art
                and nature in order to explain why his early play (<hi rend="italic">The Death of
                    Empedocles</hi>) is an attempt to overcome the opposition between art and nature
                as the mark of a genuinely modern form of tragedy. The opening of the treatise
                prefigures in many ways the “alternation of tones” theory that will become
                Hölderlin’s more explicit focus in “On the Difference of Poetic Modes,” since he
                describes his tragedy as proceeding through a variety of “tones” each of which is in
                tension with the “reflection” or “sensation” meant to depict it. What Hölderlin
                makes explicit, however, is that even though the “subject matter” of the tragedy is
                “foreign” to the world of the poet, the poet’s selection of this world as a “vessel”
                for his own is strictly “analogical.” That is, the poet’s world can only be
                reflected back to him and to others through the medium of the foreign (in this case,
                ancient Greek tragedy) because that world is precisely the converse of his own. A
                “modern” tragedy is possible only insofar as it engages Greek forms to articulate an
                entirely different content. In other words, something like the opposition between the Greeks and the Hesperians
                that Hölderlin describes in the December 4, 1801 letter to Böhlendorff appears to be
                operative here. To generate a form of art that is "the free use of one’s
                own" as Hölderlin insists in the letter, requires a relation to the foreign that
                refuses simple imitation (PW 150; 2:926). It must repeat the inimitable disjunction
                between tone and expression that characterizes all artforms and that leads the work
                of art to overcome its own conditions of possibility. Hölderlin insists: “We learn
                nothing with more difficulty than to freely use the national. And, I believe that it
                is precisely the clarity of the presentation that is so natural to us as is for the
                Greek the fire from heaven” (PW 149; 2:927). In other words, what is “natural”
                for the Greeks is “fire from heaven,” a sacred or ideal pathos that arises in
                connection with the divine. For us, we modern “Hesperians” it is the reverse; what
                is “inborn” for us is “clarity of presentation” (<hi rend="italic">die Klahrheit der Darstellung</hi>). And
                    <hi rend="italic">because</hi> each is “inborn,” it is precisely the opposite
                that ends up being “mastered.” The Greeks mastered sobriety or the “clarity of
                presentation” because what defined their world is “sacred pathos,” whereas for we
                Hesperians what comes most naturally is precisely that pathos, whereas what is most
                “their own” (the sobriety or the “clarity of presentation”) remains elusive for us. </p>
                  <p> In short, to return to the problematic central to “Ground for Empedocles,” the world
                of the modern poet, though heterogeneous to the “outward presentations”
                that define ancient tragedy, must nonetheless be located and seized hold of through
                an imitation of ancient tragedy. This takes place only by reproducing the inimitable
                disjunction between presentation and tone, between the “clarity of presentation” and
                “fire from heaven” that defined the Greeks. This must be done, in other words,
                without strict imitation, without the reproduction of the precise relationship
                between the two that defined the Greeks. Hence the reason why Hölderlin must turn to
                that most ancient of questions concerning the relation of art to nature: he’s not
                simply describing the imitation of nature by art but a more complicated
                process—demonstrating the way nature and art are already intertwined to the extent
                that they are both modes of presentation and, as a result, define the contours of a
                given “world” by the specific way in which those modes of presentation interact. For
                Hölderlin, there is no nature “over there” (to paraphrase Latour) that must be
                “represented” by art in order to accomplish itself in a kind of Aristotelian
                mimesis. Rather, art and nature form a unity governed by an internal tension similar
                to the tension inherent in the opposition between representation and tone in poetry.
                What constitutes a “world” for Hölderlin is not a “decision” about beings that
                allows them to appear as beings of a certain kind. There is only an attempt to
                encounter (poetically) a set of modes of presentation in tension with each other
                that make a given world possible, even if the exacerbation of those tensions
                demonstrates that the world they have formed is in a state of collapse.</p>
                  <p> Thus, while Hölderlin’s approach appears at first to mirror Aristotle’s conception of
                the imitation and completion of nature by art, this dialectic is in fact supplanted
                by something close to the internal oscillation described later in “On the Difference
                of Poetic Modes.” If, as Hölderlin puts in in “Ground for Empedocles”: “art is the
                blossom, the perfection of nature” (<hi rend="italic">Die Kunst ist die Blüte, die Vollendung der
                Natur</hi>) (PW 53; 2:116), this is so only because two different forms of production
                and organization come to vie with each other rather than reproduce one another.
                They form a “world” in and through their disjunction, a differentiation that both
                constitutes the relative unity of that “world” and its conditions of
                dissolution. To grasp this process poetically entails, for Hölderlin, the
                introduction of an important distinction found throughout his oeuvre: the
                distinction between “organic” (<hi rend="italic">organisch</hi>e) and “aorgic” (<hi rend="italic">aorgischen</hi>) principles. This opposition has given
                commentators some difficulty, especially since “aorgic” appears to be a Hölderlinian
                neologism. Veronique Foti asserts that the organic/aorgic opposition is
                simply another name for the <hi rend="italic">physis/techne</hi> distinction, which in turn becomes translated into the
                nature/culture divide. Yet, this doesn’t always seem to be the case. Though
                Hölderlin draws on Schelling’s opposition between <hi rend="italic">organisch </hi> and <hi rend="italic">anorganisch</hi>
                    principles, <note place="foot" resp="author"> This distinction is found throughout Schelling’s works on nature. For
                            a particularly focused discussion of it, see F. W. J. Schelling,

                distinction implies something more than a divergence between a purely natural and a
                purely non-natural organism or structure. </p>
                  <p> In fact, Hölderlin’s organic represents a tendency — in works of art as much as in
                “nature” — towards a more or less stable but regulated order. The aorgic, by
                contrast, marks a tendency toward dissolution and disorganization; the coming undone
                of a particular temporary equilibrium. Hölderlin first introduces these terms in
                “Ground for Empedocles” when he is attempting to describe the specificity of the
                “world” the titular character of his play — Empedocles — inhabits, claiming that, as
                with the particular relationship between art and nature that characterizes the
                Greeks, Empedocles’s world is defined by a precise dynamic between “organic” and
                “aorgic” principles: “The more organic, artistic man is the blossom of nature, the
                more aorgic nature, when it is sensed purely, by the purely organized, purely and
                uniquely formed man, affords him the feeling of perfection” (PW 53; 2:116–17).
                The dynamic between these two tendencies characterizes Empedocles’s world but also
                signals the overcoming of that world in their mutual antagonism—Hölderlin calls it
                the “highest hostility” (<hi rend="italic">der höchsten Feindseligkeit</hi>), which
                is also their “highest reconciliation” (<hi rend="italic">die höchste
                    Versöhnung</hi>) (PW 54; 2:118) — of their relation. He conceives of his own
                play, in a sense, as nothing but the unfolding of this tension, exemplified by the
                death of Empedocles. </p>
                  <p> As with other oppositions in Hölderlin, however, the organic/aorgic opposition that
                defines Empedocles’s world exists only to produce a form of “becoming in
                dissolution” (<hi rend="italic">Weden im Vergehen</hi>),<note place="foot" resp="author">  This is also the title of an important essay by
                            Hölderlin, “Becoming in Dissolution” (PW 96-–100;
                        1:900-–905).</note> a form of self-overcoming where each side of
                the opposition transcends into its opposite. To avoid being abstract, in order for
                the opposition to become real, or “known” according to Hölderlin,
                
                <quote>it must present itself by separating itself in the excess of inwardness where the
                opposed principles interchange so that the organic, which surrendered itself too
                much to nature, and which forgot its essence, transcends into the extreme of
                autonomous activity, whereas nature, at least in its effects on reflective man,
                transcends into the extreme of the aorgic, the incomprehensible, the non-sensuous,
                the unformed, the unlimited. (PW 53; 2:117)</quote>
                
                In other words, what initially appeared on one side—defined organization and the
                regulated order of the world known as the organic — precisely in its desire for
                organization, “interchanges” with the aorgic (Hölderlin is careful not to use terms
                such as “sublation” that might treat this exchange as a dialectic) and thereby
                undoes itself and the opposition that defines it at the same time. There is no
                reconciliation between the organic and the aorgic, only a “uniting moment that
                dissolves more and more, like a phantasm” and which “reacts against the organic in
                aorgic manner, distances itself from it” (PW 43; 2:118). This moment
                fundamentally characterizes Empedocles’s belonging to his world which is in the
                process of dissolution. As Hölderlin insists, as a character, Empedocles embodies
                the contretemps between the organic and the aorgic and so “is a son of his heaven
                and his time, of his fatherland, a son of tremendous oppositions of nature and art
                in which the world appeared before his eyes” (PW 54; 2:118–19). As a result, he
                becomes a “victim of his time” (<hi rend="italic">ein Opfer seiner Zeit</hi>) (PW
                57; 2:121). Unable to reconcile the opposition between nature and art that
                governs the totality of the world to which he belongs, he becomes a necessary
                “sacrifice” that reveals, in his death, the death of his world: “[the destiny of his
                epoch] demanded a sacrifice where man in his entirety becomes real and visible as
                that wherein the destiny of his epoch seems to dissolve, where the extremes seem to
                unite truly and visibly in one but therefore are united too closely” (PW 56;
                2:121).</p>
                  <p> The oscillation between the organic and the aorgic functions both as that which
                defines the plot of <hi rend="italic">The Death of Empedocles</hi> and as that
                which forms Empedocles as a character by making him its archetype or figure. This
                oscillation also defines Empedocles’s “destiny.” But this form of destiny must be
                read in a thoroughly modern sense since it is not predicated on a particular
                cosmology—as it might be said to be in Sophocles, for example, in the relation
                between gods and mortals. Rather, Hölderlin imitates Greek tragedy in order to
                witness its self-overcoming, to pass through the foreign (the Greeks) and the
                collapse of “their” world, to the dissolution of our own. Perhaps this is why, once
                Hölderlin finally abandoned his play after three failed attempts to write it, the
                ending of the third and final attempt breaks off fragmentarily with the chorus
                proclaiming a “new world” that is simultaneously contrasted with the Earth:

            At the end of the play, in the concluding non-reconciliation between organic and
                aorgic that defines Empedocles’s “sacrifice,” we are left only with a heaven that
                has become an empty “brazen vault” and a world that has become nothing but
                “semblance” (<hi rend="italic">Schein</hi>). Far from a sacrifice that reconciles
                mortals with gods, Empedocles’s death merely gestures toward a newly reconfigured
                Earth, whose gifts “mock” those who remain, along with a world that has
                fundamentally been dissolved. In fact, Hölderlin’s notes for the continuation of the
                third version of the play describe Empedocles as “one in and through whom a world
                dissolves and in the same instant renews itself” (<hi rend="italic">in dem und durch den eine Welt
                sich zugleich auflöse und erneue </hi>) (DE 194; 2:154). In other words, <hi rend="italic">The Death of Empedocles</hi> ends at the moment of the dissolution
                of a given world (and its concomitant configuration of the Earth), without
                necessarily gesturing at what follows out of it. This is perhaps why “Ground for
                Empedocles” makes of the play’s final sacrifice a figure not of the “reconciliation”
                between opposing forces but of a fundamental separation — a separation figured
                by Empedocles himself: “He is destiny itself, only with the exception that the
                contending forces inside him are tied to a consciousness, to a point of separation
                (Scheidpunkt) which keeps them facing one another in a clear and controlled manner”
                (PW 61; 2:127).</p>

                    “Original Separation”</head>
                  <p> By the time Hölderlin had abandoned his own attempts to write a tragedy, and had
                begun the task of attempting to “translate” Sophocles’s <hi rend="italic">Oedipus
                    Rex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Antigone</hi>, writing his enigmatic prose
                “notes” to both plays, that “separation” had a more distinctive
                significance. It is removed, first of all, from the context of individual
                “consciousness” and transformed into a question not of the “world-forming”
                capacities of poetry but of its encounter with a reality for which it has no
                coordinates, no presentational or performative capacities. This pushes the “point of
                separation” (<hi rend="italic">Scheidpunkt</hi>) attested to in <hi rend="italic">Death of Empedocles</hi> toward an entirely different conception of the
                relation between world and Earth, this time one that is no longer structured by its
                association with the divine. The “real separation” (wirkliche Trennung) (PW 86;
                1:893) that emerges as a result is still due to the irreconcilable dynamic of the
                oscillation between order and dissolution, the organic and the aorgic. Yet, when
                Hölderlin presents this oscillation again in his description of the “alternation of
                tones” in “On the Difference of Poetic Modes,” a different conception of the Earth
                begins to emerge at the juncture of the “separation” or “caesura” that Hölderlin
                makes central to his reading of Sophocles. It becomes clear that his thinking about
                classic tragedy is intertwined with his own articulation of the purpose and
                structure of poetry more generally, insofar as it repeats the hyperbolic logic of
                inversion found in the organic/ aorgic dynamic. This time, however, the overall
                problematic concerns not just the conditions for a properly modern tragedy but the
                incongruities at work in poetry itself, specifically the way tone and expression are
                repeatedly differentiated and placed into tension. The basic organic/ aorgic
                distinction is, in a sense, built in to the opposition between tone and expression
                as well. An epic poem, for example, is initially characterized by a “naïve”
                expression, whereas its underlying tone is aorgic/heroic:
                
            <quote> The epic, in its outer appearance <hi rend="italic">naïve poem</hi>, in its <hi rend="italic">basic tone</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Grundton</hi>) the <hi rend="italic">more pathetic</hi>, heroic, aorgic one; hence it strives in its
                art-character not for energy, movement and life, but for precision, calmness and
                pictorial quality. The opposition between its basic tone and its art-character,
                between its proper and its improper, metaphorical tone is resolved in the idealistic
                where it neither loses so much life as in its narrowly delimiting art-character nor
                as much moderation as in the immediate expression of its basic tone. (PW 83–84;
                1:890).</quote>
                
            For Hölderlin, then, every poem progresses through a series of oppositions between
                tone and expression, by which it strives to define its “unity.” Again, the
                hyperbolic logic Hölderlin articulates in “Ground for Empedocles” is at work, except
                that it is not so clear that a “resolution” of that tension is possible, as it
                appears to be in the <hi rend="italic">death</hi> of Empedocles. In fact, this
                striving after some kind of unity between tone and expression leads only to what
                Hölderlin calls a “real separation” (<hi rend="italic">wiklichen Trennung</hi>): the
                poem’s turning away from any attempt to ultimately reconcile its internal
                oppositions. </p>
                  <p> It is precisely in this “real separation” that a second, more enigmatic, conception
                of the Earth materializes. “On the Difference of Poetic Modes” at first connects the
                “real separation” within the poem with a turning away of the gods: 
                
            <quote>And here, in the excess of spirit within unity, in its striving for materiality, in

                the ideal beginning of the real separation. (PW 85-86; 1:892-93) </quote>
                
            As in the <hi rend="italic">Death of Empedocles</hi>, the final “reconciliation” of
                the organic with the aorgic gives way to something irreducible to either. By calling
                this the “arbitrariness of Zeus,” Hölderlin is already invoking his difficult and
                enigmatic reading of Sophocles, in particular <hi rend="italic">Oedipus Rex</hi>,
                which focuses on the way that the play stages the “caesura” or turning away from the
                gods (i.e. a particular conception of the divine) and the concomitant notion of
                tragic fate that constitutes that “world.” In the context of his meditation on
                poetry, what matters is how the “real separation” manifests itself in the poem as
                the internal tension of the opposed tendencies toward form and dissolution, until
                that very tension culminates in a return to the “real” or as Hölderlin will later
                assert, the “original” separation between the organic and the aorgic. The “new
                unity” that the internal oppositions engender in poetry is merely the “ideal”
                version of the “real separation.” Yet it prefigures what Hölderlin calls the
                “striving of the divisible,” by which he means that the initially “ideal” separation
                between organic and aorgic continues to develop in the poem “until the primordially
                separating has arrived at its total expression” (<hi rend="italic">bis das ursprünglich Trennende zu
                seiner völligen Äußerung gekommen ist </hi>) (PW 88; 1:896).</p>
                  <p> That “total expression” of the “primordially separating” Hölderlin goes on to name,
                simply, “the Earth.” Hölderlin’s “Notes to Antigone” elaborates the emergence of
                this motif by framing the “real separation” in terms of a “reversal” that occurs
                when Kreon and Antigone both simultaneously appeal to Zeus as a principle of divine
                order lying beyond the world of the living. Beginning with a meditation on the
                “calculable law” of “Antigone,” which once again entails the “successive modes
                through which representation, sensation and reason develop according to poetic
                logic” (PW 109; 2:452), Hölderlin focuses on the moment in the play that
                “interrupts” this logic and introduces something irreducible to the succession of
                representations. This interruption happens at the moment both characters appeal to
                the same authority to justify their actions, which effectively makes it the crux of
                the play for Hölderlin. The appeals by Kreon and Antigone do not involve the same
                principle, however. In each case, Zeus represents something different to each of
                them, even if structurally the appeal takes the same form insofar as the same
                “sacred name” (Zeus) is used to designate a “highest,” an ultimate authority or <hi rend="italic">arche</hi>. For Kreon, Zeus represents the traditional form of
                divine authority. In the case of Antigone, however, Zeus’s divine status is
                immediately inverted into its opposite and given an earthward turn. Zeus is
                presented as the “father of time or: father of earth, for it is his character,
                opposing the eternal tendency, to reverse the striving from this world to the other
                into a striving from another world to this one” (<hi rend="italic">“Vater der Zeit oder: Vater der
                Erde, weil sein Charakter ist, der ewigen Tendenz entgegen, das Streben aus dieser
                Welt in die andre zu kehren zu einem Streben au seiner andern Welt in diese</hi>) (PW
                112; 2:454). In other words, Antigone’s appeal is initially understood in
                classical terms as a reversal of the striving for transcendence and for a stable
                organic law (in Hölderlin’s sense) to a reversal that grounds that law in a
                strictly temporal order, the “golden stream of becoming” (<hi rend="italic">das goldenströmende
                Werden</hi>) to cite Hölderlin’s somewhat odd translation of Sophocles
                (PW 112; 2:454). Zeus, as with the fatal discordance between the organic and the
                aorgic found in “On the Difference of Poetic Modes,” constitutes here another
                example of the inversion of extremes at work in Hölderlin generally: the more divine he is,
                the more terrestrial, and this inversion organizes both the structure of the play
                and its denouement: 
                
                <quote>“Once, that which characterizes the Antitheos, where someone, in the sense of god,
                acts as if against god and recognizes the spirit of the highest as lawless. Then the
                pious fear of destiny, thus the praise of god as something preordained. This is the
                spirit of the two impartially contrasted opposites in the chorus. Antigone acting
                more in the first sense. Kreon in the second” (PW 112; 2:455). </quote>
                
                Whereas Kreon relates to Zeus as the representative of the divine and of tragic
                destiny, Antigone’s appeal to Zeus as an “Antitheos” is in opposition to his
                divinity, emphasizing instead his “lawlessness.” This presents a stark
                contrast between Kreon, for whom Zeus is the organizing principle of the world, and
                Antigone, for whom Zeus represents an aorgic disorder, a divine that has
                fundamentally absconded and which, as a result, “reverses” the desire for a
                transcendent order, turning a striving for the beyond into a return to the “Earth.”
                This “Earth,” in the context of this tragic agon of the play, emerges in opposition
                to the divine as the return to a world deprived of its center, deprived of the
                “heavenly” opposition that defines it. One could say that Hölderlin’s reading of
                Sophocles aligns itself here with Jean-Pierre Vernant and Pierre Vidal-Naquet’s
                suggestion that “the tragic universe lies between two worlds,” a past age of myth
                that was still present and the values of the new political order that emerge in and
                through the collapse of the world of myth (7). “The Earth” would thus appear to be a
                name for a political order no longer founded on theological structures. </p>
                  <p> However, in a further development of the motif of the Earth, Hölderlin makes clear
                that this reversal is not “ours”; it is not <hi rend="italic">we</hi> who are in the
                midst of this radical reversal that undoes an entire configuration of the world. The
                reversal from the divine to the Earth belongs essentially to the Greeks — it is what
                brings about the tragic end of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> world. For us, by
                contrast, we “Hesperians” or moderns for whom a “lack of destiny” is our essential
                attribute, the earthward turn must be understood differently; according to
                Hölderlin, our “Zeus” is anything but divine, and anything but a higher principle of
                order or justice: 
                
            <quote>For us, existing under the more real Zeus who not only stays between this earth and
                the ferocious world of the dead, but who also forces the eternally anti-human course
                of nature on its way to another world <hi rend="italic">more decidedly down onto
                    earth</hi>, and since this greatly changes the essential and patriotic
                representations, and since our poetry must be patriotic so that its themes are
                selected according to our world-view and their representations, for us, then, the
                Greek representations change insofar as it is their chief tendency to comprehend
                themselves. (PW 113; 2:456) </quote>
                
            Ripped from the opposition between the terrestrial and the heavenly, “our Zeus”
                abandons any reference to transcendence, to “another world”—even one that has been
                withdrawn. </p>
                  <p> This abandonment has a concomitant effect: the “Earth” to which it returns has become
                decidedly alien since it can no longer be defined in opposition to the divine. Our
                Zeus is a “god” in name only, who “forces the eternally anti-human course of nature
                on its way to another world <hi rend="italic">more decidedly down to Earth</hi>.”
                Here something other than the ever-present oscillating opposition between the
                organic and the aorgic comes into view. Having passed through the “foreign” that is
                ancient Greek tragedy, we arrive at something even more foreign: an Earthward turn
                that cannot be reduced either to the return to a mundane world separated from the
                divine nor to a conception of “nature” still dependent on that opposition. As
                Hölderlin makes clear, “our” Zeus forces nature toward a world even more “Earthly”
                than this other Earth whose significance still derives from the absence of the gods,
                and thus remains a withdrawal internal to that world. The “world” toward which our
                Zeus compels nature is a world no longer governed either by any relation to the
                divine or by the culture/nature division. While the translator, Thomas Pfau, uses
                the term “anti-human” here for <hi rend="italic">menschenfeindlichen</hi>, this word
                suggests something that is not just “anti-human” but also “inhuman,” a landscape
                without Man.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Jacques Derrida, in the “Ends of Man” describes this problematic as a

                “world” might be (if it is even still a world), its terrestrial status is certainly
                not yet a “dwelling,” since the natural world of the Greeks has been fundamentally
                overturned. </p>
                  <p> Hölderlin’s use of the term “patriotic” (<hi rend="italic">vaterländisch</hi>) to
                characterize the representations that follow from this transformation only heightens
                the sense of a complete disorientation brought about by his second reference to the
                Earth, since the <hi rend="italic">patria</hi>, the sense of home, belonging, or
                propriety suggested both by the word “patriotic” and the phrase “the more real Zeus”
                is left fundamentally without an object. Hölderlin simply insists that the second
                earthward turn of this Zeus necessitates a radical change in “the essential and
                patriotic representations” and that “our poetry must be patriotic so that its themes
                are selected according to our world-view and their representations,”
                without detailing how this actually takes place (PW 113; 2:456). His insistence on
                the possessive “our” serves only to reinforce the fact that “Zeus” and “our
                world-view” (<hi rend="italic">unserer Weltansicht</hi>) are themselves taken hold
                of, appropriated, by this other return to an Earth that leaves us without our
                bearings, without any sense of a “world” or cosmology through which to make sense of
                it. Hölderlin’s term “patriotic,” (<hi rend="italic">vaterlandische</hi>) then, does
                not refer to a “fatherland” or “native land” in the traditional sense of a
                geographic or spiritual space in which some collective sense of belonging, an “our”
                or “we,” might materialize. Rather, it refers to what remains after the “death” of
                nature and the extinction of the “world” specific to the Greeks — that is, it is
                what characterizes “we Hesperians” only on the condition that the “we” is not
                understood according to a shared belonging to a given world.</p>
                  <p> Hölderlin, however, goes on to claim that the “patriotic representations” that follow
                out of the forcing of “the eternally anti-human course of nature on its way to
                another world <hi rend="italic">more
                    decidedly down to Earth</hi>”
                results in a further development that, in fact, fundamentally unsettles poetry’s
                ability to “represent” or express “our world." Whereas the “nature” of the Greeks undergoes
                a “death” insofar as it is separated from the divine and therefore nature’s
                animation by otherworldy forces, “our” nature is figured as a complete reversal of
                    <hi rend="italic">all</hi> forms of representation in what Hölderlin calls a
                “patriotic reversal” (<hi rend="italic">ein vaterlandische Umkehr</hi>):
                
            <quote>For patriotic reversal is the reversal of all modes and forms of representation.
                However, an absolute reversal of these, as indeed a complete reversal altogether
                without any point of rest is forbidden for man as a knowing being. And in patriotic
                reversal where the entire form of things changes, and where nature and necessity,
                which always remain, incline toward another form—be it that they transcend into
                chaos or into a new form—in such a change everything that is necessary favors the
                change. (PW 114-1–15; 2:457)</quote>
                
            This “patriotic reversal” does not entail another “representation” of the Earth, but
                the “reversal of all modes and forms of representation” tout court. What we witness,
                according to Hölderlin, is not just a “death” of nature but its fundamental
                transformation into either “chaos” (which the translator offers for <hi rend="italic">Wildnis</hi> which implies not just formlessness but rather
                something not-yet formed)—or simply “another form” (<hi rend="italic">andern
                    Gestalt</hi>). What this other Earthward turn therefore invokes is not simply a
                nature already bereft of any relation to the divine or to Man but one that begins
                to escape the space of representation altogether, of any pre-given Gestalt. The fact
                that this <hi rend="italic">other</hi> nature, which “inclines toward another form”
                even as it threatens to undo every form and representation that attempts to
                configure it, is at once inhuman and a process (it is a <hi rend="italic">course</hi> of nature—a <hi rend="italic">Naturgang</hi>), a tendency rather
                than an object or totality of objects, is not immaterial. It suggests that what characterizes “eternally
                inhuman nature” for Hölderlin are processes that outstrip each other, where
                tendencies toward order (the organic) are immediately generative of a disorder (the
                aorgic) or an entropy that is hardly in any dialectical relation to the stable
                system it disrupts. To put this in more contemporary terms, one could say that
                Nature consists of an excess to the various systems — technological, agricultural,
                scientific, moral, political, and so on — that attempt to delimit it and that by doing
                so unwittingly generate the very “aorgic” disorder found within it. Hölderlin’s
                Earth is, put simply, without any exteriority, while simultaneously an excess of
                potentialities that no system, technical or living, artificial or organic, can
                contain.</p>

                    “Homelessness,” World and Earth</head>
                  <p> Examining the extent to which Hölderlin’s conceptualization of the Earth shapes his
                poetics would require a longer discussion of the way his late hymns and river poems
                    (<hi rend="italic">Der Rhine</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Der Ister</hi> in particular) take up the organic/aorgic divide
                and the “patriotic reversal” that his prose works describe. Hölderlin’s assertion
                that a “complete reversal altogether without any point of rest is forbidden for man
                as a knowing being” suggests that, despite its complete reversal of “all modes and
                forms of representation,” poetry does in fact bear witness to the “real separation”
                between Earth and world. The question, of course, is how. Heidegger’s seminars on
                Hölderlin’s hymns<note place="foot" resp="author"> Heidegger taught several seminars on Hölderlin,
                            each one focused on a reading of a river poem. See Martin Heidegger, <hi rend="italic">Hölderlin’s Hymn “Germania” and

                claims that these poems are not only about poetic production but also historicity,
                the “becoming historical” of a people and the way in which the “fatherland” comes
                to be interpreted as “Being itself,” out of which the “fundamental orientation
                towards beings as a whole arises and attains its configuration.” (Hölderlin’s <hi rend="italic"> Hymn “Germania” </hi>109).
                In other words, Heidegger repeatedly insists on the extent to which Hölderlin’s
                “patriotic reversal” entails a reconfiguration of world and Earth, between the
                “orientation towards beings as a whole” that defines the world and the Earth’s
                self-concealment. While it is certainly the case that Hölderlin’s late hymns
                articulate, as Heidegger insists, a form of “poetic dwelling,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> See
                            Heidegger, “Poetically Man Dwells” in <hi rend="italic">Poetry,
                                Language, Thought</hi> 215.</note> it is not clear that anything like
                    <hi rend="italic">Dasein</hi> or its “world-forming” capacities are involved.
                The river poems treat the earthward turn described in Hölderlin’s prose works by
                following his theory of the alternation of tones, identifying that alternation with
                the movement of the river itself. The fact that his poems repeat something like the
                “real separation” Hölderlin discusses in his prose works should problematize any
                claims that his poetry concerns itself primarily with the withdrawal of the divine.
                Put another way, whereas Heidegger identifies the rivers with the poet as a
                “demi-god” situated in the time between the absence of the old gods and the arrival
                of the new, Hölderlin’s poetics actually articulates instead a fundamental break
                between the poet and the river, marking each as subject to a completely different
                temporality. Whereas Hölderlin identifies his poetry initially with a backward
                glance toward a conception of the Earth in mourning for a world that no longer
                exists, the river’s silence and forward movement in fact denote a disjunction
                between that conception and its own itinerary, which constitutes a reversal of the
                “forms and representations” that make up that world. And yet, since a “complete
                reversal” of those “modes and forms of representation” is impossible, the poem
                nonetheless bears witness to this break in and through the language of that
                    world.</p>
                  <p> While a full analysis of the relation between Hölderlin’s longer hymns and his
                conception of the Earth is not possible here, a quick perusal of one of his early
                odes — <hi rend="italic">Der Main</hi> — provides a sense of what is stake. Like his
                later hymns, <hi rend="italic">Der Main</hi> invokes a historical and geographical
                “journeying” on the Earth. It opens in what Hölderlin calls the “naïve” mood, where
                the speaker identifies his “song” with a longing for immediacy, in this case for an
                encounter with “other lands” that remain explicitly idealized:

                            137; Hölderlin,
                            <hi rend="italic">Sämtliche Werke und Briefe Volume </hi>1,
                            239–40. The poem will henceforth be cited in text as (M) followed by
                            line numbers.</note>
                        </l>
                     </lg>
                
           By the third stanza, this longing has singled out a specific locale — ancient Greece — as
                its focus:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l> O once I long to land there, on Sunium’s coast,</l>
                        <l> Once ask my way to your columns, Olympion, </l>
                        <l>Ach! Einmal dort an Suniums Küste möcht</l>
                        <l>Ich landen, deine Säulen, Olympion! (M 9-10)</l>
                     </lg>
                    
            Yet the poem thereby immediately shifts into the heroic tone once it recognizes the
                bygone status of this ancient world. Desiring to “land” at Sunium, which features
                several ruined temples including the temple of Zeus (the “Olympion”), the speaker
                wishes to witness its “columns” before it too is consigned to oblivion: 
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>And soon, before the northern gale can</l>
                        <l>Bury you too in the scattered rubble</l>
                        <l>Of temples Athens raised, and their imaged gods</l>
                        <l>For long now desolate you have you stood, O pride</l>
                        <l>Of worlds that are no more!</l>
                        <l>Erfragen, dort, noch eh der Nordsturm</l>
                        <l>Hin in den Schutt der Athenertempel</l>
                        <l>Und ihrer Götterbilder auch dich begräbt;</l>
                        <l>Denn lang schon einsam stehst du, o Stolz der Welt</l>
                        <l>Die nicht mer ist!— (M 11–15)</l>
                     </lg>
                    
            As the poem goes on to intimate, this very destruction of the “world” represented by
                the Greek temple is the condition for the emergence of the Earth, an even more
                radical “stranger” (<hi rend="italic">Fremden</hi>) in relation to the poet than the
                Greeks. The encounter with the “unbounded” Earth in the rubble of the divine leads
                the speaker to declare his own “homelessness”:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>To you, perhaps, you islands, yet one day shall</l>
                        <l> A homeless singer come; for he’s driven on</l>
                        <l>From stranger still to stranger, and the</l>
                        <l>Earth, the unbounded, alas, must serve him</l>
                        <l>In place of home and nation his whole life long</l>
                        <l>Zu euch vieleicht, ihr Inseln! geräth noch einst</l>
                        <l>Ein heimathloser Sänger; denn wander muß</l>
                        <l>Von Fremden er zu Fremden, und die</l>
                        <l>Erde, die freie, sie muß ja leider!</l>
                        <l>Statt Vaterlands ihm dienen, so lang er lebt (M 25–29).</l>
                     </lg>
                    
            The oscillation of tones, and the abrupt shift away from the poet’s focus on the gods
                as the object and source of his song, gradually destabilizes the ground beneath the
                speaker, disrupting any clear opposition between <hi rend="italic">Heim</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fremde</hi>, home and the strange (or foreign). Faced with the
                destruction of the temple of Zeus and the collapse of the world to which it
                belonged, the speaker is instead “driven on” from stranger to stranger toward an
                Earth freed from its determination by that
                world, prior to its constitution in relation to another.</p>
                  <p> This “unbounded Earth,” however is in no way another world or “homeland,” since, as
                the passage makes clear, it “serves” the speaker in place of home and nation.
                Instead, the ode ends by addressing itself to the river, but only once there is
                another tonal shift after the caesura in the eighth
                stanza separating the death of the homeless singer from the river:
                
                <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>And when he dies—but never, delightful Main,</l>
                        <l>Shall I forget you or your banks, the</l>
                        <l>Variously blessed, on my farthest travels.</l>
                        <l>Hospitably, though proud, you admitted me,</l>
                        <l>And, smoothly flowing, brightened the stranger’s eye</l>
                        <l>And, taught me gently gliding songs, and</l>
                        <l>Taught me the strength that’s alive in silence.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Und wenn er stirbt—doch nimmer vergeßt ich dich,</l>
                        <l>So fern ich wandre, schöner Main! und</l>
                        <l>Deine Gestade, die vielbeglükten</l>
                        <l>Gastfreundlich nahmst du Stolzer! bei dir mich auf</l>
                        <l>Und heitertest das Auge dem Fremdlinge,</l>
                        <l>Und still hingleitende Gesänge</l>
                        <l>Lehrtest du mich und geräuschlos Leben. (M 31–36)</l>
                     </lg>
                    
            The river, as intermediary between the “boundless” Earth and the poet, is both the
                condition of possibility for his song (it teaches “gently gliding songs”) and that
                which remains unspoken, unpresentable, irreducible to the song it makes possible,
                since the river also teaches “the strength that’s alive in silence.” If the
                “unbounded” Earth has overturned or eluded every “form and representation,” the
                alternation of tones, the oscillation between the death of one nature, and the
                promise or birth of another testifies in Hölderlin to an “Earth” that figures
                something other than a region of beings or an objectivity and that remains wholly
                other to human representation, as alien as another planet. What remains, in
                Hölderlin, is a relation of non-equivalence, and a collectivity predicated not simply on
                intertwinement but on differentiations that allow for no common foundation or
                starting point. Hölderlin’s poetic ecology is, to use Frédéric Neyrat’s formulation,
                “an ecology of separation” that does not attempt to revive the old gods of nature,
                who in fact died some time ago. Instead, it encounters something far
                more strange and disorienting in and through what might be called its “geopoetics”:
                the bringing-to-language of an Earth that has twisted free from any concept of
                nature, from any “world” of Man or humans. Hölderlin’s Earth: a fully

                  <p> After the frame, on the first page of the narrative proper of Mary Shelley’s 1826
                novel <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, the narrator and titular last man Lionel
                Verney opens his account with a strange reflection on the distribution of global
                space, in addition to a remark on Man as such: 
                
            <quote> I AM the native of a sea-surrounded nook, a cloud-enshadowed land, which, when the
                surface of the globe . . . presents itself
                to my mind, appears only as an inconsiderable speck in the immense whole; and yet,
                when balanced in the scale of mental power, far outweighed countries of larger
                extent and more numerous population. So true it is, that man’s mind alone was the
                creator of all that was good or great to man, and that Nature herself was only his
                first minister. England, seated far north in the turbid sea, now visits my dreams in
                the semblance of a vast and well-manned ship, which mastered the winds and rode
                proudly over the waves. (9) </quote>
                
                England’s place is at the center and height of civilization, indeed at the very
                height of “Man." Much later in the book, after the plague
                has decimated almost the whole country, Verney apostrophizes England with: “England,
                thou wert the triumph of man” (LM 323). And here at the opening, England’s place in
                the globe is explicitly determined not geographically but in terms of “the scale of mental
                power.” This scale of mental power, Verney then says, is the essence of what it
                means to be “Man”: “man’s mind alone was the creator of all that was good or great
                to man.” Indeed, it is precisely England’s
                outsized claim to “mental power” that allows it to assert its sovereignty and
                dominate both global commerce and nature alike, “master[ing] the winds” and sea,
                “subdu[ing]” the earth, with nonhuman nature as “only [man’s] first minister” (9);
                thus Man’s sovereignty is not only a political but an ecological matter. In the
                narrative’s opening, which has been called a “dream of sovereign extension,” we are told that Man
                is constituted by sovereignty and mastery
                and that this sovereignty (indexed by mental power) is not equally distributed
                across the divisions of humanity (Elmer 358). England is figured as a
                    ship, and specifically, a “well-<hi rend="italic">man</hi>ned ship”—the triumph of Man. From the novel’s title to
                the opening paragraph, to its final word, “Man” in <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    Man</hi> is a differentiated dream of sovereignty. </p>
                  <p> This operation of differentiation is inseparably bound up with race. The very idea
                of a “scale of mental power” that is distributed unevenly across the globe evokes
                various strands of scientific racism and racialized Enlightenment anthropology, from
                the sense of literal brain measurement and weighing on a scale according to race to the idea of the <hi rend="italic">scala naturae</hi>, the great chain of being, a descending line with white
                European man at the top and all others below. This is the case, for example, in
                William Petty’s 1677 work <hi rend="italic">The Scale of Creatures</hi>, which
                claims that “Europeans do not only differ from the aforementioned Africans in
                    colour . . . but also . . . in the Internal qualities of their
                Minds” (cited in Linebaugh and Rediker 139). The word “scale” in relation to race
                also comes up in colonial planter and administrator Edward Long’s <hi rend="italic">History of Jamaica</hi> (1774), which argues for white supremacy on the basis
                of “the system of created beings [being] perfect and consistent . . . this perfection arises from an <hi rend="italic">exact scale of gradation</hi>, from the lowest to the highest”
                (484; emphasis added). Or closer to Shelley’s time, take the physician Charles White’s 1799 racist work
                called <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Regular Gradation in Man</hi>, the title
                of which is important because it implies that the unity of the category of “Man” is
                constituted by an internal differentiation, or gradation, that is, fundamentally
                hierarchical and racialized. The very idea of Man implies this internally gradated
                scale where different groups of humans can co-belong to this supposedly universal
                category, which is structured by the hierarchy and exclusions built into its machinery. We might then
                think of race constructed in this way as the imposition of this scale, this temporal
                schema of human development or “gradation,” onto human difference with whiteness as the proper fulfillment
                or sovereign end of Man. The opening of Verney’s narrative evinces a “political
                unconscious of racialized British-Eurocentrism” that suffuses the rest of <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>—this paradigm not only determines the parameters
                and political ecology of Man in the novel
                but stages the scene of its own ruination (An 581-82).</p>
                  <p> That Shelley’s novel of universal apocalypse <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>
                harbors a critique of the idea of Man, of the Enlightenment, and of colonialism and
                empire, is not a new observation. An early and still powerful, if gestural, version
                of this argument was made by Barbara Johnson in her influential 1980 essay “The Last
                Man,” which reads the novel as an indictment of “a certain Western culture which can
                no longer take itself for the voice of humanity in its entirety” (10).<note place="foot" resp="author&gt;                     ">Later important readings of the colonial contexts of <hi rend="italic">The Last
                                Man</hi> include those of Alan Bewell and Paul Cantor.</note> 
                For Johnson, the novel both mourns this Enlightenment universalism of Man while also limning its destructiveness, what
                she calls its “lethal universality,” figured (or disfigured), of course, by the
                plague that consumes the world (11). In what follows, I wish to deepen the critical
                line of inquiry initiated by Johnson and others to explore how the novel invites us to imagine other ways of being by
                modeling the abdication of the racialized position of Man. In step with this
                abdication, <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> makes it possible to inhabit the
                negative space of other, relational forms of life, though these other forms are only obliquely glimpsed and
                elicited in the diegetic space and time—which is also the prophetic space and

                  <p> How does the novel delineate a form of life that is “postuniversal,” in Johnson’s
                words, but also not isolated in the particularity of an all too familiar
                individualism that detaches itself from any relation, political, ecological, or
                otherwise (10)? And where does Johnson’s interrogation of Enlightenment’s violent
                universalism via Shelley’s novel leave us today? By which I mean: where does this
                leave the “us,” the “we,” the possibility of community after Man, after the end of
                History that <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> portrays? This question takes on a
                deeper urgency and ominous resonance in the Anthropocene, the age of environmental
                crisis where “Man” (<hi rend="italic">anthropos</hi>), or the idea of Man, has
                altered the very climate and earth system with his various projects and activity. <note place="foot" resp="author">I take up the discourse around the
                            Anthropocene (and the debate around its name) in more detail in a review essay on Donna Haraway published in <hi rend="italic">Qui
                                Parle</hi> 27.1 (2018), and in an essay “Fragmentary Domesticity: Wordsworth’s Image of the Common."</note>
                
                 As the contemporary discourse around the Anthropocene shows, the political question
                of the contested constitution of Man is always an ecological one, with differing
                conceptions of relation to the earth at stake. In fact, <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    Man</hi> also deals with a number of environmental issues like climate change,
                sea-level rise, seasonal disruption, and human-animal relations, but these specific
                ecological problems provide more of a backdrop to this essay, which is concerned
                with the political ecology of “Man” as a concept, as well as its alternatives: both
                what Man violently excludes and what would be otherwise than Man, undoing it. If
                both politics and ecology in their different ways deal with the question of
                relationality, it is normally assumed that politics is concerned with human
                relationality, and ecology with relational fields in the nonhuman world. It is the
                imperative of political ecology to question and undo this partition between the
                human and nonhuman in order to summon new forms of relationality and collectivity;
                but the abolition of this partition should also involve examining the production of
                nonhumanity or improper humanity <hi rend="italic">within</hi> manufactured
                conceptions of the human—that which is necessarily excluded or degraded so that Man
                can be Man. </p>
                  <p> The issue of relationality foregrounded by political ecology is obviously a
                stumbling block for <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, for to whom or what can the
                only man relate? Indeed, the question of relationality, community, and the solitary
                individual cuts across Johnson’s essay on the novel, which, evoking Nietzsche’s
                notion of the Last Man, asks on its first page: “The human here is apparently
                something that says ‘we.’ And what if men were reduced only to ‘I’? Would the word
                ‘man’ still have the same meaning if there were only one left? Would the end of man
                take place before or after the death of the last man?” (3). The connection between
                the “we” and the end(s) of Man comes more fully into view when we recall that
                Johnson’s essay on Shelley was originally given as a talk at a conference organized
                in 1980 by Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe on the work of Derrida called
                “The Ends of Man,” after Derrida’s 1968 essay of that name. This latter essay ends
                with a haunting three-word query putting
                the community of Man in question: <hi rend="italic">“But who, we?"</hi> (136; emphasis added). Derrida’s
                question(ing) of the “we” is further taken up by theorist Sylvia
                Wynter in her exposure and disruption of the racialized coloniality inherent in the
                idea of “Man.”
                <note place="foot" resp="author"> “To me Derrida’s most radical essay was . . . ‘The Ends of Man.’ 
                    At the end he asks, ‘But who, “we”?’ The <hi rend="italic">refernt-we</hi> of man and of its ends, he implies, is not the <hi rend="italic">referent-we</hi> of the human species itself. . . The above is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> single issue with which 
                    global warming and climate instability now confronts us and that we have to replace the ends of <hi rend="italic">the referent-we </hi> 
                    of liberal monohumanist Man with the ecumenically human ends of the <hi rend="italic">referent-we in the horizon of
                                humanity”</hi> (Wynter, “Unparalleled
                                Catastrophe” 23-24). </note>
                To simplify, for Wynter, the historically specific notion or genre of humanity of Western Man
                “over-represented” itself, conflating its ideas of Man (which in the nineteenth
                century takes the form of <hi rend="italic">homo oeconomicus</hi>) with the proper
                human as such, creating a false and hierarchical “we.” What Wynter names “[Man’s]
                over-representation as if it were that of the human” necessarily involved both the
                “invention” and “subjugation” of racialized “Human Others” in order to “fuel” and to
                justify Europe’s sovereign “global conquests and expansion” (“Map for the Territory”
                    128-29).<note place="foot" resp="author"> “The invention of the global category of 
                        Human Others on the basis of the institutionalized inferiorization and subjugation of those [racialized] human beings . . . was indispensible . . . to the
                        over-representation of this ethno-class or Western bourgeois genre or mode of being human, as if
                                it were that of the human itself” (Wynter, “Map” 128-29). </note>
                The reflexive questioning of the “we,” often by putting it in scare quotes, has
                become a kind of theoreme or theory meme, an almost obligatory move in many strands
                of critical theoretical discourse.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Examples of this move are countless. 
                    For a recent one relating to Anthropocene debates, see Kathryn Yusoff: “To be included in the ‘we’ of the
                                Anthropocene is to be silenced by a claim to universalism that fails
                                to notice its subjugations” (12). </note> 
                This is for good reason, but in addition to bracketing the “we” to draw attention to its
                contingent formations and naturalized exclusions, it is
                is also important to pay attention to what has been bracketed out by given notions of the “we” and of
                    Man in order to disclose other forms
                of life, relation, and collectivity that move outside and against the paradigm of
                Man. The last section of this essay attempts to read for and think through images of
                these alternative forms, these omens of an “otherwise we-ness,” in <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>.<note place="foot">I take “otherwise we-ness” from J. Kameron
                                Carter, who opposes to it the “appropriative and expropriative, a
                                thieving and exclusionary ‘We-ness’” of Man: “Man is a figure of
                                ontological and planetary terror, as Calvin Warren powerfully
                                argues. The terror of Man both produces and targets the nonhuman or
                                the less-than-human mass(es) figured as the Racial Other”

                  </p>
                  <p> To arrive there, the next section builds on the paradigm of
                <hi rend="italic">The Last Man </hi> opened up by Barbara
                Johnson and others and examines how the novel’s critique of Man centers upon a
                hierarchically differentiated concept of Man as a sovereign who is constantly
                engaged in projects, labor, improvement,
                and tasks. Man’s sovereignty is indexed by these projects, as well as by progress
                into a future that is only seemingly open to possibility but in fact necessitates a
                reproduction of the world as it is, preventing other forms of existence from
                blossoming. This means the novel’s conception of Man faces an apparent paradox: on
                the one hand, (white, European, especially English) Man is the finished, highest <hi rend="italic">telos</hi> of being, the summit of both humanity and earthly
                creation (“the triumph of man”); on the other hand, and at the same time, Man is
                constitutively open (indeed the being <hi rend="italic">most</hi> open) to possibilities
                that he actualizes through tasks and projects, which only reproduce Man and the
                world as correlative structures.<note place="foot" resp="author">This conceptualization of possibility and
                                reproduction emerges from my collaborative work with Kirill Chepurin
                                on Hans Blumenberg, possibility, and modernity.</note>
                
                For example, later in the novel, when Verney addresses England as “the triumph of
                man,” he attributes this chauvinistic civilizational triumph to “thy children, their
                unwearied industry and lofty aspiration,” that is, their ambitious projects and
                tasks (LM 324). </p>
                  <p> However, this paradigm of (European) Man’s sovereignty established through a
                dialectic of project and progress collides with and is undone by the forces of
                abdication, inoperativity, interruption, and aimlessness that permeate <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>. This theme of abdication begins with the
                narrator’s relinquishment of authorship and authority to the Sibylline prophecy, which she transcribes and translates, and
                continues through the constant abdications of sovereignty, authority, and direction
                in the narrative, up to the plague that
                interrupts all futurity. Along the way, the novel creates apertures and overtures
                for imagining other, relational forms of life that
                do not hew to the colonial and ontological protocols of Man or what Lisa Lowe calls the “colonial
                divisions of humanity” (7). One example of this life other than Man, a life without
                sovereignty, is evoked by the last man himself, Lionel Verney, who on the last page
                of the novel begs for a task that would afford him a teleological orientation: “I
                    long . . . to have some <hi rend="italic">task</hi>, however slight or voluntary, for each day’s
                fulfillment” (LM 470; emphasis added).
                Condemned to wander the ravaged and empty earth without task, both the last man and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> disclose an image of what might be other
                than Man, an image that in its very isolation invites us to imagine a relational
                existence without ground or <hi rend="italic">telos</hi>, after the end of History
                and in its ruins. In this way, the last man’s tasklessness embodies Georges
                Bataille’s famous concept of life after the end of History as a “negativité sans
                emploi,” which we might here translate as "negativity without task" (369). <note place="foot" resp="author">
                    In his text on negativity without task, Bataille is responding to Alexandre Kojève’s idea of the End of History, 
                    a concept famously later picked up and reworked by Francis Fukuyama, who added a rather Shelleyan twist to the 
                    title of his 1992 work <hi rend="italic">The End of History and the Last
                                Man</hi> (Bataille himself discusses the theme of the “last man” in <hi rend="italic">Inner
                                Experience</hi>, though this is unmentioned by Fukuyama). 
                    Despite these twentieth-century permutations, it is important to remember that the 
                    End of History is a quintessentially Romantic-era problematic, originating with Hegel. 
                    See also Jerome Christensen, <hi rend="italic">Romanticism at the End of
                                History</hi>. Bataille’s concept of
                            <hi rend="italic">negativité sans emploi</hi> also gave rise to a series of important 
                    theoretical reflections on the possibility of a community that would be without work by thinkers such as Jean-Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben and Maurice Blanchot.
                    Romanticism plays an essential role in this discourse on community, one I trace in my book <hi rend="italic">All Things Common </hi>
                    (forthcoming). An incisive reading of this discourse with reference to the question
                    of sovereignty can be found in Michael Krimper’s “Nonsovereign: Inoperativity from Batalle to
                    Agamben.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> After the next section "Task Master" develops <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>’s notion of Man as a
                sovereign engaging in tasks, projects, and labors of improvement, the third section "Sympathology"
                examines a vexed scene with the novel’s only explicitly Black character to lay bare
                the racialized exclusions inherent in Man and to show how Verney refuses the opportunity to abdicate this sovereign position.
                Reading the scene of the plague’s transmission to Verney by a “negro half clad” by
                drawing on critiques of the human and the notion of flesh from work in Black
                Studies, I reframe this scene as the very heart of the novel’s incisive
                interrogation of Man. The final section "Eternal Fruition" then dwells with what the novel variously
                calls “other shapes,” “other spirits,” and “other forms of being” that refuse the
                    over-represented order of Man and open
                the door to something else. As one of Romanticism’s most important experiments in
                political ecology, <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> both plumbs the disastrous
                politics and ecology encoded in Man and
                finds other forms of common life sealed in the immanence of a kiss. </p>

                  <head>Task Master</head>
                  <p> That “Man” is a construct was understood and explored more thoroughly, and
                literally, by Mary Shelley than perhaps any other Romantic author (this is of course
                one of the many lessons of <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>). In <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, one way that the construction of Man is
                recapitulated is through the autobiographical microcosm of the last man Lionel
                Verney himself, who was orphaned along with his sister Perdita and grew up in a state he himself
                describes as “savagery” (LM 29). He gradually leaves this “savage” state and enters
                the subtly (and punningly) racialized “<hi rend="italic">paled</hi> demesne of
                civilization” only when subjected to a sovereign, a “master hand” (27, 29; emphasis added).
                When their long-lost family friend Adrian, a prince and the son of the abdicated and
                final King of England, comes to Cumberland, Verney almost immediately falls under
                Adrian’s noble spell. Throwing off his “war against civilization,”
                Verney follows Adrian down the path of progress into civilization, which is progress
                into the domain of Man: “I now began to be human,” Verney writes (29). He goes on to
                compare his newfound claims to participate in both civilization and Man to nothing
                other than the primal scene of colonialism itself, 1492: “I felt as the sailor, who
                from the topmast first discovered the shore of America; and like him I hastened to
                tell my companions of my discoveries in unknown regions” (31). This is yet another
                indication that “Man” in the novel is not a universal category but a contingent, colonial one, whose
                conceptualization is inextricable from the divisions of 1492 and what Wynter calls
                its “new world view.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In her essay “1492: A New World View,” 
                    Wynter investigates how the event of 1492 led to the creation of “the new symbolic 
                    construct of Race” as a tool to “legitimate . . . sovereignty” (11). </note>
                To become Man is to enter into a relation of coloniality and to assume whiteness. 
                Man’s supposed universality is constituted by its exclusions, exceptions, segregations, and
                gradations of (especially racial and gendered) differentiation. Verney’s own trajectory
                throughout the novel follows the path of Man itself, from “savagery” to sovereignty
                to lastness, to being without task — and as Emily Steinlight writes of Verney “As soon as he is last, he is no longer
                man” (71).</p>
                  <p> Educating and improving Verney becomes one of Adrian’s civilizing tasks, but we soon
                learn that Adrian has schemes and tasks for progress on a much larger scale. Verney
                mentions Adrian’s “theories for the <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi>
                of man,” for example, and various “schemes”
                and projects for progress and general improvement (36, 43; emphasis added). Later, in terms
                reminiscent of the theories of perfectibility espoused by Shelley’s father William
                Godwin, Adrian discusses plans for improvement with Raymond and the astronomer
                Merrival; Adrian attributes his vision of the coming utopian perfectibility of man
                precisely to Man’s propensity for labors, tasks, and projects: “Man cannot repose,
                and his restless aspirations will now bring forth good” (219). Throughout the novel,
                almost to the bitter end, Adrian is engaged in increasingly futile tasks and labors
                that crumble before the onslaught of the plague—tasks, as Adrian puts it, “for ever
                and ever to be sought,” eternally to be sought because receding from actual
                fruition, and only renewing the world as it is (327). Still later in the book,
                Adrian stakes a final claim to tasks, crying: “to our tasks . . . to the last I will struggle” (398). </p>
                  <p> Lord Raymond, the figure based on Byron, also embodies a mania for tasks, especially
                projects for improvement and civilization. After he assumes sovereignty (becoming Lord Protector of England), we are
                told: “Raymond was occupied in a thousand beneficial schemes . . . He was continually surrounded by projectors and
                projects” (106). These projects are nothing other than an index of Raymond’s
                sovereign power, his desire for domination both ecological (“the elements”) and
                political (“man”): “He looked forward to entire dominion over
                the elements and the mind of man” (117). Indeed both Raymond and Adrian take up the
                civilizing task of fighting with the Greeks in a war against the “barbarism” of the
                Muslim forces of Turkey, people who are described explicitly in terms of stillness

                    in civilization, stood still, a monument of antique barbarism” (175). </note>
                Crucially, Raymond envisions his civilizing war in relation to a futurity that is
                endlessly renewed and reproduced in future generations, always advancing in a
                testament to the glory and sovereignty of Man: “Other generations will arise,
                and ever and for ever will continue . . . to be gloried by our valour” (194). 
                It is this endless progress that “exalt[s] the race of man and make[s] this little globe a dwelling of the
                mighty” (194). The fact that this exaltation of Man as a supposed “we,” a “race,”
                requires war against and the eradication of other, non-European groups of human
                beings (not to mention the earth itself) reveals a concept of Man caught up in the
                “over-represented” (Wynter) violent universalism that <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    Man</hi> adumbrates and ultimately unworks.</p>
                  <p> A passage from the end of Chapter 15 demonstrates more acutely the intimate
                connection between tasks, the idea of Man, and the reproduction of the world (that
                is, the world constituted by the exclusions inherent in the idea of Man, the world
                of Shelley’s day continued into ca. 2100). Verney observes a group of
                “enterpriz[ing]” young Etonian boys and
                attempting “to read the future man” through their youth, sees them as “the future
                governors of England; the men, who, when . . . our projects completed or destroyed for
                ever . . . were
                the beings who were to carry on the vast machine of society; here were the lovers,
                husbands, fathers; here the landlord, politician, soldier” (227).<note place="foot" resp="author"> That Eton is an all-boys school (as it is today) is significant. 
                    While this essay will focus more on the question of race in the novel (which has been less often discussed), 
                    gender obviously figures into the paradigm of Man in important ways. 
                    Verney’s sister Perdita longs for a sovereign task at one point (“Would that I also had a career!”), 
                    only to be told later by Raymond that his civilizing task “is no woman’s work” (162-63; 193-94). On “apocalypse and gender” in <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, see Chapter 5 of Steven Goldsmith’s

                It is precisely the youth and open possibility of the young Etonians that will afford them the futurity
                and the new “projects” that will simply reproduce the world as it is and “carry on the vast machine of
                society” (we might think of Lee Edelman’s work on the child and futurity here). <note place="foot" resp="author">See Edelman’s <hi rend="italic">No Future: Queer Theory and the

                Importantly, this same passage links this logic to the reproduction of Man: “Thus man remains, while we the individuals
                pass away” (228). The reproduction of the world — the sovereign world of governors and
                landlords and soldiers and the institution of Eton — and the reproduction and
                preservation of the being Man are co-constitutive (it’s no accident that Verney also
                quotes Edmund Burke in this passage). As we have seen, Man remaining, and remaining
                as sovereign, is powered by progress and advancement. “Advance,” Verney
                apostrophizes the young men repeatedly, “Advance! . . . May your progress be uninterrupted and secure; born during the
                spring-tide of the hopes of man, may you lead up the summer to which no winter may
                succeed!” (228).<note place="foot" resp="author"> At another point Verney explicitly associates the reproduction of Man 
                    with the word “task”: “Some from among the family of man must survive, and these should be among the survivors; 
                    that should be my <hi rend="italic"> task</hi>—to accomplish it my own life were a small sacrifice” (261; emphasis added). </note>
                
                The conscious irony here of Verney addressing future generations in the past while writing from a
                position after the extinction of humanity 
                is superseded by a doubled irony in the passage of which Shelley could only have
                been dimly aware: that is, the formulation of Man’s advancement, projects, and
                industry begetting a long winterless
                summer, an eerily prescient image of global warming’s coming endless summer in the
                Anthropocene, the age of Man. </p>
                  <p> The novel’s interest in improvement and its connection to the imbricated logics of
                tasks, futurity, Man, and the reproduction of the world is illuminated by the
                recent critique of improvement by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten.
                Drawing on Wynter and others, Harney and Moten link the Enlightenment’s colonial and
                racialized idea of Man to the imposition of tasks of improvement that actually keep
                things in place: what they call “man’s perpetually stilled motion” in “eternally
                prospective completion-in-improvement” (84, 89). The idea of Man is constituted by
                the differentiation and subjection of certain racialized groups who are set aside as
                in need of being “endlessly improved . . . on their endless way to becoming Man,” a telos infinitely deferred
                (85). For Harney and Moten, this murderous anthropological paradigm of work, tasks, and improvement is also
                irreducibly a problematic of political ecology, as it leads toward the “destruction
                of the biosphere” and “socioecological disaster” (85, 88). The demand for
                improvement, which is essential to capitalism, is indeed first directed against the
                earth itself, as in discourses of land improvement and enclosure.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    On connections between logics of improvement and enclosure and logics of property, race, and coloniality,

                            <hi rend="italic">Colonial Lives of
                            Property</hi>. Since the logic of improvement is part and parcel of enclosure, 
                    it is thus closely tied to proletarianization and the emerging notion of a “work ethic”; 
                    and while the racializing force of improvement is more obvious in relation to the improvement 
                    project of colonialism, even within Britain, those commoners who needed to be improved into 
                    workers were often described in racializing terms. </note>
                    
                So it is in this light that we should read the various discourses in <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> on tasks, projects, and schemes for
                improvement—tasks that index the sovereignty of (European) Man, who lords over the
                spheres of the political and the ecological and in doing so obscures their inextricability.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    As Chris Washington writes in his insightful chapter on <hi rend="italic">The Last
                            Man</hi>: “Shelley, in the later sections of the novel, 
                    targets and takes down humans’ notion of their own sovereignty over the 
                    world and its inhabitants” (77). </note>
                    
                The next section will further explore the dimensions of Man’s racialization through
                Verney’s encounter with a figure who is constitutively denied entry onto “the bright
                noon-enlightened highway of mankind” (LM 157).</p>

                  <head>Sympathology</head>
                  <p> Early in the third and final volume of <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, Verney
                and his family are preparing to depart England with Adrian and the few remaining
                English survivors of the plague. After a visit to London, Verney returns to his home
                in Windsor to come upon the body of his young son Alfred, who has just died of the
                disease. Before he reaches Alfred, however, he has a strange physical encounter with
                an unnamed, plague-infected “negro half clad” (the novel’s only explicitly Black
                character), from whom Verney appears to contract the plague by breathing in the sick
                man’s breath. Given that Verney is the lone character to actually recover from the
                plague, the scene of his contracting disease — and thus his possible inoculation — would
                appear to be a crucial one, yet this extraordinary passage has proven difficult to
                interpet. It is a grim scene, even for so bleak a novel as this, and one that
                has vexed commentators, who often gloss over it rapidly.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    One notable exception is Peter Melville’s “The Problem of Immunity in <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> which analyzes the scene in detail and
                                argues contrary to received opinion that Verney does not actually
                                contract the plague from the dying Black man. Melville makes an
                                interesting epidemiological case, but this reading also seems too
                                against the grain given that Verney declares himself to have gotten 
                                the plague in the paragraph immediately following the scene.</note>
                
                But by engaging work in Black Studies that interrogates the racialized
                determinations of Man, this narrative episode can be read both as developing the novel’s critique of Man as a
                racialized and exclusionary mechanism (whose most paradigmatic exclusion is
                    blackness) and also as opening the
                possibility of a form of relationality that is other than Man — a possibility
                ultimately rejected by Verney. 
                
            <quote>Here is the event, in Verney’s first-person—or rather, last-person—narration: 
            "I threw open the door of the first room that presented itself. It was quite dark;
                but, as I stept within, a pernicious scent assailed my senses, producing sickening
                qualms, which made their way into my very heart, while I felt my leg clasped, and a
                groan repeated by the person that held me. I lowered my lamp, and saw a negro half
                clad, writing under the agony of disease, while he held me with a convulsive grasp.
                With mixed horror and impatience I strove to disengage myself, and fell on the
                sufferer; he wound his naked festering arms round me, his face close to mine, and
                his breath, death-laden, entered my vitals. For a moment I was overcome, my head was
                bowed by aching nausea; til, reflection returning, I sprung up, threw the wretch
                from me, and darting up the staircase, entered the chamber usually inhabited by my
                family. A dim light shewed me Alfred on a couch; Clara trembling, and paler than
                whitest snow, had raised him on her arm" (336-37). </quote>
                
            The macabre scene unfolds in a kind of dark netherworld. Verney’s actions seem
                instinctive, but the resulting picture is that the “negro half clad,” literally <hi rend="italic">bare</hi> life, is denied entry into the Kingdom of Man. His
                half-clothed state and the language used to describe him (“wretch” — a favorite
                epithet of Frankenstein for his creature) indicate Verney’s judgment of his
                nonhumanity before he physically throws the man off. We don’t know the Black man’s
                name, his language, his situation, his relation to any person or place in the world,
                nor where he comes from or how—he is simply dropped off there by the narrative, as
                if transported from another world. He is in the house but out of place: an instance of pure
                deracination. It’s not clear in the novel whether the global slave system has been
                abolished in the late twenty-first century (it appears
                not), but in the year of the book’s publication, 1826, this Black character would
                certainly have been associated with British enslavement (slavery was not completely
                abolished in the British Empire until the 1840s). Further, as Siobhan Carroll has
                noted, Verney’s depiction of his house, with its “dark[ness],” “pernicious scents,” disease,
                sounds of groans, and general horror, closely resembles contemporary descriptions of
                slave ships (12).<note place="foot" resp="author">See Carroll for another reading of this scene

                  </p>
                  <p> Peter Melville is right to remind us that the context of this scene is that of home
                and family—Verney has rushed into his home, looking for his wife and child.<note place="foot" resp="author&gt;">

                It appears that at least part of Verney’s violent rejection of the dying man stems
                from his judgment of the incongruity of blackness and domestic sociality, from which
                blackness is not only barred but seen as
                an interference. As Saidiya Hartman writes, “In short, the
                slave exists out of the world and outside the house” (169). Indeed, what if this
                passage evinces not so much a “lapse . . . of sympathy” on Verney’s part, as Melville argues, but rather
                demonstrates the normal operation of sympathy as it is structured to (not) work upon
                those not viewed as human, those not part of what the novel calls “the family of
                man,” or any family at all (Melville 835; LM 261)?<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    When Verney later has become the last man, he pens a mournful paean to universal 
                    “human sympathy,” but even here divides humanity into colonial categories like 
                    “wild and cruel Caribbee” and “merciless Cannibal” (449). </note>
                
                This reading would allow us to see this episode as exposing the cracks in the false
                “we” of Man that the novel ruins, a “we” from which blackness is constitutively
                    excluded but also to which blackness
                here presents some alternative, otherworldly, fleshly embrace.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    On (anti-)blackness and the “we,” see Christina Sharpe’s <hi rend="italic">In the Wake</hi> (7) and Stephen Best’s <hi rend="italic">None Like
                    Us</hi>: “Whatever blackness or black culture is, it cannot be indexed to a ‘we’—or 
                    if it is, that ‘we’ can only be structured by and given in its own negation and refusal” (22). 
                    Frank B. Wilderson III’s Afro-Pessimism takes this the furthest in the claim to “shi[t] on the 
                    inspiration of the personal pronoun <hi rend="italic">we</hi>” (143). </note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Let us look at this scene in closer detail. What is the nature of this particular encounter, so
                different from other encounters in the novel where Verney reacts to the diseased and
                dead without fear and even sometimes with
                care? Verney perceives it to be a violent struggle, describing himself as being
                “clasped” and “grasp[ed],” and responds accordingly, recoiling in disgust and
                forcefully “thr[owing] the wretch from me.” In the chapter just before this scene,
                the plague had been directly associated with the notion of “flesh,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    “She [plague] has invested [man’s] form, is incarnate in his <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi>, has entwined herself with his being, and blinds his heaven-seeking eyes” (316; emphasis added). </note>
                and likewise here Verney sees the Black man not as a coherent body or person but as a mass of decaying flesh, with the
                pun on “wound” intensifying the sense of festering decay: “He wound his naked festering arms round me.” 
                Yet one might also see this collision of flesh from the dying man’s perspective, from the (non)place of
                exclusion, as the demonstration of and invitation to an altogether different
                entanglement outside of Man and Man’s sovereignty, a sharing of woundedness indexed
                both by the plague and by blackness (and their mutual identification).<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    Regarding decay, contagion, and pathology, Moten notes that “blackness has been associated with a certain sense of decay,” 
                    though this is also connected to an “impossible, pathological sociality” (177, 210). 
                    On “racial pathologies” and the convergence of “race-science” and “race-medicine” in the eighteenth-century 
                    British Empire, see Suman Seth’s insightful <hi rend="italic">Difference and
                            Disease</hi>. </note>
                
                This embrace is an insistence on inextricable relationality even as Verney seeks to
                “disengage [him]self” from their precarious enmeshment. Following Alexander
                Weheliye’s recent theorization of flesh inspired by Wynter, Hortense Spillers, and
                others, we can think of the flesh here as a wound or “vestibular gash in the armor
                of Man, simultaneously a tool of dehumanization and a relational vestibule to
                alternate ways of being” (44).<note place="foot" resp="author">I am indebted also to Alex Dubilet’s
                    discussion of flesh in “An Immanence
                    without the World: On Dispossession, Nothingness, and Secularity.”</note> 
                The possibility of differentiating these two antithetical and simultaneous meanings of the flesh — as brutally violent
                reduction versus an antechamber to a new
                common life — depends in part upon whether vulnerability, the wound or “gash” in Man,
                is distributed to certain “others” as a sacrificial burden to bear or whether it is shared and generalized
                (indeed the very word “plague” derives from Latin <hi rend="italic">plaga</hi>,
                which can mean both a “strike” and the “wound” or “gash” such a strike causes). The
                former is the case in this scene, as Verney chooses disengagement over entanglement. </p>
                  <p> Verney falls down upon on the “sufferer,” and they become one in an almost-kiss and
                exchange of corrupted breath: “He wound his naked festering arms round me,
                his face close to mine, and his breath, death-laden, entered my vitals. For a moment
                I was overcome, my head was bowed by aching nausea.” For a fugitive moment of
                contact and contagion, Verney is dispossessed of his individuated body and
                consciousness and is “overcome,” losing the ground underneath him and feeling
                “aching nausea.” These symptoms of vertigo indicate an experience with what Jared
                Sexton calls “that wounded, disseminative vertigo that is blackness” (“On Black
                Negativity”). Verney loses all bearings in meeting with one who is abandoned, barred
                from bearings, and barred from Man. Yet after this brief moment, “reflection”
                returns to Verney, and he separates himself by “disengage[ing],” rejecting and
                abandoning the dying man. He regains orientation, and rushes off to find his dead
                child Alfred, held by his niece Clara, whose whiteness is notably emphasized: “paler
                than whitest snow.” </p>
                  <p> Instead of perceiving the encounter as a violent struggle, as
                Verney does, being attentive to the action of the dying man as an embrace and a kiss
                on the mouth (the intense homoeroticism of this scene is too often unremarked) <note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    While the “negro half clad” is described as male, the state of undress, position on the floor,

                    in her foundational essay “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe,” sees as the “ungendering”

                see the Black man as included in Man but
                his refusal to “unMan” himself (to repurpose a verb Verney himself earlier uses) <note place="foot" resp="author">

                his refusal to abdicate the sovereignty of Man and affirm some shared fleshly entanglement with a
                (non)person marked by slavery. Another passage from Sexton prompts a final
                reflection on this critical scene from the novel: 
                
                <quote>In a world structured by the twin axioms of white superiority and black inferiority,
                of white existence and black nonexistence, a world structured by a negative
                categorical imperative—“above all, don’t be black” (Gordon 1997: 63)—in this world,
                the zero degree of transformation is the turn toward blackness, a turn toward the
                shame, as it were, that “resides in the idea that ‘I am thought of as less than
                human’” (Nyong’o 2002: 389). In this we might create a transvaluation of pathology
                itself, something like an embrace of pathology without pathos. (“Social Life”
                23)</quote>
                
            Given that pathology is in the first instance concerned with the understanding of
                disease, Sexton’s comment is remarkably apt for a novel about universal plague and
                for the scene I have been discussing in particular. What would it mean for Verney 
                to have been able to affirm an “embrace of pathology” in the novel, to perform an act not of sympathy
                but what we might call sympathology? Perhaps it would look like not simply aiding the dying man but staying on the floor, staying
                entangled, sharing the damage of the plague as mutually vulnerable beings and inhabiting and generalizing this
                vulnerability in a common passivity; it might look something like death, or William Blake called “self-annihilation.” This
                negative image in the novel (the whole narrative is, recall, a prophecy), what <hi rend="italic">doesn’t</hi> happen, adumbrates the opening for the affirmation of the “less
                than human” (Sexton quoting Nyong’o) and thereby other than Man: the life that is cast off on the ground, without work and
                task, and “unsovereign.”<note place="foot" resp="author">On the enslaved person as (paradoxically)
                                without task and without work, cf. Agamben: “The slave . . . is the human being without work 
                                who renders possible the realization of the work of the human being” (23). 
                                On slavery and the “unsovereign,” see Sexton’s “The <hi rend="italic">Vel</hi> of Slavery: Tracking the Figure of the Unsovereign,” drawing on Nahum Chandler’s <hi rend="italic">X: The Problem of the Negro as
                                a Problem for
                            Thought</hi>.</note>
                    
                Having a glimpse of what is other than Man is in fact something upon which Verney
                constantly speculates, as we’ll see in the next section. </p>
                  <p> But instead, Verney separates himself and survives. He does appear to contract the
                plague in this scene,<note place="foot" resp="author">"The seeds of mortal disease had taken root in my bosom” (LM 337).</note>
                        but as an inoculation rather than a fatal case. Verney
                refuses to embrace pathology, refuses to join what is (forced to be) outside of Man,
                and rather than helping or joining the Black man, throws him off and, moreover, 
                feeds on his dying life by using the literally abject man (“threw . . . from me”, cf. Latin
                <hi rend="italic">ab </hi> + <hi rend="italic">iactus</hi>) as a
                sacrifice for his own immunization; they do not share the wound or the vulnerability
                of flesh in common dehiscence. Not only is the unnamed Black character not fully
                included in the proper category of Man but
                his not being Man is precisely what allows Verney to be Man. Verney (again, almost
                literally) parasitically feeds off his disease, subjection, and abjection; he
                becomes inoculated and able to reproduce himself even as the world around him
                disintegrates. In this way, the scene is a microcosm of the more general
                constitutive exclusions of Man that the novel probes and stages. Alongside the
                already radical interrogation of Western humanism, colonialism, and imperialism in
                    <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, a trajectory brought out by Barbara Johnson
                and others, reading the novel in dialogue with work in Black Studies 
                further radicalizes our understanding of the limits and the outsides of Man. In
                addition, such a reading offers another understanding of this crucial hinge of the
                whole novel—namely, reframing the question as to why Shelley had the last man, the
                one character to survive the plague, contract it from the only character explicitly
                racialized as Black. This analytic bears on Romanticism’s political ecology more
                generally in fundamental ways; it prompts a rethinking of the category of ecological
                and nonhuman relationality according to “racial blackness” as the “paradigmatic
                figure of the nonhuman”—a paradigm consolidating precisely in the Romantic era—which
                as such aligns with all “earth’s vulnerable inhabitants,” and the earth itself
                (Karera 46, 52).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Compare Zakiyyah Iman Jackson, 
                    whom Karera’s article cites, on the “embrace” of blackness as conditioning the

                    “Terrestrial movement toward the nonhuman is simultaneously movement toward blackness, 
                    whether blackness is embraced or not, as blackness constitutes the very matter at hand” (“Outer Worlds” 217). </note>

                  <p> While the first two parts of this essay delineated the novel’s idea of Man, the last
                section argued Verney’s refusal to unMan himself took the form of his refusal to
                embrace the pathology of the plague and the dying Black man. Embracing and
                inhabiting the plague would mean acceding to the forces of interruption that the
                plague both figures and ushers in.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Cf. Johnson: 
                    “The Plague is what man’s measures can neither foresee nor master . . . [it] 
                    is that which at once stops all systems of meaning from functioning and that 
                    against which those systems are necessarily erected” (10). </note>
                
                The plague is a shifting figure in the book, conjuring both the “lethal
                universality” of Man (Johnson) and what interrupts this structure of universality
                (in this way it recalls Derrida’s discussion of the <hi rend="italic">pharmakon</hi>, or indeed, Weheliye’s conceptual framing of the flesh). The plague,
                whose movement is often described in terms eerily rendolent of the Englightenment, like advancement
                and progress,<note place="foot" resp="author"> Cf. numerous phrases like 
                    “the swift advance of the disease” (288), the “progress of the plague” (339), etc. </note>
                is what short-circuits the reproduction of the world. It undoes the logics of
                sovereignty, tasks, progress, and futurity and, on another level, exposes their
                violently differentiating mechanisms and effects. Yet the plague is only the most
                prominent harbinger of the forces of negativity — interruption, inoperativity, aimlessness, ruination, and especially abdication — that pervade <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>.
                In fact, it is possible to delineate a
                dialectic of abdication among all of the taskmasters and project mongers of the novel, 
                in addition to one on the second-order level of the novel itself. First of all, the main characters’ relation
                is set in motion, before they meet, by the last King of England abdicating the
                throne in the year 2073; the young would-be king Adrian then renounces any claims to
                the throne, amounting to an abdication; Raymond, whose very name suggests kingship
                over the world (cf. <hi rend="italic">roi</hi>, <hi rend="italic">rey</hi> + <hi rend="italic">monde</hi>, <hi rend="italic">mundo</hi>, etc.), renounces sovereignty over England on the cusp of achieving
                it, then later actually does assume the sovereignty of the Protectorship (called a
                “task” (150) only then to abdicate the throne and give up on “his various projects” (149); 
                yet another sovereign, Ryland, assumes then abdicates the Protectorship. Indeed, the end of Man is consistently
                described as the end of sovereignty.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “Now is man lord of the creation? Look at
                                him—ha! I see plague! . . . Man, the queller of the elements,
                                the lord of created nature, the peer of demi-gods, existed no
                                longer . . . Farewell to kingly pomp and warlike pageantry;
                                the crowns are in the dust” (LM 316, 320).</note>
                Even near the end of the novel, with the plague finally gone and almost everyone on earth
                dead, Verney describes the plague itself in terms of abdication: “She [the plague]
                abdicated her throne” (426). In <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, sovereignty
                cannot hold itself in place, and its continual ruination gestures toward the
                unsovereign life and community that the novel invites its readers to consider.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    On Romanticism’s engagement with alternative, groundless forms of sovereignty, see Kir Kuiken’s

                            Sovereignties</hi>.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Alongside the acts of abdicating sovereignty, there are also several images toward
                the end of the novel, both figurative and literal, of relinquishing the rudder,
                reins, or pilotage, of giving up direction and directionality, of refusing to have a
                goal, telos, or task. “We took our hands therefore away from the long grasped
                rudder,” Verney sighs after leaving England (413).<note place="foot" resp="author">Cf. 
                    “the reins hanging loosely in his grasp, [he] left the choice of the path to the instinct of his
                                horse” (418) and “given up all
                                pilotage” (423).</note>
                At an earlier moment of despair, he enjoins “man” to abdicate his sovereignty as the “lord of creation,”
                and to embrace dispossession: “Lie down, O man . . . give up all claim to your inheritance” (316).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Importantly in this passage, Verney intuits
                                the relation of the notion of “man” as sovereign “lord of creation”
                                to the colonizing imperative: “Of old navies used to stem the giant
                                ocean-waves betwixt Indus and the Pole for slight articles of
                                luxury. Men made perilous journies to possess themselves of earth’s
                                splendid trifles, gems and gold. Human labour was wasted—human life
                                set at nought” (316).</note> 
                Then there is, of course, the last man, Verney, whom I designated
                at the beginning of this essay as a paradigmatic figure of tasklessness. 
                Even while relinquishing the hope for improvement (“I form no expectation of alteration for the better”), in the
                novel’s final paragraph Verney longs in vain “to have some task” (470). Although his
                tasks have been abdicated for him, Verney remains trapped in the paradigm of Man,
                and trapped in isolation; his solitary wandering recalls Victor Frankenstein’s isolation at
                the end of that novel, not least as Frankenstein on his deathbed cries: “ My task is unfulfilled" (<hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> 177). </p>
                  <p> The novel therefore prompts us to think through the logic of
                    abdication; the abdication of sovereignty, of tasks,
                direction, and progress, and by extension the abdication of Man himself — or the idea
                of Man itself. But what comes after Man, after History, after sovereignty? For whom,
                after all, is the last man writing? This impossible audience is of course the
                central structural problem of the book, one that occurs intermittently to Verney
                himself. He speculates on possible future readers on an earth with no future,
                settling upon either surviving remnants of humanity or more evocatively a totally other form of life, an alternate way of
                being, something he calls at one point a “race spiritual” (399.) With the demise of
                humanity and Man around him, Verney becomes consumed with the possibility that there
                is a mode of being, a possible “we,” that is not Man. And despite its march toward
                annihilation, <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>’s prophetic mode is constantly
                demonstrating that things can be otherwise, even those formations that “seemed
                eternal” like Man, History, World, Nature — including climate, the seasons, and the sun,
                all of which are disrupted in some fashion in the book—can be seen, configured,
                experienced, shared, and inhabited differently (412). Verney mocks the astronomer
                Merrival for invoking beings after Man without being able to “describe the unknown
                and unimaginable lineaments of the creatures who would then occupy the vacated
                dwelling of mankind” (290); yet Verney himself variously gives thought to “other
                spirits, other minds, other perceptive beings, sightless to us” and to “other forms
                of being” who have altogether different forms of “communings” (341; 420). At another
                moment, he harbors the thought that “humanity is not extinct; but merely passed into
                other shapes, unsubjected to our perceptions” (413). These “other shapes” of life
                would be “unsubjected” to the perceptions and paradigm of Man, with “unsubjected”
                suggesting beings not subjected to any sovereign, and perhaps, coming after the
                subject itself. </p>
                  <p> The novel does little to limn these “other shapes” of — or than — humanity, except to suggest the possibility that they could exist, and, in foregrounding the force of
                inoperativity and abdication, the possibility they would be unsovereign, without task,
                detached from the sovereign imperatives of progress and the colonial, racial
                apparatuses of division that marry such imperatives. To close, I will suggest
                a final image of a taskless, unsovereign, relational life other than Man that the
                novel bequeaths to readers. Mere pages from the end, the last man wanders through
                the deserted city of Rome and takes in its museums and monuments:
                
                <quote>I gazed at each statue, and lost myself in a reverie before many a fair Madonna or
                beauteous nymph. I haunted the Vatican, and stood surrounded by marble forms of
                divine beauty. Each stone deity was possessed by sacred gladness, and the eternal
                fruition of love. They looked on me with unsympathizing complacency, and often in
                wild accents I reproached them for their supreme indifference—for they were human
                shapes, the human form divine was manifest in each fairest limb and lineament. The
                perfect moulding brought with it the idea of colour and motion; often, half in
                bitter mockery, half in self-delusion, I clasped their icy proportions, and, coming
                between Cupid and his Psyche’s lips, pressed the unconceiving marble. (465)</quote>
                
            In quite Blakean language, Verney experiences these statues as presences that have
                “the human form divine” and human “lineament[s] but are not Man. He partakes in some strange communion with the
                figures, losing himself in a Rousseauian “reverie” as he and the statues gaze upon
                one another. The statues themselves seem to be perpetually, purely in relation,
                dispossessed from themselves and “possessed by sacred gladness, and the eternal
                fruition of love.” What is “eternal fruition”? Given that “fruition” denotes the
                realization of some potentiality, trajectory, project, or task, “<hi rend="italic">eternal</hi> fruition” indicates the absolute non-presence of any task. That which is
                always, eternally in fruition has no need of a projected task or process of coming
                    <hi rend="italic">into</hi> fruition; it simply is. The statues thus enflesh a
                common, taskless existence. Their “supreme indifference” is indifference to the
                world of differentiation itself, the world of tasks and progress, of improvement,
                deferral, and futurity: the world of Man.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    For a similar logic of indifference and nonproductivity in Shelley’s contemporary
                                Friedrich Schelling, see Kirill Chepurin’s “Indifference and the
                                World: Schelling’s Pantheism of Bliss.”</note> 
                As the pun on “unconceiving marble” suggests, the statues have no child gestating or
                project into futurity; there is no work or task to be fulfilled, no condition to be
                improved, nothing to be accomplished or realized, because existence is always
                already “eternal[ly]” in fruition, immanently what it is—let be. The name for this
                release, this immaculate nonconception, is
                love: “the eternal fruition of love.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    In an article discussing the importance of Shelley’s reading and translation of Spinoza for <hi rend="italic">The Last
                                Man</hi>, Eileen Hunt Botting links Shelley's notion of love (in the novel and a poem where she writes “I wed eternity”), 
                    with its emphasis on “immanence and embodiment,” to Spinoza’s philosophy (1137). 
                    Along these lines I also want to acknowledge Diana Newby’s dissertation 
                    chapter on Shelley’s Spinozism in <hi rend="italic">The Last
                        Man</hi>, which I was able to read and learn from while finishing edits on this essay. And see Newby’s “Race, Vitalism and the Contingency of Contagion in
                    Mary Shelley’s The Last Man.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> We might see in this immanent non-realization an illustration of Anne-Lise François’s subtly ecological — more
                explicit in her recent work — ethics of non-productivity, “(non)fulfillment,” and “freedom from work” in her book <hi rend="italic">Open Secrets</hi> (58, xvi). If there is an ethics and a form of
                relationality modeled, however forbiddingly, by the statues’ embrace, it is clearly
                not grounded in any notion of sympathy. Verney rebukes the statues for their “<hi rend="italic">unsympathizing</hi>” air, desiring some form of recognition that
                their presence — a presence immanent in itself yet alien to the world — will not yield.
                The statues’ refusal of sympathy, and their simultaneous modeling of a kind of
                immanent commonality and love that is without sympathy and “without pathos”
                (Sexton), return us to the earlier scene that demonstrated the exclusions built into
                the paradigm of sympathy: Verney’s encounter with the “negro half clad,” to which
                this scene bears striking parallels. In both episodes, Verney “los[es him]self” in
                communion (here in “reverie,” earlier being “overcome” without “reflection”) only then to dissever himself from
                relation and react violently. Just as in the earlier scene he felt the Black man
                “clasp” his body and perceived it an assault, responding angrily, the same verb
                returns here as Verney himself “clasp[s]” the statues in fury, “reproach[ing] them”
                with “wild accents” and “bitter mockery.” And similarly here as before, there is a
                ghost of a kiss. Where earlier Verney exchanged breaths with the dying man, their
                mouths close in the offer of a kiss, here Verney attempts to infiltrate and join the
                endless kiss of Cupid and Psyche: “coming between Cupid and his Psyche’s lips, [I]
                pressed the unconceiving marble.” Each of the two kisses promises contact with a
                presence that is not Man, but these promises, ciphers of another life, dissolve
                before the last man in different ways. Verney pulls away from the first kiss from
                the dying man, siphoning his life for inoculation, while he is closed off from the
                statues’ futureless kiss, still retaining his desire to be Man (and rebuking the
                statues for being otherwise). The last man in this way wishes to remain the last
                Man; Verney is unwilling to accede to a life without task, to some other kind of
                relationality with other beings and with the earth. Yet this refusal lets a question
                linger: what if the wholly “other shapes” we desire are already immanent, right in
                front of us, in the form of a kiss that harbors the eternal fruition of a life both
                alien and common?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> invites us to think a different image
                of humanity that is not beholden to the sovereign solitude of Man, and in this way,
                to quote Wynter again, to “collectively give humanness a different future,” opening
                new configurations of a common “we” (“Unparalleled Catastrophe” 73). 
                This image other than Man would harbor a different ecology, a different 
                relation to the earth—one not grounded in sovereignty, mastery,
                or tasks of improvement. Like the statues’ eternal fruition, this form of life is
                immanent, already realized in the relationality that constitutes every fleshly
                entanglement (however powerfully and violently denied). The numerous environmental
                catastrophes in <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> are an essential part of its
                explicitly prophetic vision, an intimation of how the hierarchically differentiated
                and racialized construct of Man would produce what Verney calls a “funereal earth”
                (LM 440), but what is now called the Anthropocene, a “new geological epoch . . . built from slavery and colonialism
                (Lewis and Maslin 320). It is the novel’s indictment of itself and its world that it
                can easier imagine the extinction of humanity than the end of the idea of Man. Yet
                    <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>’s experiment in political ecology is not
                only a critique - it is also the adumbration of something else.</p>
                  <p> One of the wagers of this essay has been its preliminary attempt to place Mary Shelley
                in dialogue with theoretical discourses, especially in Black Studies, on the
                “abolition of Man” and the “dethroning of Man and uttering new forms of life”
                (Weheliye 138; Walcott 192). Continuing to do so can help reframe Romanticism by sharpening our attention to the constitutive exclusions and erasures of
                Romanticism’s world (which is our world) and also by revitalizing the speculative habits inherent in Romanticism’s critique
                of Enlightenment and, more generally, its critique of the
                proper. Following this path would be one way of taking up Verney’s final
                inscription, an overture to a coming community written on a building to no one or to no Man: 
                “Friend, come! I wait for thee!” (LM 456).<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    Compare in <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> the creature’s haunting final inscription, 
                    scratched in stones and trees, left for Victor Frankenstein: “Come on, my enemy” (174).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Disentangling the extinction of humanity from the abolition of Man involves imagining
                and inhabiting other forms of life, though not as a <hi rend="italic">task</hi> to
                be actualized but a re-expression of something already immanent:
                some trace of the common, the flesh, the earth, that the world keeps us from seeing,
                in part by setting us to our tasks (but who, “us”?). <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    Man</hi> presents one image of humanity, Man, and narrates its downfall—but the
                book is cast as a prophecy, which is less a prediction than it is a warning. </p>

                  <p> On the last day of February 2020, I received an email letting me know that this
                Romantic Circles Praxis volume on Political Ecology, with my essay on Mary Shelley’s
                    <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, was kicking back into gear for publication.
                This same day, Feb. 29th, 2020, was the day of the first reported death in the United States
                from the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19 (though it would later be
                discovered there had been at least two earlier undetected deaths). This essay was
                finished in the summer of 2019 essentially as is, and while I have decided not to
                make any substantial or timely changes to it in light of the current moment, the
                pandemic seems to demand some extra reflection from readers of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Last Man</hi>. It is certainly eerie to return to my own essay and to Shelley’s monumental novel of
                twenty-first-century plague now, in mid-May 2020, as COVID-19 ravages on into what looks to be a grim summer and year
                ahead. Though long overshadowed in popular consciousness by <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> was quickly thrust into
                the news in the early days of the pandemic, mentioned prominently in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>,<note place="foot" resp="author">

                has the plague” (LM 242). But like prophecy, literature does not give easy lessons
                and always exceeds any time or conditions that would await its proper arrival. Of
                course, and despite the “all” encoded in the <hi rend="italic">pan</hi> of pandemic,
                all the world does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have the plague—infection and fatality
                numbers in the United States show huge racial disparities, with
                Latinx, Indigenous, and especially Black
                people disproportionately suffering. The racial parameters of who counts as Man
                continue to enforce a differential vulnerability, with some protected and others sacrificed as a kind of social
                inoculation. Perhaps, as Sexton suggests in a different context, this world itself
                is the pathogen for such a situation<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  <p> Somewhere in the flurry of intellectual commentary on COVID-19 that has rapidly emerged, it
                was pointed out that the virus’s name derives from the arch-symbol of sovereignty:
                    <hi rend="italic">corona</hi>, meaning crown. Corona is indeed the crown, but
                only the crown, of the preexisting politico-economic regimes of sovereignty and governance that ever more brutally set
                tasks for those workers it deems essential, which is to say dispensable. These tasks
                must be done, without any real overarching changes, so that this world can reproduce
                itself and its hierarchies—so that it can “<hi rend="italic">go on</hi>,” in the
                words of the U.S. president, the supposed sovereign, who <ref target="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237027356314869761">tweeted</ref> on March 9th, 2020: 
                
            <quote>“So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000
                and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this
                moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about
                that!” </quote>
                
            I am fascinated by the ampersanded zeugma here, which encrypts a whole world logic: “Nothing is shut down, <hi rend="italic">life &amp; the economy go on</hi>.” Maybe the real question is how
                to break the zeugma between “life” and “the economy,” the zeugma that governs
                everything. How to make everything refuse to “go on”; how to expel sovereignty and
                economy from enclosing and hierarchically differentiating, or gradating, fleshly
                life; how to desert, leave, destitute, quit, abdicate the whole complex, this world
                and age of Man. What community, or what “other forms of being” and “communings”
                would come after (LM 420)? Relation is still possible with physical distancing, when
                not touching can be care; and flickers of other communings are showing up in
                emerging mutual-aid networks, organized rent strikes, and calls for a debt jubilee
                and general strike. We might think of such a strike — “strike,” the original meaning
                of <hi rend="italic">plaga</hi>, "plague", — as a refusal of tasks and an affirmation of a
                taskless common life. Another cipher of the shadowed future could be detected in the
                graffiti message showing up in different places of late, posing a simple question:
                “The Economy, or Life?” This graffiti might be answered by another graffiti message,
                one left by the last man to those to
                follow – “Friend, come! I wait for thee!” (LM 456).

                  <head>Introduction: We Fight for Grass</head>
                  <p> What may be the first appearance of “political ecology” in print offers no distinct
                definition or theorization. Yet Frank Thone’s little think piece entitled “We Fight
                for Grass,” which appeared under that heading in the <hi rend="italic">Science News
                    Letter</hi> of January 5, 1935, does articulate a strange, age-old parable of
                colonial avarice and climatic revenge. The topos long predates both the inauguration
                of the natural science of “ecology” in the 1860s and its self-conscious
                politicization in the 1970s, not to mention the splashy advent of a quite different
                sense of “political ecology” in (post) humanistic theory by way of Jane Bennett’s
                2010 monograph, <hi rend="italic">Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of
                Things</hi>. Visions of what might be called “ecological retribution” — and their
                utopian counterpart, “ecological jubilee” — were to be the subject of this essay, for
                the sake of ecocriticism and Romantic “political ecology” avant la lettre, long
                before I stumbled upon a variant here, at one minor, modern origin of the phrase.
                Yet its presence, I think, promotes Thone’s much-dismissed “We Fight for Grass” into
                a revealing emblem for the ongoing challenge of “political ecology” in the
                text-based disciplines and a concise introduction to the present essay. </p>
                  <p> In Thone’s 1935 iteration of “political ecology,” the fantasy of ecological
                retribution arrives at the height of an unwieldy analogy that compares the
                incursions of Imperial Japan in Outer Mongolia to “the Indian Fighting days of our
                own West” (14). While “to be sure, there are differences,” Thone boils both
                conflicts down to an age-old antagonism between settlers and nomads: native peoples
                who “fight for grass” — pasture for their ruminant food sources — against the conquering
                plowshares of an “emergent empire” (14). The terms of the analogy are thus
                technically mythic even before the author actually compares Mongolian horsemen to
                “Centaurs” (14). The toil of tilling the soil divides fallen life from Paradise in
                Judaeo-Christian theology and the Golden Age from the rest in Greco-Roman cosmogony;
                Reformation theology and Enlightenment stadial historicism redefined such declension 
                as progress and ranked human societies accordingly. None of these mythic backgrounds
                are incidental to the present inquiry. But what matters most is the moral climax of
                “We Fight for Grass,” when Thone suddenly pivots to the Dust Bowl then afflicting
                the North American prairies. His political ecology casts this catastrophe as a
                modality of attenuated, indigenous revenge:
         
            <quote>The Indians fought for grass. They lost. The plow broke sod farther and farther
                westward, until in the mad, wheat-hungry years of the World War grasslands that
                never should have been turned over at all were broken and put into grain. Then came
                drought, grass-hoppers, dust storms; the Indians were in part avenged. Now we seek
                to replace the vanished grass. (14)</quote>
         
                At a distance of 85 years, the ideologies in play make easy targets. Grasslands
                “turned over” by an agentless “plow” elide their seizure through genocidal acts of
                “Indian Removal” (juridical, military, and biopolitical) that the author will
                neither query nor name. “We seek to replace the vanished grass,” Thone concludes,
                yet fail to imagine reparations for the (putatively) “vanished” people, let alone
                grasp how the two projects would be inseparable. Though a tone of regret replaces
                that of triumph, Thone’s grass-up, ecological retelling of political conflict leaves
                the fatalist logic of Manifest Destiny and its myth of the Vanishing Indian intact. </p>
                  <p> Yet it is precisely this heady mix of ecological regret and ethnocultural
                unaccountability that may make Thone’s New Deal “political ecology” a
                still-pertinent emblem for the state of our art. Rewriting episodes of imperial
                conquest from the angle of the grass, the effort prefigures now familiar forms of an
                ecologically motivated “nonhuman turn” and their increasingly notorious political
                shortcomings when it comes to those Sylvia Wynter names “Man’s human Others” (Wynter
                and Scott 174). Influential new materialist, object-oriented, posthumanist, and
                Anthropocene theories have been charged justly with “resounding silence” on matters
                of race and colonial history, above all by scholars in Black and critical ethnic
                studies whose thought, by force rather than belated epiphany, has proceeded in
                proximity to categories like animality, thing-hood and the land (Z. I. Jackson 216;
                Karera, 34, 47). The elision of pertinent non-white, non-Northern expertise marks
                the recent genealogy of “political ecology” as well. Giving the term new life in <hi rend="italic">Vibrant Matter</hi>, Bennett neglected to acknowledge the
                the full-fledged academic discipline that
                already bore the same name. Centered in the study of the global South, Political Ecology
                was born among mid-century decolonization struggles and infused the purportedly
                apolitical natural science of ecology with the insights and methods of critical
                geography, Marxian structural analysis, cultural ecology, peasant and agrarian
                studies, and systems and dependency theory, frequently in open opposition to Third
                World development policies and in open alliance with indigenous and peasant
                    movements.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  <p> What is the connection between eliding minoritized people and thought in some
                variants of “political ecology” and the tendency to figure climate catastrophe as a
                modality of their revenge? In what ways does “Anthropocene” discourse license again,
                and with all scientific rigor, an understanding of the weather as payback for crimes
                of history? Can such moralization constitute anything other than repressed theology?
                The theological echoes in this essay's key terms, ecological "retribution" and "jubilee,” are meant to welcome this latter question. The following
                contribution to the problem of “political ecology” seeks to explore
                this ideologically fraught mode of merging, or submerging, human histories of
                exploitation into the action of (also exploited) terrestrial elements — including some
                improbably radical, utopian variations on the theme.</p>
                  <p> Limits of time and training do not permit me to remedy the missed encounter between
                the two materialist formations of “political ecology” sketched above — the one a
                critical natural and social science, the other a posthumanist ontology of
                relation — by properly interdisciplinary, hemispheric means. What I can do is plumb my
                European Romantic archive for the site that prefigures this encounter with the
                greatest intensity, soliciting a practice of reading informed by critical ecologies
                of race. This site is the highly vulnerable, even confused conjuncture between
                materialist natural philosophy, Jacobin internationalism, antislavery and commercial
                empire bodied forth as <hi rend="italic">botany</hi> (c.f. “We Fight for Grass”) in
                Erasmus Darwin’s 1791 epic, <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Vegetation.</hi>
                Exemplifying the wider logic of “ecological retribution” and “ecological jubilee”,
                Darwin’s materialist epic and associated satire envision elements of exploited earth <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                dispossessed people conspiring to avenge or overthrow regimes of colonization,
                expropriation, and enslavement. I take seriously the way this problematic gesture contests, at a stroke, the progress
                of empire, the rule of “natural law,” and normative expectations about which
                kinds of terrestrial beings are capable of moral and political action. </p>
                  <p> The first part of this essay locates the poetic and political roots of Jacobin
                ecological jubilee in Golden Age pastoral, with that tradition's peculiar credulity regarding the
                political partisanship of other-than-human natures. Darwin’s engagement with this
                tradition is never finally dissociable from the English Enlightenment ideologies of
                which his “Lunar Society” circle formed the liberal and dissenting vanguard,
                including familiar and still fatal forms of techno-utopian optimism. Yet I attempt
                to isolate that aspect of Darwin’s techno-pastoral that exceeded such mystifications
                and apologetics, frightening his contemporaries with a vision of communal luxury
                that extended past both the rights-bearing category of the citizen-subject and the
                purportedly universal community of humanitarian sentiment, into the (supposedly)
                extra-political terrain of the earth.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Against the reflexive tendency to figure the
                            earth as power’s apolitical ground, see Diran and Traisnel’s elaboration
                            of “geopower”—the “unspoken corollary” of Foucauldian biopolitics that
                            regulates the relation between living and nonliving realms, populations
                            and lands, 33–34.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Turning from ecological jubilee to ecological retribution, the second part of this
                essay delves into the most geological and abolitionist canto of Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Economy of Vegetation</hi>, teasing out the overdetermined
                connections between racialized blackness and the energetic humus of appropriated
                earth that Darwin’s poetry confusedly mobilizes. The section focuses on Darwin’s
                repeated engagements with the period’s most iconic antislavery icon, Josiah
                Wedgwood’s mass-produced cameo of a pleading slave in chains. I argue that Darwin’s
                due diligence to the extractive sources of both industrial manufacture and geological
                knowledge combines with his “relief poetics” — a compositional commitment to bestowing
                figure on the material that usually passes for ground — to issue distinctly
                anti-humanitarian and illiberal incitements to vengeance against slavery and
                colonization. In the militant visions of ecological retribution that ensue by the
                close of this “Earth Canto,” human and inhuman victims of this process collaborate
                    <hi rend="italic">to inhume</hi> the transatlantic traffic known as “The
                Inhuman Trade.”</p>
                  <p> In contrast to the new materialist vogue for leveling hierarchies in the domain of ontology,
                I argue, Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Economy of Vegetation</hi> belongs to the
                prehistory of ecological reckoning with social class, racial caste, and colonial
                history — that is, with the differential distribution of harm, culpability,
                resistance, and reparation that is the substance of ecological justice. Taken
                together, the Jacobin and abolitionist dimensions of his materialist “economy of
                nature” illuminate, in their intersection, both the ideological and the utopian
                horizons of a genuinely
                <hi rend="italic">political </hi>ecology. </p>

                  <p> After several decades of restitution by historians of literature and science, Erasmus
                Darwin’s encyclopedic oeuvre at last requires no general introduction in a venue
                such as this.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                Despite the long-term triumph of a rival Romantic aesthetics that noisily broke with
                the doctor-poet’s prosody, philosophy, and politics, <hi rend="italic">The Botanic
                    Garden</hi> (1791) is now recognized quite simply as “the most popular and the most controversial
                nature poem of the 1790s” (Bewell
                <hi rend="italic">Natures </hi>53). The poem in fact comprises
                two epic, didactic parts, <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Vegetation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Loves of the Plants</hi>.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Though it would constitute “Part 2” of

                sexuality will reenter this inquiry, our ultimate focus is <hi rend="italic">The
                    Economy of Vegetation</hi>. Following the Lucretian trick of shifting focus from
                single, bounded, perceptible bodies to the plural, subliminal, elemental media that
                pass through and between them, <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Vegetation</hi>
                treats botanical bodies — in so far as they metabolize water, light, earth, and air — as
                privileged organs for the disclosure, the making phenomenal, of every chemical and
                energetic interchange on the globe. In each of the poem’s four Cantos, the “Goddess
                of Botany” summons one elemental constituency (Earth, Air, Water, and Fire,
                respectively), and proceeds to chronicle the action of its members “as they may be
                supposed to affect the growth of vegetables” (v).<note place="foot" resp="author">In a nod to the radical Enlightenment

                            “Gnomes!,” Air elements as “Sylphs!,” Water elements as “Nymphs,” and
                            Fire elements as “Salamanders!”. </note> 
                At this point, the staggering array of topics that bear upon plant life and love in this poem comes
                into view. As we can see from “the Argument” of any given Canto (Figure 1), the poem
                leaps from chemical to mythological, natural philosophical, technological, and even
                world-historical registers, compassing celebrations of the “Liberty of America; of
                Ireland; of France” and denunciations of the slave trade and the Spanish colonial
                “Destruction of Mexico”  (57-58).</p>
                  <p> My aim in this section is to take seriously (if no less comedically!) the pertinence of
                revolutionary, anti-colonial, and abolitionist causes to an <hi rend="italic">Economy of Vegetation</hi>, right up to the absurd, limit-possibility of
                politically partisan vegetables. Previous scholars have shown that Darwin’s critics
                on the British right provide acute diagnoses of the political and aesthetic threats
                his botany posed in the 1790s.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Catherine Packham, Devin Griffiths, Noel Jackson,

                English Romanticists’ attention to James Gillray’s 1798 cartoon “New Morality,”
                (Figure 2; Bewell 1989), published in the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin Magazine

                The piece is an extraordinary visual condensation of the culture war (from 1793, also an actual war)
                excited in Britain by the French Revolution. There is much late-Directorate topical
                specificity on evidence here: a nightmare scenario in which President

                The invading monster has an English face, that of the Whig
                Duke of Bedford, and carries other prominent Whig politicians on its back; they are
                wafted into London on a frothy tide of revolutionary fervor that had, at least since
                Edmund Burke’s <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</hi>
                (1790), been figured as intoxicating liquor bubbling across the channel. A
                print-media “cornucopia of ignorance,” labeled with the names of a number of liberal
                press outlets, echoes the beast’s fat form: it overflows with ten years of English
                left-ish writing, from Coleridge and Southey to Priestley, Tooke, Godwin, and
                Wollstonecraft.</p>
                  <p> Bewell urged Romanticists to zero in on the tiny flower-seller (Figure 3) in the
                distant middle ground of the image, just before the ad hominem caricatures of
                political figures and their works fade into an anonymous popular mob. The flowers in
                the seller’s basket are blossoming into a riot of bonnet rouges, and the little
                label beneath reads “Zoonomia” — the title of Erasmus Darwin’s medical magnum opus on
                animal life (1794–96) — followed by the perfectly incriminating subtitle, “Jacobin
                Plants.” “Zoonomia . . . or Jacobin Plants”: pithy proof that Darwin’s botany was
                perceived as a partisan endeavor in the 1790s and of whose side it was on. Bewell
                moved outward from here to reevaluate botany in the period as the locus of a
                “radical form of pastoral poetry”. Thanks to his reading and
                others, we now understand Darwin’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Loves of the Plants </hi>as Exhibit A for
                an English libertine botany that mobilized plant sexuality as a polymorphically
                perverse challenge to the contemporary mating rites of British humans ("Jacobin Plants" 132). Darwin’s
                “flowery porn,” as Tristanne Connolly put it, outraged conservative critics, not
                least because the pleasures of botanical reading were so frequently enjoyed by
                    women.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In
                            addition to Conolly, see, recently and especially, Kelley, 78–93. I
                            borrow the term “libertine botany” from Meeker and Szabari, who deftly
                            theorize an early modern modality of botanical erotics that treats plant
                            life as “animated by desire yet without interiority,” capable of
                            multiplying affect, animation, and pleasure across different kind of
                            material bodies — rather than subjecting plants to an Enlightenment logic
                            of analogy that constrains them to model human sexuality or subjectivity
                            (479–80). Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Loves of the Plants</hi> occupies
                            an ambivalent place in this brilliant analysis, evincing at once a
                            profoundly libertine “affective involvement in animated matter,” driven
                            by plants’ ability to “engender the technologies that allow us to be
                            affected by them,” and a tendency to foreclose such possibilities
                            through the anthropocentric conceit of plant “marriage”
                        (485–86).</note> Yet it is less clear how a pastoral that is
                radical in the sphere of gender and sexuality connects to the adjective “Jacobin”
                that would seem to stand instead, in Gillray’s cartoon and in the English
                conservative imagination, as a loose cipher for a somewhat different social
                threat — that of popular, transnational Revolutionism. Visually, the blooming Liberty
                Caps in Darwin’s basket amplify the raised arms and open mouths of a threatening,
                jubilant mob.</p>
                  <p> Let’s, then, draw out the cartoon’s stranger and more hilarious accusation that
                Darwinian botany is a botany in which plants take a political side, sporting or
                sprouting Phyrigian caps as partisans of liberty. Might other-than-human natures
                have moral and political prowesses and preferences, in addition to, or even as a
                subset of, their <hi rend="italic">Loves</hi>? Here it is as if, to quote that later,
                flower-powered, libidinal revolutionist, Herbert Marcuse “Nature, too, awaits the
                Revolution” (74).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Compare Bewell’s witty nod to 1960s “flower-power”
                            in “Jacobin Plants” (132); on the Anthropocene relevance of “libidinal
                            ecology” (including Marcuse), see Pettman and Grebowicz.</note>
                Reading Gillray’s image against itself, we can see that it bears hostile witness to
                something very like this thesis: not only flowers, but fish, fowl, reptiles,
                amphibians, and other mammals swell the ranks of the revolutionary invasion. A
                metamorphic front of half-human chimera (avian, simian, reptilian . . . asinine!)
                conveys the purportedly degrading message that it is the animal in human
                beings that drives their transnationally militant works and acts (in the guise of
                Jacobin “phil-anthropy”). </p>
                  <p> We are supposed to laugh, of course, but also to be afraid. In the eyes of his
                critics, it seems, Darwin and his crew of enthusiastic, polymathic, dissenting
                Enlightenment savants — the Lunar Society, as they called themselves — represented a
                dangerous, Francophilic form of socially Utopian naturalism that drew force and
                authority from the wider, para-juridical domain of the earth. This position is
                clearly part — but not, I think, a well-grasped part — of the long-term rise of “natural
                right” political philosophy in general and of Jacobin “natural Republicanism” in
                particular (Edelstein 1–25). It is also clearly connected, as Devin Griffiths has
                recently argued, to Darwin’s increasing notoriety as a theorist of biological
                    evolution.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Griffiths has persuasively argued that the intensifying vitriol (and
                            satirical assault) against Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Botanic
                                Garden</hi> in the later 1790s had much to do with the poems’
                            reappraisal through the prism of his later, biomedical masterwork
                            <hi rend="italic">Zoonomia </hi>(1794–96), which
                            advanced an overtly evolutionary theory of organic life. In hindsight,
                            Griffiths argues, the <hi rend="italic">Botanic Garden</hi> was reread
                            as a threatening “evolutionary epic” (#54). On this reading, the
                            metamorphic, multispecies front in Gillray’s “New Morality” primarily
                            represents (conservative skepticism of) an all-encompassing, progressive
                            theory of evolution (79–80), rather than his politics of revolution.
                            Indeed, Griffith ultimately concurs with such critics that Darwin
                            “powerfully confused biological development with social progress” (80),
                            arguing that his epic evolutionism foundered on an inability to discover
                            a “less teleological” historicism that could “admit diversification,
                            uncertainty, and the contingency of change” (55):
                            <quote>In its implicit addresses to an audience that comprises not merely all of humanity, but all of nature, the <hi rend="italic"> Botanic Garden</hi> gestures toward a unitary history without
                                granularity or uncertainty. It is a fatal problem, in so far as it
                                leaves the poem unable to address the most important event of its
                                day. Despite Darwin’s noted advocacy, and the most suspicious
                                readings of Canning, Frere, and others, the French Revolution finds
                                no place in the poem, even as the revolution reflects the poem’s
                                guiding problem: whether order emerges from freedom. (80)</quote>
                In the context of Griffith’s serious and important
                            new reading, it is puzzling that this final assertion is, frankly,
                            false. <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden </hi>in
                            fact contains a famous and immediately influential passage on the French
                            Revolution (<hi rend="italic">Economy of Vegetation</hi>, Canto 2,
                            ll.377–94), and the poem’s notoriously willy-nilly (far from
                            “teleological”) incorporation of topical events is precisely what must
                            be explained (see Packham, n13, below). Darwin’s sense of natural and
                            social history is, moreover, “granular” and “contingent” in an a
                            technical, neo-Lucretian sense, rigorously theorizing the connection
                            between natural and cultural pattern-formation through a sense of
                            “habit” that extends deep into nonhuman being (Goldstein, “Nerve Poetry”
                            5#). Perhaps Griffith’s criticism was meant for Darwin’s later epic, <hi rend="italic">The Temple of Nature</hi> (1803), rather than <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi>? It would then need to contend
                            with Martin Priestman’s work on the political and social arguments
                            contained in that poem’s suppressed outline, <hi rend="italic">The
                                Progress of Society</hi>.</note> 
                Yet both these orientations would read the flora and fauna in this image as allegories for <hi rend="italic">human</hi> degradation. How might we instead thicken the notion of
                “radical pastoral” to account for the ridiculous and/or dire possibility of
                multinatural revolutionism found in Darwin’s representations of plant animacy and
                    love?<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            “Multinaturalism” comes from the anthropologist Eduardo
                            Viveiros de Castro’s studies of IAmerindian American cosmological
                            perspectivalism in its difference from modern Western multiculturalism.
                            While multiculturalism presumes “the unity of nature and the plurality
                            of cultures,” or many partial representations of one natural reality
                            external to representation, Amerindian perspectivalism supposes “one
                            ‘culture,’ multiple ‘natures,’” wherein radically different beings have
                            in common the figure that “one sees of oneself when one says ‘I’”
                            (58–60). I import the term not in its full anthropological specificity
                            but rather to emphasize a commitment to natures, plural, and the effects
                            of such pluralization. It seems to me that in the radical pastoral
                            perspective under discussion, nature is no guarantor of unity or
                            lawfulness, and yet attributes of mental/moral culture usually reserved
                            for human subjects are presumed throughout. Bewell separately coins the
                            term “multi-naturalism” in <hi rend="italic">Natures in Translation</hi>
                            to denote a modern, “cosmopolitan” sense of “nature” that is no longer
                            bound to place: the nature discoverable in botanic gardens was “composed
                            of strangers, of immigrants, of foreign plants that have traveled from
                            far across the globe” whose diversity represents the reach and interests
                            of British commercial empire (74, 79). “Multinaturalism” in this sense
                            thus operates as analogue and corollary (rather than reversal) of
                            modern Western “multiculturalism.”</note>

                            satires of Erasmus Darwin’s work in fact stressed its aleatory
                            qualities. Caricaturing the “fundamental failure of any system of

                            effectively indicted the “chaos” of democratic politics with the same
                            brush (166–67). Their reinvestment in literary decorum, Packham shows,

(Cheekily mistranslated to imply, yes, plants without pants.) In fact, <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> attempts to expose the whole Darwinian project
                of versified botany as an awkward, obvious attempt to clothe the “broad,” “brawny”
                butts of the Paris street in decorous poetic breeches. “Attend,” calls the poem’s
                pseudo-Darwin to his sans-culottist comrade, “While in Rhyme’s Galligaskins I
                enclose / The broad posteriors of thy brawny prose” (B2).</p>
                  <p> Like Gillray’s cartoon, <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> parody singles out for
                special ridicule the theme of nonhuman natures collaborating and rejoicing in the
                Revolution. “Skip, skip ye Mountains! Forests lend your Ears!,” calls “Darwin (5).” For
                under the rule of “red-capt Liberty” and “fair Philosophy” that the poem heralds,
                tongue-in-cheek, a two-fold revolution transpires (5, 4): while the human
                sans-culottes level their social hierarchy “to the mean muck of low Equality,” the
                curse of human labor relaxes, and other natures assert their own technicity (11).
                Plants spontaneously metamorphose into luxurious foodstuffs and manufactures, much
                to the delight of the rural and urban poor, who are left idle by the newfound productivity
                of louche, transgressively animate Darwinian vegetables. In a return to the
                effortless luxury of the mythic Golden Age, stock Georgic characters like the busy
                dairymaid swiftly regress to lazily gathering “Rich Cream and Butter from [a] herd of
                Trees” (10). By the climax of this part of the poem, plants have assumed the
                manufacture of complex commodities and luxury goods: “Tallow Candles tip the modest
                Thorn, / Candles of Wax the prouder Elm adorn!”; atop another grove, “Where leaves
                once grew, now periwigs of Hair!” (7).</p>
                  <p> The most obvious target of the parodist’s extravagant vegetable grotesques is a
                certain form of techno-scientific hubris. Darwin, Beddoes, and their Lunar Society
                cohort were at the forefront of the coal-, steam-, and expropriation-powered
                industrial modernization of the English Midlands; at the dawn of an “Anthropocene”
                age frequently dated to their precise generation and social set, they helped pioneer
                a now familiar and still feckless variety of techno-utopian futurism. In places in
                    <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi>, Darwin apostrophizes steam power,
                prophecies air travel, and projects geo-engineering as a modality of climate
                    control.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                        Launching the term “Anthropocene” in 2000, Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer 
                        proposed dating the epoch to Lunar Society member James Watt’s 1784 patent on the 
                        double-acting steam engine. Many dates, logics, and critiques have since been proposed;

                        and their afterlives.</note>
                Taking as an epigraph one of Beddoes’s particularly enthusiastic speculations — “May
                we not, by regulating the vegetable functions, teach our Woods &amp; Hedges to
                supply us with Butter &amp; Tallow?” — the parody is out to caricature Lunar readiness
                to meddle in the natural order of things as well as to prophecy the monstrous
                consequences of a notably Godless faith in scientific miracles. </p>
                  <p> This rather familiar form of anti-Promethean caution against Beddoes’s and Darwin’s
                visionary experimentalism is not entirely fair.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    In context, Beddoes’s idea involves both
                            less technological hubris and less magical thinking than the parody lets
                            on. The excerpted question comes at the end of an
                            anything-but-fantastical passage on the healthful and useful properties
                            of actually existing botanical butters. Beddoes wants to know whether some such
                            plant could be bred and cultivated in England, and, in a question of
                            ongoing ecological import, whether a plant-based diet might better and
                            more efficiently nourish the British populace. In fact, in general, his
                                <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi>’ sense of how science could
                            alleviate social misery has less to do with “techno-fixes”—the hallmark
                            of which is to avoid or cut through the messy realm of political
                            contestation—than with the social reorganization of science that
                            Revolution must entail. He literally wants to know what medicine could
                            achieve were it not “exclusively at the disposal of Despots and Juntos”
                            (Beddoes iv).</note> 
                But what I wish to emphasize instead is
                that the parodist also picks up on, and exaggerates to the point of caricature, a
                different, though perhaps equally delusive and damaging, form of techno-utopian
                ecology in Erasmus Darwin’s sans-culottist botanical poetry. For beyond the epigraph
                in this instructive spoof, cessation of labor becomes its crucial theme: pastoral
                <hi rend="italic">otium </hi> in the key of freedom from toil,
                carrying with it release from the exigency to transform, combat, coerce, or exchange
                other natures. What humans (specifically, the “frisky French” and their English
                admirers) <hi rend="italic">do </hi>in
                <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age </hi>parody is violently
                revolutionize their social order, delivering the “gigantic blow” that lays Royalty,
                Monarchy, Ministry, Bigotry, Slavery, and God “low” (12–14). What other natures do,
                in the solidarity that the parodist sarcastically calls their “happiness” and
                “triumph,” is pitch in to resolve the resultant crisis in production. Their
                generous, generative metamorphoses realize and surpass that fundamental demand of
                the sans-culottes — "Equality <hi rend="italic">and Bread</hi>!” — which itself pushed
                past the domain of liberal political rights and into the realm of “animal” need
                (Soboul 43–52; Simmons 1–12).
                <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age </hi>epistle culminates in a
                materialist burlesque in which the people Burke famously characterized as a “swinish
                multitude” party with an actual multitude of pigs (among other flora and fauna),
                flourishing on uncoerced plenty and rejoicing in their general “<hi rend="italic">nudity of Breech!</hi>” (15, 12)</p>
                  <p> Sketched here in negative, unflattering caricature, then, would seem to be a vision
                of not-merely-human “communal luxury” that, as an ecological ethos, would be
                deliciously, improbably predicated on working less <note place="foot"> I borrow the
                            evocative and technically apt phrase “communal luxury” from Kristen
                            Ross’s study of the practical imaginary of the Paris commune; see
                            especially 39–66.</note> 
                Focused on setting their social relations in order, the Europeans in the poem relent in their intensive
                transformation and domination of the (rest of the) natural world. And rather than
                occasioning a reversion to wilderness or (ig)noble savagery, this cessative ethos
                gives place to the ingenuity, artfulness, and technics of natures not
                usually credited with such powers. Deriving the latter vision from Darwin requires
                little hyperbole: <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi>, as we shall see,
                everywhere attributes technical and cultural ingenuity to flora, in extension of
                their powers of erotic and physiological transformation. Belonging, as <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> parodist emphatically signals, to the
                proto-utopian genres of Golden Age myth, pastoral poetry, and belly-centric Land of
                Cockaigne folklore, the Lunar Society’s experimental philosophy and poetry thus
                hazards the insane, intoxicating possibility that the supposedly immutable “natural
                law” said to govern the non-human realm may be as fungible as our “positive” and
                “civil” law. What if scarcity, competition, and toil were “necessities” not of
                Nature but of liberal political economy, laws of a zero-sum system transposed (and
                enforced) upon an Earth quite capable of behaving differently? If the rules of the
                    <hi rend="italic">oikos</hi> were changed, do we really know what other natures
                would do? On what grounds do we assume that moral, cultural, technical, and
                political capacity in nature actually begin and end in those beings currently
                overrepresented as rights-bearing citizens and subjects of moral sensibility?
                “Shout, shout, ye Meads! . . . ye Corn-fields, raise your happy heads!” (15)</p>
                  <p> Lest deriving this eco-utopian vision of multinatural jubilee from its derisive
                caricature seem farfetched, consider that the apocryphal
                <hi rend="italic">Golden Age </hi>epistle seemed so very like
                something Erasmus Darwin would write that he felt compelled to publicly disavow
                authorship in the <hi rend="italic">Derby Mercury</hi> (King-Hele 250). Though
                hardly a subtle piece of work, the anonymous parody persists in “the odd distinction of
                having been read ‘straight,’” and it continues, to this day, to be misattributed to
                Erasmus Darwin in some library catalogs and criticism (Faubert 454; Reiman xii–ix;
                Priestman 199n12). Martin Priestman convincingly suggests that an embarrassing
                similarity between anti-Jacobin parodies like
                <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age </hi>and an epic that Darwin
                actually had underway in the late 1790s — a poem in which, according to extant notes,
                “Liberty returns, and leads the golden age” under the aegis of “mild Philosophy” and
                Nature in the Lucretian shape of <hi rend="italic">“Immortal Love!</hi>” — may have
                motivated Darwin to abandon that genuine Golden Age project (Priestman 261, 193-216).
                Satire and sincerity, original and parody, thrilling possibility and risible absurdity
                blur so thoroughly in the reception of such utopian political ecology that one
                begins to suspect that — as with the term <hi rend="italic">utopian</hi>
                itself — the assumption of derogatory or aspirational connotations, the placement of the line between vision and farce, reveals less about the text itself than about a
                given reader's degree of attachment to the present order of things. </p>

                     <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age </hi>parody will not let
                readers forget that there is classical precedent for all this.
                The poem everywhere
                references Virgil’s fourth, “messianic”
                <hi rend="italic">Eclogue, </hi>notable for infusing Golden Age
                myth into the pastoral mode and for transposing that Age from the mythic past to the
                imminent, political future.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the different origins and character of the pastoral mode,
                            and Golden Age myth, as well as their experimental merger
                            in Roman literature, see Thomas G. Rosenmeyer 214–24.</note>
                What matters about this version of pastoral as a means to capture (and skewer)
                Darwin’s visionary naturalism is that Virgil’s
                <hi rend="italic">Eclogue </hi>borrowed the stirring, Golden
                Age topos of an unforced, unstinting earth — “the fruitful earth unforced bare . . . fruit
                abundantly and without stint” to mortals “free from toil and grief" — and cast this
                condition of uncoerced terrestrial luxury as subject to political restitution
                (Hesiod 117–18, 113). An encomium to his patron Pollio, consul at the time of
                composition, Virgil’s poem augurs the return of the Golden Age under his
                stewardship, prophesying the birth of a divine ruler whose advent brings the very
                earth to pour forth gifts of flowers, fruits, milk, and grain. The anonymous author of <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> satire of Darwin
                suggests that the Lunar Society cohort likewise expects the wholesale
                “renovation of the world," albeit "under the benign influence of French Freedom” (5n).</p>
                  <p> And here, in fact, is the first political-ecological feature to mark the classical
                Golden Age tradition associated, by the 1790s, with experimental utopianism and
                Jacobin internationalism: the notion that plants and animals and winds and waters
                will participate in a new political dispensation, altering the very face of the
                earth. On the horizon of the faltering republic, Virgil’s fourth eclogue forecasts a
                form of theologico-political expiation felt deep into the earth: an alteration that
                would “free the lands from lasting fear" (Lee 57; Virgil 13–14).<note place="foot" resp="author"> “te duce, si
                            qua manet sceleris vestigia nostril / inrita perpetua solvent formidine
                            terras” (Virgil 13–14)</note> While the Golden Age renews under
                the rising sign of empire in Virgil, Ovid’s version harks back to an
                anarcho-communism of terrestrial elements: the earth (<hi rend="italic">humus</hi>)
                “had been a common good, one all could share,” “just like the sunlight and the air”
                (Mandelbaum 8; Ovid 1:135–36). Justice was immanent in such an earth, as we learn when
                She flees it (in person of the goddess Astraea, 1:150); or which we knew already,
                since everything and everyone moves “uncompelled” (<hi rend="italic">inmunis</hi>)
                but righteously (Mandelbaum 6; Ovid 1:101). When Ovid writes that “the Age” — not just its
                men — cultivated faith and rectitude of itself, without law, and without judge or
                protector, he gathers persons, animals, plants, and planet together, in an epoch of
                unforced generativity and righteousness (Ovid 1:89–90).<note place="foot" resp="author"> “Aurea prima sata est aetas, quae
                            vindice nullo, / sponte sua sine lege fidem rectumque colebat” (Ovid
                            1:89–90).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Though their political valences differ diametrically, then, both the Ovidian and the
                Virgilian strains of Golden Age myth share the vision of a nature that answers to
                justice, rather than necessity. They also share in the enactment of a poetic
                reprieve from the labor of coercion that is felt both by those who work the land and the
                land that they work, together: “the soil will suffer hoes no more, nor vines the
                hook” (non rastros patietur humus, non uinea falcem) (Lee 59; Virgil 40). Yet Virgil
                also presses to the point of irony, perhaps to the point of transparent fantasy, the
                Golden Age vision of spontaneous luxury and worklessness without privation. As the
                    <hi rend="italic">Eclogue</hi>’s landscape “spontaneously” overflows with goods
                that conform to aristocratic taste, Virgil — and Darwin’s parodist after him — manages
                to underscore the eye-brow-raising convenience for (certain) humans of that which the
                earth is said to give freely (<hi rend="italic">sponte sua</hi>) in her golden
                    mood.<note place="foot" resp="author">This reading confirms Anabelle Patterson’s thesis that the

                            provocations to explore the connection between literary culture and

                Most hyperbolically, rams and sheep turn themselves rich colors - purple, saffron, scarlet - gamely
                obviating the need to dye their wool or skins. In Virgil's "technicolor" animal skins (Rosenmeyer 217), the later parodist
                of Erasmus Darwin finds his mark: where "nature" is poetically induced past fruiting and farming into 
                textile manufacture and manipulation, there is an emblem for the hubris of experimental philosophy and textual artistry
                at the dawn of the Industrial Age.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                lines and provides the Latin in a footnote to make sure no one misses the reference (5, 5n).</note>
                The parodist clearly sees a distinction without a difference between trying to intervene
                technically in plant fertility (to "regulate the vegetable functions") and the Golden Age
                vision of their spontaneous technicity that he summons to ridicule that project (B2).
                The latter is ideological cover for the former, and both instantiate what <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin</hi>
                satirists on the British right would soon distill as the core Darwinian/Jacobin fallacy:
                "Whatever is, is wrong." The ethos not only inverts the quiescent motto of that responsible 
                couplet artist, Alexander Pope, but also constitutes a dangerous and unchristian suggestion 
                to the rabble that labor is not their lot in this life. </p>
                  <p>For, in fact, in the shadow of Virgil’s pastoral irony, the
                earth’s supposedly unforced freedom can appear to differ precious little from her forcible
                transformation: do not other natures live to serve human desires in Golden Age ecology? Celebrating
                their creative powers à la Darwin (like celebrating their “resilience,” in a contemporary
                idiom), may be little more than an alibi for subjecting them to every serviceable
                    transformation.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Though concern for the status of nonhuman
                            natures is merely an incidental byproduct of the parodist’s concern for

                            we glimpse in his early suspicion of GMO-logic how the conservative

                From a Marxian perspective, meanwhile, is not nature’s productive “automatism” in the Golden Age merely a

                  <p> Such crucial, demystifying critiques can never finally be gainsaid.<note place="foot" resp="author">The Marxian line of ideology critique is

                                botanicals as celebrating “the metamorphosis of nature into
                                commodities” and thereby cashing in on a booming global trade in
                                plants that was utterly transforming the “nature” of both colony and

                    permanently susceptible of ideology critique. Following Karl Mannheim,
                    the first to mutually theorize “ideology” and “utopia,” we might
                    differentiate between these two dimensions of mental “incongruence with
                    the state of reality” by asking whether a given orientation, were it to
                    “pass over into conduct,” would “shatter” the existing order of things
                    (utopia) or ensure its maintenance (ideology) (173).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> The first feature concerns pastoral <hi rend="italic">adynata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">impossibilia</hi> — those “miraculous dislocations of natural law",
                like sheep that turn colors and trees that grow wigs,
                that have been hallmarks of pastoral rhetoric since Theocritus (Rosenmeyer 216).
                While these expressions are typically read as tropes for impossibility itself, if not signs of
                divine intervention, they also effect, as I suggested above, a provocative decoupling
                of the concept of nature from those of necessity and determination. In such figures,
                nature ceases to play the role of indifferent background to human suffering and
                triumph, or of the repetitive cycle from which the arrow of human history breaks, or of
                the ironclad physical determination from which we wrest our uniquely human moral
                freedom. Instead, other natures freely take part in the action in a manner that
                cannot quite be explained away as anthropomorphism.<note place="foot" resp="author">Here we can trace an affordance
                            of the Epicurean and Lucretian tradition that Erasmus Darwin shared with
                            Virgil, Ovid, Theocritus, and classical pastoral as a whole. Rather than
                            conceive of nature as inherently lawful, such poetic philosophy ascribed
                            to nature’s least constituents the power to “break the bonds of fate,”
                            lest nothing different would or could ever arise, or have arisen, in the
                            cosmos (De rerum natura Book 2, 1. 254, 114-15, trans. modified). Since this tradition equates that which is familiarly called
                            “chance” in the realm of physics with that which is called “freedom” in
                            the realm of ethics, it carves out a broad space for moral, cultural,
                            and political conduct among nonhuman natures, even as it instructs
                            humans in their fundamental naturalness and contingency.</note>
                
                And in so far as Golden Age pastoralists depict <hi rend="italic">impossibilia</hi>
                as effects of political regime change, they also call into question the tenacious
                metaphor of nature <hi rend="italic">as </hi>law (<hi rend="italic">jus naturae</hi>) and the presumption that the power to suspend it
                is exclusively sovereign or divine.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Rosenmeyer 98–129 for the Epicurean persuasions
                            of classical pastoral, particularly with regard to questions of freedom,
                            autonomy, and pleasure.</note> Now that “Anthropocene” weather
                relentlessly historicizes the lawlike regularities of the Holocene environments we
                once knew, it is perhaps worth considering the behavior of
                terrestrial natures under the sign of their potential freedom and actual coercion,
                rather than their supposed necessity.</p>
                  <p> Secondly, the eco-utopian pastoral imaginary that I have traced through Darwin to
                Virgil and Ovid’s Golden Ages manifests an unfamiliar, indeed anti-Promethean, form
                of technophilia. Though present in Ovid’s self-cultivating grains, and, especially,
                in Virgil’s “technicolor animals,” images of the spontaneous technicity of other
                natures may reach their literary climax in Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">The Loves of
                    the Plants</hi>. There, Flax is cast as the “Inventress” of weaving, ably
                fashioning her own fibrous body into a textile; the Carline Thistle plays the “fair
                Mechanic” whose far-floating seeds precede the Montgolfier brothers in the
                “invention” of the hot air balloon, and Papyra [papyrus] is credited with
                introducing semiotic systems into human cultures (2:66–84, 7–66, 105–18). Darwin’s
                suspicious parodist reads such images of vegetable ingenuity as covert allegories
                for the experimentalists’ own plans to manipulate plant biology. But taken straight,
                Darwin’s notion of vegetable ingenuity emerges from a thoroughgoing naturalist
                perspective that has ceased to respect the anthropo- and androcentric distinction
                between the fruits of biological generation and the works of technical genius.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Concurring, therefore, with Bewell
                            that “in Darwin’s ‘economy of vegetation,’ the distinction between
                            nature and <hi rend="italic">techné </hi>is not of
                            great importance,” I depart from his judgment that managing,
                            controlling, exploiting, and profiting from nature is therefore
                            paramount (<hi rend="italic">Natures </hi>69).
                            There is, after all, also the “libertine” possibility Meeker and Szabari
                            ascribe to him, that of seeing other natures as “artfully enabling
                            mediation” and “engender[ing] the technologies that allow us to be
                            affected by them” (486).</note> 
                Situating “invention” and “representation” <hi rend="italic">within </hi>the realm of
                generative reproduction and deviation, Darwinian techno-pastoral foregrounds the
                precedence and participation of other natures as coauthors in the history of art,
                technology, and mediation.
                
                Yet such technophilic naturalism, and this is the third
                point, would remain indistinguishable from familiar technologies of domination, were
                it not for the copresence of the pastoral insistence on leisure. Only the pause that
                the pastoral mode places on the workaday world and the working day ensures that the
                visionary technics in evidence arise not from increased human manipulation but, on
                the contrary, from giving space or leaving room for other beings to take up,
                differently, the activity of transformation to which some human societies have relentlessly
                subjected the other constituents of the earth.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I remain inspired by and indebted to
                            Anne-Lise François’ unparalleled meditation on the ethics and politics
                            of biotechnology as “a contest for the domain of human and ecological
                            creativity”; in her essay, pastoral is implicated in the difficulty of
                            holding an “openness to unscripted, heretofore unimagined possibilities”
                            of nature apart from the hegemonic mandate of “constant reinvention”
                            (45). And a key distinction arises between an ethos that makes space to
                            be surprised by ecological creativity and one that seeks to control,
                            patent, and “<hi rend="italic">imagine </hi>itself
                            determining” the shape and duration of plant and animal generation (44).
                            See also, in the context of an ecological ethos of desistence Matthew A.
                            Taylor’s notion of “counter-industrious revolution”: not a “war against
                            climate change, only a relinquishing of the fetishes of growth,
                            productivity, acceleration and mastery that have fired our world” (132).

                  </p>
                  <p> Finally, this strange form of techno-pastoral utopianism permits a political ecology
                to come into view that foregrounds the authentically political axis of freedom and
                coercion, as opposed to the now common preoccupation with the ontological axis of
                “human” and/versus “nonhuman” being. It is true that an open ontology — an ontology
                that does not presume to dictate the capacities of various kinds of being in advance
                and that does not invest in the human “exception” — is propitious, if not
                prerequisite, for an ecological point of view. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that
                abolishing hierarchy among categories of being accomplishes anybody’s political
                liberation. In fact, where ontological leveling masquerades as <hi rend="italic">political</hi> ecology achieved, it necessarily thwarts and mystifies the basic
                politicization of ecology.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I take this to be the risk of Jane
                            Bennett’s eloquent and influential “new materialist” approach to
                            political ecology in <hi rend="italic">Vibrant Materialism</hi>. Many of
                            her sources in the long, <hi rend="italic">old</hi> history of
                            non-Cartesian, non-Kantian philosophical naturalism, vitalism, and
                            materialism do not share this deficit.</note> 
                This is because matters of justice, exploitation, and repair in the realm of ecology have never concerned
                <hi rend="italic">the</hi> human and/versus <hi rend="italic">the</hi> non-human; they have instead to do with
                <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> humans exploiting <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> other human
                and nonhuman beings. An analytic grounded in ontological
                categories of being has no means to grasp this asymmetrical and differential
                distribution of responsibility and harm. In this context, parables of ecological
                jubilee acquire their peculiar utopian, <hi rend="italic">counter-ideological purchase</hi>. For, however
                distortedly, they begin by imagining not ontological equivalency but an end to
                coercion. This, I would argue, is a genuinely political gambit. </p>
                  <p> How, then, does this peculiar eco-utopian imaginary we have been tracing comport with
                the facts of racialization, colonization, and enslavement that enabled and fractured
                “the human” and his rights during
                Darwin’s era of their revolutionary ascendancy and counter-reaction? To explore this
                question, I turn, finally, to Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">The Economy of
                    Vegetation</hi>, focusing on the political ecology of slavery and abolition in
                that poem. Here, the human and non-human “Others of Man” welcomed into the poem’s
                Jacobin ecology clearly emerge as demanding and exacting allies, rather than, as I
                worried above, figures of wish-fulfillment or alibis for the history of
                technological and colonial domination. Darwin’s techniques of figuring earth and
                ground in <hi rend="italic">The Economy</hi>, I argue, push past the interests of
                his own bustling, industrial bourgeois milieu to issue in distinctly illiberal,
                anti-humanitarian incitements to multinatural vengeance against chattel slavery and
                settler colonialism. In black counterpoint to our visions of “ecological jubilee,”
                    <hi rend="italic">The Economy</hi>’s parables of “ecological retribution”
                attempt to join forces with the many expropriated natures (human, nonhuman,
                dehumanized) forced into complicity by the transatlantic slave trade on the eve of
                a militant <hi rend="italic">black</hi> Jacobinism.</p>

                  <head>Relief Poetry and the Race for/of the Ground</head>
                  <p> If the class politics of Darwin’s visions of communal luxury were transparent enough
                to make for easy parody, grasping the ecological intersection between race and class
                in his work requires a subtler appreciation of the poet’s figurative and
                compositional tactics. The brilliant Swiss-English graphic artist Henri Fuseli’s
                frontispiece to <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Vegetation</hi> provides a
                perfect introduction (Figure 4). The frontispiece is supposed to represent the
                Goddess of Botany, “Flora, attired by the Elements,” in correspondence with the four,
                element-focused cantos through which the poem purports to tell the “physiology of
                plants.” And indeed, Fuseli’s frontispiece provides an allegorical persona for each
                element: Air, with her dashing butterfly hat; Fire, with a mirror to represent the
                action of light; Water, with an appropriate vase; and Earth offering up a sampling
                of her gorgeous vegetation. But who, then, is the extra, extra-earthy figure in the
                very bottom of the frame, reaching up from the ground, as plants do, but with brawny
                arms and a cap of weeds? </p>
                  <p> As Fuseli intimates with this picture, supernumerary, subterranean figures like this
                one proliferate in the second canto of <hi rend="italic">The Economy of
                    Vegetation</hi>, the one that is devoted to the elemental activity of “earth.”
                Here, the actions of soils, earths, and minerals are at stake and all manner of
                quasi-animate beings, from slumbering seeds to incipient statues, Bastilled
                prisoners, oppressed Irishmen, and Africans in irons, linger in stony latency to
                release themselves, or be released, from the ground. As the syntax of that last
                sentence suggests, the distribution of agency and patience across figure and
                background is particularly fraught when it comes to the canto’s joint task of
                personifying elements of earth — that is, figuring the ground—and depicting the action
                of that and those who have been, in Darwin’s phrase, “disanimated” or
                reduced to that terrestrial matrix. <note place="foot" resp="author">I adapt the term from a related context: Canto 2, l. 312, analyzed below.</note>
                The addressees of this Earth Canto, elements of
                ground whom Darwin personifies as “Gnomes,” bear this figural burden: they operate
                as a force of frankly de-carceral natality, even as they do not quite cease to
                embody the inhuman, inanimate states of imprisonment and (social) death in which
                certain beings are interred, not to mention the stony walls, tombs, and prisons that
                contain them. In any case, their personification means allowing the background to
                surge into relief, usually at the cost of someone or something else (Canto 1, l.73). Reading
                Darwin’s Earth Canto alongside anticolonial ecologies of race allows us to see how the
                kitschy, elastic, preternatural figure of the “Gnomes” — etymologically, <hi rend="italic">earth-men</hi> — come to signify the condition of imposed
                identification and possible allegiance between varieties of exploited ground and the racialized
                classes of beings conscripted to work them. Such earths and such human beings are
                linked by economies of extraction that Darwin cannot but trace in doing due
                diligence to the sites and sources of Enlightenment geological and mineralogical
                knowledge.</p>
                  <p> But before leaving Fuseli’s image, notice its ekphrastic function: as an engraving of
                a (fictional) cameo, the frontispiece offers another indispensable clue to Darwin’s
                mediatic art in <hi rend="italic">The Economy</hi>. Critics, then and now, have
                agreed that Erasmus Darwin’s poetic style is highly visual, rife with allegorical
                personifications and written “principally to the eye,” as he put it himself, as if in
                proper neoclassical deference to poetry’s “sister art,” painting (<hi rend="italic">ut pictura poeisis</hi>) ("Loves" 48). But the meaning of writing “to the eye” changes in
                light of Darwin’s understanding of the neurophysiology of sight. To address the eye
                with a printed word, he explains in his biomedical masterwork, <hi rend="italic">Zoonomia</hi>, is to trigger cascades of associated tactile experience,
                literally disposing the reader’s nerves of touch to reconstitute the
                three-dimensional feel of the signified with her own body (Goldstein “Nerve
                poetry”). Darwin’s allegories of reading thus stress the kinesthetic reconstitution
                of poetic lines as three-dimensional forms: William Cowper attested to the effect as
                “Meet[ing] the eye with a <hi rend="italic">boldness of projection</hi> unattainable
                by any hand but that of a master” (qtd. in Packham 147). Given this foundational
                semiotic relation between plastic plenitude and visual abstraction, it is no wonder
                that specimens of relief sculpture (tomb decorations, architectural ornaments,
                medallions, cameos, and coins) are privileged objects of Darwin’s poetic attention

                            from the formal level of the line to that of the epic, Darwin’s poems
                            are constructed as spatial architectures rather than temporal
                            narratives. And see Alan Richardson’s groundbreaking recognition of Darwin (among
                            others) as advancing an influential, embodied, brain-based science of

                emergence of plastic forms from undifferentiated ground, objects sculpted or molded

                hoped to produce through poetry by virtue of the physiology of reading. </p>
                  <p> As the prototype for Darwin’s poetry, the minor art of bas-relief declines to produce
                autonomous, free-standing forms, in favor of scenes in which form continually issues
                from a material ground. Likewise, Darwin’s didactic figural strategies
                systematically redistribute attention towards grounds and surroundings, refusing (or
                failing) to extricate focal agents and objects from their contextual supports and
                dramatizing the difficulty of selecting what to bring into relief. In addition to
                explaining much readerly disorientation, Darwin’s dizzying commitment to
                foregrounding backgrounds and magnifying the minor accounts for the most distinctive
                and obvious formal feature of his poems — the extensive apparatus of footnotes that
                supports each column of verse like a prosaic pedestal.<note place="foot" resp="author">Substantiating the poem’s claims with sources
                                and explanations, this apparatus redefines the poetic voice as an
                                expression of collective expertise (the “The Lunar Society” and its
                                members’ far-flung correspondence and research) that cannot stand or

                                aesthetic heteronomy of didactic, for which contextualism is
                                intrinsic to the form and to any formalism capable of countenancing
                                it as art (Goldstein,

                contemporary transatlantic abolitionist movement in the middle of his Earth Canto
                (Figure 5). This bas-relief medallion first appears in the course of the canto’s
                survey of the formation of clays and the manufacture of ceramics. Commissioned in
                1787 as the seal for the London Committee of the Society for Effecting the Abolition
                of the Slave Trade (SEAST), the image was a smash hit in abolitionist circles,
                especially after Darwin’s Lunar Society friend and collaborator, the porcelain
                manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood, put it into mass production as a wearable cameo at his
                state-of-the-art factory, Etruria (Figure 6). In an irony apparently lost on
                those who wore it, the SEAST’s emblem against human commodification became quite the
                fashionable commodity: the cameo was set in snuffboxes and worn in bracelets and
                hairpins; like an earlier modern “meme,” it crossed the channel and the Atlantic,
                switching genders, settings, and media in diverse adaptations (Clarkson 191–92;
                Hamilton 631–52). Responding to a batch he received from Wedgwood in a 1798 letter,
                Lunar Society foreign correspondent Benjamin Franklin described a marked alteration
                in “the countenances” of those to whom he had distributed the cameo, attesting to
                the medallion’s particular power as a plastic relief artifact: “I have seen such marks of being
                affected by contemplating the figure of the supplicant (which is admirably executed)
                that I am persuaded it may have an effect equal to that of the best written pamphlet
                in procuring favour to those afflicted people” (qtd. in Hamilton 635).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Tobias
                            Menely’s compelling account, which draws on Clarkson, of the
                            perlocutionary political efficacy of sentimental humanitarian rhetoric
                            in abolitionist poetry: rather than merely consolidating existing bonds,
                            Menely argues, the abolitionist appeal can work to bring into being a
                            sympathetic public that does not preexist its utterance (45–67).
                            Questions remain, I think, about the terms on which enslaved subjects
                            are figured for the purposes of forging new sympathetic identifications
                            among presumptively white audiences.</note> 
                Leading English abolitionist Thomas Clarkson credited the icon with helping to “keep up a hatred of
                the trade among the people” and “turning the popular feeling in our favour” during
                the many intervals when the Society’s parliamentary efforts were stalled (188,
                191).</p>
                  <p> Typifying both the propagandistic efficacy and the limits of the mainstream white
                abolitionist imagination — which preferred to picture a “supplicating Negro” begging
                kinship recognition (in the nearly unanswerable form of a negative rhetorical
                question) to the ongoing fact and fear of slave and Maroon uprisings in the
                colonies — the image also did its share of damage. In casting the enslaved person's humanity and
                freedom as a “gift” in the (presumptively white) spectator’s power to bestow, such
                visions of “the emancipation moment” symbolically steal a person’s freedom a second time by
                usurping their power to seize it (Wood 29).<note place="foot" resp="author"> In Marcus Wood’s analysis, 
                    this paradigm of emancipation tees up an ethos of white British self-congratulation for the eventual 
                    abolition of the trade in 1807 that persisted well into the bicentennial celebrations of 2007, 
                    which failed to commemorate, for instance, the fact that slaveholders and not formally enslaved persons were financially 
                    compensated for their “loss.” Without disputing this overall Fanon-derived analysis, Hamilton has shown that the visual 
                    rhetoric of the kneeling slave was somewhat more nuanced, alluding to the heroic endurance and (potentially 
                    threatening) strength of Hercules. I would also note that Darwin’s own, neurophysiological theory of the operation 
                    of sympathetic mimesis through various perceptual media suggests that such a complex object’s text and sculptured 
                    image may not have acted in concert on the body of a person who simultaneously sees, reads, and holds it. 
                    True, the motto “Am I Not A Man and A Brother?” projects its <hi rend="italic">reader</hi> as the addressee and 
                    adjudicator of this rhetorical question, empowered to grant or withhold humanity and kinship from the “imploring” slave. 
                    But because the bas-relief pictures the slave in profile, it positions its viewer as witness, instead, to a 
                    scene in which the slave beseeches someone else. This position of complicit remove was well-keyed to the English 
                    mainland situation, in which citizens could (and frequently did) congratulate themselves on the effective illegality
                    of slavery on their soil, while profiting magnificently from the transatlantic slave trade. 
                    Less suspiciously read, this effect correlates with Menely’s keen observation that humanitarian 
                    abolitionist poetics extend the scope of existing sympathetic identification where “the collective
                    addressee witnesses not only the suffering slave but its own witnessing of the slave’s suffering” (65). 
                    Finally, Darwin’s understanding of ideation as bodily mimicry of the object by the senses, particularly in the 
                    case of touch, suggests that the palpable medallion may not only constrain the agency of the depicted slave but
                    also bring the perceiver to his or her (virtual) knees, forcing their nerves to rehearse like attitudes of 
                    humiliation. See Goldstein “Nerve Poetry” on Darwin’s neuro-aesthetics. </note>
                
                Nor is such an analysis merely a product of hindsight. In his 1801 novel of the
                Haitian Revolution, <hi rend="italic">The Daughter of Adoption</hi>, John Thelwall
                put the logic of what Marcus Wood calls “the horrible gift of freedom” in the mouth of a revered old white
                philanthropist in St. Domingue who surprises a radical young friend by
                <hi rend="italic">not </hi>celebrating the news that the
                islands’ slaves “have thrown off the yoke” (160). “‘And is it possible, sir, after
                what I have heard from your lips,” the young man asks incredulously, “that you can
                be averse to the emancipation of your sable brethren?’” The older man replies: “I
                would die to emancipate them; but I cannot wish for their revolt” (160). At the core
                of the white Englishman’s stated, humanitarian preference for the “slow” but
                “certain” operation of “the sympathy of mankind,” then, Thelwall reveals a refusal
                to relinquish that power to emancipate the slave in which the colonist’s supremacy
                is staked at a value equal to that of his own life.</p>
                  <p> Darwin’s first pass at the cameo focuses on its production in Wedgwood’s factory,
                attempting to channel “the fair medallion’s” transmedial, transatlantic efficacy in
                verse, even as it draws out the occulted labor and materials behind its sentimental
                surface:

                Commenting on passages such as this some thirty years ago, Maureen McNeil shrewdly
                observed that Darwin’s industrial poetry erased workers from the scene, instead
                attributing labor “to ‘gnomes’ who magically perform the work required” (17, 19).
                Yet equipped with mining and prospecting hammers, presiding over kilns, grinding
                pigments with a “strong arm,” molding and glazing forms with a
                “charm’d . . . touch,” these “GNOMES” certainly insinuate the working people at
                Wedgwood’s factory and across his far-flung supply and production chain. Rather than
                eliminate human producers, Darwin’s incessant apostrophes to earth-men in the plural
                encompass human laborers together with the materials, tools, and machines they work,
                conjoining both sources of occulted value that contribute to the animate “magic” of
                commodities. “Charm’d by your touch,” Darwin repeats, the molten metals pour,
                harden, refine, take shape, and shine: “The bold Cameo speaks, the soft Intaglio
                thinks.” What ultimately “speaks” and “thinks” through the “bold Cameo” in this
                passage is an industrial supply and production chain, from clay harvesting to
                mineral mining, chemical processing, and factory finishing. At stake is a kind of proto-Marxist
                prosopopoeia that makes the commodity’s power an indexical expression of the human
                labor and globally-sourced materials that went into its production.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Alongside the
                            famous antislavery medallion, Darwin reproduced the image of another,
                            equally fraught Wedgwood cameo, this one plunging us into the penal
                            colonization of Australia: a cameo of “Hope attended by Peace, and Art,
                            and Labour; which was made of clay from Botany-Bay; to which place [Wedgewood]
                            sent many of them, to show the inhabitants what their materials would
                            do, and to encourage their industry” (<hi rend="italic">Economy of
                                Vegetation</hi> l.315n).</note> Darwin’s remediation makes
                clear that these occulted agencies (“GNOMES”) contribute to the semiotic and
                affective efficacy of the cameo (its power to “speak,” “think,” and “call the pearly
                drops from Pity’s eye, / Or stay Despair’s disanimating sigh”). But as we will see,
                it is not quite clear that their meaning agrees with the milquetoast motto — <hi rend="italic">Am I Not A Man and a Brother?</hi> — actually printed thereon.</p>
                  <p> On the earthen side of Darwin’s gnomic conjunction, a “new” materialist emphasis on
                nonhuman agency — particularly on the kind of “natural technicity” I explored in the
                previous section — is indeed emphatic in this section of <hi rend="italic">The Economy
                    of Vegetation</hi>. Mineral processes of taking shape and appearing, including
                in splendid, highly wrought forms, are literally and scientifically at stake in the
                Earth Canto, as in this passage on the process by which acids transmute chalk into
                gemstones:

           In another context, to speak of stones weaving, folding, printing, and tinting their
                garments — to write of stones molding spheres and cubes, painting landscapes, or
                “roll[ing] their lucid eyes” back at the spectator — would constitute gross and
                indecent anthropomorphism. But such figures operate differently in a poem that
                systematically traces the chemical and geological production of spectacular mineral
                forms, revealing very real, yet very nonhuman powers to fashion the kind of shapes
                that humans achieve largely through artistry and technique. These mineral
                productions include not only rigorously geometrical forms but also mimetic
                similitudes of other natures: rocks and gemstones that assume the shape of wisps of
                hair, floral petals and spines, striated sands and tree rings, land- and seascapes.
                The Earth Canto also explores the mineral dimension of plant and animal vitality: Darwin
                traces the blush of blood-borne iron beneath a rosy human cheek and the “dark mould,
                white lime, and crumbling sands” that nourish and awaken dormant seeds (542). By
                virtue of the recently discovered chemical processes of oxidation, respiration, and
                photosynthesis traced in the poem, moreover, elements of earth actually effectuate
                animation and its signs in the poem: breath, energy, growth, motion.</p>
                  <p> Darwin’s scientific realism on the question of the relation between earthly
                materiality and technical artistry, between geochemistry and biological animation,
                means that his “GNOMES” certainly personify a sphere of suppressed identity between “earths”
                and “men,” bodying forth at once the action of minerals in and on human beings and
                of human beings in and on the earth. But as usual, summation at the level of
                human/nonhuman ontology will occlude the political burden of the not-quite-,
                not-merely-human “gnomes” in their pointed marginality and plural, collective
                action. Reading Darwin’s Earth Canto in its entirety in fact helps mitigate the present
                tendency to mistake ontology for political ecology that is writ large in those theories of the
                “Anthropocene” that urge the suppression of difference under the (negative)
                universal sign of human peril.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dipesh Chakrabarty’s brilliant and influential
                            early formulation of the challenge that Anthropocene science posed to
                            humanist historiography focused on the limits of his own formation in
                            postcolonial, Marxist, subaltern, and globalization studies, and
                            projected the “negative universal history” that would need to arise in

                To repeat what ought to be obvious, at
                stake in the ecological predicament said to have begun in Darwin’s generation is not
                a question of the relation between the anthropos and the earth but of <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> human societies exploiting certain other human societies <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the nonhuman beings that condition their existence. And it is in the latter side of this
                asymmetrical relation — the human and nonhuman beings brought together as expendable
                resources throughout the history of New World colonization and capitalization — that
                the gnomic conjunction <hi rend="italic">earth-men</hi> increasingly figures forth
                in Darwin’s poem. Such conjunctions are crucial to a political ecology capable of
                recognizing historical reparations as intrinsic to any project of ecological
                repair.</p>
                  <p> From the perspective of critical geography, Kathryn Yusoff has suggestively sketched
                the conjunction between (certain) earths and (certain) men at stake in the
                pre-history of fossil capital and “Anthropocene” geology. The “coal-black” subjects
                of chattel slavery and the earths subjected to fossil fuel extraction were forcibly
                conjoined, she argues, by “blackness” as an “inhuman categorization” that marked
                those who bore it as appropriable energy sources for colonial expansion and
                industrialization. To foreground just one literal, metabolic example of the link
                between England’s industrialization and its expanding colonial empire, West Indian
                plantation sugar and East Indian tea fueled the “wage slaves” at the base of
                England’s new industrial economy, those soot-blackened persons that populate both
                William Blake’s <hi rend="italic">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> and
                Darwin’s West Midlands region, known as the “Black Country.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lunar Society
                            collaborations were instrumental to the early and precipitous
                            industrialization of the West Midlands projects ranging from John
                            Wilkinson’s ironworks at Bradley to James Watt’s improvements on the
                            Newcomen Engine to numerous canal and transportation via projects. See
                            Jennifer S. Uglow’s comprehensive group biography.</note>
                Yet Yusoff’s theory of “black inhumanist poetics,” like Monique Allewaert’s notion
                of “parahuman” allegiance among the beings yoked together by plantation
                ecology/economy, reveals not only histories of subjugation but also illicit
                practices of “freedom <hi rend="italic"> in </hi>the earth”
                unleashed when expropriated subjects of “inhuman categorization” tip their
                compulsory intimacy with the land into strategic alliance and multinatural
                insurgency (Yusoff xii, 15; Allewaert 7).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Monique Allewaert’s work on “parahuman”
                            allegiances in the plantation zone brilliantly explores not only the
                            vulnerabilities but also the illicit powers arising from enslaved
                            African and Maroon subjects’ initially unchosen proximity to other
                            natures (by way of both lived experience and onto-epistemological
                            categorization) as well as from their participation in and invention of
                            cosmologies that organize nature otherwise.</note> When Yusoff
                suggests that early American black inhumanist artistry can attest to “a
                gravitational force so extravagant, it defies gravity”, we can perceive the
                elective affinity between the long history of Afro-futurism and the eco-utopian
                “suspensions of natural law” this essay has traced by way of pastoral (100). At stake is a
                form of multinatural allegiance that upends not only positive laws but also the
                natural laws taken for their necessary ground.</p>
                  <p> Written from the contradictory heart of a dissenting, abolitionist Enlightenment centered in
                England’s industrializing Midlands, Darwin’s poetry ultimately manages to limn and
                solicit such insurgent potential within the differentially “inhuman” terrestrial
                collectivities that it apostrophizes without being able to activate or control.
                Though critics from the
                <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin </hi>forward have mocked the topical
                miscellany characteristic of Darwin’s poem, there is a logic to the poem’s movement in the
                Earth Canto, and it is frankly and increasingly - anti-colonial. In fact, Darwin traces, with subtle but
                intensifying condemnation, the very trajectory mapped by Yusoff’s “inhuman geography,”
                the geo-logic that unites the histories of fossil capital with that of colonial slavery. </p>
                  <p> Here, in brief, is that sequence of movements. From industrial-scale cameo-production
                in Wedgewood’s factory, Darwin next surveys the nearby fields of “sable COAL,”
                pointedly touching on the dark distillates of “fossil oil”: “pitchy” Naptha, and
                Jet, eponymously black (349, 351–52). He gives particular attention to Amber, a
                petroleum sublimate whose electrical properties, in Darwin’s lithic retelling,
                galvanize the American and French Revolutions (“man electrified man” [368]) through
                the person of Benjamin Franklin only to stumble on the long colonial history of the
                Americas and, again, the present reality of Black enslavement (353–94). In such
                sequencing, the volatile blackness of fossil earth forms a link between the poem’s
                repeated confrontations with chattel slavery in an Age of Revolution, as if the
                racialized conjunction between usable earth and useable people held the key to
                grasping the <hi rend="italic">non</hi>contradiction between the victory of the
                Rights of Man and an ongoing “inhuman trade.”</p>
                  <p> Darwin builds to a second engagement with Wedgwood’s medallion by castigating his
                countrymen as successors to the Spanish colonial profiteers who “slaughter’d half
                the globe”:

            The closing anti-slavery exhortation, paraphrasing the Wedgwood cameo’s scene and
                motto, has the ring of a sentimental set piece: an appeal to universal brotherhood
                keyed to the supposed humanitarian impulse of a British readership. </p>
                  <p> But the passage also stages a limit to this fashionable, consumable form of speaking
                and feeling for the enslaved person. There is more to say, it seems, but “sorrow” — whether the
                enslaved person's or the poet’s, in his overweening sympathy — “choaks the rest.” And here the poem
                itself emphatically “chokes” on a kind of grievance not so easily produced and
                consumed: the lines sputter apart in a flurry of dashes, chiasmi, and an awkward
                enjambment that together shatter Darwin’s highly regular meter and end-stopped
                lineation. At this breaking point, the materialist nature poem capitulates into a
                kind of curse or prayer (the language is biblical) that radicalizes Darwin’s overall
                poetics of deflecting attention towards the background. Calling on the elemental
                milieu for relief - “AIR! bear to heaven upon thy azure flood / Their innocent
                cries! — EARTH! cover not their blood!”<hi rend="italic">—</hi>the speaker cedes to
                these elemental media that quintessential artistic power of lifting something up for
                notice or preservation. Now the air is to bear up the slaves’ protest, the earth to
                ensure that their wrongly-spilled blood continues to surface. In the absence of a
                divine Book of Judgment, the vast material and semiotic re-combinatory that Darwin
                scientifically believes the globe to be is called upon to retain the evidence of the
                damage, to amplify the smothered voices, to enact retribution or reparation. This
                scene of natural justice seems to me the moral counterpart of the joyous
                multi-natural jubilee that tore hierarchies to the (fertile) ground. </p>
                  <p> If this were a canonical Romantic lyric poem, if it operated according to good
                negative aesthetic principles, it would probably stop here, at the threshold that
                marks the unsayable, even sublime, alterity of the Other’s suffering. But this poem
                is didactic, scholarly, thorough. And it is after material retribution. Having
                diligently followed the minerals, so to speak, through that zig-zag, transatlantic
                course that connects the precious metal mines of Spanish colonial Mexico and Peru
                (which first fueled the demand for enslaved African labor) — home to the coalfields of
                the English Midlands (whose incipient industrial working classes are fueled by West
                Indian sugar) — across the channel to revolutionary France (about to be galvanized by
                insurrection in Saint-Domingue), Darwin’s “GNOMES” have picked up a racialized and
                explicitly militant charge:

            And indeed, Darwin finishes out the canto by seeking evidence of what I called, at
                the outset “ecological retribution” — that is, he sifts through his vast natural
                historical archive for signs of elemental forces departing from the moral
                indifference usually presumed to be their law. </p>
                  <p> What emerges across the canto’s remaining episodes is a revisionist natural history
                in which terrestrial elements conspire with racialized subjects to reverse and
                avenge the progress of empire. Darwin reprises the ancient story of the Persian
                general Cambyses II, who attempted to “subdue Ethopia,” only to have his armies
                subsumed by burning sandstorms in the deserts of Northeast Africa: “wave after wave
                the driving desert swims, / Bursts over their heads, and <hi rend="italic">inhumes</hi> the struggling limbs” (435n, 489–90; emphasis added).<note place="foot" resp="author">Darwin retells

                In this retelling, what seems like natural disaster is fostered by the “vindictive
                hands” of the canto’s ever-present “Gnomes” — those half-human, half-earthen
                collectivities that have changed over the course of the canto from solicitous
                minsters of the poem’s every topical whim to militant, “resistless” agents of
                political violence (460, 487). Their “infuriate surge” inhumes the invaders in “one
                great earthy Ocean” (487, 494). Night then “bow[s] his Ethiop brow,” as if to
                sanctify the action, before the poem turns to celebrate the “Afric Warrior,”
                Hannibal, to whom the very Alps yielded passage, that he might “sh[ake] the rising
                empire of the world” (495, 529–41). Implicitly, over the course of this movement, Darwin has threatened 
                that the earth will <hi rend="italic">inhume</hi> that is, smother - with earth - the "inhuman trade" in which 
                his own well-being is implicated and which gives the lie to contemporary pretenses
                of universal humanism and humanitarian sentimentalism alike.</p>
                  <p> Are such dark pastoral <hi rend="italic">adynata</hi>, no less than the Golden,
                utopian ones — for in both cases, other-than-human beings suspend the laws of nature
                by taking a moral or political side — simply preposterous and ironic,
                <hi rend="italic">impossibilia </hi>connoting impossibility
                itself? Are the twinned, utopian poles of multinatural vengeance and multinatural
                jubilee anything other than “bad faith” in the presumptively materialist context of
                Darwin’s poem — examples of the eschatology for atheists that Steven Goldsmith has
                detected in much new materialist thought? Or examples of unchallenging recourse to a common
                form of Providentialism, in which the elements are once again instruments of a just
                God? ("Almost Gone" 417) Maybe. Yet in the present context of global climate destabilization, it feels
                difficult not to read the destructive behavior of the elements as commentary on the
                history of human production and consumption as well as to recognize that the
                Holocene regularities we have known have never been as immutable as “natural law.”
                Moreover, and more to the point of Darwin’s groping attempts at a natural philosophy
                and poetics of abolition, some Black Studies scholars’ critiques of mainstream
                Anthropocene and new materialist theory advocate a similar form of attention to the
                poetic conjuncture between other-than-human beings and human subjects of
                dehumanization — between what is called “nature” and those “genres of being human”
                rendered illegible by one ethno-class’s over-representation
                <hi rend="italic">as </hi>Man (Wynter, "Re-Enchantment" 183, 186; "Unsettling" 273, 281, 316-18, 331). </p>
                  <p> Zakiyyah Iman Jackson observes that because the racialization of some expressions of
                humanity as insufficiently human structures the very field of <hi rend="italic">non</hi>-human being for modern Western metaphysics, attempts to move “<hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> the human” without confronting race as intrinsic to
                the matter at hand cannot but perpetuate humanism’s historical ignorance and silence
                regarding Black critiques and praxes — not least those “irreverent to the normative
                production of ‘the human’” all along (216). It ought to go without saying that
                other-than-white thought and practice, early and late, has a good deal to teach
                Anthropocene perpetrators about comporting otherwise with other-than-human beings.
                Yet although the precedence and brilliance of minoritized thought on this score
                frequently goes unacknowledged, the inherence of racialization in the actual and
                theoretical territory of ecological concern for other-than-human beings is not
                optional: “terrestrial movement toward the nonhuman is simultaneously movement
                toward blackness, whether blackness is embraced or not” (Z. I. Jackson 217).</p>
                  <p> By turning so incessantly to the ground in his <hi rend="italic">Economy of

                other-than-human realm was rife with human being uncounted as such. For a natural
                philosopher and poet such as Erasmus Darwin, moreover, such dispossessed subjects
                shared space with genres of plant, animal, and mineral being whose capacity for
                meaning-making and historical transformation was likewise undreamt and
                underestimated in mainstream metaphysics. </p>
                  <p> I hope to have suggested that, issuing from deep within the culture of the
                perpetrators, the doggedly terrestrial movement of Erasmus Darwin’s
                <hi rend="italic">Botanic Garden </hi>cannot but express the
                historical, epistemological, metabolic, and metonymic associations between the
                earth’s energetic darkness and that of its (literally) denigrated subjects. But more than this:
                the poetics draws this racialized dimension of the ground into relief,
                apostrophizing the human humus in such a way as to hail the retributive and
                reparative ingenuity of this association without enfolding it in the discourse of
                Man. Darwin’s awkward, impure anti-colonialism appeals not to the wrath and rapture
                of God but to that of the <hi rend="italic">interred</hi>, those scarcely
                distinguishable from the ground and thereby able to partake, for better or for
                worse, of its more-than-human power. Who knows what other natures, in their freedom,
                might do, were we to cease foreclosing that possibility by force and by
                philosophy?</p>
