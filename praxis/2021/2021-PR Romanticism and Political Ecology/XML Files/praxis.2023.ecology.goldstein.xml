         <p> What may be the first appearance of “political ecology” in print offers no distinct
                definition or theorization. Yet Frank Thone’s little think piece entitled “We Fight
                for Grass,” which appeared under that heading in the <hi rend="italic">Science News
                    Letter</hi> of January 5, 1935, does articulate a strange, age-old parable of
                colonial avarice and climatic revenge. The topos long predates both the inauguration
                of the natural science of “ecology” in the 1860s and its self-conscious
                politicization in the 1970s, not to mention the splashy advent of a quite different
                sense of “political ecology” in (post) humanistic theory by way of Jane Bennett’s
                2010 monograph, <hi rend="italic">Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of
                Things</hi>. Visions of what might be called “ecological retribution” — and their
                utopian counterpart, “ecological jubilee” — were to be the subject of this essay, for
                the sake of ecocriticism and Romantic “political ecology” avant la lettre, long
                before I stumbled upon a variant here, at one minor, modern origin of the phrase.
                Yet its presence, I think, promotes Thone’s much-dismissed “We Fight for Grass” into
                a revealing emblem for the ongoing challenge of “political ecology” in the
                text-based disciplines and a concise introduction to the present essay. </p>
         
            <p> In Thone’s 1935 iteration of “political ecology,” the fantasy of ecological
                retribution arrives at the height of an unwieldy analogy that compares the
                incursions of Imperial Japan in Outer Mongolia to “the Indian Fighting days of our
                own West” (14). While “to be sure, there are differences,” Thone boils both
                conflicts down to an age-old antagonism between settlers and nomads: native peoples
                who “fight for grass” — pasture for their ruminant food sources — against the conquering
                plowshares of an “emergent empire” (14). The terms of the analogy are thus
                technically mythic even before the author actually compares Mongolian horsemen to
                “Centaurs” (14). The toil of tilling the soil divides fallen life from Paradise in
                Judaeo-Christian theology and the Golden Age from the rest in Greco-Roman cosmogony;
                Reformation theology and Enlightenment stadial historicism redefined such declension 
                as progress and ranked human societies accordingly. None of these mythic backgrounds
                are incidental to the present inquiry. But what matters most is the moral climax of
                “We Fight for Grass,” when Thone suddenly pivots to the Dust Bowl then afflicting
                the North American prairies. His political ecology casts this catastrophe as a
                modality of attenuated, indigenous revenge:
         
            <quote>The Indians fought for grass. They lost. The plow broke sod farther and farther
                westward, until in the mad, wheat-hungry years of the World War grasslands that
                never should have been turned over at all were broken and put into grain. Then came
                drought, grass-hoppers, dust storms; the Indians were in part avenged. Now we seek
                to replace the vanished grass. (14)</quote>
         
                At a distance of 85 years, the ideologies in play make easy targets. Grasslands
                “turned over” by an agentless “plow” elide their seizure through genocidal acts of
                “Indian Removal” (juridical, military, and biopolitical) that the author will
                neither query nor name. “We seek to replace the vanished grass,” Thone concludes,
                yet fail to imagine reparations for the (putatively) “vanished” people, let alone
                grasp how the two projects would be inseparable. Though a tone of regret replaces
                that of triumph, Thone’s grass-up, ecological retelling of political conflict leaves
                the fatalist logic of Manifest Destiny and its myth of the Vanishing Indian intact. </p>
         
            <p> Yet it is precisely this heady mix of ecological regret and ethnocultural
                unaccountability that may make Thone’s New Deal “political ecology” a
                still-pertinent emblem for the state of our art. Rewriting episodes of imperial
                conquest from the angle of the grass, the effort prefigures now familiar forms of an
                ecologically motivated “nonhuman turn” and their increasingly notorious political
                shortcomings when it comes to those Sylvia Wynter names “Man’s human Others” (Wynter
                and Scott 174). Influential new materialist, object-oriented, posthumanist, and
                Anthropocene theories have been charged justly with “resounding silence” on matters
                of race and colonial history, above all by scholars in Black and critical ethnic
                studies whose thought, by force rather than belated epiphany, has proceeded in
                proximity to categories like animality, thing-hood and the land (Z. I. Jackson 216;
                Karera, 34, 47). The elision of pertinent non-white, non-Northern expertise marks
                the recent genealogy of “political ecology” as well. Giving the term new life in <hi

                the full-fledged academic discipline that
                already bore the same name. Centered in the study of the global South, Political Ecology
                was born among mid-century decolonization struggles and infused the purportedly
                apolitical natural science of ecology with the insights and methods of critical
                geography, Marxian structural analysis, cultural ecology, peasant and agrarian
                studies, and systems and dependency theory, frequently in open opposition to Third
                World development policies and in open alliance with indigenous and peasant
                    movements.<note place="foot" resp="author">

           <p> What is the connection between eliding minoritized people and thought in some
                variants of “political ecology” and the tendency to figure climate catastrophe as a
                modality of their revenge? In what ways does “Anthropocene” discourse license again,
                and with all scientific rigor, an understanding of the weather as payback for crimes
                of history? Can such moralization constitute anything other than repressed theology?
                The theological echoes in this essay's key terms, ecological "retribution" and "jubilee,” are meant to welcome this latter question. The following
                contribution to the problem of “political ecology” seeks to explore
                this ideologically fraught mode of merging, or submerging, human histories of
                exploitation into the action of (also exploited) terrestrial elements — including some
                improbably radical, utopian variations on the theme.</p>
                
            <p> Limits of time and training do not permit me to remedy the missed encounter between
                the two materialist formations of “political ecology” sketched above — the one a
                critical natural and social science, the other a posthumanist ontology of
                relation — by properly interdisciplinary, hemispheric means. What I can do is plumb my
                European Romantic archive for the site that prefigures this encounter with the
                greatest intensity, soliciting a practice of reading informed by critical ecologies
                of race. This site is the highly vulnerable, even confused conjuncture between
                materialist natural philosophy, Jacobin internationalism, antislavery and commercial
                empire bodied forth as <hi rend="italic">botany</hi> (c.f. “We Fight for Grass”) in
                Erasmus Darwin’s 1791 epic, <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Vegetation.</hi>
                Exemplifying the wider logic of “ecological retribution” and “ecological jubilee”,
                Darwin’s materialist epic and associated satire envision elements of exploited earth <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                dispossessed people conspiring to avenge or overthrow regimes of colonization,
                expropriation, and enslavement. I take seriously the way this problematic gesture contests, at a stroke, the progress
                of empire, the rule of “natural law,” and normative expectations about which
                kinds of terrestrial beings are capable of moral and political action. </p>
                
            <p> The first part of this essay locates the poetic and political roots of Jacobin
                ecological jubilee in Golden Age pastoral, with that tradition's peculiar credulity regarding the
                political partisanship of other-than-human natures. Darwin’s engagement with this
                tradition is never finally dissociable from the English Enlightenment ideologies of
                which his “Lunar Society” circle formed the liberal and dissenting vanguard,
                including familiar and still fatal forms of techno-utopian optimism. Yet I attempt
                to isolate that aspect of Darwin’s techno-pastoral that exceeded such mystifications
                and apologetics, frightening his contemporaries with a vision of communal luxury
                that extended past both the rights-bearing category of the citizen-subject and the
                purportedly universal community of humanitarian sentiment, into the (supposedly)
                extra-political terrain of the earth.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Against the reflexive tendency to figure the
                            earth as power’s apolitical ground, see Diran and Traisnel’s elaboration

                            regulates the relation between living and nonliving realms, populations
                            and lands, 33–34.</note></p>
            
            <p> Turning from ecological jubilee to ecological retribution, the second part of this
                essay delves into the most geological and abolitionist canto of Darwin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Economy of Vegetation</hi>, teasing out the overdetermined
                connections between racialized blackness and the energetic humus of appropriated
                earth that Darwin’s poetry confusedly mobilizes. The section focuses on Darwin’s
                repeated engagements with the period’s most iconic antislavery icon, Josiah
                Wedgwood’s mass-produced cameo of a pleading slave in chains. I argue that Darwin’s
                due diligence to the extractive sources of both industrial manufacture and geological
                knowledge combines with his “relief poetics” — a compositional commitment to bestowing
                figure on the material that usually passes for ground — to issue distinctly
                anti-humanitarian and illiberal incitements to vengeance against slavery and
                colonization. In the militant visions of ecological retribution that ensue by the
                close of this “Earth Canto,” human and inhuman victims of this process collaborate
                    <hi rend="italic">to inhume</hi> the transatlantic traffic known as “The
                Inhuman Trade.”</p>
                
            <p> In contrast to the new materialist vogue for leveling hierarchies in the domain of ontology,
                I argue, Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Economy of Vegetation</hi> belongs to the
                prehistory of ecological reckoning with social class, racial caste, and colonial
                history — that is, with the differential distribution of harm, culpability,
                resistance, and reparation that is the substance of ecological justice. Taken
                together, the Jacobin and abolitionist dimensions of his materialist “economy of
                nature” illuminate, in their intersection, both the ideological and the utopian
                horizons of a genuinely

            <p> After several decades of restitution by historians of literature and science, Erasmus

                Despite the long-term triumph of a rival Romantic aesthetics that noisily broke with
                the doctor-poet’s prosody, philosophy, and politics, <hi rend="italic">The Botanic
                    Garden</hi> (1791) is now recognized quite simply as “the most popular and the most controversial
                nature poem of the 1790s” (Bewell
                <hi rend="italic">Natures </hi>53). The poem in fact comprises
                two epic, didactic parts, <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Vegetation</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Loves of the Plants</hi>.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Though it would constitute “Part 2” of

                sexuality will reenter this inquiry, our ultimate focus is <hi rend="italic">The

                single, bounded, perceptible bodies to the plural, subliminal, elemental media that
                pass through and between them, <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Vegetation</hi>
                treats botanical bodies — in so far as they metabolize water, light, earth, and air — as
                privileged organs for the disclosure, the making phenomenal, of every chemical and
                energetic interchange on the globe. In each of the poem’s four Cantos, the “Goddess
                of Botany” summons one elemental constituency (Earth, Air, Water, and Fire,
                respectively), and proceeds to chronicle the action of its members “as they may be
                supposed to affect the growth of vegetables” (v).<note place="foot" resp="author">In a nod to the radical Enlightenment
                            hermetic tradition, Darwin personifies the material elements according
                            to the code of Rosicrucian symbolism, addressing Earth elements as
                            “Gnomes!,” Air elements as “Sylphs!,” Water elements as “Nymphs,” and
                            Fire elements as “Salamanders!”. </note> 
                At this point, the staggering array of topics that bear upon plant life and love in this poem comes
                into view. As we can see from “the Argument” of any given Canto (Figure 1), the poem
                leaps from chemical to mythological, natural philosophical, technological, and even
                world-historical registers, compassing celebrations of the “Liberty of America; of
                Ireland; of France” and denunciations of the slave trade and the Spanish colonial
                “Destruction of Mexico”  (57-58).</p>

                    >Economy of Vegetation</hi>, right up to the absurd, limit-possibility of

                his botany posed in the 1790s.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Catherine Packham, Devin Griffiths, Noel Jackson,

                The invading monster has an English face, that of the Whig
                Duke of Bedford, and carries other prominent Whig politicians on its back; they are
                wafted into London on a frothy tide of revolutionary fervor that had, at least since
                Edmund Burke’s <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</hi>
                (1790), been figured as intoxicating liquor bubbling across the channel. A
                print-media “cornucopia of ignorance,” labeled with the names of a number of liberal
                press outlets, echoes the beast’s fat form: it overflows with ten years of English

                Wollstonecraft.</p>
                
            <p> Bewell urged Romanticists to zero in on the tiny flower-seller (Figure 3) in the
                distant middle ground of the image, just before the ad hominem caricatures of
                political figures and their works fade into an anonymous popular mob. The flowers in
                the seller’s basket are blossoming into a riot of bonnet rouges, and the little
                label beneath reads “Zoonomia” — the title of Erasmus Darwin’s medical magnum opus on
                animal life (1794–96) — followed by the perfectly incriminating subtitle, “Jacobin
                Plants.” “Zoonomia . . . or Jacobin Plants”: pithy proof that Darwin’s botany was
                perceived as a partisan endeavor in the 1790s and of whose side it was on. Bewell
                moved outward from here to reevaluate botany in the period as the locus of a
                “radical form of pastoral poetry”. Thanks to his reading and
                others, we now understand Darwin’s
                <hi rend="italic">The Loves of the Plants </hi>as Exhibit A for
                an English libertine botany that mobilized plant sexuality as a polymorphically
                perverse challenge to the contemporary mating rites of British humans ("Jacobin Plants" 132). Darwin’s
                “flowery porn,” as Tristanne Connolly put it, outraged conservative critics, not
                least because the pleasures of botanical reading were so frequently enjoyed by
                    women.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In

                            borrow the term “libertine botany” from Meeker and Szabari, who deftly
                            theorize an early modern modality of botanical erotics that treats plant
                            life as “animated by desire yet without interiority,” capable of
                            multiplying affect, animation, and pleasure across different kind of
                            material bodies — rather than subjecting plants to an Enlightenment logic
                            of analogy that constrains them to model human sexuality or subjectivity
                            (479–80). Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Loves of the Plants</hi> occupies
                            an ambivalent place in this brilliant analysis, evincing at once a
                            profoundly libertine “affective involvement in animated matter,” driven
                            by plants’ ability to “engender the technologies that allow us to be
                            affected by them,” and a tendency to foreclose such possibilities
                            through the anthropocentric conceit of plant “marriage”
                        (485–86).</note> Yet it is less clear how a pastoral that is
                radical in the sphere of gender and sexuality connects to the adjective “Jacobin”
                that would seem to stand instead, in Gillray’s cartoon and in the English
                conservative imagination, as a loose cipher for a somewhat different social
                threat — that of popular, transnational Revolutionism. Visually, the blooming Liberty
                Caps in Darwin’s basket amplify the raised arms and open mouths of a threatening,
                jubilant mob.</p>
                
            <p> Let’s, then, draw out the cartoon’s stranger and more hilarious accusation that
                Darwinian botany is a botany in which plants take a political side, sporting or
                sprouting Phyrigian caps as partisans of liberty. Might other-than-human natures
                have moral and political prowesses and preferences, in addition to, or even as a
                subset of, their <hi rend="italic">Loves</hi>? Here it is as if, to quote that later,
                flower-powered, libidinal revolutionist, Herbert Marcuse “Nature, too, awaits the
                Revolution” (74).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Compare Bewell’s witty nod to 1960s “flower-power”

                            ecology” (including Marcuse), see Pettman and Grebowicz.</note>
                Reading Gillray’s image against itself, we can see that it bears hostile witness to
                something very like this thesis: not only flowers, but fish, fowl, reptiles,
                amphibians, and other mammals swell the ranks of the revolutionary invasion. A
                metamorphic front of half-human chimera (avian, simian, reptilian . . . asinine!)
                conveys the purportedly degrading message that it is the animal in human
                beings that drives their transnationally militant works and acts (in the guise of
                Jacobin “phil-anthropy”). </p>
                
            <p> We are supposed to laugh, of course, but also to be afraid. In the eyes of his
                critics, it seems, Darwin and his crew of enthusiastic, polymathic, dissenting
                Enlightenment savants — the Lunar Society, as they called themselves — represented a
                dangerous, Francophilic form of socially Utopian naturalism that drew force and
                authority from the wider, para-juridical domain of the earth. This position is
                clearly part — but not, I think, a well-grasped part — of the long-term rise of “natural
                right” political philosophy in general and of Jacobin “natural Republicanism” in
                particular (Edelstein 1–25). It is also clearly connected, as Devin Griffiths has
                recently argued, to Darwin’s increasing notoriety as a theorist of biological
                    evolution.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Griffiths has persuasively argued that the intensifying vitriol (and
                            satirical assault) against Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Botanic
                                Garden</hi> in the later 1790s had much to do with the poems’
                            reappraisal through the prism of his later, biomedical masterwork
                            <hi rend="italic">Zoonomia </hi>(1794–96), which
                            advanced an overtly evolutionary theory of organic life. In hindsight,
                            Griffiths argues, the <hi rend="italic">Botanic Garden</hi> was reread
                            as a threatening “evolutionary epic” (#54). On this reading, the
                            metamorphic, multispecies front in Gillray’s “New Morality” primarily
                            represents (conservative skepticism of) an all-encompassing, progressive
                            theory of evolution (79–80), rather than his politics of revolution.
                            Indeed, Griffith ultimately concurs with such critics that Darwin
                            “powerfully confused biological development with social progress” (80),
                            arguing that his epic evolutionism foundered on an inability to discover
                            a “less teleological” historicism that could “admit diversification,
                            uncertainty, and the contingency of change” (55):
                            <quote>In its implicit addresses to an audience that comprises not merely all of humanity, but all of nature, the <hi rend="italic"> Botanic Garden</hi> gestures toward a unitary history without
                                granularity or uncertainty. It is a fatal problem, in so far as it
                                leaves the poem unable to address the most important event of its
                                day. Despite Darwin’s noted advocacy, and the most suspicious
                                readings of Canning, Frere, and others, the French Revolution finds
                                no place in the poem, even as the revolution reflects the poem’s
                                guiding problem: whether order emerges from freedom. (80)</quote>
                In the context of Griffith’s serious and important
                            new reading, it is puzzling that this final assertion is, frankly,
                            false. <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden </hi>in
                            fact contains a famous and immediately influential passage on the French
                            Revolution (<hi rend="italic">Economy of Vegetation</hi>, Canto 2,
                            ll.377–94), and the poem’s notoriously willy-nilly (far from
                            “teleological”) incorporation of topical events is precisely what must
                            be explained (see Packham, n13, below). Darwin’s sense of natural and
                            social history is, moreover, “granular” and “contingent” in an a
                            technical, neo-Lucretian sense, rigorously theorizing the connection
                            between natural and cultural pattern-formation through a sense of
                            “habit” that extends deep into nonhuman being (Goldstein, “Nerve Poetry”
                            5#). Perhaps Griffith’s criticism was meant for Darwin’s later epic, <hi
                                rend="italic">The Temple of Nature</hi> (1803), rather than <hi
                                rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi>? It would then need to contend
                            with Martin Priestman’s work on the political and social arguments
                            contained in that poem’s suppressed outline, <hi rend="italic">The
                                Progress of Society</hi>.</note> 
                Yet both these orientations would read the flora and fauna in this image as allegories for <hi
                    rend="italic">human</hi> degradation. How might we instead thicken the notion of
                “radical pastoral” to account for the ridiculous and/or dire possibility of
                multinatural revolutionism found in Darwin’s representations of plant animacy and
                    love?<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            “Multinaturalism” comes from the anthropologist Eduardo
                            Viveiros de Castro’s studies of IAmerindian American cosmological
                            perspectivalism in its difference from modern Western multiculturalism.
                            While multiculturalism presumes “the unity of nature and the plurality
                            of cultures,” or many partial representations of one natural reality
                            external to representation, Amerindian perspectivalism supposes “one
                            ‘culture,’ multiple ‘natures,’” wherein radically different beings have
                            in common the figure that “one sees of oneself when one says ‘I’”
                            (58–60). I import the term not in its full anthropological specificity
                            but rather to emphasize a commitment to natures, plural, and the effects
                            of such pluralization. It seems to me that in the radical pastoral
                            perspective under discussion, nature is no guarantor of unity or
                            lawfulness, and yet attributes of mental/moral culture usually reserved
                            for human subjects are presumed throughout. Bewell separately coins the
                            term “multi-naturalism” in <hi rend="italic">Natures in Translation</hi>
                            to denote a modern, “cosmopolitan” sense of “nature” that is no longer
                            bound to place: the nature discoverable in botanic gardens was “composed
                            of strangers, of immigrants, of foreign plants that have traveled from
                            far across the globe” whose diversity represents the reach and interests
                            of British commercial empire (74, 79). “Multinaturalism” in this sense
                            thus operates as analogue and corollary (rather than reversal) of
                            modern Western “multiculturalism.”</note></p>
                
            <p> Another brilliant parody helps specify the logic — or the fantasy — that keeps turning

                            reception (159–62). In a convincing counterpoint to Griffiths’ argument
                            about Darwin’s unitary “teleology,” Packham emphasizes how conservative
                            satires of Erasmus Darwin’s work in fact stressed its aleatory
                            qualities. Caricaturing the “fundamental failure of any system of
                            literary or intellectual order or hierarchy” in his poems, such critics
                            effectively indicted the “chaos” of democratic politics with the same
                            brush (166–67). Their reinvestment in literary decorum, Packham shows,
                            was pitched against practices of creative compilation characteristic of
                            the radical journals friendlier to Darwin’s poetry
                    (169–71).</note> More outrageous, even, than “Jacobins,” <hi

                    rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> attempts to expose the whole Darwinian project
                of versified botany as an awkward, obvious attempt to clothe the “broad,” “brawny”
                butts of the Paris street in decorous poetic breeches. “Attend,” calls the poem’s
                pseudo-Darwin to his sans-culottist comrade, “While in Rhyme’s Galligaskins I
                enclose / The broad posteriors of thy brawny prose” (B2).</p>
                
            <p> Like Gillray’s cartoon, <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> parody singles out for
                special ridicule the theme of nonhuman natures collaborating and rejoicing in the
                Revolution. “Skip, skip ye Mountains! Forests lend your Ears!,” calls “Darwin (5).” For
                under the rule of “red-capt Liberty” and “fair Philosophy” that the poem heralds,
                tongue-in-cheek, a two-fold revolution transpires (5, 4): while the human
                sans-culottes level their social hierarchy “to the mean muck of low Equality,” the
                curse of human labor relaxes, and other natures assert their own technicity (11).
                Plants spontaneously metamorphose into luxurious foodstuffs and manufactures, much
                to the delight of the rural and urban poor, who are left idle by the newfound productivity
                of louche, transgressively animate Darwinian vegetables. In a return to the
                effortless luxury of the mythic Golden Age, stock Georgic characters like the busy
                dairymaid swiftly regress to lazily gathering “Rich Cream and Butter from [a] herd of
                Trees” (10). By the climax of this part of the poem, plants have assumed the
                manufacture of complex commodities and luxury goods: “Tallow Candles tip the modest
                Thorn, / Candles of Wax the prouder Elm adorn!”; atop another grove, “Where leaves
                once grew, now periwigs of Hair!” (7).</p>
                
            <p> The most obvious target of the parodist’s extravagant vegetable grotesques is a
                certain form of techno-scientific hubris. Darwin, Beddoes, and their Lunar Society
                cohort were at the forefront of the coal-, steam-, and expropriation-powered
                industrial modernization of the English Midlands; at the dawn of an “Anthropocene”
                age frequently dated to their precise generation and social set, they helped pioneer
                a now familiar and still feckless variety of techno-utopian futurism. In places in
                    <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi>, Darwin apostrophizes steam power,
                prophecies air travel, and projects geo-engineering as a modality of climate
                    control.<note place="foot" resp="author" > 
                        Launching the term “Anthropocene” in 2000, Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer 
                        proposed dating the epoch to Lunar Society member James Watt’s 1784 patent on the 
                        double-acting steam engine. Many dates, logics, and critiques have since been proposed; 
                        see Tobias Menely and Jesse O. Taylor for a thoughtful introduction to the implications of 
                        this and rival chronologies. And see Siobhan Carroll on Darwin’s climate intervention schemes 
                        and their afterlives.</note>
                Taking as an epigraph one of Beddoes’s particularly enthusiastic speculations — “May
                we not, by regulating the vegetable functions, teach our Woods &amp; Hedges to
                supply us with Butter &amp; Tallow?” — the parody is out to caricature Lunar readiness
                to meddle in the natural order of things as well as to prophecy the monstrous
                consequences of a notably Godless faith in scientific miracles. </p>
         
            <p> This rather familiar form of anti-Promethean caution against Beddoes’s and Darwin’s
                visionary experimentalism is not entirely fair.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    In context, Beddoes’s idea involves both
                            less technological hubris and less magical thinking than the parody lets
                            on. The excerpted question comes at the end of an
                            anything-but-fantastical passage on the healthful and useful properties
                            of actually existing botanical butters. Beddoes wants to know whether some such
                            plant could be bred and cultivated in England, and, in a question of
                            ongoing ecological import, whether a plant-based diet might better and
                            more efficiently nourish the British populace. In fact, in general, his
                                <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi>’ sense of how science could
                            alleviate social misery has less to do with “techno-fixes”—the hallmark
                            of which is to avoid or cut through the messy realm of political
                            contestation—than with the social reorganization of science that
                            Revolution must entail. He literally wants to know what medicine could
                            achieve were it not “exclusively at the disposal of Despots and Juntos”
                            (Beddoes iv).</note> 
                But what I wish to emphasize instead is
                that the parodist also picks up on, and exaggerates to the point of caricature, a
                different, though perhaps equally delusive and damaging, form of techno-utopian
                ecology in Erasmus Darwin’s sans-culottist botanical poetry. For beyond the epigraph
                in this instructive spoof, cessation of labor becomes its crucial theme: pastoral

                in the solidarity that the parodist sarcastically calls their “happiness” and
                “triumph,” is pitch in to resolve the resultant crisis in production. Their
                generous, generative metamorphoses realize and surpass that fundamental demand of
                the sans-culottes — "Equality <hi rend="italic">and Bread</hi>!” — which itself pushed
                past the domain of liberal political rights and into the realm of “animal” need
                (Soboul 43–52; Simmons 1–12).
                <hi rend="italic" >The Golden Age </hi>epistle culminates in a
                materialist burlesque in which the people Burke famously characterized as a “swinish
                multitude” party with an actual multitude of pigs (among other flora and fauna),
                flourishing on uncoerced plenty and rejoicing in their general “<hi rend="italic"
                    >nudity of Breech!</hi>” (15, 12)</p>
                
            <p> Sketched here in negative, unflattering caricature, then, would seem to be a vision
                of not-merely-human “communal luxury” that, as an ecological ethos, would be
                deliciously, improbably predicated on working less <note place="foot"> I borrow the
                            evocative and technically apt phrase “communal luxury” from Kristen

                Focused on setting their social relations in order, the Europeans in the poem relent in their intensive
                transformation and domination of the (rest of the) natural world. And rather than
                occasioning a reversion to wilderness or (ig)noble savagery, this cessative ethos
                gives place to the ingenuity, artfulness, and technics of natures not
                usually credited with such powers. Deriving the latter vision from Darwin requires
                little hyperbole: <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi>, as we shall see,
                everywhere attributes technical and cultural ingenuity to flora, in extension of
                their powers of erotic and physiological transformation. Belonging, as <hi
                    rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> parodist emphatically signals, to the
                proto-utopian genres of Golden Age myth, pastoral poetry, and belly-centric Land of
                Cockaigne folklore, the Lunar Society’s experimental philosophy and poetry thus
                hazards the insane, intoxicating possibility that the supposedly immutable “natural
                law” said to govern the non-human realm may be as fungible as our “positive” and
                “civil” law. What if scarcity, competition, and toil were “necessities” not of
                Nature but of liberal political economy, laws of a zero-sum system transposed (and
                enforced) upon an Earth quite capable of behaving differently? If the rules of the
                    <hi rend="italic">oikos</hi> were changed, do we really know what other natures
                would do? On what grounds do we assume that moral, cultural, technical, and
                political capacity in nature actually begin and end in those beings currently
                overrepresented as rights-bearing citizens and subjects of moral sensibility?

            <p> Lest deriving this eco-utopian vision of multinatural jubilee from its derisive
                caricature seem farfetched, consider that the apocryphal
                <hi rend="italic" >Golden Age </hi>epistle seemed so very like
                something Erasmus Darwin would write that he felt compelled to publicly disavow
                authorship in the <hi rend="italic">Derby Mercury</hi> (King-Hele 250). Though
                hardly a subtle piece of work, the anonymous parody persists in “the odd distinction of
                having been read ‘straight,’” and it continues, to this day, to be misattributed to
                Erasmus Darwin in some library catalogs and criticism (Faubert 454; Reiman xii–ix;
                Priestman 199n12). Martin Priestman convincingly suggests that an embarrassing
                similarity between anti-Jacobin parodies like
                <hi rend="italic" >The Golden Age </hi>and an epic that Darwin
                actually had underway in the late 1790s — a poem in which, according to extant notes,
                “Liberty returns, and leads the golden age” under the aegis of “mild Philosophy” and
                Nature in the Lucretian shape of <hi rend="italic">“Immortal Love!</hi>” — may have
                motivated Darwin to abandon that genuine Golden Age project (Priestman 261, 193-216).
                Satire and sincerity, original and parody, thrilling possibility and risible absurdity
                blur so thoroughly in the reception of such utopian political ecology that one
                begins to suspect that — as with the term <hi rend="italic">utopian</hi>
                itself — the assumption of derogatory or aspirational connotations, the placement of the line between vision and farce, reveals less about the text itself than about a
                given reader's degree of attachment to the present order of things. </p>

                The poem everywhere
                references Virgil’s fourth, “messianic”
                <hi rend="italic" >Eclogue, </hi>notable for infusing Golden Age
                myth into the pastoral mode and for transposing that Age from the mythic past to the

                What matters about this version of pastoral as a means to capture (and skewer)
                Darwin’s visionary naturalism is that Virgil’s
                <hi rend="italic" >Eclogue </hi>borrowed the stirring, Golden
                Age topos of an unforced, unstinting earth — “the fruitful earth unforced bare . . . fruit
                abundantly and without stint” to mortals “free from toil and grief" — and cast this
                condition of uncoerced terrestrial luxury as subject to political restitution
                (Hesiod 117–18, 113). An encomium to his patron Pollio, consul at the time of
                composition, Virgil’s poem augurs the return of the Golden Age under his
                stewardship, prophesying the birth of a divine ruler whose advent brings the very
                earth to pour forth gifts of flowers, fruits, milk, and grain. The anonymous author of <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> satire of Darwin
                suggests that the Lunar Society cohort likewise expects the wholesale
                “renovation of the world," albeit "under the benign influence of French Freedom” (5n).</p>
                
            <p> And here, in fact, is the first political-ecological feature to mark the classical
                Golden Age tradition associated, by the 1790s, with experimental utopianism and
                Jacobin internationalism: the notion that plants and animals and winds and waters
                will participate in a new political dispensation, altering the very face of the
                earth. On the horizon of the faltering republic, Virgil’s fourth eclogue forecasts a
                form of theologico-political expiation felt deep into the earth: an alteration that
                would “free the lands from lasting fear" (Lee 57; Virgil 13–14).<note place="foot" resp="author"> “te duce, si
                            qua manet sceleris vestigia nostril / inrita perpetua solvent formidine
                            terras” (Virgil 13–14)</note> While the Golden Age renews under
                the rising sign of empire in Virgil, Ovid’s version harks back to an
                anarcho-communism of terrestrial elements: the earth (<hi rend="italic">humus</hi>)
                “had been a common good, one all could share,” “just like the sunlight and the air”
                (Mandelbaum 8; Ovid 1:135–36). Justice was immanent in such an earth, as we learn when
                She flees it (in person of the goddess Astraea, 1:150); or which we knew already,
                since everything and everyone moves “uncompelled” (<hi rend="italic">inmunis</hi>)
                but righteously (Mandelbaum 6; Ovid 1:101). When Ovid writes that “the Age” — not just its
                men — cultivated faith and rectitude of itself, without law, and without judge or
                protector, he gathers persons, animals, plants, and planet together, in an epoch of
                unforced generativity and righteousness (Ovid 1:89–90).<note place="foot" resp="author"> “Aurea prima sata est aetas, quae
                            vindice nullo, / sponte sua sine lege fidem rectumque colebat” (Ovid
                            1:89–90).</note></p>
            
            <p> Though their political valences differ diametrically, then, both the Ovidian and the
                Virgilian strains of Golden Age myth share the vision of a nature that answers to
                justice, rather than necessity. They also share in the enactment of a poetic
                reprieve from the labor of coercion that is felt both by those who work the land and the
                land that they work, together: “the soil will suffer hoes no more, nor vines the
                hook” (non rastros patietur humus, non uinea falcem) (Lee 59; Virgil 40). Yet Virgil
                also presses to the point of irony, perhaps to the point of transparent fantasy, the
                Golden Age vision of spontaneous luxury and worklessness without privation. As the
                    <hi rend="italic">Eclogue</hi>’s landscape “spontaneously” overflows with goods
                that conform to aristocratic taste, Virgil — and Darwin’s parodist after him — manages
                to underscore the eye-brow-raising convenience for (certain) humans of that which the
                earth is said to give freely (<hi rend="italic">sponte sua</hi>) in her golden
                    mood.<note place="foot" resp="author">This reading confirms Anabelle Patterson’s thesis that the

                Most hyperbolically, rams and sheep turn themselves rich colors - purple, saffron, scarlet - gamely
                obviating the need to dye their wool or skins. In Virgil's "technicolor" animal skins (Rosenmeyer 217), the later parodist
                of Erasmus Darwin finds his mark: where "nature" is poetically induced past fruiting and farming into 
                textile manufacture and manipulation, there is an emblem for the hubris of experimental philosophy and textual artistry
                at the dawn of the Industrial Age.<note place="foot" resp="author"><hi rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi> both adapts these
                lines and provides the Latin in a footnote to make sure no one misses the reference (5, 5n).</note>
                The parodist clearly sees a distinction without a difference between trying to intervene
                technically in plant fertility (to "regulate the vegetable functions") and the Golden Age
                vision of their spontaneous technicity that he summons to ridicule that project (B2).
                The latter is ideological cover for the former, and both instantiate what <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin</hi>
                satirists on the British right would soon distill as the core Darwinian/Jacobin fallacy:
                "Whatever is, is wrong." The ethos not only inverts the quiescent motto of that responsible 
                couplet artist, Alexander Pope, but also constitutes a dangerous and unchristian suggestion 
                to the rabble that labor is not their lot in this life. </p>
                
                <p>For, in fact, in the shadow of Virgil’s pastoral irony, the
                earth’s supposedly unforced freedom can appear to differ precious little from her forcible
                transformation: do not other natures live to serve human desires in Golden Age ecology? Celebrating
                their creative powers à la Darwin (like celebrating their “resilience,” in a contemporary
                idiom), may be little more than an alibi for subjecting them to every serviceable
                    transformation.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Though concern for the status of nonhuman
                            natures is merely an incidental byproduct of the parodist’s concern for

                            we glimpse in his early suspicion of GMO-logic how the conservative
                            principle of deference to the extant contributes to a conservation

                    the state of reality” by asking whether a given orientation, were it to
                    “pass over into conduct,” would “shatter” the existing order of things
                    (utopia) or ensure its maintenance (ideology) (173).</note></p>
                
            <p> The first feature concerns pastoral <hi rend="italic">adynata</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">impossibilia</hi> — those “miraculous dislocations of natural law",
                like sheep that turn colors and trees that grow wigs,
                that have been hallmarks of pastoral rhetoric since Theocritus (Rosenmeyer 216).
                While these expressions are typically read as tropes for impossibility itself, if not signs of
                divine intervention, they also effect, as I suggested above, a provocative decoupling
                of the concept of nature from those of necessity and determination. In such figures,
                nature ceases to play the role of indifferent background to human suffering and
                triumph, or of the repetitive cycle from which the arrow of human history breaks, or of
                the ironclad physical determination from which we wrest our uniquely human moral
                freedom. Instead, other natures freely take part in the action in a manner that
                cannot quite be explained away as anthropomorphism.<note place="foot" resp="author">Here we can trace an affordance
                            of the Epicurean and Lucretian tradition that Erasmus Darwin shared with
                            Virgil, Ovid, Theocritus, and classical pastoral as a whole. Rather than
                            conceive of nature as inherently lawful, such poetic philosophy ascribed
                            to nature’s least constituents the power to “break the bonds of fate,”
                            lest nothing different would or could ever arise, or have arisen, in the
                            cosmos (De rerum natura Book 2, 1. 254, 114-15, trans. modified). Since this tradition equates that which is familiarly called
                            “chance” in the realm of physics with that which is called “freedom” in
                            the realm of ethics, it carves out a broad space for moral, cultural,
                            and political conduct among nonhuman natures, even as it instructs
                            humans in their fundamental naturalness and contingency.</note>
                
                And in so far as Golden Age pastoralists depict <hi rend="italic">impossibilia</hi>
                as effects of political regime change, they also call into question the tenacious
                metaphor of nature <hi rend="italic" >as </hi>law (<hi

                relentlessly historicizes the lawlike regularities of the Holocene environments we

                terrestrial natures under the sign of their potential freedom and actual coercion,
                rather than their supposed necessity.</p>
                
            <p> Secondly, the eco-utopian pastoral imaginary that I have traced through Darwin to
                Virgil and Ovid’s Golden Ages manifests an unfamiliar, indeed anti-Promethean, form
                of technophilia. Though present in Ovid’s self-cultivating grains, and, especially,
                in Virgil’s “technicolor animals,” images of the spontaneous technicity of other
                natures may reach their literary climax in Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">The Loves of
                    the Plants</hi>. There, Flax is cast as the “Inventress” of weaving, ably
                fashioning her own fibrous body into a textile; the Carline Thistle plays the “fair
                Mechanic” whose far-floating seeds precede the Montgolfier brothers in the
                “invention” of the hot air balloon, and Papyra [papyrus] is credited with
                introducing semiotic systems into human cultures (2:66–84, 7–66, 105–18). Darwin’s
                suspicious parodist reads such images of vegetable ingenuity as covert allegories
                for the experimentalists’ own plans to manipulate plant biology. But taken straight,
                Darwin’s notion of vegetable ingenuity emerges from a thoroughgoing naturalist
                perspective that has ceased to respect the anthropo- and androcentric distinction
                between the fruits of biological generation and the works of technical genius.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Concurring, therefore, with Bewell
                            that “in Darwin’s ‘economy of vegetation,’ the distinction between
                            nature and <hi rend="italic" >techné </hi>is not of
                            great importance,” I depart from his judgment that managing,
                            controlling, exploiting, and profiting from nature is therefore
                            paramount (<hi rend="italic" >Natures </hi>69).
                            There is, after all, also the “libertine” possibility Meeker and Szabari
                            ascribe to him, that of seeing other natures as “artfully enabling
                            mediation” and “engender[ing] the technologies that allow us to be
                            affected by them” (486).</note> 
                Situating “invention” and “representation” <hi rend="italic" >within </hi>the realm of
                generative reproduction and deviation, Darwinian techno-pastoral foregrounds the
                precedence and participation of other natures as coauthors in the history of art,
                technology, and mediation.
                
                Yet such technophilic naturalism, and this is the third
                point, would remain indistinguishable from familiar technologies of domination, were
                it not for the copresence of the pastoral insistence on leisure. Only the pause that
                the pastoral mode places on the workaday world and the working day ensures that the
                visionary technics in evidence arise not from increased human manipulation but, on
                the contrary, from giving space or leaving room for other beings to take up,
                differently, the activity of transformation to which some human societies have relentlessly
                subjected the other constituents of the earth.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I remain inspired by and indebted to
                            Anne-Lise François’ unparalleled meditation on the ethics and politics
                            of biotechnology as “a contest for the domain of human and ecological
                            creativity”; in her essay, pastoral is implicated in the difficulty of
                            holding an “openness to unscripted, heretofore unimagined possibilities”
                            of nature apart from the hegemonic mandate of “constant reinvention”
                            (45). And a key distinction arises between an ethos that makes space to
                            be surprised by ecological creativity and one that seeks to control,
                            patent, and “<hi rend="italic" >imagine </hi>itself
                            determining” the shape and duration of plant and animal generation (44).
                            See also, in the context of an ecological ethos of desistence Matthew A.
                            Taylor’s notion of “counter-industrious revolution”: not a “war against
                            climate change, only a relinquishing of the fetishes of growth,
                            productivity, acceleration and mastery that have fired our world” (132).

            <p> Finally, this strange form of techno-pastoral utopianism permits a political ecology
                to come into view that foregrounds the authentically political axis of freedom and
                coercion, as opposed to the now common preoccupation with the ontological axis of
                “human” and/versus “nonhuman” being. It is true that an open ontology — an ontology
                that does not presume to dictate the capacities of various kinds of being in advance
                and that does not invest in the human “exception” — is propitious, if not
                prerequisite, for an ecological point of view. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that
                abolishing hierarchy among categories of being accomplishes anybody’s political
                liberation. In fact, where ontological leveling masquerades as <hi rend="italic"
                    >political</hi> ecology achieved, it necessarily thwarts and mystifies the basic
                politicization of ecology.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I take this to be the risk of Jane
                            Bennett’s eloquent and influential “new materialist” approach to
                            political ecology in <hi rend="italic">Vibrant Materialism</hi>. Many of
                            her sources in the long, <hi rend="italic">old</hi> history of
                            non-Cartesian, non-Kantian philosophical naturalism, vitalism, and
                            materialism do not share this deficit.</note> 
                This is because matters of justice, exploitation, and repair in the realm of ecology have never concerned
                <hi rend="italic">the</hi> human and/versus <hi rend="italic">the</hi> non-human; they have instead to do with
                <hi rend="italic" >certain</hi> humans exploiting <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> other human
                and nonhuman beings. An analytic grounded in ontological
                categories of being has no means to grasp this asymmetrical and differential
                distribution of responsibility and harm. In this context, parables of ecological
                jubilee acquire their peculiar utopian, <hi rend="italic">counter-ideological purchase</hi>. For, however
                distortedly, they begin by imagining not ontological equivalency but an end to
                coercion. This, I would argue, is a genuinely political gambit. </p>
                
            <p> How, then, does this peculiar eco-utopian imaginary we have been tracing comport with
                the facts of racialization, colonization, and enslavement that enabled and fractured
                “the human” and his rights during
                Darwin’s era of their revolutionary ascendancy and counter-reaction? To explore this
                question, I turn, finally, to Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">The Economy of
                    Vegetation</hi>, focusing on the political ecology of slavery and abolition in
                that poem. Here, the human and non-human “Others of Man” welcomed into the poem’s
                Jacobin ecology clearly emerge as demanding and exacting allies, rather than, as I
                worried above, figures of wish-fulfillment or alibis for the history of
                technological and colonial domination. Darwin’s techniques of figuring earth and
                ground in <hi rend="italic">The Economy</hi>, I argue, push past the interests of
                his own bustling, industrial bourgeois milieu to issue in distinctly illiberal,
                anti-humanitarian incitements to multinatural vengeance against chattel slavery and
                settler colonialism. In black counterpoint to our visions of “ecological jubilee,”
                    <hi rend="italic">The Economy</hi>’s parables of “ecological retribution”
                attempt to join forces with the many expropriated natures (human, nonhuman,
                dehumanized) forced into complicity by the transatlantic slave trade on the eve of
                a militant <hi rend="italic">black</hi> Jacobinism.</p></div>

                <head>Relief Poetry and the Race for/of the Ground</head>
          
                
            <p> If the class politics of Darwin’s visions of communal luxury were transparent enough
                to make for easy parody, grasping the ecological intersection between race and class
                in his work requires a subtler appreciation of the poet’s figurative and
                compositional tactics. The brilliant Swiss-English graphic artist Henri Fuseli’s
                frontispiece to <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Vegetation</hi> provides a
                perfect introduction (Figure 4). The frontispiece is supposed to represent the
                Goddess of Botany, “Flora, attired by the Elements,” in correspondence with the four,
                element-focused cantos through which the poem purports to tell the “physiology of
                plants.” And indeed, Fuseli’s frontispiece provides an allegorical persona for each
                element: Air, with her dashing butterfly hat; Fire, with a mirror to represent the
                action of light; Water, with an appropriate vase; and Earth offering up a sampling
                of her gorgeous vegetation. But who, then, is the extra, extra-earthy figure in the
                very bottom of the frame, reaching up from the ground, as plants do, but with brawny
                arms and a cap of weeds? </p>
                
            <p> As Fuseli intimates with this picture, supernumerary, subterranean figures like this
                one proliferate in the second canto of <hi rend="italic">The Economy of
                    Vegetation</hi>, the one that is devoted to the elemental activity of “earth.”
                Here, the actions of soils, earths, and minerals are at stake and all manner of
                quasi-animate beings, from slumbering seeds to incipient statues, Bastilled
                prisoners, oppressed Irishmen, and Africans in irons, linger in stony latency to
                release themselves, or be released, from the ground. As the syntax of that last
                sentence suggests, the distribution of agency and patience across figure and
                background is particularly fraught when it comes to the canto’s joint task of
                personifying elements of earth — that is, figuring the ground—and depicting the action
                of that and those who have been, in Darwin’s phrase, “disanimated” or
                reduced to that terrestrial matrix. <note place="foot" resp="author">I adapt the term from a related context: Canto 2, l. 312, analyzed below.</note>
                The addressees of this Earth Canto, elements of
                ground whom Darwin personifies as “Gnomes,” bear this figural burden: they operate
                as a force of frankly de-carceral natality, even as they do not quite cease to
                embody the inhuman, inanimate states of imprisonment and (social) death in which
                certain beings are interred, not to mention the stony walls, tombs, and prisons that
                contain them. In any case, their personification means allowing the background to
                surge into relief, usually at the cost of someone or something else (Canto 1, l.73). Reading
                Darwin’s Earth Canto alongside anticolonial ecologies of race allows us to see how the
                kitschy, elastic, preternatural figure of the “Gnomes” — etymologically, <hi
                    rend="italic">earth-men</hi> — come to signify the condition of imposed
                identification and possible allegiance between varieties of exploited ground and the racialized
                classes of beings conscripted to work them. Such earths and such human beings are
                linked by economies of extraction that Darwin cannot but trace in doing due
                diligence to the sites and sources of Enlightenment geological and mineralogical
                knowledge.</p>
                
            <p> But before leaving Fuseli’s image, notice its ekphrastic function: as an engraving of
                a (fictional) cameo, the frontispiece offers another indispensable clue to Darwin’s
                mediatic art in <hi rend="italic">The Economy</hi>. Critics, then and now, have
                agreed that Erasmus Darwin’s poetic style is highly visual, rife with allegorical
                personifications and written “principally to the eye,” as he put it himself, as if in
                proper neoclassical deference to poetry’s “sister art,” painting (<hi rend="italic"
                    >ut pictura poeisis</hi>) ("Loves" 48). But the meaning of writing “to the eye” changes in
                light of Darwin’s understanding of the neurophysiology of sight. To address the eye
                with a printed word, he explains in his biomedical masterwork, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoonomia</hi>, is to trigger cascades of associated tactile experience,
                literally disposing the reader’s nerves of touch to reconstitute the
                three-dimensional feel of the signified with her own body (Goldstein “Nerve
                poetry”). Darwin’s allegories of reading thus stress the kinesthetic reconstitution
                of poetic lines as three-dimensional forms: William Cowper attested to the effect as
                “Meet[ing] the eye with a <hi rend="italic">boldness of projection</hi> unattainable
                by any hand but that of a master” (qtd. in Packham 147). Given this foundational
                semiotic relation between plastic plenitude and visual abstraction, it is no wonder
                that specimens of relief sculpture (tomb decorations, architectural ornaments,
                medallions, cameos, and coins) are privileged objects of Darwin’s poetic attention
                in the <hi rend="italic">Botanic Garden</hi>.<note place="foot" resp="author">  See Priestman’s related insight that,
                            from the formal level of the line to that of the epic, Darwin’s poems
                            are constructed as spatial architectures rather than temporal
                            narratives. And see Alan Richardson’s groundbreaking recognition of Darwin (among
                            others) as advancing an influential, embodied, brain-based science of
                            the “mind” within Romantic culture.</note> Dramatizing the
                emergence of plastic forms from undifferentiated ground, objects sculpted or molded
                in bas-relief were ready allegories for the kind of cognitive experience Darwin
                hoped to produce through poetry by virtue of the physiology of reading. </p>
                
            <p> As the prototype for Darwin’s poetry, the minor art of bas-relief declines to produce
                autonomous, free-standing forms, in favor of scenes in which form continually issues
                from a material ground. Likewise, Darwin’s didactic figural strategies
                systematically redistribute attention towards grounds and surroundings, refusing (or
                failing) to extricate focal agents and objects from their contextual supports and
                dramatizing the difficulty of selecting what to bring into relief. In addition to
                explaining much readerly disorientation, Darwin’s dizzying commitment to
                foregrounding backgrounds and magnifying the minor accounts for the most distinctive
                and obvious formal feature of his poems — the extensive apparatus of footnotes that
                supports each column of verse like a prosaic pedestal.<note place="foot" resp="author">Substantiating the poem’s claims with sources
                                and explanations, this apparatus redefines the poetic voice as an
                                expression of collective expertise (the “The Lunar Society” and its
                                members’ far-flung correspondence and research) that cannot stand or
                                be comprehended apart from this generative matrix of production.
                                Against the autonomy of lyric, then, we might counterpose the
                                aesthetic heteronomy of didactic, for which contextualism is
                                intrinsic to the form and to any formalism capable of countenancing
                                it as art (Goldstein,

                With a root in <hi rend="italic">relevare</hi>, to lift up, but also to offer help
                or relief, what I term “relief poetry” captures the immediately political and
                sentimental pathos of a poetry saturated with the problem of what or whom to
                elevate, make visible, and animate by setting the reader’s living nervous system

                            the mischief Blake works thereon through his own bas-relief art

            <p> The intimate connection between relief poetics, mineral extraction, industrial
                manufacturing, and chattel slavery in the (Political) <hi rend="italic">Economy of
                    Vegetation</hi> comes to a head when Darwin embeds the most iconic token of the
                contemporary transatlantic abolitionist movement in the middle of his Earth Canto
                (Figure 5). This bas-relief medallion first appears in the course of the canto’s
                survey of the formation of clays and the manufacture of ceramics. Commissioned in
                1787 as the seal for the London Committee of the Society for Effecting the Abolition
                of the Slave Trade (SEAST), the image was a smash hit in abolitionist circles,
                especially after Darwin’s Lunar Society friend and collaborator, the porcelain
                manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood, put it into mass production as a wearable cameo at his
                state-of-the-art factory, Etruria (Figure 6). In an irony apparently lost on
                those who wore it, the SEAST’s emblem against human commodification became quite the
                fashionable commodity: the cameo was set in snuffboxes and worn in bracelets and
                hairpins; like an earlier modern “meme,” it crossed the channel and the Atlantic,
                switching genders, settings, and media in diverse adaptations (Clarkson 191–92;
                Hamilton 631–52). Responding to a batch he received from Wedgwood in a 1798 letter,
                Lunar Society foreign correspondent Benjamin Franklin described a marked alteration
                in “the countenances” of those to whom he had distributed the cameo, attesting to
                the medallion’s particular power as a plastic relief artifact: “I have seen such marks of being
                affected by contemplating the figure of the supplicant (which is admirably executed)
                that I am persuaded it may have an effect equal to that of the best written pamphlet
                in procuring favour to those afflicted people” (qtd. in Hamilton 635).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Tobias

                            in abolitionist poetry: rather than merely consolidating existing bonds,
                            Menely argues, the abolitionist appeal can work to bring into being a
                            sympathetic public that does not preexist its utterance (45–67).
                            Questions remain, I think, about the terms on which enslaved subjects
                            are figured for the purposes of forging new sympathetic identifications
                            among presumptively white audiences.</note> 
                Leading English abolitionist Thomas Clarkson credited the icon with helping to “keep up a hatred of
                the trade among the people” and “turning the popular feeling in our favour” during
                the many intervals when the Society’s parliamentary efforts were stalled (188,
                191).</p>
                
            <p> Typifying both the propagandistic efficacy and the limits of the mainstream white
                abolitionist imagination — which preferred to picture a “supplicating Negro” begging
                kinship recognition (in the nearly unanswerable form of a negative rhetorical
                question) to the ongoing fact and fear of slave and Maroon uprisings in the
                colonies — the image also did its share of damage. In casting the enslaved person's humanity and
                freedom as a “gift” in the (presumptively white) spectator’s power to bestow, such
                visions of “the emancipation moment” symbolically steal a person’s freedom a second time by
                usurping their power to seize it (Wood 29).<note place="foot" resp="author" > In Marcus Wood’s analysis, 
                    this paradigm of emancipation tees up an ethos of white British self-congratulation for the eventual 
                    abolition of the trade in 1807 that persisted well into the bicentennial celebrations of 2007, 
                    which failed to commemorate, for instance, the fact that slaveholders and not formally enslaved persons were financially 
                    compensated for their “loss.” Without disputing this overall Fanon-derived analysis, Hamilton has shown that the visual 
                    rhetoric of the kneeling slave was somewhat more nuanced, alluding to the heroic endurance and (potentially 
                    threatening) strength of Hercules. I would also note that Darwin’s own, neurophysiological theory of the operation 
                    of sympathetic mimesis through various perceptual media suggests that such a complex object’s text and sculptured 
                    image may not have acted in concert on the body of a person who simultaneously sees, reads, and holds it. 
                    True, the motto “Am I Not A Man and A Brother?” projects its <hi rend="italic">reader</hi> as the addressee and 
                    adjudicator of this rhetorical question, empowered to grant or withhold humanity and kinship from the “imploring” slave. 
                    But because the bas-relief pictures the slave in profile, it positions its viewer as witness, instead, to a 
                    scene in which the slave beseeches someone else. This position of complicit remove was well-keyed to the English 
                    mainland situation, in which citizens could (and frequently did) congratulate themselves on the effective illegality
                    of slavery on their soil, while profiting magnificently from the transatlantic slave trade. 
                    Less suspiciously read, this effect correlates with Menely’s keen observation that humanitarian 
                    abolitionist poetics extend the scope of existing sympathetic identification where “the collective
                    addressee witnesses not only the suffering slave but its own witnessing of the slave’s suffering” (65). 
                    Finally, Darwin’s understanding of ideation as bodily mimicry of the object by the senses, particularly in the 
                    case of touch, suggests that the palpable medallion may not only constrain the agency of the depicted slave but
                    also bring the perceiver to his or her (virtual) knees, forcing their nerves to rehearse like attitudes of 
                    humiliation. See Goldstein “Nerve Poetry” on Darwin’s neuro-aesthetics. </note>
                
                Nor is such an analysis merely a product of hindsight. In his 1801 novel of the
                Haitian Revolution, <hi rend="italic">The Daughter of Adoption</hi>, John Thelwall
                put the logic of what Marcus Wood calls “the horrible gift of freedom” in the mouth of a revered old white
                philanthropist in St. Domingue who surprises a radical young friend by
                <hi rend="italic" >not </hi>celebrating the news that the
                islands’ slaves “have thrown off the yoke” (160). “‘And is it possible, sir, after
                what I have heard from your lips,” the young man asks incredulously, “that you can
                be averse to the emancipation of your sable brethren?’” The older man replies: “I
                would die to emancipate them; but I cannot wish for their revolt” (160). At the core
                of the white Englishman’s stated, humanitarian preference for the “slow” but
                “certain” operation of “the sympathy of mankind,” then, Thelwall reveals a refusal
                to relinquish that power to emancipate the slave in which the colonist’s supremacy
                is staked at a value equal to that of his own life.</p>
                
            <p> Darwin’s first pass at the cameo focuses on its production in Wedgwood’s factory,
                attempting to channel “the fair medallion’s” transmedial, transatlantic efficacy in
                verse, even as it draws out the occulted labor and materials behind its sentimental
                surface:

                Commenting on passages such as this some thirty years ago, Maureen McNeil shrewdly
                observed that Darwin’s industrial poetry erased workers from the scene, instead
                attributing labor “to ‘gnomes’ who magically perform the work required” (17, 19).
                Yet equipped with mining and prospecting hammers, presiding over kilns, grinding
                pigments with a “strong arm,” molding and glazing forms with a
                “charm’d . . . touch,” these “GNOMES” certainly insinuate the working people at
                Wedgwood’s factory and across his far-flung supply and production chain. Rather than
                eliminate human producers, Darwin’s incessant apostrophes to earth-men in the plural
                encompass human laborers together with the materials, tools, and machines they work,
                conjoining both sources of occulted value that contribute to the animate “magic” of
                commodities. “Charm’d by your touch,” Darwin repeats, the molten metals pour,
                harden, refine, take shape, and shine: “The bold Cameo speaks, the soft Intaglio
                thinks.” What ultimately “speaks” and “thinks” through the “bold Cameo” in this
                passage is an industrial supply and production chain, from clay harvesting to
                mineral mining, chemical processing, and factory finishing. At stake is a kind of proto-Marxist
                prosopopoeia that makes the commodity’s power an indexical expression of the human
                labor and globally-sourced materials that went into its production.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Alongside the
                            famous antislavery medallion, Darwin reproduced the image of another,
                            equally fraught Wedgwood cameo, this one plunging us into the penal
                            colonization of Australia: a cameo of “Hope attended by Peace, and Art,
                            and Labour; which was made of clay from Botany-Bay; to which place [Wedgewood]
                            sent many of them, to show the inhabitants what their materials would
                            do, and to encourage their industry” (<hi rend="italic">Economy of
                                Vegetation</hi> l.315n).</note> Darwin’s remediation makes
                clear that these occulted agencies (“GNOMES”) contribute to the semiotic and
                affective efficacy of the cameo (its power to “speak,” “think,” and “call the pearly
                drops from Pity’s eye, / Or stay Despair’s disanimating sigh”). But as we will see,
                it is not quite clear that their meaning agrees with the milquetoast motto — <hi
                    rend="italic">Am I Not A Man and a Brother?</hi> — actually printed thereon.</p>
                
            <p> On the earthen side of Darwin’s gnomic conjunction, a “new” materialist emphasis on
                nonhuman agency — particularly on the kind of “natural technicity” I explored in the
                previous section — is indeed emphatic in this section of <hi rend="italic">The Economy
                    of Vegetation</hi>. Mineral processes of taking shape and appearing, including
                in splendid, highly wrought forms, are literally and scientifically at stake in the
                Earth Canto, as in this passage on the process by which acids transmute chalk into
                gemstones:
          
                    <quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>Hence silvery Selenite her chrystal moulds,</l>
            <l>And soft Asbestus smooths his silky folds;</l>
            <l>His cubic forms phosphoric Fluor prints,</l>
            <l>Or rays in spheres his amethystine tints.</l>
            <l>Soft cobweb clouds transparent Onyx spreads,</l>
            <l>And playful Agates weave their colour’d threads;</l>
            <l>Gay pictured Mochoes glow with landscape-dyes,</l>
            <l>And changeful Opals roll their lucid eyes (219–26)</l></lg></quote>
                        
           In another context, to speak of stones weaving, folding, printing, and tinting their
                garments — to write of stones molding spheres and cubes, painting landscapes, or
                “roll[ing] their lucid eyes” back at the spectator — would constitute gross and
                indecent anthropomorphism. But such figures operate differently in a poem that
                systematically traces the chemical and geological production of spectacular mineral
                forms, revealing very real, yet very nonhuman powers to fashion the kind of shapes
                that humans achieve largely through artistry and technique. These mineral
                productions include not only rigorously geometrical forms but also mimetic
                similitudes of other natures: rocks and gemstones that assume the shape of wisps of
                hair, floral petals and spines, striated sands and tree rings, land- and seascapes.
                The Earth Canto also explores the mineral dimension of plant and animal vitality: Darwin
                traces the blush of blood-borne iron beneath a rosy human cheek and the “dark mould,
                white lime, and crumbling sands” that nourish and awaken dormant seeds (542). By
                virtue of the recently discovered chemical processes of oxidation, respiration, and
                photosynthesis traced in the poem, moreover, elements of earth actually effectuate
                animation and its signs in the poem: breath, energy, growth, motion.</p>
                
            <p> Darwin’s scientific realism on the question of the relation between earthly
                materiality and technical artistry, between geochemistry and biological animation,
                means that his “GNOMES” certainly personify a sphere of suppressed identity between “earths”
                and “men,” bodying forth at once the action of minerals in and on human beings and
                of human beings in and on the earth. But as usual, summation at the level of
                human/nonhuman ontology will occlude the political burden of the not-quite-,
                not-merely-human “gnomes” in their pointed marginality and plural, collective
                action. Reading Darwin’s Earth Canto in its entirety in fact helps mitigate the present
                tendency to mistake ontology for political ecology that is writ large in those theories of the
                “Anthropocene” that urge the suppression of difference under the (negative)
                universal sign of human peril.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dipesh Chakrabarty’s brilliant and influential
                            early formulation of the challenge that Anthropocene science posed to
                            humanist historiography focused on the limits of his own formation in
                            postcolonial, Marxist, subaltern, and globalization studies, and
                            projected the “negative universal history” that would need to arise in
                            their place (199, 222). And see Andreas Malm’s <hi rend="italic">The

                            urgency that sees attention to differential histories as an obstacle to
                            climate action.</note> 
                To repeat what ought to be obvious, at
                stake in the ecological predicament said to have begun in Darwin’s generation is not
                a question of the relation between the anthropos and the earth but of <hi
                    rend="italic">certain</hi> human societies exploiting certain other human societies <hi
                    rend="italic">and</hi> the nonhuman beings that condition their existence. And it is in the latter side of this
                asymmetrical relation — the human and nonhuman beings brought together as expendable
                resources throughout the history of New World colonization and capitalization — that
                the gnomic conjunction <hi rend="italic">earth-men</hi> increasingly figures forth
                in Darwin’s poem. Such conjunctions are crucial to a political ecology capable of
                recognizing historical reparations as intrinsic to any project of ecological
                repair.</p>
                
            <p> From the perspective of critical geography, Kathryn Yusoff has suggestively sketched
                the conjunction between (certain) earths and (certain) men at stake in the
                pre-history of fossil capital and “Anthropocene” geology. The “coal-black” subjects
                of chattel slavery and the earths subjected to fossil fuel extraction were forcibly
                conjoined, she argues, by “blackness” as an “inhuman categorization” that marked
                those who bore it as appropriable energy sources for colonial expansion and
                industrialization. To foreground just one literal, metabolic example of the link
                between England’s industrialization and its expanding colonial empire, West Indian
                plantation sugar and East Indian tea fueled the “wage slaves” at the base of
                England’s new industrial economy, those soot-blackened persons that populate both
                William Blake’s <hi rend="italic">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> and
                Darwin’s West Midlands region, known as the “Black Country.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lunar Society
                            collaborations were instrumental to the early and precipitous
                            industrialization of the West Midlands projects ranging from John
                            Wilkinson’s ironworks at Bradley to James Watt’s improvements on the
                            Newcomen Engine to numerous canal and transportation via projects. See
                            Jennifer S. Uglow’s comprehensive group biography.</note>
                Yet Yusoff’s theory of “black inhumanist poetics,” like Monique Allewaert’s notion
                of “parahuman” allegiance among the beings yoked together by plantation
                ecology/economy, reveals not only histories of subjugation but also illicit
                practices of “freedom <hi rend="italic" > in </hi>the earth”
                unleashed when expropriated subjects of “inhuman categorization” tip their
                compulsory intimacy with the land into strategic alliance and multinatural
                insurgency (Yusoff xii, 15; Allewaert 7).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Monique Allewaert’s work on “parahuman”
                            allegiances in the plantation zone brilliantly explores not only the
                            vulnerabilities but also the illicit powers arising from enslaved
                            African and Maroon subjects’ initially unchosen proximity to other
                            natures (by way of both lived experience and onto-epistemological
                            categorization) as well as from their participation in and invention of
                            cosmologies that organize nature otherwise.</note> When Yusoff
                suggests that early American black inhumanist artistry can attest to “a
                gravitational force so extravagant, it defies gravity”, we can perceive the
                elective affinity between the long history of Afro-futurism and the eco-utopian
                “suspensions of natural law” this essay has traced by way of pastoral (100). At stake is a
                form of multinatural allegiance that upends not only positive laws but also the
                natural laws taken for their necessary ground.</p>
                
            <p> Written from the contradictory heart of a dissenting, abolitionist Enlightenment centered in
                England’s industrializing Midlands, Darwin’s poetry ultimately manages to limn and
                solicit such insurgent potential within the differentially “inhuman” terrestrial
                collectivities that it apostrophizes without being able to activate or control.
                Though critics from the
                <hi rend="italic" >Anti-Jacobin </hi>forward have mocked the topical
                miscellany characteristic of Darwin’s poem, there is a logic to the poem’s movement in the
                Earth Canto, and it is frankly and increasingly - anti-colonial. In fact, Darwin traces, with subtle but
                intensifying condemnation, the very trajectory mapped by Yusoff’s “inhuman geography,”
                the geo-logic that unites the histories of fossil capital with that of colonial slavery. </p>
                                
            <p> Here, in brief, is that sequence of movements. From industrial-scale cameo-production
                in Wedgewood’s factory, Darwin next surveys the nearby fields of “sable COAL,”
                pointedly touching on the dark distillates of “fossil oil”: “pitchy” Naptha, and
                Jet, eponymously black (349, 351–52). He gives particular attention to Amber, a
                petroleum sublimate whose electrical properties, in Darwin’s lithic retelling,
                galvanize the American and French Revolutions (“man electrified man” [368]) through
                the person of Benjamin Franklin only to stumble on the long colonial history of the
                Americas and, again, the present reality of Black enslavement (353–94). In such
                sequencing, the volatile blackness of fossil earth forms a link between the poem’s
                repeated confrontations with chattel slavery in an Age of Revolution, as if the
                racialized conjunction between usable earth and useable people held the key to
                grasping the <hi rend="italic">non</hi>contradiction between the victory of the
                Rights of Man and an ongoing “inhuman trade.”</p>
                
            <p> Darwin builds to a second engagement with Wedgwood’s medallion by castigating his
                countrymen as successors to the Spanish colonial profiteers who “slaughter’d half
                the globe”:

            The closing anti-slavery exhortation, paraphrasing the Wedgwood cameo’s scene and
                motto, has the ring of a sentimental set piece: an appeal to universal brotherhood
                keyed to the supposed humanitarian impulse of a British readership. </p>
                
            <p> But the passage also stages a limit to this fashionable, consumable form of speaking
                and feeling for the enslaved person. There is more to say, it seems, but “sorrow” — whether the
                enslaved person's or the poet’s, in his overweening sympathy — “choaks the rest.” And here the poem
                itself emphatically “chokes” on a kind of grievance not so easily produced and
                consumed: the lines sputter apart in a flurry of dashes, chiasmi, and an awkward
                enjambment that together shatter Darwin’s highly regular meter and end-stopped
                lineation. At this breaking point, the materialist nature poem capitulates into a
                kind of curse or prayer (the language is biblical) that radicalizes Darwin’s overall
                poetics of deflecting attention towards the background. Calling on the elemental
                milieu for relief - “AIR! bear to heaven upon thy azure flood / Their innocent
                cries! — EARTH! cover not their blood!”<hi rend="italic">—</hi>the speaker cedes to
                these elemental media that quintessential artistic power of lifting something up for
                notice or preservation. Now the air is to bear up the slaves’ protest, the earth to
                ensure that their wrongly-spilled blood continues to surface. In the absence of a
                divine Book of Judgment, the vast material and semiotic re-combinatory that Darwin
                scientifically believes the globe to be is called upon to retain the evidence of the
                damage, to amplify the smothered voices, to enact retribution or reparation. This
                scene of natural justice seems to me the moral counterpart of the joyous
                multi-natural jubilee that tore hierarchies to the (fertile) ground. </p>
                
            <p> If this were a canonical Romantic lyric poem, if it operated according to good
                negative aesthetic principles, it would probably stop here, at the threshold that
                marks the unsayable, even sublime, alterity of the Other’s suffering. But this poem
                is didactic, scholarly, thorough. And it is after material retribution. Having
                diligently followed the minerals, so to speak, through that zig-zag, transatlantic
                course that connects the precious metal mines of Spanish colonial Mexico and Peru
                (which first fueled the demand for enslaved African labor) — home to the coalfields of
                the English Midlands (whose incipient industrial working classes are fueled by West
                Indian sugar) — across the channel to revolutionary France (about to be galvanized by
                insurrection in Saint-Domingue), Darwin’s “GNOMES” have picked up a racialized and
                explicitly militant charge: 
           
                    <quote><lg type="stanza">
                
            <l>When Heaven’s dread justice smites in crimes o’ergrown</l>
            <l>The blood-nursed Tyrant on his purple throne, </l>
            <l>GNOMES! YOUR bold forms unnumber’d arms outstretch,</l>
            <l>And urge the vengeance o’er the guilty wretch. (431–34)</l></lg></quote>
                        
            And indeed, Darwin finishes out the canto by seeking evidence of what I called, at
                the outset “ecological retribution” — that is, he sifts through his vast natural
                historical archive for signs of elemental forces departing from the moral
                indifference usually presumed to be their law. </p>
                                
            <p> What emerges across the canto’s remaining episodes is a revisionist natural history
                in which terrestrial elements conspire with racialized subjects to reverse and
                avenge the progress of empire. Darwin reprises the ancient story of the Persian
                general Cambyses II, who attempted to “subdue Ethopia,” only to have his armies
                subsumed by burning sandstorms in the deserts of Northeast Africa: “wave after wave
                the driving desert swims, / Bursts over their heads, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >inhumes</hi> the struggling limbs” (435n, 489–90; emphasis added).<note place="foot" resp="author">Darwin retells 
                        the story from classical sources but corroborates the ongoing possibility of

                        desert phenomena recorded in Scottish travel writer James Bruce’s

                In this retelling, what seems like natural disaster is fostered by the “vindictive
                hands” of the canto’s ever-present “Gnomes” — those half-human, half-earthen
                collectivities that have changed over the course of the canto from solicitous
                minsters of the poem’s every topical whim to militant, “resistless” agents of
                political violence (460, 487). Their “infuriate surge” inhumes the invaders in “one
                great earthy Ocean” (487, 494). Night then “bow[s] his Ethiop brow,” as if to
                sanctify the action, before the poem turns to celebrate the “Afric Warrior,”
                Hannibal, to whom the very Alps yielded passage, that he might “sh[ake] the rising
                empire of the world” (495, 529–41). Implicitly, over the course of this movement, Darwin has threatened 
                that the earth will <hi rend="italic">inhume</hi> that is, smother - with earth - the "inhuman trade" in which 
                his own well-being is implicated and which gives the lie to contemporary pretenses
                of universal humanism and humanitarian sentimentalism alike.</p>
                
            <p> Are such dark pastoral <hi rend="italic">adynata</hi>, no less than the Golden,
                utopian ones — for in both cases, other-than-human beings suspend the laws of nature
                by taking a moral or political side — simply preposterous and ironic,
                <hi rend="italic" >impossibilia </hi>connoting impossibility
                itself? Are the twinned, utopian poles of multinatural vengeance and multinatural
                jubilee anything other than “bad faith” in the presumptively materialist context of
                Darwin’s poem — examples of the eschatology for atheists that Steven Goldsmith has
                detected in much new materialist thought? Or examples of unchallenging recourse to a common
                form of Providentialism, in which the elements are once again instruments of a just
                God? ("Almost Gone" 417) Maybe. Yet in the present context of global climate destabilization, it feels
                difficult not to read the destructive behavior of the elements as commentary on the
                history of human production and consumption as well as to recognize that the
                Holocene regularities we have known have never been as immutable as “natural law.”
                Moreover, and more to the point of Darwin’s groping attempts at a natural philosophy
                and poetics of abolition, some Black Studies scholars’ critiques of mainstream
                Anthropocene and new materialist theory advocate a similar form of attention to the
                poetic conjuncture between other-than-human beings and human subjects of
                dehumanization — between what is called “nature” and those “genres of being human”
                rendered illegible by one ethno-class’s over-representation
                <hi rend="italic">as </hi>Man (Wynter, "Re-Enchantment" 183, 186; "Unsettling" 273, 281, 316-18, 331). </p>
                                
            <p> Zakiyyah Iman Jackson observes that because the racialization of some expressions of
                humanity as insufficiently human structures the very field of <hi rend="italic"
                    >non</hi>-human being for modern Western metaphysics, attempts to move “<hi
                    rend="italic">beyond</hi> the human” without confronting race as intrinsic to
                the matter at hand cannot but perpetuate humanism’s historical ignorance and silence
                regarding Black critiques and praxes — not least those “irreverent to the normative
                production of ‘the human’” all along (216). It ought to go without saying that
                other-than-white thought and practice, early and late, has a good deal to teach
                Anthropocene perpetrators about comporting otherwise with other-than-human beings.
                Yet although the precedence and brilliance of minoritized thought on this score
                frequently goes unacknowledged, the inherence of racialization in the actual and
                theoretical territory of ecological concern for other-than-human beings is not
                optional: “terrestrial movement toward the nonhuman is simultaneously movement
                toward blackness, whether blackness is embraced or not” (Z. I. Jackson 217).</p>
                
            <p> By turning so incessantly to the ground in his <hi rend="italic">Economy of
                    Vegetation</hi>, has Darwin found a way of registering the threat and promise of
                a kind of terrestrial justice meted out by and for subjects scarcely discernible
                therefrom — sustaining, and threatening his gorgeous <hi rend="italic">Botanic
                    Garden</hi> with their "inhuman," inhuming power? Not so improbably, perhaps, when
                the glaring fact of the “inhuman trade” revealed to anyone who cared to see that the
                other-than-human realm was rife with human being uncounted as such. For a natural
                philosopher and poet such as Erasmus Darwin, moreover, such dispossessed subjects
                shared space with genres of plant, animal, and mineral being whose capacity for
                meaning-making and historical transformation was likewise undreamt and
                underestimated in mainstream metaphysics. </p>
                
            <p> I hope to have suggested that, issuing from deep within the culture of the
                perpetrators, the doggedly terrestrial movement of Erasmus Darwin’s
                <hi rend="italic" >Botanic Garden </hi>cannot but express the
                historical, epistemological, metabolic, and metonymic associations between the
                earth’s energetic darkness and that of its (literally) denigrated subjects. But more than this:
                the poetics draws this racialized dimension of the ground into relief,
                apostrophizing the human humus in such a way as to hail the retributive and
                reparative ingenuity of this association without enfolding it in the discourse of
                Man. Darwin’s awkward, impure anti-colonialism appeals not to the wrath and rapture
                of God but to that of the <hi rend="italic">interred</hi>, those scarcely
                distinguishable from the ground and thereby able to partake, for better or for
                worse, of its more-than-human power. Who knows what other natures, in their freedom,
                might do, were we to cease foreclosing that possibility by force and by
                philosophy?</p></div>
