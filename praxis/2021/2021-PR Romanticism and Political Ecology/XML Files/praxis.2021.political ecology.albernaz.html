               <h1><span class="head">The Sovereignty of "Man"</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>After the frame, on the first page of the narrative proper of Mary Shelley’s 1826
               novel <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, the narrator and titular last man Lionel Verney opens his account with a strange
               reflection on the distribution of global space, in addition to a remark on Man as
               such: <span class="quote">‘I AM the native of a sea-surrounded nook, a cloud-enshadowed land, which, when the
                  surface of the globe . . . presents itself to my mind, appears only as an inconsiderable
                  speck in the immense whole; and yet, when balanced in the scale of mental power, far
                  outweighed countries of larger extent and more numerous population. So true it is,
                  that man’s mind alone was the creator of all that was good or great to man, and that
                  Nature herself was only his first minister. England, seated far north in the turbid
                  sea, now visits my dreams in the semblance of a vast and well-manned ship, which mastered
                  the winds and rode proudly over the waves. (9) ’</span> England’s place is at the center and height of civilization, indeed at the very height
               of “Man." Much later in the book, after the plague has decimated almost the whole
               country, Verney apostrophizes England with: “England, thou wert the triumph of man”
               (LM 323). And here at the opening, England’s place in the globe is explicitly determined
               not geographically but in terms of “the scale of mental power.” This scale of mental
               power, Verney then says, is the essence of what it means to be “Man”: “man’s mind
               alone was the creator of all that was good or great to man.” Indeed, it is precisely
               England’s outsized claim to “mental power” that allows it to assert its sovereignty
               and dominate both global commerce and nature alike, “master[ing] the winds” and sea,
               “subdu[ing]” the earth, with nonhuman nature as “only [man’s] first minister” (9);
               thus Man’s sovereignty is not only a political but an ecological matter. In the narrative’s
               opening, which has been called a “dream of sovereign extension,” we are told that
               Man is constituted by sovereignty and mastery and that this sovereignty (indexed by
               mental power) is not equally distributed across the divisions of humanity (Elmer 358).
               England is figured as a ship, and specifically, a “well-<span style="font-style:italic">man</span>ned ship”—the triumph of Man. From the novel’s title to the opening paragraph, to
               its final word, “Man” in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> is a differentiated dream of sovereignty.</p>
            <p>This operation of differentiation is inseparably bound up with race. The very idea
               of a “scale of mental power” that is distributed unevenly across the globe evokes
               various strands of scientific racism and racialized Enlightenment anthropology, from
               the sense of literal brain measurement and weighing on a scale according to race to
               the idea of the <span style="font-style:italic">scala naturae</span>, the great chain of being, a descending line with white European man at the top and
               all others below. This is the case, for example, in William Petty’s 1677 work <span style="font-style:italic">The Scale of Creatures</span>, which claims that “Europeans do not only differ from the aforementioned Africans
               in colour . . . but also . . . in the Internal qualities of their Minds” (cited in
               Linebaugh and Rediker 139). The word “scale” in relation to race also comes up in
               colonial planter and administrator Edward Long’s <span style="font-style:italic">History of Jamaica</span> (1774), which argues for white supremacy on the basis of “the system of created beings
               [being] perfect and consistent . . . this perfection arises from an <span style="font-style:italic">exact scale of gradation</span>, from the lowest to the highest” (484; emphasis added). Or closer to Shelley’s time,
               take the physician Charles White’s 1799 racist work called <span style="font-style:italic">An Account of the Regular Gradation in Man</span>, the title of which is important because it implies that the unity of the category
               of “Man” is constituted by an internal differentiation, or gradation, that is, fundamentally
               hierarchical and racialized. The very idea of Man implies this internally gradated
               scale where different groups of humans can co-belong to this supposedly universal
               category, which is structured by the hierarchy and exclusions built into its machinery.
               We might then think of race constructed in this way as the imposition of this scale,
               this temporal schema of human development or “gradation,” onto human difference with
               whiteness as the proper fulfillment or sovereign end of Man. The opening of Verney’s
               narrative evinces a “political unconscious of racialized British-Eurocentrism” that
               suffuses the rest of <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>—this paradigm not only determines the parameters and political ecology of Man in
               the novel but stages the scene of its own ruination (An 581-82).</p>
            <p>That Shelley’s novel of universal apocalypse <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> harbors a critique of the idea of Man, of the Enlightenment, and of colonialism and
               empire, is not a new observation. An early and still powerful, if gestural, version
               of this argument was made by Barbara Johnson in her influential 1980 essay “The Last
               Man,” which reads the novel as an indictment of “a certain Western culture which can
               no longer take itself for the voice of humanity in its entirety” (10).<a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                     (1)
                     </sup></a> For Johnson, the novel both mourns this Enlightenment universalism of Man while also
               limnings its destructiveness, what she calls its “lethal universality,” figured (or
               disfigured), of course, by the plague that consumes the world (11). In what follows,
               I wish to deepen the critical line of inquiry initiated by Johnson and others to how
               the novel invites us to imagine other ways of being by modeling the abdication of
               the racialized position of Man. In step with this abdication, <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> makes it possible to inhabit the negative space of other, relational forms of life,
               though these other forms are only obliquely glimpsed and elicited in the diegetic
               space and time—which is also the prophetic space and time—of the narrative.<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                     (2)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>How does the novel delineate a form of life that is “postuniversal,” in Johnson’s
               words, but also not isolated in the particularity of an all too familiar individualism
               that detaches itself from any relation, political, ecological, or otherwise (10)?
               And where does Johnson’s interrogation of Enlightenment’s violent universalism via
               Shelley’s novel leave us today? By which I mean: where does this leave the “us,” the
               “we,” the possibility of community after Man, after the end of History that <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> portrays? This question takes on a deeper urgency and ominous resonance in the Anthropocene,
               the age of environmental crisis where “Man” (<span style="font-style:italic">anthropos</span>), or the idea of Man, has altered the very climate and earth system with his various
               projects and activity. <a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                     (3)
                     </sup></a> As the contemporary discourse around the Anthropocene shows, the political question
               of the contested constitution of Man is always an ecological one, with differing conceptions
               of relation to the earth at stake. In fact, <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> also deals with a number of environmental issues like climate change, sea-level rise,
               seasonal disruption, and human-animal relations, but these specific ecological problems
               provide more of a backdrop to this essay, which is concerned with the political ecology
               of “Man” as a concept, as well as its alternatives: both what Man violently excludes
               and what would be otherwise than Man, undoing it. If both politics and ecology in
               their different ways deal with the question of relationality, it is normally assumed
               that politics is concerned with human relationality, and ecology with relational fields
               in the nonhuman world. It is the imperative of political ecology to question and undo
               this partition between the human and nonhuman in order to summon new forms of relationality
               and collectivity; but the abolition of this partition should also involve examining
               the production of nonhumanity or improper humanity <span style="font-style:italic">within</span> manufactured conceptions of the human—that which is necessarily excluded or degraded
               so that Man can be Man.</p>
            <p>The issue of relationality foregrounded by political ecology is obviously a stumbling
               block for <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, for to whom or what can the only man relate? Indeed, the question of relationality,
               community, and the solitary individual cuts across Johnson’s essay on the novel, which,
               evoking Nietzsche’s notion of the Last Man, asks on its first page: “The human here
               is apparently something that says ‘we.’ And what if men were reduced only to ‘I’?
               Would the word ‘man’ still have the same meaning if there were only one left? Would
               the end of man take place before or after the death of the last man?” (3). The connection
               between the “we” and the end(s) of Man comes more fully into view when we recall that
               Johnson’s essay on Shelley was originally given as a talk at a conference organized
               in 1980 by Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe on the work of Derrida called
               “The Ends of Man,” after Derrida’s 1968 essay of that name. This latter essay ends
               with a haunting three-word query putting the community of Man in question: <span style="font-style:italic">“But who, we?"</span> (136; emphasis added). Derrida’s question(ing) of the “we” is further taken up by
               theorist Sylvia Wynter in her exposure and disruption of the racialized coloniality
               inherent in the idea of “Man.” <a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                     (4)
                     </sup></a> To simplify, for Wynter, the historically specific notion or genre of humanity of
               Western Man “over-represented” itself, conflating its ideas of Man (which in the nineteenth
               century takes the form of <span style="font-style:italic">homo oeconomicus</span>) with the proper human as such, creating a false and hierarchical “we.” What Wynter
               names “[Man’s] over-representation as if it were that of the human” necessarily involved
               both the “invention” and “subjugation” of racialized “Human Others” in order to “fuel”
               and to justify Europe’s sovereign “global conquests and expansion” (“Map for the Territory”
               128-29).<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                     (5)
                     </sup></a> The reflexive questioning of the “we,” often by putting it in scare quotes, has become
               a kind of theoreme or theory meme, an almost obligatory move in many strands of critical
               theoretical discourse.<a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                     (6)
                     </sup></a> This is for good reason, but in addition to bracketing the “we” to draw attention
               to its contingent formations and naturalized exclusions, it is is also important to
               pay attention to what has been bracketed out by given notions of the “we” and of Man
               in order to disclose other forms of life, relation, and collectivity that move outside
               and against the paradigm of Man. The last section of this essay attempts to read for
               and think through images of these alternative forms, these omens of an “otherwise
               we-ness,” in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>.<a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                     (7)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>To arrive there, the next section builds on the paradigm of <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man </span> opened up by Barbara Johnson and others and examines how the novel’s critique of
               Man centers upon a hierarchically differentiated concept of Man as a sovereign who
               is constantly engaged in projects, labor, improvement, and tasks. Man’s sovereignty
               is indexed by these projects, as well as by progress into a future that is only seemingly
               open to possibility but in fact necessitates a reproduction of the world as it is,
               preventing other forms of existence from blossoming. This means the novel’s conception
               of Man faces an apparent paradox: on the one hand, (white, European, especially English)
               Man is the finished, highest <span style="font-style:italic">telos</span> of being, the summit of both humanity and earthly creation (“the triumph of man”);
               on the other hand, and at the same time, Man is constitutively open (indeed the being
               <span style="font-style:italic">most</span> open) to possibilities that he actualizes through tasks and projects, which only
               reproduce Man and the world as structures.<a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                     (8)
                     </sup></a> For example, later in the novel, when Verney addresses England as “the triumph of
               man,” he attributes this chauvinistic civilizational triumph to “thy children, their
               unwearied industry and lofty aspiration,” that is, their ambitious projects and tasks
               (LM 324).</p>
            <p>However, this paradigm of (European) Man’s sovereignty established through a dialectic
               of project and progress collides with and is undone by the forces of abdication, inoperativity,
               interruption, and aimlessness that permeate <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>. This theme of abdication begins with the narrator’s relinquishment of authorship
               and authority to the Sibylline prophecy, which she transcribes and translates, and
               continues through the constant abdications of sovereignty, authority, and direction
               in the narrative, up to the plague that interrupts all futurity. Along the way, the
               novel creates apertures and overtures for imagining other, relational forms of life
               that do not hew to the colonial and ontological protocols of Man or what Lisa Lowe
               calls the “colonial divisions of humanity” (7). One example of this life other than
               Man, a life without sovereignty, is evoked by the last man himself, Lionel Verney,
               who on the last page of the novel begs for a task that would afford him a teleological
               orientation: “I long . . . to have some <span style="font-style:italic">task</span>, however slight or voluntary, for each day’s fulfillment” (LM 470; emphasis added).
               Condemned to wander the ravaged and empty earth without task, both the last man and
               <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> disclose an image of what might be other than Man, an image that in its very isolation
               invites us to imagine a relational existence without ground or <span style="font-style:italic">telos</span>, after the end of History and in its ruins. In this way, the last man’s tasklessness
               embodies Georges Bataille’s famous concept of life after the end of History as a “negativité
               sans emploi,” which we might here translate as "negativity without task" (369). <a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                     (9)
                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>After the next section "Task Master" develops <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>’s notion of Man as a sovereign engaging in tasks, projects, and labors of improvement,
               the third section "Sympathology" examines a vexed scene with the novel’s only explicitly
               Black character to lay bare the racialized exclusions inherent in Man and to show
               how Verney refuses the opportunity to abdicate this sovereign position. Reading the
               scene of the plague’s transmission to Verney by a “negro half clad” by drawing on
               critiques of the human and the notion of flesh from work in Black Studies, I reframe
               this scene as the very heart of the novel’s incisive interrogation of Man. The final
               section "Eternal Fruition" then dwells with what the novel variously calls “other
               shapes,” “other spirits,” and “other forms of being” that refuse the over-represented
               order of Man and open the door to something else. As one of Romanticism’s most important
               experiments in political ecology, <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> both plumbs the disastrous politics and ecology encoded in Man and finds other forms
               of common life sealed in the immanence of a kiss.</p>

            <p>That “Man” is a construct was understood and explored more thoroughly, and literally,
               by Mary Shelley than perhaps any other Romantic author (this is of course one of the
               many lessons of <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>). In <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, one way that the construction of Man is recapitulated is through the autobiographical
               microcosm of the last man Lionel Verney himself, who was orphaned along with his sister
               Perdita and grew up in a state he himself describes as “savagery” (LM 29). He gradually
               leaves this “savage” state and enters the subtly (and punningly) racialized “<span style="font-style:italic">paled</span> demesne of civilization” only when subjected to a sovereign, a “master hand” (27,
               29; emphasis added). When their long-lost family friend Adrian, a prince and the son
               of the abdicated and final King of England, comes to Cumberland, Verney almost immediately
               falls under Adrian’s noble spell. Throwing off his “war against civilization,” Verney
               follows Adrian down the path of progress into civilization, which is progress into
               the domain of Man: “I now began to be human,” Verney writes (29). He goes on to compare
               his newfound claims to participate in both civilization and Man to nothing other than
               the primal scene of colonialism itself, 1492: “I felt as the sailor, who from the
               topmast first discovered the shore of America; and like him I hastened to tell my
               companions of my discoveries in unknown regions” (31). This is yet another indication
               that “Man” in the novel is not a universal category but a contingent, colonial one,
               whose conceptualization is inextricable from the divisions of 1492 and what Wynter
               calls its “new world view.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">
                     (10)
                     </sup></a> To become Man is to enter into a relation of coloniality and to assume whiteness.
               Man’s supposed universality is constituted by its exclusions, exceptions, segregations,
               and gradations of (especially racial and gendered) differentiation. Verney’s own trajectory
               throughout the novel follows the path of Man itself, from “savagery” to sovereignty
               to lastness, to being without task—and as Emily Steinlight writes of Verney “As soon
               as he is last, he is no longer man” (71).</p>
            <p>Educating and improving Verney becomes one of Adrian’s civilizing tasks, but we soon
               learn that Adrian has schemes and tasks for progress on a much larger scale. Verney
               mentions Adrian’s “theories for the <span style="font-style:italic">improvement</span> of man,” for example, and various “schemes” and projects for progress and general
               improvement (36, 43; emphasis added). Later, in terms reminiscent of the theories
               of perfectibility espoused by Shelley’s father William Godwin, Adrian discusses plans
               for improvement with Raymond and the astronomer Merrival; Adrian attributes his vision
               of the coming utopian perfectibility of man precisely to Man’s propensity for labors,
               tasks, and projects: “Man cannot repose, and his restless aspirations will now bring
               forth good” (219). Throughout the novel, almost to the bitter end, Adrian is engaged
               in increasingly futile tasks and labors that crumble before the onslaught of the plague—tasks,
               as Adrian puts it, “for ever and ever to be sought,” eternally to be sought because
               receding from actual fruition, and only renewing the world as it is (327). Still later
               in the book, Adrian stakes a final claim to tasks, crying: “to our tasks . . . to
               the last I will struggle” (398).</p>
            <p>Lord Raymond, the figure based on Byron, also embodies a mania for tasks, especially
               projects for improvement and civilization. After he assumes sovereignty (becoming
               Lord Protector of England), we are told: “Raymond was occupied in a thousand beneficial
               schemes . . . He was continually surrounded by projectors and projects” (106). These
               projects are nothing other than an index of Raymond’s sovereign power, his desire
               for domination both ecological (“the elements”) and political (“man”): “He looked
               forward to entire dominion over the elements and the mind of man” (117). Indeed both
               Raymond and Adrian take up the civilizing task of fighting with the Greeks in a war
               against the “barbarism” of the Muslim forces of Turkey, people who are described explicitly
               in terms of stillness and refusing the advancing progress of civilization.<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                     (11)
                     </sup></a> Crucially, Raymond envisions his civilizing war in relation to a futurity that is
               endlessly renewed and reproduced in future generations, always advancing in a testament
               to the glory and sovereignty of Man: “Other generations will arise, and ever and for
               ever will continue . . . to be gloried by our valour” (194). It is this endless progress
               that “exalt[s] the race of man and make[s] this little globe a dwelling of the mighty”
               (194). The fact that this exaltation of Man as a supposed “we,” a “race,” requires
               war against and the eradication of other, non-European groups of human beings (not
               to mention the earth itself) reveals a concept of Man caught up in the “over-represented”
               (Wynter) violent universalism that <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> adumbrates and ultimately unworks.</p>
            <p>A passage from the end of Chapter 15 demonstrates more acutely the intimate connection
               between tasks, the idea of Man, and the reproduction of the world (that is, the world
               constituted by the exclusions inherent in the idea of Man, the world of Shelley’s
               day continued into ca. 2100). Verney observes a group of “enterpriz[ing]” young Etonian
               boys and attempting “to read the future man” through their youth, sees them as “the
               future governors of England; the men, who, when . . . our projects completed or destroyed
               for ever . . . were the beings who were to carry on the vast machine of society; here
               were the lovers, husbands, fathers; here the landlord, politician, solider” (227).<a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                     (12)
                     </sup></a> It is precisely the youth and open possibility of the young Etonians that will afford
               them the futurity and the new “projects” that will simply reproduce the world as it
               is and “carry on the vast machine of society” (we might think of Lee Edelman’s work
               on the child and futurity here). <a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">
                     (13)
                     </sup></a>. Importantly, this same passage links this logic to the reproduction of Man: “Thus
               man remains, while we the individuals pass away” (228). The reproduction of the world—the
               sovereign world of governors and landlords and soldiers and the institution of Eton—and
               the reproduction and preservation of the being Man are co-constitutive (it’s no accident
               that Verney also quotes Edmund Burke in this passage). As we have seen, Man remaining,
               and remaining as sovereign, is powered by progress and advancement. “Advance,” Verney
               apostrophizes the young men repeatedly, “Advance! . . . May your progress be uninterrupted
               and secure; born during the spring-tide of the hopes of man, may you lead up the summer
               to which no winter may succeed!” (228).<a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">
                     (14)
                     </sup></a> The conscious irony here of Verney addressing future generations in the past while
               writing from a position after the extinction of humanity is superseded by a doubled
               irony in the passage of which Shelley could only have been dimly aware: that is, the
               formulation of Man’s advancement, projects, and industry begetting a long winterless
               summer, an eerily prescient image of global warming’s coming endless summer in the
               Anthropocene, the age of Man.</p>
            <p>The novel’s interest in improvement and its connection to the imbricated logics of
               tasks, futurity, Man, and the reproduction of the world are illuminated by the recent
               critique of improvement by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten. Drawing on Wynter and others,
               Harney and Moten link the Enlightenment’s colonial and racialized idea of Man to the
               imposition of tasks of improvement that actually keep things in place: what they call
               “man’s perpetually stilled motion” in “eternally prospective completion-in-improvement”
               (84, 89). The idea of Man is constituted by the differentiation and subjection of
               certain racialized groups who are set aside as in need of being “endlessly improved . . . on
               their endless way to becoming Man,” a telos infinitely deferred (85). For Harney and
               Moten, this murderous anthropological paradigm of work, tasks, and improvement is
               also irreducibly a problematic of political ecology, as it leads toward the “destruction
               of the biosphere” and “socioecological disaster” (85, 88). The demand for improvement,
               which is essential to capitalism, is indeed first directed against the earth itself,
               as in discourses of land improvement and enclosure.<a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">
                     (15)
                     </sup></a> So it is in this light that we should read the various discourses in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> on tasks, projects, and schemes for improvement—tasks that index the sovereignty
               of (European) Man, who lords over the spheres of the political and the ecological
               and in doing so obscures their inextricability.<a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">
                     (16)
                     </sup></a> The next section will further explore the dimensions of Man’s racialization through
               Verney’s encounter with a figure who is constitutively denied entry onto “the bright
               noon-enlightened highway of mankind” (LM 157).</p>

            </header>
            <p>Early in the third and final volume of <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, Verney and his family are preparing to depart England with Adrian and the few remaining
               English survivors of the plague. After a visit to London, Verney returns to his home
               in Windsor to come upon the body of his young son Alfred, who has just died of the
               disease. Before he reaches Alfred, however, he has a strange physical encounter with
               an unnamed, plague-infected “negro half clad” (the novel’s only explicitly Black character),
               from whom Verney appears to contract the plague by breathing in the sick man’s breath.
               Given that Verney is the lone character to actually recover from the plague, the scene
               of his contracting disease — and thus his possible inoculation — would appear to be
               a crucial one, yet this extraordinary passage has proven difficult to interpet. It
               is a grim scene, even for so bleak a novel as this, and one that has vexed commentators,
               who often gloss over it rapidly.<a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">
                     (17)
                     </sup></a> But by engaging work in Black Studies that interrogates the racialized determinations
               of Man, this narrative episode can be read both as developing the novel’s critique
               of Man as a racialized and exclusionary mechanism (whose most paradigmatic exclusion
               is blackness) and also as opening the possibility of a form of relationality that
               is other than Man—a possibility ultimately rejected by Verney. <span class="quote">‘Here is the event, in Verney’s first-person—or rather, last-person—narration: I threw
                  open the door of the first room that presented itself. It was quite dark; but, as
                  I stept within, a pernicious scent assailed my senses, producing sickening qualms,
                  which made their way into my very heart, while I felt my leg clasped, and a groan
                  repeated by the person that held me. I lowered my lamp, and saw a negro half clad,
                  writing under the agony of disease, while he held me with a convulsive grasp. With
                  mixed horror and impatience I strove to disengage myself, and fell on the sufferer;
                  he wound his naked festering arms round me, his face close to mine, and his breath,
                  death-laden, entered my vitals. For a moment I was overcome, my head was bowed by
                  aching nausea; til, reflection returning, I sprung up, threw the wretch from me, and
                  darting up the staircase, entered the chamber usually inhabited by my family. A dim
                  light shewed me Alfred on a couch; Clara trembling, and paler than whitest snow, had
                  raised him on her arm (336-37). ’</span> The macabre scene unfolds in a kind of dark netherworld. Verney’s actions seem instinctive,
               but the resulting picture is that the “negro half clad,” literally <span style="font-style:italic">bare</span> life, is denied entry into the Kingdom of Man. His half-clothed state and the language
               used to describe him (“wretch”—a favorite epithet of Frankenstein for his creature)
               indicate Verney’s judgment of his nonhumanity before he physically throws the man
               off. We don’t know the Black man’s name, his language, his situation, his relation
               to any person or place in the world, nor where he comes from or how—he is simply dropped
               off there by the narrative, as if transported from another world. He is in the house
               but out of place: an instance of pure deracination. It’s not clear in the novel whether
               the global slave system has been abolished in the late twenty-first century (it appears
               not), but in the year of the book’s publication, 1826, this Black character would
               certainly have been associated with British enslavement (slavery was not completely
               abolished in the British Empire until the 1840s). Further, as Siobhan Carroll has
               noted, Verney’s depiction of his house, with its “dark[ness],” “pernicious scents,”
               disease, sounds of groans, and general horror, closely resembles contemporary descriptions
               of slave ships (12).<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>Peter Melville is right to remind us that the context of this scene is that of home
               and family—Verney has rushed into his home, looking for his wife and child.<a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">
                     (19)
                     </sup></a> It appears that at least part of Verney’s violent rejection of the dying man stems
               from his judgment of the incongruity of blackness and domestic sociality, from which
               blackness is not only barred but seen as an interference. As Saidiya Hartman writes,
               “In short, the slave exists out of the world and outside the house” (169). Indeed,
               what if this passage evinces not so much a “lapse . . . of sympathy” on Verney’s part,
               as Melville argues, but rather demonstrates the normal operation of sympathy as it
               is structured to (not) work upon those not viewed as human, those not part of what
               the novel calls “the family of man,” or any family at all (Melville 835; LM 261)?<a class="note_back" href="#Note20" id="Note20_return"><sup class="super">

               “we” of Man that the novel ruins, a “we” from which blackness is constitutively excluded
               but also to which blackness here presents some alternative, otherworldly, fleshly
               embrace.<a class="note_back" href="#Note21" id="Note21_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>Let us look at this scene in closer detail. What is the nature of this particular
               encounter, so different from other encounters in the novel where Verney reacts to
               the diseased and dead without fear and even sometimes with care? Verney perceives
               it to be a violent struggle, describing himself as being “clasped” and “grasp[ed],”
               and responds accordingly, recoiling in disgust and forcefully “thr[owing] the wretch
               from me.” In the chapter just before this scene, the plague had been directly associated
               with the notion of “flesh,”<a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">
                     (22)
                     </sup></a> and likewise here Verney sees the Black man not as a coherent body or person but
               as a mass of decaying flesh, with the pun on “wound” intensifying the sense of festering
               decay: “He wound his naked festering arms round me.” Yet one might also see this collision
               of flesh from the dying man’s perspective, from the (non)place of exclusion, as the
               demonstration of and invitation to an altogether different entanglement outside of
               Man and Man’s sovereignty, a sharing of woundedness indexed both by the plague and
               by blackness (and their mutual identification).<a class="note_back" href="#Note23" id="Note23_return"><sup class="super">
                     (23)
                     </sup></a> This embrace is an insistence on inextricable relationality even as Verney seeks
               to “disengage [him]self” from their precarious enmeshment. Following Alexander Weheliye’s
               recent theorization of flesh inspired by Wynter, Hortense Spillers, and others, we
               can think of the flesh here as a wound or “vestibular gash in the armor of Man, simultaneously
               a tool of dehumanization and a relational vestibule to alternate ways of being” (44).<a class="note_back" href="#Note24" id="Note24_return"><sup class="super">
                     (24)
                     </sup></a> The possibility of differentiating these two antithetical and simultaneous meanings
               of the flesh — as brutally violent reduction versus an antechamber to a new common
               life — depends in part upon whether vulnerability, the wound or “gash” in Man, is
               distributed to certain “others” as a sacrificial burden to bear or whether it is shared
               and generalized (indeed the very word “plague” derives from Latin <span style="font-style:italic">plaga</span>, which can mean both a “strike” and the “wound” or “gash” such a strike causes).
               The former is the case in this scene, as Verney chooses disengagement over entanglement.</p>
            <p>Verney falls down upon on the “sufferer,” and they become one in an almost-kiss and
               exchange of corrupted breath: “He wound his naked festering arms round me, his face
               close to mine, and his breath, death-laden, entered my vitals. For a moment I was
               overcome, my head was bowed by aching nausea.” For a fugitive moment of contact and
               contagion, Verney is dispossessed of his individuated body and consciousness and is
               “overcome,” losing the ground underneath him and feeling “aching nausea.” These symptoms
               of vertigo indicate an experience with what Jared Sexton calls “that wounded, disseminative
               vertigo that is blackness” (“On Black Negativity”). Verney loses all bearings in meeting
               with one who is abandoned, barred from bearings, and barred from Man. Yet after this
               brief moment, “reflection” returns to Verney, and he separates himself by “disengage[ing],”
               rejecting and abandoning the dying man. He regains orientation, and rushes off to
               find his dead child Alfred, held by his niece Clara, whose whiteness is notably emphasized:
               “paler than whitest snow.” </p>
            <p>Instead of perceiving the encounter as a violent struggle, as Verney does, being attentive
               to the action of the dying man as an embrace and a kiss on the mouth (the intense
               homoeroticism of this scene is too often unremarked) <a class="note_back" href="#Note25" id="Note25_return"><sup class="super">

               pointing towards and that <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> opens onto. Read this way, Verney’s failure is not in his refusal to see the Black
               man as included in Man but his refusal to “unMan” himself (to repurpose a verb Verney
               himself earlier uses) <a class="note_back" href="#Note26" id="Note26_return"><sup class="super">
                     (26)
                     </sup></a> his refusal to abdicate the sovereignty of Man and affirm some shared fleshly entanglement
               with a (non)person marked by slavery. Another passage from Sexton prompts a final
               reflection on this critical scene from the novel: <span class="quote">‘In a world structured by the twin axioms of white superiority and black inferiority,
                  of white existence and black nonexistence, a world structured by a negative categorical
                  imperative—“above all, don’t be black” (Gordon 1997: 63)—in this world, the zero degree
                  of transformation is the turn toward blackness, a turn toward the shame, as it were,
                  that “resides in the idea that ‘I am thought of as less than human’” (Nyong’o 2002:
                  389). In this we might create a transvaluation of pathology itself, something like
                  an embrace of pathology without pathos. (“Social Life” 23)’</span> Given that pathology is in the first instance concerned with the understanding of
               disease, Sexton’s comment is remarkably apt for a novel about universal plague and
               for the scene I have been discussing in particular. What would it mean for Verney
               to have been able to affirm an “embrace of pathology” in the novel, to perform an
               act not of sympathy but what we might call sympathology? Perhaps it would look like
               not simply aiding the dying man but staying on the floor, staying entangled, sharing
               the damage of the plague as mutually vulnerable beings and inhabiting and generalizing
               this vulnerability in a common passivity; it might look something like death, or William
               Blake called “self-annihilation.” This negative image in the novel (which is, recall,
               a prophecy), what <span style="font-style:italic">doesn’t</span> happen, adumbrates the opening for the affirmation of the “less than human” (Sexton
               quoting Nyong’o) and thereby other than Man: the life that is cast off on the ground,
               without work and task, and “unsovereign.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note27" id="Note27_return"><sup class="super">

               constantly speculates, as we’ll see in the next section.</p>

               plague in this scene,<a class="note_back" href="#Note28" id="Note28_return"><sup class="super">
                     (28)
                     </sup></a> but as an inoculation rather than a fatal case. Verney refuses to embrace pathology,
               refuses to join what is (forced to be) outside of Man, and rather than helping or
               joining the Black man, throws him off and, moreover, feeds on his dying life by using
               the literally abject man (“threw . . . from me”, cf. Latin <span style="font-style:italic">ab </span> + <span style="font-style:italic">iactus</span>) as a sacrifice for his own immunization; they do not share the wound or the vulnerability
               of flesh in common dehiscence. Not only is the unnamed Black character not fully included
               in the proper category of Man but his not being Man is precisely what allows Verney
               to be Man. Verney (again, almost literally) parasitically feeds off his disease, subjection,
               and abjection; he becomes inoculated and able to reproduce himself even as the world
               around him disintegrates. In this way, the scene is a microcosm of the more general
               constitutive exclusions of Man that the novel probes and stages. Alongside the already
               radical interrogation of Western humanism, colonialism, and imperialism in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, a trajectory brought out by Barbara Johnson and others, reading the novel in dialogue
               with work in Black Studies further radicalizes our understanding of the limits and
               the outsides of Man. In addition, such a reading offers another understanding of this
               crucial hinge of the whole novel—namely, reframing the question as to why Shelley
               had the last man, the one character to survive the plague, contract it from the only
               character explicitly racialized as Black. This analytic bears on Romanticism’s political
               ecology more generally in fundamental ways; it prompts a rethinking of the category
               of ecological and nonhuman relationality according to “racial blackness” as the “paradigmatic
               figure of the nonhuman”—a paradigm consolidating precisely in the Romantic era—which
               as such aligns with all “earth’s vulnerable inhabitants,” and the earth itself (Karera
               46, 52).<a class="note_back" href="#Note29" id="Note29_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>While the first two parts of this essay delineated the novel’s idea of Man, the last
               section argued Verney’s refusal to unMan himself took the form of his refusal to embrace
               the pathology of the plague and the dying Black man. Embracing and inhabiting the
               plague would mean acceding to the forces of interruption that the plague both figures
               and ushers in.<a class="note_back" href="#Note30" id="Note30_return"><sup class="super">

               of Man (Johnson) and what interrupts this structure of universality (in this way it
               recalls Derrida’s discussion of the <span style="font-style:italic">pharmakon</span>, or indeed, Weheliye’s conceptual framing of the flesh). The plague, whose movement
               is often described in eerily Enlightenment-like terms of advancement and progress,<a class="note_back" href="#Note31" id="Note31_return"><sup class="super">

               tasks, progress, and futurity and, on another level, exposes their violently differentiating
               mechanisms and effects. Yet the plague is only the most prominent harbinger of the
               forces of negativity — interruption, inoperativity, abdication, aimlessness, ruination,
               and especially abdication — that pervade <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>. In fact, it is possible to delineate a dialectic of abdication among all of the
               taskmasters and project mongers of the novel, in addition to one on the second-order
               level of the novel itself. First of all, the main characters’ relation is set in motion,
               before they meet, by the last King of England abdicating the throne in the year 2073;
               the young would-be king Adrian then renounces any claims to the throne, amounting
               to an abdication; Raymond, whose very name suggests kingship over the world (cf. <span style="font-style:italic">roi</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">re</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">rey</span> + <span style="font-style:italic">monde</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">mundo</span>, etc.), renounces sovereignty over England on the cusp of achieving it, then later
               actually does assume the sovereignty of the Protectorship (called a “task” (150) only
               then to abdicate the throne and give up on “his various projects” (149); yet another
               sovereign, Ryland, assumes then abdicates the Protectorship. Indeed, the end of Man
               is consistently described as the end of sovereignty.<a class="note_back" href="#Note32" id="Note32_return"><sup class="super">
                     (32)
                     </sup></a> Even near the end of the novel, with the plague finally gone and almost everyone
               on earth dead, Verney describes the plague itself in terms of abdication: “She [the
               plague] abdicated her throne” (426). In <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, sovereignty cannot hold itself in place, and its continual ruination gestures toward
               the unsovereign life and community that the novel invites its readers to consider.<a class="note_back" href="#Note33" id="Note33_return"><sup class="super">

                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>Alongside the acts of abdicating sovereignty, there are also several images toward
               the end of the novel, both figurative and literal, of relinquishing the rudder, reins,
               or pilotage, of giving up direction and directionality, of refusing to have a goal,
               telos, or task. “We took our hands therefore away from the long grasped rudder,” Verney
               sighs after leaving England (413).<a class="note_back" href="#Note34" id="Note34_return"><sup class="super">
                     (34)
                     </sup></a> At an earlier moment of despair, he enjoins “man” to abdicate his sovereignty as
               the “lord of creation,” and to embrace dispossession: “Lie down, O man . . . give
               up all claim to your inheritance” (316).<a class="note_back" href="#Note35" id="Note35_return"><sup class="super">
                     (35)
                     </sup></a> Then there is, of course, the last man, Verney, whom I designated at the beginning
               of this essay as a paradigmatic figure of tasklessness. Even while relinquishing the
               hope for improvement (“I form no expectation of alteration for the better”), in the
               novel’s final paragraph Verney longs in vain “to have some task” (470). Although his
               tasks have been abdicated for him, Verney remains trapped in the paradigm of Man,
               and trapped in isolation; his solitary wandering recalls Victor Frankenstein’s isolation
               at the end of that novel, not least as Frankenstein on his deathbed cries: “ My task
               is unfulfilled" (<span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span> 177).</p>
            <p>The novel therefore prompts us to think through the logic of abdication; the abdication
               of sovereignty, of tasks, direction, and progress, and by extension the abdication
               of Man himself — or the idea of Man itself. But what comes after Man, after History,
               after sovereignty? For whom, after all, is the last man writing? This impossible audience
               is of course the central structural problem of the book, one that occurs intermittently
               to Verney himself. He speculates on possible future readers on an earth with no future,
               settling upon either surviving remnants of humanity or more evocatively a totally
               other form of life, an alternate way of being, something he calls at one point a “race
               spiritual” (399.) With the demise of humanity and Man around him, Verney becomes consumed
               with the possibility that there is a mode of being, a possible “we,” that is not Man.
               And despite its march toward annihilation, <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>’s prophetic mode is constantly demonstrating that things can be otherwise, even those
               formations that “seemed eternal” like Man, History, World, Nature—even climate, the
               seasons, and the sun, all of which are disrupted in some fashion in the book—can be
               seen, configured, experienced, shared, and inhabited differently (412). Verney mocks
               the astronomer Merrival for invoking beings after Man without being able to “describe
               the unknown and unimaginable lineaments of the creatures who would then occupy the
               vacated dwelling of mankind” (290); yet Verney himself variously gives thought to
               “other spirits, other minds, other perceptive beings, sightless to us” and to “other
               forms of being” who have altogether different forms of “communings” (341; 420). At
               another moment, he harbors the thought that “humanity is not extinct; but merely passed
               into other shapes, unsubjected to our perceptions” (413). These “other shapes” of
               life would be “unsubjected” to the perceptions and paradigm of Man, with “unsubjected”
               suggesting beings not subjected to any sovereign, and perhaps, coming after the subject
               itself.</p>
            <p>The novel does little to limn these “other shapes” of — or than — humanity, except
               to suggest the possibility that they could exist, and, in foregrounding the force
               of inoperativity and abdication, the possibility they would be unsovereign, without
               task, detached from the sovereign imperatives of progress and the colonial, racial
               apparatuses of division that marry such imperatives. To close, I will suggest a final
               image of a taskless, unsovereign, relational life other than Man that the novel bequeaths
               to readers. Mere pages from the end, the last man wanders through the deserted city
               of Rome and takes in its museums and monuments: <span class="quote">‘I gazed at each statue, and lost myself in a reverie before many a fair Madonna or
                  beauteous nymph. I haunted the Vatican, and stood surrounded by marble forms of divine
                  beauty. Each stone deity was possessed by sacred gladness, and the eternal fruition
                  of love. They looked on me with unsympathizing complacency, and often in wild accents
                  I reproached them for their supreme indifference—for they were human shapes, the human
                  form divine was manifest in each fairest limb and lineament. The perfect moulding
                  brought with it the idea of colour and motion; often, half in bitter mockery, half
                  in self-delusion, I clasped their icy proportions, and, coming between Cupid and his
                  Psyche’s lips, pressed the unconceiving marble. (465)’</span> In quite Blakean language, Verney experiences these statues as presences that have
               “the human form divine” and human “lineament[s] but are not Man. He partakes in some
               strange communion with the figures, losing himself in a Rousseauian “reverie” as he
               and the statues gaze upon one another. The statues themselves seem to be perpetually,
               purely in relation, dispossessed from themselves and “possessed by sacred gladness,
               and the eternal fruition of love.” What is “eternal fruition”? Given that “fruition”
               denotes the realization of some potentiality, trajectory, project, or task, “<span style="font-style:italic">eternal</span> fruition” indicates the absolute non-presence of any task. That which is always,
               eternally in fruition has no need of a projected task or process of coming <span style="font-style:italic">into</span> fruition; it simply is. The statues thus enflesh a common, taskless existence. Their
               “supreme indifference” is indifference to the world of differentiation itself, the
               world of tasks and progress, of improvement, deferral, and futurity: the world of
               Man.<a class="note_back" href="#Note36" id="Note36_return"><sup class="super">

               or project into futurity; there is no work or task to be fulfilled, no condition to
               be improved, nothing to be accomplished or realized, because existence is always already
               “eternal[ly]” in fruition, immanently what it is—let be. The name for this release,
               this immaculate nonconception, is love: “the eternal fruition of love.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note37" id="Note37_return"><sup class="super">

                     </sup></a></p>
            <p>We might see in this immanent non-realization an illustration of Anne-Lise François’s
               subtly ecological — more explicit in her recent work — ethics of non-productivity,
               “(non)fulfillment,” and “freedom from work” in her book <span style="font-style:italic">Open Secrets</span> (58, xvi). If there is an ethics and a form of relationality modeled, however forbiddingly,
               by the statues’ embrace, it is clearly not grounded in any notion of sympathy. Verney
               rebukes the statues for their “<span style="font-style:italic">unsympathizing</span>” air, desiring some form of recognition that their presence — a presence immanent
               in itself yet alien to the world — will not yield. The statues’ refusal of sympathy,
               and their simultaneous modeling of a kind of immanent commonality and love that is
               without sympathy and “without pathos” (Sexton), return us to the earlier scene that
               demonstrated the exclusions built into the paradigm of sympathy: Verney’s encounter
               with the “negro half clad,” to which this scene bears striking parallels. In both
               episodes, Verney “los[es him]self” in communion (here in “reverie,” earlier being
               “overcome” without “reflection”) only then to dissever himself from relation and react
               violently. Just as in the earlier scene he felt the Black man “clasp” his body and
               perceived it an assault, responding angrily, the same verb returns here as Verney
               himself “clasp[s]” the statues in fury, “reproach[ing] them” with “wild accents” and
               “bitter mockery.” And similarly here as before, there is a ghost of a kiss. Where
               earlier Verney exchanged breaths with the dying man, their mouths close in the offer
               of a kiss, here Verney attempts to infiltrate and join the endless kiss of Cupid and
               Psyche: “coming between Cupid and his Psyche’s lips, [I] pressed the unconceiving
               marble.” Each of the two kisses promises contact with a presence that is not Man,
               but these promises, ciphers of another life, dissolve before the last man in different
               ways. Verney pulls away from the first kiss from the dying man, siphoning his life
               for inoculation, while he is closed off from the statues’ futureless kiss, still retaining
               his desire to be Man (and rebuking the statues for being otherwise). The last man
               in this way wishes to remain the last Man; Verney is unwilling to accede to a life
               without task, to some other kind of relationality with other beings and with the earth.
               Yet this refusal lets a question linger: what if the wholly “other shapes” we desire
               are already immanent, right in front of us, in the form of a kiss that harbors the
               eternal fruition of a life both alien and common?</p>
            <p><span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> invites us to think a different image of humanity that is not beholden to the sovereign
               solitude of Man, and in this way, to quote Wynter again, to “collectively give humanness
               a different future,” opening new configurations of a common “we” (“Unparalleled Catastrophe”
               73). This image other than Man would harbor a different ecology, a different relation
               to the earth—one not grounded in sovereignty, mastery, or tasks of improvement. Like
               the statues’ eternal fruition, this form of life is immanent, already realized in
               the relationality that constitutes every fleshly entanglement (however powerfully
               and violently denied). The numerous environmental catastrophes in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> are an essential part of its explicitly prophetic vision, an intimation of how the
               hierarchically differentiated and racialized construct of Man would produce what Verney
               calls a “funereal earth” (LM 440), but what is now called the Anthropocene, a “new
               geological epoch . . . built from slavery and colonialism (Lewis and Maslin 320).
               It is the novel’s indictment of itself and its world that it can easier imagine the
               extinction of humanity than the end of the idea of Man. Yet <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>’s experiment in political ecology is not only a critique - it is also the adumbration
               of something else.</p>
            <p>One of the wagers of this essay has been its preliminary attempt to place Mary Shelley
               in dialogue with theoretical discourses, especially in Black Studies, on the “abolition
               of Man” and the “dethroning of Man and uttering new forms of life” (Weheliye 138;
               Walcott 192). Continuing to do so can help reframe Romanticism by sharpening our attention
               to the constitutive exclusions and erasures of Romanticism’s world (which is our world)
               and also by revitalizing the speculative habits inherent in Romanticism’s critique
               of Enlightenment and, more generally, its critique of the proper. Following this path
               would be one way of taking up Verney’s final inscription, an overture to a coming
               community written on a building to no one or to no Man: “Friend, come! I wait for
               thee!” (LM 456).<a class="note_back" href="#Note38" id="Note38_return"><sup class="super">

            <p>Disentangling the extinction of humanity from the abolition of Man involves imagining
               and inhabiting other forms of life, though not as a <span style="font-style:italic">task</span> to be actualized but a re-expression of something already immanent: some trace of
               the common, the flesh, the earth, that the world keeps us from seeing, in part by
               setting us to our tasks (but who, “us”?). <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> presents one image of humanity, Man, and narrates its downfall—but the book is cast
               as a prophecy, which is less a prediction than it is a warning.</p>

            <p>On the last day of February 2020, I received an email letting me know that this Romantic
               Circles Praxis volume on Political Ecology, with my essay on Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, was kicking back into gear for publication. This same day, Feb. 29th, 2020, was
               the day of the first reported death in the United States from the novel coronavirus,
               or COVID-19 (though it would later be discovered there had been at least two earlier
               undetected deaths). This essay was finished in the summer of 2019 essentially as is,
               and while I have decided not to make any substantial or timely changes to it in light
               of the current moment, the pandemic seems to demand some extra reflection from readers
               of <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>. It is certainly eerie to return to my own essay and to Shelley’s monumental novel
               of twenty-first-century plague now, in mid-May 2020, as COVID-19 ravages on into what
               looks to be a grim summer and year ahead. Though long overshadowed in popular consciousness
               by <span style="font-style:italic">Frankenstein</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> was quickly thrust into the news in the early days of the pandemic, mentioned prominently
               in <span style="font-style:italic">The New York Times</span>,<a class="note_back" href="#Note39" id="Note39_return"><sup class="super">
                     (39)
                     </sup></a> <span style="font-style:italic">The New Yorker</span>, and elsewhere. It seems poised to be <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> novel for the novel coronavirus, expected to teach us something in a time when “all
               the world has the plague” (LM 242). But like prophecy, literature does not give easy
               lessons and always exceeds any time or conditions that would await its proper arrival.
               Of course, and despite the “all” encoded in the <span style="font-style:italic">pan</span> of pandemic, all the world does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have the plague—infection and fatality numbers in the United States show huge racial
               disparities, with Latinx, Indigenous, and especially Black people disproportionately
               suffering. The racial parameters of who counts as Man continue to enforce a differential
               vulnerability, with some protected and others sacrificed as a kind of social inoculation.
               Perhaps, as Sexton suggests in a different context, this world itself is the pathogen
               for such a situation<a class="note_back" href="#Note40" id="Note40_return"><sup class="super">
                     (40)
                     </sup></a> —all the world does not <span style="font-style:italic">have</span> the plague, rather this world, “this waste world,” <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> the plague (LM 293).</p>
            <p>Somewhere in the flurry of intellectual commentary on COVID-19 that has rapidly emerged,
               it was pointed out that the virus’s name derives from the arch-symbol of sovereignty:
               <span style="font-style:italic">corona</span>, meaning crown. Corona is indeed the crown, but only the crown, of the preexisting
               politico-economic regimes of sovereignty and governance that ever more brutally set
               tasks for those workers it deems essential, which is to say dispensable. These tasks
               must be done, without any real overarching changes, so that this world can reproduce
               itself and its hierarchies—so that it can “<span style="font-style:italic">go on</span>,” in the words of the U.S. president, the supposed sovereign, who tweeted on March
               9th, 2020: <span class="quote">‘“So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000
                  and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment
                  there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” ’</span> I am fascinated by the ampersanded zeugma here, which encrypts a whole world logic:
               “Nothing is shut down, <span style="font-style:italic">life &amp; the economy go on</span>.” Maybe the real question is how to break the zeugma between “life” and “the economy,”
               the zeugma that governs everything. How to make everything refuse to “go on”; how
               to expel sovereignty and economy from enclosing and hierarchically differentiating,
               or gradating, fleshly life; how to desert, leave, destitute, quit, abdicate the whole
               complex, this world and age of Man. What community, or what “other forms of being”
               and “communings” would come after (LM 420)? Relation is still possible with physical
               distancing, when not touching can be care; and flickers of other communings are showing
               up in emerging mutual-aid networks, organized rent strikes, and calls for a debt jubilee
               and general strike. We might think of such a strike — “strike,” the original meaning
               of <span style="font-style:italic">plaga</span>, "plague", — as a refusal of tasks and an affirmation of a taskless common life.
               Another cipher of the shadowed future could be detected in the graffiti message showing
               up in different places of late, posing a simple question: “The Economy, or Life?”
               This graffiti might be answered by another graffiti message, one left by the last
               man to those to follow – “Friend, come! I wait for thee!” (LM 456).</p>

               see Kathryn Yusoff: “To be included in the ‘we’ of the Anthropocene is to be silenced
               by a claim to universalism that fails to notice its subjugations” (12). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">In his text on negativity without task, Bataille is responding to Alexandre Kojève’s
               idea of the End of History, a concept famously later picked up and reworked by Francis
               Fukuyama, who added a rather Shelleyan twist to the title of his 1992 work <span style="font-style:italic">The End of History and the Last Man</span> (Bataille himself discusses the theme of the “last man” in <span style="font-style:italic">Inner Experience</span>, though this is unremarked by Fukuyama). Despite these twentieth-century permutations,
               it is important to remember that the End of History is a quintessentially Romantic-era
               problematic, originating with Hegel. See also Jerome Christensen, <span style="font-style:italic">Romanticism at the End of History</span>. Bataille’s concept of <span style="font-style:italic">negativité sans emploi</span> also gave rise to a series of important theoretical reflections on the possibility
               of a community that would be inoperative (Nancy), without work (Agamben), and without
               project (Blanchot); Romanticism plays an essential role in this discourse on community,
               one I trace in my book <span style="font-style:italic">All Things Common </span> (in progress).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">In her essay “1492: A New World View,” Wynter investigates how the event of 1492 led
               to the creation of “the new symbolic construct of Race” as a tool to “legitimate .
               . . sovereignty” (11). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Raymond wishes “to eradicate from Europe a power which, while every other nation advanced
               in civilization, stood still, a monument of antique barbarism” (175). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">That Eton is an all-boys school (as it is today) is significant. While this essay
               will focus more on the question of race in the novel (which has been less often discussed),
               gender obviously figures into the paradigm of Man in important ways. Verney’s sister
               Perdita longs for a sovereign task at one point (“Would that I also had a career!”),
               only to be told later by Raymond that his civilizing task “is no woman’s work” (162-63;
               193-94). On “apocalypse and gender” in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, see Chapter 5 of Steven Goldsmith’s <span style="font-style:italic">Unbuilding Jerusalem</span></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Colin Carman’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Radical Ecology of the Shelleys: Eros and Environment</span>. Carman discusses the ecology of kissing in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, a key topos for this essay.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">At another point Verney explicitly associates the reproduction of Man with the word
               “task”: “Some from among the family of man must survive, and these should be among
               the survivors; that should be my <span style="font-style:italic">task</span>—to accomplish it my own life were a small sacrifice” (261; emphasis added).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">On connections between logics of improvement and enclosure and logics of property,
               race, and coloniality, see Gary Fields’s <span style="font-style:italic">Enclosure</span> and Brenna Bhandar’s <span style="font-style:italic">Colonial Lives of Property</span>. Since the logic of improvement is part and parcel of enclosure, it is thus closely
               tied to proletarianization and the emerging notion of a “work ethic”; and while the
               racializing force of improvement is more obvious in relation to the improvement project
               of colonialism, even within Britain, those commoners who needed to be improved into
               workers were often described in racializing terms.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">As Chris Washington writes in his insightful chapter on <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>: “Shelley, in the later sections of the novel, targets and takes down humans’ notion
               of their own sovereignty over the world and its inhabitants” (77).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">One notable exception is Peter Melville’s “The Problem of Immunity in <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> which analyzes the scene in detail and argues contrary to received opinion that Verney
               does not actually contract the plague from the dying Black man. Melville makes an
               interesting epidemiological case, but this reading also seems too against the grain
               given that Verney declares himself to have gotten the plague in the paragraph immediately
               following the scene.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note20"><span class="noteLabel">20. </span><span class="noteBody">When Verney later has become the last man, he pens a mournful paean to universal “human
               sympathy,” but even here divides humanity into colonial categories like “wild and

               is, that ‘we’ can only be structured by and given in its own negation and refusal”
               (22). Frank B. Wilderson III’s Afro-Pessimism takes this the furthest in the claim
               to “shi[t] on the inspiration of the personal pronoun <span style="font-style:italic">we</span>” (143).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
