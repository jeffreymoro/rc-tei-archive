            <p> After the frame, on the first page of the narrative proper of Mary Shelley’s 1826
                novel <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, the narrator and titular last man Lionel
                Verney opens his account with a strange reflection on the distribution of global
                space, in addition to a remark on Man as such: 
                
            <quote> I AM the native of a sea-surrounded nook, a cloud-enshadowed land, which, when the
                surface of the globe . . . presents itself
                to my mind, appears only as an inconsiderable speck in the immense whole; and yet,
                when balanced in the scale of mental power, far outweighed countries of larger
                extent and more numerous population. So true it is, that man’s mind alone was the
                creator of all that was good or great to man, and that Nature herself was only his
                first minister. England, seated far north in the turbid sea, now visits my dreams in
                the semblance of a vast and well-manned ship, which mastered the winds and rode
                proudly over the waves. (9) </quote>
                
                England’s place is at the center and height of civilization, indeed at the very
                height of “Man." Much later in the book, after the plague
                has decimated almost the whole country, Verney apostrophizes England with: “England,
                thou wert the triumph of man” (LM 323). And here at the opening, England’s place in
                the globe is explicitly determined not geographically but in terms of “the scale of mental
                power.” This scale of mental power, Verney then says, is the essence of what it
                means to be “Man”: “man’s mind alone was the creator of all that was good or great
                to man.” Indeed, it is precisely England’s
                outsized claim to “mental power” that allows it to assert its sovereignty and
                dominate both global commerce and nature alike, “master[ing] the winds” and sea,
                “subdu[ing]” the earth, with nonhuman nature as “only [man’s] first minister” (9);
                thus Man’s sovereignty is not only a political but an ecological matter. In the
                narrative’s opening, which has been called a “dream of sovereign extension,” we are told that Man
                is constituted by sovereignty and mastery
                and that this sovereignty (indexed by mental power) is not equally distributed
                across the divisions of humanity (Elmer 358). England is figured as a
                    ship, and specifically, a “well-<hi
                    rend="italic">man</hi>ned ship”—the triumph of Man. From the novel’s title to
                the opening paragraph, to its final word, “Man” in <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    Man</hi> is a differentiated dream of sovereignty. </p>
                
            <p> This operation of differentiation is inseparably bound up with race. The very idea
                of a “scale of mental power” that is distributed unevenly across the globe evokes
                various strands of scientific racism and racialized Enlightenment anthropology, from
                the sense of literal brain measurement and weighing on a scale according to race to the idea of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scala naturae</hi>, the great chain of being, a descending line with white
                European man at the top and all others below. This is the case, for example, in
                William Petty’s 1677 work <hi rend="italic">The Scale of Creatures</hi>, which
                claims that “Europeans do not only differ from the aforementioned Africans in
                    colour . . . but also . . . in the Internal qualities of their
                Minds” (cited in Linebaugh and Rediker 139). The word “scale” in relation to race
                also comes up in colonial planter and administrator Edward Long’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Jamaica</hi> (1774), which argues for white supremacy on the basis
                of “the system of created beings [being] perfect and consistent . . . this perfection arises from an <hi
                    rend="italic">exact scale of gradation</hi>, from the lowest to the highest”
                (484; emphasis added). Or closer to Shelley’s time, take the physician Charles White’s 1799 racist work
                called <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Regular Gradation in Man</hi>, the title
                of which is important because it implies that the unity of the category of “Man” is
                constituted by an internal differentiation, or gradation, that is, fundamentally
                hierarchical and racialized. The very idea of Man implies this internally gradated
                scale where different groups of humans can co-belong to this supposedly universal
                category, which is structured by the hierarchy and exclusions built into its machinery. We might then
                think of race constructed in this way as the imposition of this scale, this temporal
                schema of human development or “gradation,” onto human difference with whiteness as the proper fulfillment
                or sovereign end of Man. The opening of Verney’s narrative evinces a “political
                unconscious of racialized British-Eurocentrism” that suffuses the rest of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>—this paradigm not only determines the parameters
                and political ecology of Man in the novel
                but stages the scene of its own ruination (An 581-82).</p>
                
            <p> That Shelley’s novel of universal apocalypse <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>
                harbors a critique of the idea of Man, of the Enlightenment, and of colonialism and
                empire, is not a new observation. An early and still powerful, if gestural, version
                of this argument was made by Barbara Johnson in her influential 1980 essay “The Last
                Man,” which reads the novel as an indictment of “a certain Western culture which can
                no longer take itself for the voice of humanity in its entirety” (10).<note place="foot" resp="author>
                    ">Later important readings of the colonial contexts of <hi
                                rend="italic">The Last

                For Johnson, the novel both mourns this Enlightenment universalism of Man while also limnings its destructiveness, what
                she calls its “lethal universality,” figured (or disfigured), of course, by the
                plague that consumes the world (11). In what follows, I wish to deepen the critical
                line of inquiry initiated by Johnson and others to how the novel invites us to imagine other ways of being by
                modeling the abdication of the racialized position of Man. In step with this
                abdication, <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> makes it possible to inhabit the
                negative space of other, relational forms of life, though these other forms are only obliquely glimpsed and
                elicited in the diegetic space and time—which is also the prophetic space and
                time—of the narrative.<note place="foot" resp="author"> As readers of the novel know, the frame of <hi

                    that takes the form of a late twenty-first century narrative by the last man.</note></p>
                
            <p> How does the novel delineate a form of life that is “postuniversal,” in Johnson’s
                words, but also not isolated in the particularity of an all too familiar
                individualism that detaches itself from any relation, political, ecological, or
                otherwise (10)? And where does Johnson’s interrogation of Enlightenment’s violent
                universalism via Shelley’s novel leave us today? By which I mean: where does this
                leave the “us,” the “we,” the possibility of community after Man, after the end of
                History that <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> portrays? This question takes on a
                deeper urgency and ominous resonance in the Anthropocene, the age of environmental
                crisis where “Man” (<hi rend="italic">anthropos</hi>), or the idea of Man, has
                altered the very climate and earth system with his various projects and activity. <note place="foot" resp="author">I take up the discourse around the

                 As the contemporary discourse around the Anthropocene shows, the political question
                of the contested constitution of Man is always an ecological one, with differing
                conceptions of relation to the earth at stake. In fact, <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    Man</hi> also deals with a number of environmental issues like climate change,
                sea-level rise, seasonal disruption, and human-animal relations, but these specific
                ecological problems provide more of a backdrop to this essay, which is concerned
                with the political ecology of “Man” as a concept, as well as its alternatives: both
                what Man violently excludes and what would be otherwise than Man, undoing it. If
                both politics and ecology in their different ways deal with the question of
                relationality, it is normally assumed that politics is concerned with human
                relationality, and ecology with relational fields in the nonhuman world. It is the
                imperative of political ecology to question and undo this partition between the
                human and nonhuman in order to summon new forms of relationality and collectivity;
                but the abolition of this partition should also involve examining the production of
                nonhumanity or improper humanity <hi rend="italic">within</hi> manufactured
                conceptions of the human—that which is necessarily excluded or degraded so that Man
                can be Man. </p>
                
            <p> The issue of relationality foregrounded by political ecology is obviously a
                stumbling block for <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, for to whom or what can the
                only man relate? Indeed, the question of relationality, community, and the solitary
                individual cuts across Johnson’s essay on the novel, which, evoking Nietzsche’s
                notion of the Last Man, asks on its first page: “The human here is apparently
                something that says ‘we.’ And what if men were reduced only to ‘I’? Would the word
                ‘man’ still have the same meaning if there were only one left? Would the end of man
                take place before or after the death of the last man?” (3). The connection between
                the “we” and the end(s) of Man comes more fully into view when we recall that
                Johnson’s essay on Shelley was originally given as a talk at a conference organized
                in 1980 by Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe on the work of Derrida called
                “The Ends of Man,” after Derrida’s 1968 essay of that name. This latter essay ends
                with a haunting three-word query putting
                the community of Man in question: <hi rend="italic">“But who, we?"</hi> (136; emphasis added). Derrida’s
                question(ing) of the “we” is further taken up by theorist Sylvia
                Wynter in her exposure and disruption of the racialized coloniality inherent in the
                idea of “Man.”
                <note place="foot" resp="author"> “To me Derrida’s most radical essay was . . . ‘The Ends of Man.’ 
                    At the end he asks, ‘But who, “we”?’ The <hi rend="italic">refernt-we</hi> of man and of its ends, he implies, is not the <hi
                                rend="italic">referent-we</hi> of the human species itself. . . The above is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> single issue with which 
                    global warming and climate instability now confronts us and that we have to replace the ends of <hi rend="italic">the referent-we </hi> 
                    of liberal monohumanist Man with the ecumenically human ends of the <hi rend="italic">referent-we in the horizon of
                                humanity”</hi> (Wynter, “Unparalleled
                                Catastrophe” 23-24). </note>
                To simplify, for Wynter, the historically specific notion or genre of humanity of Western Man
                “over-represented” itself, conflating its ideas of Man (which in the nineteenth
                century takes the form of <hi rend="italic">homo oeconomicus</hi>) with the proper
                human as such, creating a false and hierarchical “we.” What Wynter names “[Man’s]
                over-representation as if it were that of the human” necessarily involved both the
                “invention” and “subjugation” of racialized “Human Others” in order to “fuel” and to
                justify Europe’s sovereign “global conquests and expansion” (“Map for the Territory”
                    128-29).<note place="foot" resp="author"> “The invention of the global category of 
                        Human Others on the basis of the institutionalized inferiorization and subjugation of those [racialized] human beings . . . was indispensible . . . to the
                        over-representation of this ethno-class or Western bourgeois genre or mode of being human, as if
                                it were that of the human itself” (Wynter, “Map” 128-29). </note>
                The reflexive questioning of the “we,” often by putting it in scare quotes, has
                become a kind of theoreme or theory meme, an almost obligatory move in many strands
                of critical theoretical discourse.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Examples of this move are countless. 
                    For a recent one relating to Anthropocene debates, see Kathryn Yusoff: “To be included in the ‘we’ of the
                                Anthropocene is to be silenced by a claim to universalism that fails
                                to notice its subjugations” (12). </note> 
                This is for good reason, but in addition to bracketing the “we” to draw attention to its
                contingent formations and naturalized exclusions, it is
                is also important to pay attention to what has been bracketed out by given notions of the “we” and of
                    Man in order to disclose other forms
                of life, relation, and collectivity that move outside and against the paradigm of
                Man. The last section of this essay attempts to read for and think through images of
                these alternative forms, these omens of an “otherwise we-ness,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Last Man</hi>.<note place="foot">I take “otherwise we-ness” from J. Kameron
                                Carter, who opposes to it the “appropriative and expropriative, a
                                thieving and exclusionary ‘We-ness’” of Man: “Man is a figure of
                                ontological and planetary terror, as Calvin Warren powerfully
                                argues. The terror of Man both produces and targets the nonhuman or
                                the less-than-human mass(es) figured as the Racial Other”
                                (n.p.).</note></p>
            
            <p> To arrive there, the next section builds on the paradigm of
                <hi rend="italic">The Last Man </hi> opened up by Barbara
                Johnson and others and examines how the novel’s critique of Man centers upon a
                hierarchically differentiated concept of Man as a sovereign who is constantly
                engaged in projects, labor, improvement,
                and tasks. Man’s sovereignty is indexed by these projects, as well as by progress
                into a future that is only seemingly open to possibility but in fact necessitates a
                reproduction of the world as it is, preventing other forms of existence from
                blossoming. This means the novel’s conception of Man faces an apparent paradox: on
                the one hand, (white, European, especially English) Man is the finished, highest <hi
                    rend="italic">telos</hi> of being, the summit of both humanity and earthly
                creation (“the triumph of man”); on the other hand, and at the same time, Man is
                constitutively open (indeed the being <hi rend="italic">most</hi> open) to possibilities
                that he actualizes through tasks and projects, which only reproduce Man and the
                world as structures.<note place="foot" resp="author">This conceptualization of possibility and
                                reproduction emerges from my collaborative work with Kirill Chepurin
                                on Hans Blumenberg, possibility, and modernity.</note>
                
                For example, later in the novel, when Verney addresses England as “the triumph of
                man,” he attributes this chauvinistic civilizational triumph to “thy children, their
                unwearied industry and lofty aspiration,” that is, their ambitious projects and
                tasks (LM 324). </p>
                
            <p> However, this paradigm of (European) Man’s sovereignty established through a
                dialectic of project and progress collides with and is undone by the forces of
                abdication, inoperativity, interruption, and aimlessness that permeate <hi
                    rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>. This theme of abdication begins with the
                narrator’s relinquishment of authorship and authority to the Sibylline prophecy, which she transcribes and translates, and
                continues through the constant abdications of sovereignty, authority, and direction
                in the narrative, up to the plague that
                interrupts all futurity. Along the way, the novel creates apertures and overtures
                for imagining other, relational forms of life that
                do not hew to the colonial and ontological protocols of Man or what Lisa Lowe calls the “colonial
                divisions of humanity” (7). One example of this life other than Man, a life without
                sovereignty, is evoked by the last man himself, Lionel Verney, who on the last page
                of the novel begs for a task that would afford him a teleological orientation: “I
                    long . . . to have some <hi
                    rend="italic">task</hi>, however slight or voluntary, for each day’s
                fulfillment” (LM 470; emphasis added).
                Condemned to wander the ravaged and empty earth without task, both the last man and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> disclose an image of what might be other
                than Man, an image that in its very isolation invites us to imagine a relational
                existence without ground or <hi rend="italic">telos</hi>, after the end of History
                and in its ruins. In this way, the last man’s tasklessness embodies Georges
                Bataille’s famous concept of life after the end of History as a “negativité sans
                emploi,” which we might here translate as "negativity without task" (369). <note place="foot" resp="author">
                    In his text on negativity without task, Bataille is responding to Alexandre Kojève’s idea of the End of History, 
                    a concept famously later picked up and reworked by Francis Fukuyama, who added a rather Shelleyan twist to the 
                    title of his 1992 work <hi rend="italic">The End of History and the Last
                                Man</hi> (Bataille himself discusses the theme of the “last man” in <hi

                                Experience</hi>, though this is unremarked by Fukuyama). 
                    Despite these twentieth-century permutations, it is important to remember that the 
                    End of History is a quintessentially Romantic-era problematic, originating with Hegel.

                                History</hi>. Bataille’s concept of

                    theoretical reflections on the possibility of a community that would be inoperative (Nancy), 
                    without work (Agamben), and without project (Blanchot); Romanticism plays an essential role 
                    in this discourse on community, one I trace in my book <hi rend="italic">All Things Common </hi>

            <p> After the next section "Task Master" develops <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>’s notion of Man as a
                sovereign engaging in tasks, projects, and labors of improvement, the third section "Sympathology"
                examines a vexed scene with the novel’s only explicitly Black character to lay bare
                the racialized exclusions inherent in Man and to show how Verney refuses the opportunity to abdicate this sovereign position.
                Reading the scene of the plague’s transmission to Verney by a “negro half clad” by
                drawing on critiques of the human and the notion of flesh from work in Black
                Studies, I reframe this scene as the very heart of the novel’s incisive
                interrogation of Man. The final section "Eternal Fruition" then dwells with what the novel variously
                calls “other shapes,” “other spirits,” and “other forms of being” that refuse the
                    over-represented order of Man and open
                the door to something else. As one of Romanticism’s most important experiments in
                political ecology, <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> both plumbs the disastrous
                politics and ecology encoded in Man and
                finds other forms of common life sealed in the immanence of a kiss. </p></div>

                <head>Task Master</head>
                
            <p> That “Man” is a construct was understood and explored more thoroughly, and
                literally, by Mary Shelley than perhaps any other Romantic author (this is of course
                one of the many lessons of <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi>). In <hi
                    rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, one way that the construction of Man is
                recapitulated is through the autobiographical microcosm of the last man Lionel
                Verney himself, who was orphaned along with his sister Perdita and grew up in a state he himself
                describes as “savagery” (LM 29). He gradually leaves this “savage” state and enters
                the subtly (and punningly) racialized “<hi rend="italic">paled</hi> demesne of
                civilization” only when subjected to a sovereign, a “master hand” (27, 29; emphasis added).
                When their long-lost family friend Adrian, a prince and the son of the abdicated and
                final King of England, comes to Cumberland, Verney almost immediately falls under
                Adrian’s noble spell. Throwing off his “war against civilization,”
                Verney follows Adrian down the path of progress into civilization, which is progress
                into the domain of Man: “I now began to be human,” Verney writes (29). He goes on to
                compare his newfound claims to participate in both civilization and Man to nothing
                other than the primal scene of colonialism itself, 1492: “I felt as the sailor, who
                from the topmast first discovered the shore of America; and like him I hastened to
                tell my companions of my discoveries in unknown regions” (31). This is yet another
                indication that “Man” in the novel is not a universal category but a contingent, colonial one, whose
                conceptualization is inextricable from the divisions of 1492 and what Wynter calls
                its “new world view.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In her essay “1492: A New World View,” 
                    Wynter investigates how the event of 1492 led to the creation of “the new symbolic 
                    construct of Race” as a tool to “legitimate . . . sovereignty” (11). </note>
                To become Man is to enter into a relation of coloniality and to assume whiteness. 
                Man’s supposed universality is constituted by its exclusions, exceptions, segregations, and
                gradations of (especially racial and gendered) differentiation. Verney’s own trajectory
                throughout the novel follows the path of Man itself, from “savagery” to sovereignty
                to lastness, to being without task—and as Emily Steinlight writes of Verney “As soon as he is last, he is no longer
                man” (71).</p>
                
            <p> Educating and improving Verney becomes one of Adrian’s civilizing tasks, but we soon
                learn that Adrian has schemes and tasks for progress on a much larger scale. Verney
                mentions Adrian’s “theories for the <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi>
                of man,” for example, and various “schemes”
                and projects for progress and general improvement (36, 43; emphasis added). Later, in terms
                reminiscent of the theories of perfectibility espoused by Shelley’s father William
                Godwin, Adrian discusses plans for improvement with Raymond and the astronomer
                Merrival; Adrian attributes his vision of the coming utopian perfectibility of man
                precisely to Man’s propensity for labors, tasks, and projects: “Man cannot repose,
                and his restless aspirations will now bring forth good” (219). Throughout the novel,
                almost to the bitter end, Adrian is engaged in increasingly futile tasks and labors
                that crumble before the onslaught of the plague—tasks, as Adrian puts it, “for ever
                and ever to be sought,” eternally to be sought because receding from actual
                fruition, and only renewing the world as it is (327). Still later in the book,
                Adrian stakes a final claim to tasks, crying: “to our tasks . . . to the last I will struggle” (398). </p>
                
            <p> Lord Raymond, the figure based on Byron, also embodies a mania for tasks, especially
                projects for improvement and civilization. After he assumes sovereignty (becoming Lord Protector of England), we are
                told: “Raymond was occupied in a thousand beneficial schemes . . . He was continually surrounded by projectors and
                projects” (106). These projects are nothing other than an index of Raymond’s
                sovereign power, his desire for domination both ecological (“the elements”) and
                political (“man”): “He looked forward to entire dominion over
                the elements and the mind of man” (117). Indeed both Raymond and Adrian take up the
                civilizing task of fighting with the Greeks in a war against the “barbarism” of the
                Muslim forces of Turkey, people who are described explicitly in terms of stillness
                and refusing the advancing progress of civilization.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Raymond wishes “to eradicate from Europe a power which, while every other nation advanced 
                    in civilization, stood still, a monument of antique barbarism” (175). </note>
                Crucially, Raymond envisions his civilizing war in relation to a futurity that is
                endlessly renewed and reproduced in future generations, always advancing in a
                testament to the glory and sovereignty of Man: “Other generations will arise,
                and ever and for ever will continue . . . to be gloried by our valour” (194). 
                It is this endless progress that “exalt[s] the race of man and make[s] this little globe a dwelling of the
                mighty” (194). The fact that this exaltation of Man as a supposed “we,” a “race,”
                requires war against and the eradication of other, non-European groups of human
                beings (not to mention the earth itself) reveals a concept of Man caught up in the
                “over-represented” (Wynter) violent universalism that <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    Man</hi> adumbrates and ultimately unworks.</p>
                
            <p> A passage from the end of Chapter 15 demonstrates more acutely the intimate
                connection between tasks, the idea of Man, and the reproduction of the world (that
                is, the world constituted by the exclusions inherent in the idea of Man, the world
                of Shelley’s day continued into ca. 2100). Verney observes a group of
                “enterpriz[ing]” young Etonian boys and
                attempting “to read the future man” through their youth, sees them as “the future
                governors of England; the men, who, when . . . our projects completed or destroyed for
                ever . . . were
                the beings who were to carry on the vast machine of society; here were the lovers,
                husbands, fathers; here the landlord, politician, solider” (227).<note place="foot" resp="author"> That Eton is an all-boys school (as it is today) is significant. 
                    While this essay will focus more on the question of race in the novel (which has been less often discussed), 
                    gender obviously figures into the paradigm of Man in important ways. 
                    Verney’s sister Perdita longs for a sovereign task at one point (“Would that I also had a career!”), 
                    only to be told later by Raymond that his civilizing task “is no woman’s work” (162-63; 193-94). On “apocalypse and gender” in <hi

                It is precisely the youth and open possibility of the young Etonians that will afford them the futurity
                and the new “projects” that will simply reproduce the world as it is and “carry on the vast machine of
                society” (we might think of Lee Edelman’s work on the child and futurity here). <note place="foot" resp="author">See Edelman’s <hi

                Importantly, this same passage links this logic to the reproduction of Man: “Thus man remains, while we the individuals
                pass away” (228). The reproduction of the world—the sovereign world of governors and
                landlords and soldiers and the institution of Eton—and the reproduction and
                preservation of the being Man are co-constitutive (it’s no accident that Verney also
                quotes Edmund Burke in this passage). As we have seen, Man remaining, and remaining
                as sovereign, is powered by progress and advancement. “Advance,” Verney
                apostrophizes the young men repeatedly, “Advance! . . . May your progress be uninterrupted and secure; born during the
                spring-tide of the hopes of man, may you lead up the summer to which no winter may
                succeed!” (228).<note place="foot" resp="author"> At another point Verney explicitly associates the reproduction of Man 
                    with the word “task”: “Some from among the family of man must survive, and these should be among the survivors; 
                    that should be my <hi rend="italic"> task</hi>—to accomplish it my own life were a small sacrifice” (261; emphasis added). </note>
                
                The conscious irony here of Verney addressing future generations in the past while writing from a
                position after the extinction of humanity 
                is superseded by a doubled irony in the passage of which Shelley could only have
                been dimly aware: that is, the formulation of Man’s advancement, projects, and
                industry begetting a long winterless
                summer, an eerily prescient image of global warming’s coming endless summer in the
                Anthropocene, the age of Man. </p>
                
            <p> The novel’s interest in improvement and its connection to the imbricated logics of
                tasks, futurity, Man, and the reproduction of the world are illuminated by the
                recent critique of improvement by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten.
                Drawing on Wynter and others, Harney and Moten link the Enlightenment’s colonial and
                racialized idea of Man to the imposition of tasks of improvement that actually keep
                things in place: what they call “man’s perpetually stilled motion” in “eternally
                prospective completion-in-improvement” (84, 89). The idea of Man is constituted by
                the differentiation and subjection of certain racialized groups who are set aside as
                in need of being “endlessly improved . . . on their endless way to becoming Man,” a telos infinitely deferred
                (85). For Harney and Moten, this murderous anthropological paradigm of work, tasks, and improvement is also
                irreducibly a problematic of political ecology, as it leads toward the “destruction
                of the biosphere” and “socioecological disaster” (85, 88). The demand for
                improvement, which is essential to capitalism, is indeed first directed against the
                earth itself, as in discourses of land improvement and enclosure.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    On connections between logics of improvement and enclosure and logics of property, race, and coloniality,

                            <hi rend="italic">Colonial Lives of
                            Property</hi>. Since the logic of improvement is part and parcel of enclosure, 
                    it is thus closely tied to proletarianization and the emerging notion of a “work ethic”; 
                    and while the racializing force of improvement is more obvious in relation to the improvement 
                    project of colonialism, even within Britain, those commoners who needed to be improved into 
                    workers were often described in racializing terms. </note>
                    
                So it is in this light that we should read the various discourses in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> on tasks, projects, and schemes for
                improvement—tasks that index the sovereignty of (European) Man, who lords over the
                spheres of the political and the ecological and in doing so obscures their inextricability.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    As Chris Washington writes in his insightful chapter on <hi

                The next section will further explore the dimensions of Man’s racialization through
                Verney’s encounter with a figure who is constitutively denied entry onto “the bright
                noon-enlightened highway of mankind” (LM 157).</p></div>

            <p> Early in the third and final volume of <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, Verney
                and his family are preparing to depart England with Adrian and the few remaining
                English survivors of the plague. After a visit to London, Verney returns to his home
                in Windsor to come upon the body of his young son Alfred, who has just died of the
                disease. Before he reaches Alfred, however, he has a strange physical encounter with
                an unnamed, plague-infected “negro half clad” (the novel’s only explicitly Black
                character), from whom Verney appears to contract the plague by breathing in the sick
                man’s breath. Given that Verney is the lone character to actually recover from the
                plague, the scene of his contracting disease — and thus his possible inoculation — would
                appear to be a crucial one, yet this extraordinary passage has proven difficult to
                interpet. It is a grim scene, even for so bleak a novel as this, and one that
                has vexed commentators, who often gloss over it rapidly.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    One notable exception is Peter Melville’s “The Problem of Immunity in <hi
                                rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> which analyzes the scene in detail and
                                argues contrary to received opinion that Verney does not actually
                                contract the plague from the dying Black man. Melville makes an
                                interesting epidemiological case, but this reading also seems too
                                against the grain given that Verney declares himself to have gotten 
                                the plague in the paragraph immediately following the scene.</note>
                
                But by engaging work in Black Studies that interrogates the racialized
                determinations of Man, this narrative episode can be read both as developing the novel’s critique of Man as a
                racialized and exclusionary mechanism (whose most paradigmatic exclusion is
                    blackness) and also as opening the
                possibility of a form of relationality that is other than Man—a possibility
                ultimately rejected by Verney. 
                
            <quote>Here is the event, in Verney’s first-person—or rather, last-person—narration: 
            I threw open the door of the first room that presented itself. It was quite dark;
                but, as I stept within, a pernicious scent assailed my senses, producing sickening
                qualms, which made their way into my very heart, while I felt my leg clasped, and a
                groan repeated by the person that held me. I lowered my lamp, and saw a negro half
                clad, writing under the agony of disease, while he held me with a convulsive grasp.
                With mixed horror and impatience I strove to disengage myself, and fell on the
                sufferer; he wound his naked festering arms round me, his face close to mine, and
                his breath, death-laden, entered my vitals. For a moment I was overcome, my head was
                bowed by aching nausea; til, reflection returning, I sprung up, threw the wretch
                from me, and darting up the staircase, entered the chamber usually inhabited by my
                family. A dim light shewed me Alfred on a couch; Clara trembling, and paler than
                whitest snow, had raised him on her arm (336-37). </quote>
                
            The macabre scene unfolds in a kind of dark netherworld. Verney’s actions seem
                instinctive, but the resulting picture is that the “negro half clad,” literally <hi
                    rend="italic">bare</hi> life, is denied entry into the Kingdom of Man. His
                half-clothed state and the language used to describe him (“wretch”—a favorite
                epithet of Frankenstein for his creature) indicate Verney’s judgment of his
                nonhumanity before he physically throws the man off. We don’t know the Black man’s
                name, his language, his situation, his relation to any person or place in the world,
                nor where he comes from or how—he is simply dropped off there by the narrative, as
                if transported from another world. He is in the house but out of place: an instance of pure
                deracination. It’s not clear in the novel whether the global slave system has been
                abolished in the late twenty-first century (it appears
                not), but in the year of the book’s publication, 1826, this Black character would
                certainly have been associated with British enslavement (slavery was not completely
                abolished in the British Empire until the 1840s). Further, as Siobhan Carroll has
                noted, Verney’s depiction of his house, with its “dark[ness],” “pernicious scents,” disease,

            <p> Peter Melville is right to remind us that the context of this scene is that of home
                and family—Verney has rushed into his home, looking for his wife and child.<note place="foot" resp="author>">

                It appears that at least part of Verney’s violent rejection of the dying man stems
                from his judgment of the incongruity of blackness and domestic sociality, from which
                blackness is not only barred but seen as
                an interference. As Saidiya Hartman writes, “In short, the
                slave exists out of the world and outside the house” (169). Indeed, what if this
                passage evinces not so much a “lapse . . . of sympathy” on Verney’s part, as Melville argues, but rather
                demonstrates the normal operation of sympathy as it is structured to (not) work upon
                those not viewed as human, those not part of what the novel calls “the family of
                man,” or any family at all (Melville 835; LM 261)?<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    When Verney later has become the last man, he pens a mournful paean to universal 
                    “human sympathy,” but even here divides humanity into colonial categories like 
                    “wild and cruel Caribbee” and “merciless Cannibal” (449). </note>
                
                This reading would allow us to see this episode as exposing the cracks in the false
                “we” of Man that the novel ruins, a “we” from which blackness is constitutively
                    excluded but also to which blackness
                here presents some alternative, otherworldly, fleshly embrace.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                    if it is, that ‘we’ can only be structured by and given in its own negation and refusal” (22). 
                    Frank B. Wilderson III’s Afro-Pessimism takes this the furthest in the claim to “shi[t] on the 
                    inspiration of the personal pronoun <hi rend="italic">we</hi>” (143). </note></p>
            
            <p> Let us look at this scene in closer detail. What is the nature of this particular encounter, so
                different from other encounters in the novel where Verney reacts to the diseased and
                dead without fear and even sometimes with
                care? Verney perceives it to be a violent struggle, describing himself as being
                “clasped” and “grasp[ed],” and responds accordingly, recoiling in disgust and
                forcefully “thr[owing] the wretch from me.” In the chapter just before this scene,
                the plague had been directly associated with the notion of “flesh,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    “She [plague] has invested [man’s] form, is incarnate in his <hi
                                rend="italic">flesh</hi>, has entwined herself with his being, and blinds his heaven-seeking eyes” (316; emphasis added). </note>
                and likewise here Verney sees the Black man not as a coherent body or person but as a mass of decaying flesh, with the
                pun on “wound” intensifying the sense of festering decay: “He wound his naked festering arms round me.” 
                Yet one might also see this collision of flesh from the dying man’s perspective, from the (non)place of
                exclusion, as the demonstration of and invitation to an altogether different
                entanglement outside of Man and Man’s sovereignty, a sharing of woundedness indexed
                both by the plague and by blackness (and their mutual identification).<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    Regarding decay, contagion, and pathology, Moten notes that “blackness has been associated with a certain sense of decay,” 
                    though this is also connected to an “impossible, pathological sociality” (177, 210). 
                    On “racial pathologies” and the convergence of “race-science” and “race-medicine” in the eighteenth-century

                This embrace is an insistence on inextricable relationality even as Verney seeks to
                “disengage [him]self” from their precarious enmeshment. Following Alexander
                Weheliye’s recent theorization of flesh inspired by Wynter, Hortense Spillers, and
                others, we can think of the flesh here as a wound or “vestibular gash in the armor
                of Man, simultaneously a tool of dehumanization and a relational vestibule to
                alternate ways of being” (44).<note place="foot" resp="author">I am indebted also to Alex Dubilet’s
                                discussion of flesh in his unpublished “Acosmic
                        Immanence.”</note> 
                The possibility of differentiating these two antithetical and simultaneous meanings of the flesh — as brutally violent
                reduction versus an antechamber to a new
                common life — depends in part upon whether vulnerability, the wound or “gash” in Man,
                is distributed to certain “others” as a sacrificial burden to bear or whether it is shared and generalized
                (indeed the very word “plague” derives from Latin <hi rend="italic">plaga</hi>,
                which can mean both a “strike” and the “wound” or “gash” such a strike causes). The
                former is the case in this scene, as Verney chooses disengagement over entanglement. </p>
                
            <p> Verney falls down upon on the “sufferer,” and they become one in an almost-kiss and
                exchange of corrupted breath: “He wound his naked festering arms round me,
                his face close to mine, and his breath, death-laden, entered my vitals. For a moment
                I was overcome, my head was bowed by aching nausea.” For a fugitive moment of
                contact and contagion, Verney is dispossessed of his individuated body and
                consciousness and is “overcome,” losing the ground underneath him and feeling
                “aching nausea.” These symptoms of vertigo indicate an experience with what Jared
                Sexton calls “that wounded, disseminative vertigo that is blackness” (“On Black
                Negativity”). Verney loses all bearings in meeting with one who is abandoned, barred
                from bearings, and barred from Man. Yet after this brief moment, “reflection”
                returns to Verney, and he separates himself by “disengage[ing],” rejecting and
                abandoning the dying man. He regains orientation, and rushes off to find his dead
                child Alfred, held by his niece Clara, whose whiteness is notably emphasized: “paler
                than whitest snow.” </p>
                
            <p> Instead of perceiving the encounter as a violent struggle, as
                Verney does, being attentive to the action of the dying man as an embrace and a kiss
                on the mouth (the intense homoeroticism of this scene is too often unremarked) <note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    While the “negro half clad” is described as male, the state of undress, position on the floor,

                    in her foundational essay “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe,” sees as the “ungendering”

                see the Black man as included in Man but
                his refusal to “unMan” himself (to repurpose a verb Verney himself earlier uses) <note place="foot" resp="author">

                his refusal to abdicate the sovereignty of Man and affirm some shared fleshly entanglement with a
                (non)person marked by slavery. Another passage from Sexton prompts a final
                reflection on this critical scene from the novel: 
                
                <quote>In a world structured by the twin axioms of white superiority and black inferiority,
                of white existence and black nonexistence, a world structured by a negative
                categorical imperative—“above all, don’t be black” (Gordon 1997: 63)—in this world,
                the zero degree of transformation is the turn toward blackness, a turn toward the
                shame, as it were, that “resides in the idea that ‘I am thought of as less than
                human’” (Nyong’o 2002: 389). In this we might create a transvaluation of pathology
                itself, something like an embrace of pathology without pathos. (“Social Life”
                23)</quote>
                
            Given that pathology is in the first instance concerned with the understanding of
                disease, Sexton’s comment is remarkably apt for a novel about universal plague and
                for the scene I have been discussing in particular. What would it mean for Verney 
                to have been able to affirm an “embrace of pathology” in the novel, to perform an act not of sympathy
                but what we might call sympathology? Perhaps it would look like not simply aiding the dying man but staying on the floor, staying
                entangled, sharing the damage of the plague as mutually vulnerable beings and inhabiting and generalizing this
                vulnerability in a common passivity; it might look something like death, or William Blake called “self-annihilation.” This
                negative image in the novel (which is, recall, a prophecy), what <hi rend="italic"
                    >doesn’t</hi> happen, adumbrates the opening for the affirmation of the “less
                than human” (Sexton quoting Nyong’o) and thereby other than Man: the life that is cast off on the ground, without work and
                task, and “unsovereign.”<note place="foot" resp="author">On the enslaved person as (paradoxically)
                                without task and without work, cf. Agamben: “The slave . . . is the human being without work 
                                who renders possible the realization of the work of the human being” (23). 
                                On slavery and the “unsovereign,” see Sexton’s “The <hi

                Having a glimpse of what is other than Man is in fact something upon which Verney
                constantly speculates, as we’ll see in the next section. </p>
                
            <p> But instead, Verney separates himself and survives. He does appear to contract the
                plague in this scene,<note place="foot" resp="author">"The seeds of mortal disease had taken root in my bosom” (LM 337).</note>
                        but as an inoculation rather than a fatal case. Verney
                refuses to embrace pathology, refuses to join what is (forced to be) outside of Man,
                and rather than helping or joining the Black man, throws him off and, moreover, 
                feeds on his dying life by using the literally abject man (“threw . . . from me”, cf. Latin
                <hi rend="italic">ab </hi> + <hi rend="italic">iactus</hi>) as a
                sacrifice for his own immunization; they do not share the wound or the vulnerability
                of flesh in common dehiscence. Not only is the unnamed Black character not fully
                included in the proper category of Man but
                his not being Man is precisely what allows Verney to be Man. Verney (again, almost
                literally) parasitically feeds off his disease, subjection, and abjection; he
                becomes inoculated and able to reproduce himself even as the world around him
                disintegrates. In this way, the scene is a microcosm of the more general
                constitutive exclusions of Man that the novel probes and stages. Alongside the
                already radical interrogation of Western humanism, colonialism, and imperialism in
                    <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, a trajectory brought out by Barbara Johnson
                and others, reading the novel in dialogue with work in Black Studies 
                further radicalizes our understanding of the limits and the outsides of Man. In
                addition, such a reading offers another understanding of this crucial hinge of the
                whole novel—namely, reframing the question as to why Shelley had the last man, the
                one character to survive the plague, contract it from the only character explicitly
                racialized as Black. This analytic bears on Romanticism’s political ecology more
                generally in fundamental ways; it prompts a rethinking of the category of ecological
                and nonhuman relationality according to “racial blackness” as the “paradigmatic
                figure of the nonhuman”—a paradigm consolidating precisely in the Romantic era—which
                as such aligns with all “earth’s vulnerable inhabitants,” and the earth itself
                (Karera 46, 52).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Compare Zakiyyah Iman Jackson,

                    “Terrestrial movement toward the nonhuman is simultaneously movement toward blackness, 
                    whether blackness is embraced or not, as blackness constitutes the very matter at hand” (“Outer Worlds” 217). </note></p></div>

            <p> While the first two parts of this essay delineated the novel’s idea of Man, the last
                section argued Verney’s refusal to unMan himself took the form of his refusal to
                embrace the pathology of the plague and the dying Black man. Embracing and
                inhabiting the plague would mean acceding to the forces of interruption that the
                plague both figures and ushers in.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Cf. Johnson: 
                    “The Plague is what man’s measures can neither foresee nor master . . . [it]

                The plague is a shifting figure in the book, conjuring both the “lethal
                universality” of Man (Johnson) and what interrupts this structure of universality
                (in this way it recalls Derrida’s discussion of the <hi rend="italic"
                >pharmakon</hi>, or indeed, Weheliye’s conceptual framing of the flesh). The plague,

                is what short-circuits the reproduction of the world. It undoes the logics of
                sovereignty, tasks, progress, and futurity and, on another level, exposes their
                violently differentiating mechanisms and effects. Yet the plague is only the most
                prominent harbinger of the forces of negativity — interruption, inoperativity,
                abdication, aimlessness, ruination, and especially abdication — that pervade <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>.
                In fact, it is possible to delineate a
                dialectic of abdication among all of the taskmasters and project mongers of the novel, 
                in addition to one on the second-order level of the novel itself. First of all, the main characters’ relation
                is set in motion, before they meet, by the last King of England abdicating the
                throne in the year 2073; the young would-be king Adrian then renounces any claims to
                the throne, amounting to an abdication; Raymond, whose very name suggests kingship
                over the world (cf. <hi rend="italic">roi</hi>, <hi rend="italic">re</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">rey</hi> + <hi rend="italic">monde</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mundo</hi>, etc.), renounces sovereignty over England on the cusp of achieving
                it, then later actually does assume the sovereignty of the Protectorship (called a
                “task” (150) only then to abdicate the throne and give up on “his various projects” (149); 
                yet another sovereign, Ryland, assumes then abdicates the Protectorship. Indeed, the end of Man is consistently
                described as the end of sovereignty.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “Now is man lord of the creation? Look at

                Even near the end of the novel, with the plague finally gone and almost everyone on earth
                dead, Verney describes the plague itself in terms of abdication: “She [the plague]
                abdicated her throne” (426). In <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, sovereignty
                cannot hold itself in place, and its continual ruination gestures toward the

            <p> Alongside the acts of abdicating sovereignty, there are also several images toward
                the end of the novel, both figurative and literal, of relinquishing the rudder,
                reins, or pilotage, of giving up direction and directionality, of refusing to have a
                goal, telos, or task. “We took our hands therefore away from the long grasped

                                horse” (418) and “given up all
                                pilotage” (423).</note>
                At an earlier moment of despair, he enjoins “man” to abdicate his sovereignty as the “lord of creation,”
                and to embrace dispossession: “Lie down, O man . . . give up all claim to your inheritance” (316).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Importantly in this passage, Verney intuits
                                the relation of the notion of “man” as sovereign “lord of creation”
                                to the colonizing imperative: “Of old navies used to stem the giant
                                ocean-waves betwixt Indus and the Pole for slight articles of
                                luxury. Men made perilous journies to possess themselves of earth’s
                                splendid trifles, gems and gold. Human labour was wasted—human life
                                set at nought” (316).</note> 
                Then there is, of course, the last man, Verney, whom I designated
                at the beginning of this essay as a paradigmatic figure of tasklessness. 
                Even while relinquishing the hope for improvement (“I form no expectation of alteration for the better”), in the
                novel’s final paragraph Verney longs in vain “to have some task” (470). Although his
                tasks have been abdicated for him, Verney remains trapped in the paradigm of Man,
                and trapped in isolation; his solitary wandering recalls Victor Frankenstein’s isolation at
                the end of that novel, not least as Frankenstein on his deathbed cries: “ My task is unfulfilled" (<hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> 177). </p>
                
            <p> The novel therefore prompts us to think through the logic of
                    abdication; the abdication of sovereignty, of tasks,
                direction, and progress, and by extension the abdication of Man himself — or the idea
                of Man itself. But what comes after Man, after History, after sovereignty? For whom,
                after all, is the last man writing? This impossible audience is of course the
                central structural problem of the book, one that occurs intermittently to Verney
                himself. He speculates on possible future readers on an earth with no future,
                settling upon either surviving remnants of humanity or more evocatively a totally other form of life, an alternate way of
                being, something he calls at one point a “race spiritual” (399.) With the demise of
                humanity and Man around him, Verney becomes consumed with the possibility that there
                is a mode of being, a possible “we,” that is not Man. And despite its march toward
                annihilation, <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>’s prophetic mode is constantly
                demonstrating that things can be otherwise, even those formations that “seemed
                eternal” like Man, History, World, Nature—even climate, the seasons, and the sun,
                all of which are disrupted in some fashion in the book—can be seen, configured,
                experienced, shared, and inhabited differently (412). Verney mocks the astronomer
                Merrival for invoking beings after Man without being able to “describe the unknown
                and unimaginable lineaments of the creatures who would then occupy the vacated
                dwelling of mankind” (290); yet Verney himself variously gives thought to “other
                spirits, other minds, other perceptive beings, sightless to us” and to “other forms
                of being” who have altogether different forms of “communings” (341; 420). At another
                moment, he harbors the thought that “humanity is not extinct; but merely passed into
                other shapes, unsubjected to our perceptions” (413). These “other shapes” of life
                would be “unsubjected” to the perceptions and paradigm of Man, with “unsubjected”
                suggesting beings not subjected to any sovereign, and perhaps, coming after the
                subject itself. </p>
                
            <p> The novel does little to limn these “other shapes” of — or than — humanity, except to suggest the possibility that they could exist, and, in foregrounding the force of
                inoperativity and abdication, the possibility they would be unsovereign, without task,
                detached from the sovereign imperatives of progress and the colonial, racial
                apparatuses of division that marry such imperatives. To close, I will suggest
                a final image of a taskless, unsovereign, relational life other than Man that the
                novel bequeaths to readers. Mere pages from the end, the last man wanders through
                the deserted city of Rome and takes in its museums and monuments:
                
                <quote>I gazed at each statue, and lost myself in a reverie before many a fair Madonna or
                beauteous nymph. I haunted the Vatican, and stood surrounded by marble forms of
                divine beauty. Each stone deity was possessed by sacred gladness, and the eternal
                fruition of love. They looked on me with unsympathizing complacency, and often in
                wild accents I reproached them for their supreme indifference—for they were human
                shapes, the human form divine was manifest in each fairest limb and lineament. The
                perfect moulding brought with it the idea of colour and motion; often, half in
                bitter mockery, half in self-delusion, I clasped their icy proportions, and, coming
                between Cupid and his Psyche’s lips, pressed the unconceiving marble. (465)</quote>
                
            In quite Blakean language, Verney experiences these statues as presences that have
                “the human form divine” and human “lineament[s] but are not Man. He partakes in some strange communion with the
                figures, losing himself in a Rousseauian “reverie” as he and the statues gaze upon
                one another. The statues themselves seem to be perpetually, purely in relation,
                dispossessed from themselves and “possessed by sacred gladness, and the eternal
                fruition of love.” What is “eternal fruition”? Given that “fruition” denotes the
                realization of some potentiality, trajectory, project, or task, “<hi rend="italic"
                    >eternal</hi> fruition” indicates the absolute non-presence of any task. That which is
                always, eternally in fruition has no need of a projected task or process of coming
                    <hi rend="italic">into</hi> fruition; it simply is. The statues thus enflesh a
                common, taskless existence. Their “supreme indifference” is indifference to the
                world of differentiation itself, the world of tasks and progress, of improvement,
                deferral, and futurity: the world of Man.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    For a similar logic of indifference and nonproductivity in Shelley’s contemporary
                                Friedrich Schelling, see Kirill Chepurin’s “Indifference and the
                                World: Schelling’s Pantheism of Bliss.”</note> 
                As the pun on “unconceiving marble” suggests, the statues have no child gestating or
                project into futurity; there is no work or task to be fulfilled, no condition to be
                improved, nothing to be accomplished or realized, because existence is always
                already “eternal[ly]” in fruition, immanently what it is—let be. The name for this
                release, this immaculate nonconception, is
                love: “the eternal fruition of love.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    In an article discussing the importance of Shelley’s reading and translation of Spinoza for <hi rend="italic">The Last
                                Man</hi>, Eileen Hunt Botting links Shelley's notion of love (in the novel and a poem where she writes “I wed eternity”), 
                    with its emphasis on “immanence and embodiment,” to Spinoza’s philosophy (1137). 
                    Along these lines I also want to acknowledge Columbia PhD student Diana Newby’s brilliant dissertation 
                    chapter on Shelley’s Spinozism in <hi rend="italic">The Last
                            Man</hi>, which I was able to read and learn from while finishing edits on this essay. </note></p>
            
            <p> We might see in this immanent non-realization an illustration of Anne-Lise François’s subtly ecological — more
                explicit in her recent work — ethics of non-productivity, “(non)fulfillment,” and “freedom from work” in her book <hi
                    rend="italic">Open Secrets</hi> (58, xvi). If there is an ethics and a form of
                relationality modeled, however forbiddingly, by the statues’ embrace, it is clearly
                not grounded in any notion of sympathy. Verney rebukes the statues for their “<hi
                    rend="italic">unsympathizing</hi>” air, desiring some form of recognition that
                their presence — a presence immanent in itself yet alien to the world — will not yield.
                The statues’ refusal of sympathy, and their simultaneous modeling of a kind of
                immanent commonality and love that is without sympathy and “without pathos”
                (Sexton), return us to the earlier scene that demonstrated the exclusions built into
                the paradigm of sympathy: Verney’s encounter with the “negro half clad,” to which
                this scene bears striking parallels. In both episodes, Verney “los[es him]self” in
                communion (here in “reverie,” earlier being “overcome” without “reflection”) only then to dissever himself from
                relation and react violently. Just as in the earlier scene he felt the Black man
                “clasp” his body and perceived it an assault, responding angrily, the same verb
                returns here as Verney himself “clasp[s]” the statues in fury, “reproach[ing] them”
                with “wild accents” and “bitter mockery.” And similarly here as before, there is a
                ghost of a kiss. Where earlier Verney exchanged breaths with the dying man, their
                mouths close in the offer of a kiss, here Verney attempts to infiltrate and join the
                endless kiss of Cupid and Psyche: “coming between Cupid and his Psyche’s lips, [I]
                pressed the unconceiving marble.” Each of the two kisses promises contact with a
                presence that is not Man, but these promises, ciphers of another life, dissolve
                before the last man in different ways. Verney pulls away from the first kiss from
                the dying man, siphoning his life for inoculation, while he is closed off from the
                statues’ futureless kiss, still retaining his desire to be Man (and rebuking the
                statues for being otherwise). The last man in this way wishes to remain the last
                Man; Verney is unwilling to accede to a life without task, to some other kind of
                relationality with other beings and with the earth. Yet this refusal lets a question
                linger: what if the wholly “other shapes” we desire are already immanent, right in
                front of us, in the form of a kiss that harbors the eternal fruition of a life both
                alien and common?</p>
                
            <p><hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> invites us to think a different image
                of humanity that is not beholden to the sovereign solitude of Man, and in this way,
                to quote Wynter again, to “collectively give humanness a different future,” opening
                new configurations of a common “we” (“Unparalleled Catastrophe” 73). 
                This image other than Man would harbor a different ecology, a different 
                relation to the earth—one not grounded in sovereignty, mastery,
                or tasks of improvement. Like the statues’ eternal fruition, this form of life is
                immanent, already realized in the relationality that constitutes every fleshly
                entanglement (however powerfully and violently denied). The numerous environmental
                catastrophes in <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> are an essential part of its
                explicitly prophetic vision, an intimation of how the hierarchically differentiated
                and racialized construct of Man would produce what Verney calls a “funereal earth”
                (LM 440), but what is now called the Anthropocene, a “new geological epoch . . . built from slavery and colonialism
                (Lewis and Maslin 320). It is the novel’s indictment of itself and its world that it
                can easier imagine the extinction of humanity than the end of the idea of Man. Yet
                    <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>’s experiment in political ecology is not
                only a critique - it is also the adumbration of something else.</p>
                
            <p> One of the wagers of this essay has been its preliminary attempt to place Mary Shelley
                in dialogue with theoretical discourses, especially in Black Studies, on the
                “abolition of Man” and the “dethroning of Man and uttering new forms of life”
                (Weheliye 138; Walcott 192). Continuing to do so can help reframe Romanticism by sharpening our attention to the constitutive exclusions and erasures of
                Romanticism’s world (which is our world) and also by revitalizing the speculative habits inherent in Romanticism’s critique
                of Enlightenment and, more generally, its critique of the
                proper. Following this path would be one way of taking up Verney’s final
                inscription, an overture to a coming community written on a building to no one or to no Man: 
                “Friend, come! I wait for thee!” (LM 456).<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    Compare in <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> the creature’s haunting final inscription, 
                    scratched in stones and trees, left for Victor Frankenstein: “Come on, my enemy” (174).</note></p>
                    
            <p> Disentangling the extinction of humanity from the abolition of Man involves imagining
                and inhabiting other forms of life, though not as a <hi rend="italic">task</hi> to
                be actualized but a re-expression of something already immanent:
                some trace of the common, the flesh, the earth, that the world keeps us from seeing,
                in part by setting us to our tasks (but who, “us”?). <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    Man</hi> presents one image of humanity, Man, and narrates its downfall—but the
                book is cast as a prophecy, which is less a prediction than it is a warning. </p></div>

            <p> On the last day of February 2020, I received an email letting me know that this
                Romantic Circles Praxis volume on Political Ecology, with my essay on Mary Shelley’s
                    <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, was kicking back into gear for publication.
                This same day, Feb. 29th, 2020, was the day of the first reported death in the United States
                from the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19 (though it would later be
                discovered there had been at least two earlier undetected deaths). This essay was
                finished in the summer of 2019 essentially as is, and while I have decided not to
                make any substantial or timely changes to it in light of the current moment, the
                pandemic seems to demand some extra reflection from readers of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Last Man</hi>. It is certainly eerie to return to my own essay and to Shelley’s monumental novel of
                twenty-first-century plague now, in mid-May 2020, as COVID-19 ravages on into what looks to be a grim summer and year
                ahead. Though long overshadowed in popular consciousness by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Frankenstein</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi> was quickly thrust into
                the news in the early days of the pandemic, mentioned prominently in <hi

                and always exceeds any time or conditions that would await its proper arrival. Of
                course, and despite the “all” encoded in the <hi rend="italic">pan</hi> of pandemic,
                all the world does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have the plague—infection and fatality

                Latinx, Indigenous, and especially Black
                people disproportionately suffering. The racial parameters of who counts as Man
                continue to enforce a differential vulnerability, with some protected and others sacrificed as a kind of social
                inoculation. Perhaps, as Sexton suggests in a different context, this world itself

            <p> Somewhere in the flurry of intellectual commentary on COVID-19 that has rapidly emerged, it
                was pointed out that the virus’s name derives from the arch-symbol of sovereignty:
                    <hi rend="italic">corona</hi>, meaning crown. Corona is indeed the crown, but
                only the crown, of the preexisting politico-economic regimes of sovereignty and governance that ever more brutally set
                tasks for those workers it deems essential, which is to say dispensable. These tasks
                must be done, without any real overarching changes, so that this world can reproduce
                itself and its hierarchies—so that it can “<hi rend="italic">go on</hi>,” in the
                words of the U.S. president, the supposed sovereign, who tweeted on March 9th, 2020: 
                
            <quote>“So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000
                and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this
                moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about
                that!” </quote>
                
            I am fascinated by the ampersanded zeugma here, which encrypts a whole world logic: “Nothing is shut down, <hi
                    rend="italic">life &amp; the economy go on</hi>.” Maybe the real question is how
                to break the zeugma between “life” and “the economy,” the zeugma that governs
                everything. How to make everything refuse to “go on”; how to expel sovereignty and
                economy from enclosing and hierarchically differentiating, or gradating, fleshly
                life; how to desert, leave, destitute, quit, abdicate the whole complex, this world
                and age of Man. What community, or what “other forms of being” and “communings”
                would come after (LM 420)? Relation is still possible with physical distancing, when
                not touching can be care; and flickers of other communings are showing up in
                emerging mutual-aid networks, organized rent strikes, and calls for a debt jubilee
                and general strike. We might think of such a strike — “strike,” the original meaning
                of <hi rend="italic">plaga</hi>, "plague", — as a refusal of tasks and an affirmation of a
                taskless common life. Another cipher of the shadowed future could be detected in the
                graffiti message showing up in different places of late, posing a simple question:
                “The Economy, or Life?” This graffiti might be answered by another graffiti message,
                one left by the last man to those to
                follow – “Friend, come! I wait for thee!” (LM 456).</p>
