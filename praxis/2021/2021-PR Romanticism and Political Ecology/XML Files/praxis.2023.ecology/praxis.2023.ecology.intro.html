               <h1><span class="head">Introduction </span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Romanticism’s relationship with ecology has been a lively topic of concern. In arguing
               that English Romantic poets discovered a new “holistic” paradigm that prefigured contemporary
               ecological thought and eco-criticism, John McKusick’s seminal <span style="font-style:italic">Green Writing </span>(2000) set the stage for a renewed concern with the way Romantic-era authors form
               part of a genealogy of our own contemporary ecological concerns in the era of anthropocentric
               climate change. In <span style="font-style:italic">Ecology without Nature</span>, Timothy Morton clarified that while the “holism” specific to the Romantic period
               concerns not just a feeling of enmeshment with “nature” or with the “non-human,” it
               also contains a burgeoning feeling of interconnection that dovetails with nationalism,
               a sense of belonging to “a whole greater than the sum of its parts that potentially
               underpins a conservative or reactionary politics (101). At the root of these concerns
               is the bugbear of organicism and “organic community”—a form of holism that implies
               an identity between members as well as their subsumption by a totality that remains
               irreducible to the differences contained within it. In contradistinction to this kind
               of organicism, Morton proposes a thinking of “collectivism,” which he argues rules
               out organic community by making the collective enmeshment of human and non-human un-subsumable
               by any discrete totality. As he puts it in <span style="font-style:italic">The Ecological Thought</span>, with a nod to Saussure: <span class="quote">‘The ecological thought permits no distance. Thinking interdependence involves dissolving
                  the barrier between “over here” and “over there,” and more fundamentally, the metaphysical
                  illusion of rigid, narrow boundaries between inside and outside. Thinking interdependence
                  involves thinking difference. This means confronting the fact that all beings are
                  related to each other negatively and differentially, in an open system without center
                  or edge. (39)’</span> From holism to ecological collectivism, from nationalism to Morton’s “mesh,” Romanticism
               becomes a necessary touchstone not just for a genealogical account of our own sense
               of ecology, but also for how it necessarily presages a <span style="font-style:italic">political </span>ecology—a conceptualization of the relations between the <span style="font-style:italic">polis </span>and what it excludes or includes, what forms of collectivity it allows or disallows.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>However, the idea that Romanticism lays the groundwork for our own ecological preoccupations
                  begs the question of exactly what <span style="font-style:italic">kinds</span> of political ecologies it articulated. Nearly two decades ago, Nicholas Roe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Politics of Nature </span>argued that Romantic authors concatenated their politics with a conception of the
                  natural world that was bound up with notions of human nature and natural right, aimed
                  largely at democratic or republican political commitments. In this way, Roe challenged
                  earlier new historicist claims that Romanticism entailed a retreat from history to
                  the supposedly ahistorical domain of nature or the imagination.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>These arguments find their clearest expression in Jerome McGann, The Romantic Ideology.</span></div>
                  </div> As he puts it, “nature could never suffice as a Romantic escape from history because . . .
                  nature as an idea and as a physical actuality was fundamental to contemporary interpretations
                  of history and to the political theory of an age of revolutions" (11). When Wordsworth
                  suggests in <span style="font-style:italic">The Prelude</span> that the French Revolution seemed “nothing out of nature’s certain course,” this sense
                  of nature can hardly be seen as indifferent to the political domain, since it figures
                  as the very concept generative of a reading of historical change.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Yet all of these Romantic tropes and themes remain firmly embedded within a particular
               reading of the liberal tradition, which maintains or even privileges the distinction
               between <span style="font-style:italic">human </span>nature and a nature “out there” that it parallels, echoes, or separates itself from.
               And the notion that the political dimension of Romantic conceptions of nature is tied
               primarily to human-centered “natural rights” fundamentally limits the scope of the
               ways in which Romantic political ecology might be seen to contest not only purportedly
               natural formations such as the nation-state, but also the basic categories of liberal
               political philosophy, including its investment in universal figures of “the human”
               as the primary bearer of rights. This investment hardly constitutes a convincing bulwark
               against the ways in which the category of “the human” is both at the center of the
               period’s declarations of rights and sovereignty for a range of hitherto bereft members
               of the polity, <span style="font-style:italic">and simultaneously</span> at the center of a long history of violent de-humanizations and re-naturalizations
               of all kinds. As I will discuss below, among the issues that this volume explores
               is the question of whether the Romantic preoccupation with nature, and thus with questions
               surrounding what we now call political ecology more generally, can be reduced to these
               concerns.</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical work by thinkers of contemporary political ecology—Latour and Descola
               in particular — repeat a central tenet of contemporary eco-criticism: the need to
               relinquish any concept of a “nature” external to the political. Latour’s <span style="font-style:italic">Politics of Nature</span>, for instance, argues that any political ecology worthy of its name must abandon
               the tradition’s great divide between the political domain on the one hand (where political
               “rights” are accrued and citizens are formed), and an ahistorical “nature” on the
               other (whose denizens remain outside the political domain, without “rights” or political
               standing). This divide not only separates politics into two houses, but also accounts
               for a variety of exclusions of non-human <span style="font-style:italic">as well as human </span>non-citizens, relegating them all to the domain of nature. As Latour argues, modern
               political ecology must liquidate this opposition if it is to address adequately the
               current ecological crisis of the Anthropocene, wherein humans have now become the
               equivalent of a natural force, altering the Earth’s geological record and climate
               systems to such an extent that it is no longer possible to rigorously distinguish
               human-made from natural processes.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Like many of its critical predecessors, this volume asks what kinds of political ecologies
                  Romanticism devised and deployed in response to its own historical moment. However, <span style="font-style:italic">Romanticism and Political Ecology</span> does so without assuming either that Romantic political ecology can be reduced to
                  the “holism” of organic community and its bedfellow nationalism, or that it prefigures
                  Latour’s liquidation of the concept of the externality of nature in favor of a collectivity
                  that includes both humans and non-humans. As the essays in this volume attest, the
                  Romantic period abounded with multiple challenges to the seemingly simple division
                  between nature and culture, human and non-human, as well as to the ways in which that
                  division helped to inform a specific set of political motifs or concepts. Simply put,
                  there is more Romantic experimentation with various kinds of political ecology than
                  is dreamt of by liberal political philosophy. This includes, among other things, a
                  crucial recognition that in lieu of a simple opposition between nature and culture,
                  a complex interdependency exists that does not necessarily entail a complete immanence
                  of one to the other. In other words, as Alan Bewell has argued in <span style="font-style:italic">Natures in Translation</span>, there was never a Romantic conception of nature in the singular, but rather multiple
                  conceptions of nature and of the natural, each of which in turn entailed a different
                  understanding of its connection to politics and the political. Bewell’s claim about
                  John Clare is a case in point: even in the context of a poetry embedded in the language
                  of rights that can be extended to non-human entities,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>One of the clearest examples of this can be found in John Clare’s poem, “The Lament
                           of Swordy Well,” where the stone quarry of the title is the lyric voice of the poem
                           and laments, among other things, that the system of profit or “gain” that has produced
                           its exploitation and destruction has usurped its “freedom”: “Gain takes my freedom
                           all away/ Since its dull suit I wore/ And yet scorn vows I never pay/ And hurts me
                           more and more.See John Clare, Major Works151.</span></div>
                  </div> we discover a poet marking the passage from the death of one conception of nature
                  and world—the commons and the parish or locale which depended upon it— to the birth
                  of another: privatized industrial agriculture and the system that depends on it. This
                  suggests not just the mutual imbrication of nature with culture, but an acute recognition
                  of the <span style="font-style:italic">historical specificity</span> of any concept of nature. There is no nature “as such”—only a set of exteriorities
                  specific to a given world or ecosphere constituted by its relationship to that exteriority.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This is not to say, however, that nature, for the Romantics, is purely conceptual,
               an invention, or social creation. Rather, it functions as a domain of exteriority
               to the social-political as it is presently constituted. This volume offers what might
               be called an “alternative” understanding of Romantic political ecology, searching
               as it does for those elements within Romantic-era authors that re-situate dominant
               liberal conceptions of the relation between nature and politics. For this reason,
               the essays included here cover a wide range of canonical and non-canonical Romanticism:
               from its pre-figurations in Rousseau to the way the recently recovered work of Karoline
               von Günderrode sought to recast German <span style="font-style:italic">Naturphilosophie</span> in ways that challenged any human-centered notion of consciousness; from Hölderlin,
               whose conception of the Earth is interpreted as a figure for a transition from one
               conception of world and nature to another, to Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>, which challenges the racial hierarchies ensconced in the allegedly universal concept
               of “Man” by opening up forms of commonality predicated on a different mode of relationality;
               and finally to Erasmus Darwin’s pastoral ecologies, which directly challenge traditional
               natural law philosophy’s elision of the “non-human” resources (including human slaves)
               upon which their concept of human freedom depended. Each essay, in its turn, draws
               out an underground, unorthodox Romantic political ecology. As a result, our volume
               provides a novel genealogy for Romanticism’s pioneering role in contemporary politico-
               ecological concerns.</p>
            <p>The collection opens with Frédéric Neyrat’s “Communicating the Outside: Nature, the
               Outside, and Romanticism,” which engages in a critique of the “second wave” of post-structuralism,
               focusing on the way it argues for the liquidation of the concept of nature as a simple
               exteriority to the political. Analyzing the work of Bruno Latour and others, Neyrat
               reads the attempt to eliminate the distinction between the polis and its other—nature—as
               a symptom of the current ecological crisis. Rather than provide the conceptual matrix
               for addressing the new forms of collective action and solidarity that would be necessary
               to confront this crisis, Neyrat demonstrates how this approach ends up reasserting
               a form of community between entities—one that obliterates any sense of alterity that
               various forms of “nature” might be said to possess. This paves the way, Neyrat argues,
               for a neo-holism where all entities are reduced to a single shared plane of immanence,
               leading to a series of fantasies, including geo-engineering, which finally only exacerbates
               the crisis. In lieu of this approach, Neyrat argues for a “radical existentialism”
               that privileges a field of differences that cannot be reduced to one another. It is
               on this score that the Romanticisms of Victor Hugo and Jean-Jacques Rousseau become
               an important touchstone. Rather than understanding the Romantic period as reducing
               nature to a transcendent exteriority or to its immediate phenomenal characteristics,
               Neyrat understands Romanticism as a “producer of outsides.” “Nature” is not a single
               transcendent field, but something more akin to what Eduardo Viveiros de Castro calls
               a “multi-naturalism”—the idea that there is not one nature in the singular, but a
               multiplicity of “natures” that includes among their various iterations a notion of
               something fundamentally untouched by humans (e.g., the Earth’s burning core). This
               diversely exterior “elsewhere” that constitutes Romantic “nature,” according to Neyrat,
               opens up a separation, a spacing, rather than an absolute divide. It thereby produces
               a relation between singularities, without abolishing their differences, and introduces
               a form of community that leaves the alterity of incompossible worlds intact.</p>

               <p>Anna Ezekiel’s essay “Earth, Spirit, Humanity: Community and the Nonhuman in Karoline
                  von Günderrode’s ‘Idea of the Earth’” examines author and poet Karoline von Günderrode’s
                  prose writings as a response to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century <span style="font-style:italic">Naturphilosophie</span>, particularly the version put forth by her contemporary, Friedrich Schelling. A neglected
                  figure of German Romanticism whose work has only recently been translated into English
                  (by Ezekiel herself),
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Karoline von Günderrode, Poetic Fragments.</span></div>
                  </div> Günderrode is primarily known as a poet. Ezekiel takes up her brief text <span style="font-style:italic">The Idea of the Earth</span>, and reads it in conjunction with her other writings, examining how Günderrode’s
                  re-writing of idealist <span style="font-style:italic">Naturphilosophie</span> concepts works along different lines and with surprising results. Focusing on the
                  concept of the Earth as that which both harbors “nature” in general but also surpasses
                  it by including both human and non-human elements within it, Ezekiel’s essay shows
                  how Günderrode’s cosmology implies no special status for the human. Rather, the human
                  is embedded in, and of a piece with, the non-human. The results of this cosmology
                  are far-reaching, questioning the unique sovereignty of humanity in relation to the
                  natural world and, as a result, its domination over other non-human (and human) beings.
                  If “spirit” or “mind” cannot rigorously be distinguished from its other, or from that
                  which is not aware of itself as the unfolding of spirit, then “spirit” or “mind,”
                  not to mention consciousness, are no longer the exclusive domain of human beings.
                  Whereas idealist philosophies tend to understand self-consciousness as the emergence
                  of spirit out of its exteriorization in the natural world, Günderrode’s cosmology,
                  according to Ezekiel, implies that non-human entities can partake of “consciousness”
                  (and even self-consciousness) alongside their human counterparts. The result, as the
                  essay demonstrates, is a conception of community predicated on the notion of a form
                  of harmony with the natural world— a kind of harmony wherein human and non-human entities
                  enter into surprising connections with each other, producing a new form of sociality
                  that Günderrode calls the “realized idea of the earth.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Whereas Günderrode’s cosmology effectively equates the Earth with “the world,” my
               own contribution, “Hölderlin’s Earth,” demonstrates the extent to which one of her
               German Romantic contemporaries — Friedrich Hölderlin — articulated a different notion
               of “the Earth” in terms not dissimilar to what Neyrat in his essay calls an “infinity
               of outsides.” Focusing on the interlocking thematics of the “alternation of poetic
               tones” that Hölderlin’s prose texts argue are basic structures of all poetry, I analyze
               how Hölderlin’s focus on the crucial interplay between the organic (a relatively consistent
               moment of stasis and harmony found within both nature and man’s creations) and the
               aorgic (the gradual dissolution of that temporary stability), separates Earth from
               world, culminating in what Hölderlin calls their “real separation.” The Earth thus
               comes to designate, in Hölderlin’s poetics, a moment between the dissolution of one
               world and its relation to nature, and the unfolding of another. In short, Hölderlin’s
               conception of the Earth constitutes a radical exteriority to any notion of the “world”
               <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>to any cosmology or idea of “nature” upon which that world depends. It also, therefore,
               entails something other than an <span style="font-style:italic">oikos</span>, a “home” or “habitat” suggested in the etymology of the term “ecology,” which would
               be capable of reconstituting a shared sense of belonging or rootedness. Turning to
               one of Hölderlin’s shorter river poems, “The Main,” I analyze the way that he actually
               reverses the assumed relation between poetry and the Earth found in one of Heidegger’s
               favorite references to Hölderlin — “poetically Man dwells on this Earth” (217). In
               fact, Hölderlin’s river poetry does not open up the possibility of a new “dwelling”
               on the Earth; instead, it witnesses poetry’s exposure to something so fundamentally
               exterior to <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> world — the Earth as a <span style="font-style:italic">terra incognita</span> — that it inescapably destabilizes all senses of “dwelling,” along with any conception
               of native land or soil.</p>

               <p>Joseph Albernaz’s essay “Without Task: Abdication, Race, and Relation in Mary Shelley’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span>” shifts the collection’s focus to British Romanticism with an examination of the
                  way Shelley’s novel questions the supposedly universal category of “Man” by charting
                  an “end of Man”

                  </div> that is post-universal. Grounding his analysis in long-standing critiques of “Man”
                  as a universal category, as well as more recent critical race theory that understands
                  this category as constituted by its racial and gendered gradations and exclusions,
                  Albernaz reads Shelley’s novel as an investigation into the possibility of a form
                  of community that would not be predicated exclusively on a “shared humanity.” Since
                  the plague in the novel that ravages the globe undoes all the usual logics of human
                  sovereignty or mastery, human progress and human futurity, Albernaz sees the novel
                  as an exploration of the “end” of Man in another sense: the end of a universal category
                  capable of generating solidarity with that which it excludes. What happens, Shelley’s
                  novel seems to ask, in the absence of any goal or <span style="font-style:italic">telos</span> concerning humanity or its future? Albernaz’s response to this question shows that <span style="font-style:italic">The Last Man</span> opens a space for what he calls a form of “relational life” that no longer has any <span style="font-style:italic">telos</span> or task and that eschews any sovereignty predicated on shared belonging to a category
                  that is both racially exclusive and falsely universal. Focusing his analysis on a
                  key scene in the novel where the main character, Lionel Verney, is potentially exposed
                  to the deadly virus when he comes to the aid of one of its victims — a black man dying
                  from its effects — Albernaz contends that this scene, rather than appealing to some
                  humanity they both share, presents a renunciation of the privileges of the universal
                  category “Man” that the main character does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> share with the other. In Albernaz’s account, this scene presents most sharply what
                  is at work in oblique ways throughout the novel: an entanglement with an other who,
                  in this case, is “a (non)-person marked by slavery” and therefore by radical de-humanization.
                  For Albernaz, this possibility points forward to a landscape without man that instead
                  contains a solidarity with others whose otherness is no longer filtered through the
                  category of the human and all its particular others, human or otherwise.</p>

            <p>Amanda Goldstein’s contribution, “Utopian Pastoral and the Inhuman Trade” extends
               Albernaz’s exploration of the way Romantic political ecology sets about questioning
               the centrality of human rights - bearing subjects and the universality of Man through
               the category of racial difference. She does so by focusing her attention on the genre
               of Golden Age pastoral in relation to Erasmus Darwin’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation</span> and by setting up her interpretation of Darwin as a riposte to various contemporary
               new materialisms and post-humanisms that tend to reduce the question of the human
               to a generality—<span style="font-style:italic">the</span> human<span style="font-style:italic">—</span>and its various non-human others. As Goldstein argues, Erasmus Darwin’s work centers
               around an ecology that recognizes how specific classes or groups of humans exploit
               <span style="font-style:italic">other humans</span> and non-humans together — an exploitation that collectively becomes the basis of
               their mode of life. Darwin thus provides a needed corrective to, or politicization
               of, traditional political ecology by bringing the problem of slavery and colonialism
               into its account of the natural world and by figuring “nature” and its various non-humans
               (including dehumanized slaves) as active agents of rebellion against their own exploitation
               and enslavement. Whereas earlier versions of pastoral “ecological jubilee” depicted
               nature as taking sides with the laboring class, Goldstein’s argues that Darwin’s parables
               take the idea of “ecological retribution” further by depicting the supposedly extra-political
               domain of the Earth as released from its indifference, taking up arms against unfettered
               resource extraction and chattel slavery. These depictions, Goldstein argues, project
               emancipation and abolitionism not as the domain of enlightened (human, white) benefactors
               but as the direct and violent retribution of the enslaved. In short, Darwin projects
               a non-human agency found in the human, vegetal, and lithic “resources” upon which
               the rights-bearing colonial subject depends. The result, according to Goldstein, is
               a political ecology through and through, where the elemental forces of the Earth themselves
               become agents of justice rather than of indifferent necessity, and where both civil
               and natural law are seen as thoroughly malleable.</p>
            <p>The essays collected here examine the various modalities of Romantic political ecology
               as a “multi-naturalism,” treating the mutual imbrication of concepts of nature and
               the particular vision of the political that flows from it without reducing one to
               the other. As such, they demonstrate the breadth and possibility of Romantic political
               ecology that remains to be examined, along with the fecundity of the questions it
               continues to raise: How does one understand the relation between the human and the
               non-human? How does this very question elide the problem of race or colonialism? Is
               nature a transcendent backdrop for the sovereign rights-bearing subject or precisely
               that which potentially undermines it? How does a thinking of the Earth demonstrate
               the mutual imbrication of the human world with nature? In the midst of the current
               focus on the ecological fate of the planet, this collection hopes to offer some historical
               counter-examples of modes of thought that exceeded the dominant mode of politics (and
               ecology avant la lettre) of its time.</p>
