    <text>
        <body>
            <p> Romanticism’s relationship with ecology has been a lively topic of concern. In
                arguing that English Romanticism poets discovered a new “holistic” paradigm that
                prefigured contemporary ecological thought and eco-criticism, John McKCusick’s
                seminal <hi rend="italic">Green Writing </hi>(2000) set the
                stage for a renewed concern with the way Romantic-era authors form part of a
                genealogy of our own contemporary ecological concerns in the era of anthropocentric
                climate change. In <hi rend="italic">Ecology Without Nature</hi>, Timothy Morton
                clarified that while the “‘holism”’ specific to the Romantic period concerns not
                just a feeling of enmeshment with “nature” or with the “non-human,” it also contains
                a burgeoning feeling of interconnection that dovetails with nationalism, a sense of
                belonging to “a whole greater than the sum of its parts that potentially underpins a conservative or reactionary
                politics (101). At the root of these concerns is the bugbear of organicism and
                “organic community”—a form of holism that implies an identity between members as
                well as their subsumption by a totality that remains irreducible to the differences
                contained within it. In contradistinction to this kind of organicism, Morton
                proposes a thinking of “collectivism,” which he argues rules out organic community
                by making the collective enmeshment of human and non-human un-subsumable by any
                discrete totality. As he puts it in <hi rend="italic">The Ecological Thought</hi>,
                with a nod to Saussure:
                
            <quote>The ecological thought permits no distance. Thinking interdependence involves
                dissolving the barrier between “over here” and “over there,” and more fundamentally,
                the metaphysical illusion of rigid, narrow boundaries between inside and outside.
                Thinking interdependence involves thinking difference. This means confronting the
                fact that all beings are related to each other negatively and differentially, in an
                open system without center or edge. (39)</quote>
                
            From holism to ecological collectivism, from nationalism to Morton’s “mesh,”
                Romanticism becomes a necessary touchstone not just for a genealogical account of
                our own sense of ecology, but also for how it necessarily presages a
                <hi rend="italic">political </hi>ecology—a conceptualization of
                the relations between the <hi rend="italic">polis </hi>and what
                it excludes or includes, what forms of collectivity it allows or disallows.</p>
            
            <p> However, the idea that Romanticism lays the groundwork for our own ecological
                preoccupations begs the question of exactly what <hi rend="italic">kinds</hi> of
                political ecologies it articulated. Nearly two decades ago, Nicholas Roe’s
                <hi rend="italic">Politics of Nature </hi>argued that Romantic
                authors concatenated their politics with a conception of the natural world that was
                bound up with notions of human nature and natural right, aimed largely at democratic
                or republican political commitments. In this way, Roe challenged earlier new
                historicist claims that Romanticism entailed a retreat from history to the
                supposedly ahistorical domain of nature or the imagination.<note place="foot" resp="author"> These
                            arguments find their clearest expression in Jerome McGann, <hi
                                rend="italic">The Romantic Ideology</hi>.</note>
                As he puts it, “nature could never suffice as a Romantic escape from history because . . 
                nature as an idea and as a physical actuality was fundamental to contemporary interpretations of 
                history and to the political theory of an age of revolutions" (11). When Wordsworth suggests in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Prelude</hi> that the French
                Revolution seemed “nothing out of nature’s certain course,” this sense of nature can
                hardly be seen as indifferent to the political domain, since it figures as the very
                concept generative of a reading of historical change.</p>
            
            <p> Yet all of these Romantic tropes and themes remain firmly embedded within a
                particular reading of the liberal tradition, which maintains or even privileges the
                distinction between <hi rend="italic">human </hi>nature and a
                nature “out there” that it parallels, echoes, or separates itself from. And the
                notion that the political dimension of Romantic conceptions of nature is tied
                primarily to human-centered “natural rights” fundamentally limits the scope of the
                ways in which Romantic political ecology might be seen to contest not only
                purportedly natural formations such as the nation-state, but also the basic
                categories of liberal political philosophy, including its investment in universal
                figures of “the human” as the primary bearer of rights. This investment hardly
                constitutes a convincing bulwark against the ways in which the category of “the
                human” is both at the center of the period’s declarations of rights and sovereignty
                for a range of hitherto bereft members of the polity, <hi rend="italic">and
                    simultaneously</hi> at the center of a long history of violent de-humanizations
                and re-naturalizations of all kinds. As I will discuss below, among the issues that
                this volume explores is the question of whether the Romantic preoccupation with
                nature, and thus with questions surrounding what we now call political ecology more
                generally, can be reduced to these concerns.</p>
            
            <p> Recent theoretical work by thinkers of contemporary political ecology—Latour and
                Descola in particular— repeat a central tenet of contemporary eco-criticism: the
                need to relinquish any concept of a “nature” external to the political. Latour’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Politics of Nature</hi>, for instance, argues that any political
                ecology worthy of its name must abandon the tradition’s great divide between the
                political domain on the one hand (where political “rights” are accrued and citizens
                are formed), and an ahistorical “nature” on the other (whose denizens remain outside
                the political domain, without “rights” or political standing). This divide not only
                separates politics into two houses, but also accounts for a variety of exclusions of
                non-human <hi rend="italic">as well as human </hi>non-citizens,
                relegating them all to the domain of nature. As Latour argues, modern political
                ecology must liquidate this opposition if it is to address adequately the current
                ecological crisis of the Anthropocene, wherein humans have now become the equivalent
                of a natural force, altering the Earth’s geological record and climate systems to
                such an extent that it is no longer possible to rigorously distinguish human-made
                from natural processes.</p>
            
            <p> Like many of its critical predecessors, this volume takes up the question ofasks
                what kinds of political ecologies Romanticism devised and deployed in response to
                its own historical moment. However, <hi rend="italic">“Romanticism and Political
                    Ecology</hi>” does so without assuming either that Romantic political ecology
                can be reduced to the “holism’” of organic community and its bedfellow nationalism,
                or that it prefigures Latour’s liquidation of the concept of the externality of
                nature in favor of a collectivity that includes both humans and non-humans. As the
                essays in this volume attest, the Romantic period abounded with multiple challenges
                to the seemingly simple division between nature and culture, human and non-human, as
                well as to the ways in which that division helped to inform a specific set of
                political motifs or concepts. Simply put, there is more Romantic experimentation
                with various kinds of political ecology than is dreamt of by liberal political
                philosophy. This includes, among other things, a crucial recognition that in lieu of
                a simple opposition between nature and culture, there exists a complex
                interdependency exists that does not necessarily entail a complete immanence of one
                to the other. In other words, as Alan Bewell has argued in <hi rend="italic">Natures
                    in Translation</hi>, there was never a Romantic conception of nature in the
                singular, but rather multiple conceptions of nature and of the natural, each of
                which in turn entailed a different understanding of its connection to politics and
                the political. Bewell’s claim about John Clare is a case in point: even in the
                context of a poetry embedded in the language of rights that can be extended to
                non-human entities,<note place="foot" resp="author"> One of the clearest examples of this can be found
                            in John Clare’s poem, “The Lament of Swordy Well,” where the stone
                            quarry of the title is the lyric voice of the poem and laments, among
                            other things, that the system of profit or “gain” that has produced its
                            exploitation and destruction has usurped its “freedom”: 
                            <lg type="stanza">
                            <l>“Gain takes my freedom all away/ </l>
                           <l>Since its dull suit I wore/ </l>
                            <l>And yet scorn vows I never pay/ </l>
                            <l>And hurts me more and more.</l>

                we discover a poet marking the passage from the death of one conception of nature and
                world—the commons and the parish or locale which depended upon it— to the birth of
                another: privatized industrial agriculture and the system that depends on it. This
                suggests not just the mutual imbrication of nature with culture, but an acute
                recognition of the <hi rend="italic">historical specificity</hi> of any concept of
                nature. There is no nature “as such”—only a set of exteriorities specific to a given
                world or ecosphere constituted by its relationship to that exteriority. </p>
            
            <p> This is not to say, however, that nature, for the Romantics, is purely conceptual, an
                invention, or social creation. Rather, it functions as a domain of exteriority to
                the social-political as it is presently constituted. This volume offers what might
                be called an “alternative” understanding of Romantic political ecology, searching as
                it does for those elements within Romantic- era authors that re-situate dominant
                liberal conceptions of the relation between nature and politics. For this reason,
                the essays included here cover a wide range of canonical and non-canonical
                Romanticism: from its pre-figurations in Rousseau, to the way the recently recovered
                work of Karoline von Günderrode sought to recast German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturphilosophie</hi> in ways that challenged any human-centered notion of
                consciousness; from Hölderlin, whose conception of the Earth is interpreted as a
                figure for a transition from one conception of world and nature to another, to Mary
                Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>, which challenges the racial
                hierarchies ensconced in the allegedly universal concept of “Man” by opening up
                forms of commonality predicated on a different mode of relationality; and finally to
                Erasmus Darwin’s pastoral ecologies, which directly challenge traditional natural
                law philosophy’s elision of the “non-human” resources (including human slaves) upon
                which their concept of human freedom depended. Each essay, in its turn, draws out an
                underground, unorthodox Romantic political ecology. As a result, our volume provides
                a novel genealogy for Romanticism’s pioneering role in contemporary politico-al
                ecological concerns.</p>
            
            <p> The collection opens with Frederic Neyrat’s “Communicating the Outside: Nature, the
                Outside, and Romanticism,” which engages in a critique of the “second wave” of
                post-structuralism, focusing on the way it argues for the liquidation of the concept
                of nature as a simple exteriority to the political. Analyzing the work of Bruno
                Latour and others, Neyrat reads the attempt to eliminate the distinction between the
                polis and its other—nature—as a symptom of the current environmental crisis. Rather
                than provide the conceptual matrix for addressing the new forms of collective action
                and solidarity that would be necessary to confront this crisis, Neyrat demonstrates
                how this approach ends up reasserting a form of community between entities—one that
                obliterates any sense of alterity that various forms of “nature” might be said to
                possess. This in turn paves the way, Neyrat argues, for a neo-holism where all
                entities are reduced to a single shared plane of immanence, leading to a series of
                fantasies, including the fantasy of geo-engineering, which finally only exacerbates
                the crisis. In lieu of this approach, Neyrat argues for a “radical existentialism”
                that privileges a field of differences that cannot be reduced to one another. It is
                on this score that the Romanticisms of Victor Hugo and Jean-Jacques Rousseau
                becomesbecome an important touchstone. Rather than understanding the Romantic period
                as reducing nature to a transcendent exteriority or to its immediate phenomenal
                characteristics, Neyrat understands Romanticism as a “producer of outsides.”
                “Nature” is not a single transcendent field, but something more akin to what Eduardo 
                Viveiros de Castro calls a “multi-naturalism”—the idea that there
                is not one nature in the singular, but a multiplicity of “natures” that includes
                among their various iterations a notion of something fundamentally untouched by
                humans (e.g., the Earth’s burning core). This diversely exterior “elsewhere” that
                constitutes Romantic “nature,” according to Neyrat, opens up a separation, a
                spacing, rather than an absolute divide. It thereby produces a relation between
                singularities, without abolishing their differences, and introduces a form of
                community that leaves the alterity of incompossible worlds intact.</p>
            
            <p> Anna Ezekiel’s essay “Earth, Spirit, Humanity: Community and the Nonhuman in
                Karoline von Günderrode’s ‘Idea of the Earth’” examines author and poet Karoline von
                Günderrode’s prose writings as a response to contemporary eighteenth- and
                nineteenth-century <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi>, particularly the version
                put forth by her contemporary, Friedrich Schelling. A neglected figure of German
                Romanticism whose work has only recently been translated into English (by Ezekiel
                    herself),<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Karoline von Günderrode,
                            <hi rend="italic">Poetic Fragments.</hi></note>
                Günderrode is primarily known as a poet. Ezekiel
                takes up her brief text <hi rend="italic">The Idea of the Earth</hi>, and reads it
                in conjunction with her other writings, examining how Günderrode’s re-writing of
                idealist <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi> notions works along different
                lines, and with surprising results. Focusing on the concept of the Earth as that
                which both harbors “nature” in general, but also surpasses it by including both
                human and non-human elements within it, Ezekiel’s essay shows how Günderrode’s
                cosmology implies no special status for the human. Rather, the human is embedded in,
                and of a piece with, the non-human. The results of this cosmology are far- reaching,
                questioning the unique sovereignty of humanity in relation to the natural world and,
                as a result, its domination over other non-human (and human) beings. If “spirit” or
                “mind” cannot rigorously be distinguished from its other, or from that which is not
                aware of itself as the unfolding of spirit, then “spirit” or “mind,” not to mention
                consciousness, are no longer the exclusive domain of human beings. Whereas idealist
                philosophies tend to understand self-consciousness as the emergence of spirit out of
                its exteriorization in the natural world, Günderrode’s cosmology, according to
                Ezekiel, implies that non-human entities can partake of “consciousness” (and even
                self-consciousness) alongside their human counterparts. The result, as the essay
                demonstrates, is a conception of community predicated on the notion of a form of
                harmony with the natural world— a kind of harmony wherein human and non-human
                entities enter into surprising connections with each other, producing a new form of
                sociality that Günderrode calls the “realized idea of the earth.”</p>
            
            <p> Whereas Günderrode’s cosmology effectively equates the Earth with “the world,” my
                own contribution, “Hölderlin’s Earth,” demonstrates the extent to which one of her
                German Romanticist contemporaries—Friedrich Hölderlin—articulated a different notion
                of “the Earth” in terms not dissimilar to what Neyrat in his essay calls an
                “infinity of outsides.” Focusing on the interlocking thematics of the “alternation
                of poetic tones” that Hölderlin’s prose texts argue are basic structures of all
                poetry, I analyze how Hölderlin’s focus on the crucial interplay between the organic
                (a relatively consistent moment of stasis and harmony found within both nature and
                man’s creations), and the aorgic (the gradual dissolution of that temporary
                stability), separates Earth from world, culminating in what Hölderlin calls their
                “real separation.” The Earth thus comes to designate, in Hölderlin’s poetics, a
                moment between the dissolution of one world and its relation to nature, and the
                unfolding of another. In short, Hölderlin’s conception of the Earth constitutes a
                radical exteriority to any notion of the “world”
                <hi rend="italic">and </hi>to any cosmology or idea of “nature”
                upon which that world depends. It also, therefore, entails something other than an
                    <hi rend="italic">oikos</hi>, a “home” or “habitat” suggested in the etymology
                of the term “ecology,”, which would be capable of reconstituting a shared sense of
                belonging or rootedness. Turning to one of Hölderlin’s shorter river poems, “The
                Main,” I analyze the way that he actually reverses the assumed relation between
                poetry and the Earth found in one of
                Heidegger’s favorite references to Hölderlin—“poetically Man dwells on this
                    Earth.” In fact, Hölderlin’s river poetry is not one
                that opens up the possibility of a new “dwelling” on the Earth; instead, it
                witnesses poetry’s exposure to something so fundamentally exterior to <hi
                    rend="italic">any</hi> world—the Earth as a <hi rend="italic">terra
                    incognita</hi>— that it inescapably destabilizes all senses of “dwelling,” along
                with any conception of native land or soil.</p>
            
            <p> Joseph Albernaz’s essay “Without Task: Abdication, Race, and Relation in Mary
                Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">The Last Man</hi>” shifts the collection’s focus to
                British Romanticism, with an examination of the way Shelley’s novel questions the
                supposedly universal category of “Man” by charting an “end of Man”<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    I draw the phrase from Derrida’s essay, “The Ends of Man.” See Jacques Derrida,
                            <hi rend="italic">Margins of Philosophy,</hi> 109–-136.</note> that is post-universal. 
                Grounding his analysis in long-standing critiques of “Man” as a universal category, as well as more recent
                critical race theory that understands this category as constituted by its racial and
                gendered gradations and exclusions, Albernaz reads Shelley’s novel as an
                investigation into the possibility of a form of community that would not be
                predicated exclusively on a “shared humanity.” Since the plague in the novel that
                ravages the globe undoes all the usual logics of human sovereignty or mastery, human
                progress and human futurity, Albernaz sees the novel as an exploration of the “end”
                of Man in another sense: the end of a universal category capable of generating
                solidarity with that which it excludes. What happens, Shelley’s novel seems to ask,
                in the absence of any goal or <hi rend="italic">telos</hi> concerning humanity or
                its future? Albernaz’s response to this question shows that <hi rend="italic">The
                    Last Man</hi> opens a space for what he calls a form of “relational life” that
                no longer has any <hi rend="italic">telos</hi> or task, and that eschews any
                sovereignty predicated on shared belonging to a universal category that is both
                racially exclusive and falsely universal. Focusing his analysis on a key scene in
                the novel where the main character, Lionel Verney, is potentially exposed to the
                deadly virus when he comes to the aid of one of its victims—a black man dying from
                its effects—Albernaz contends that this scene, rather than appealing to some
                humanity they both share, presents a renunciation of the privileges of the universal
                category “Man” that the main character does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> share with
                the other. In Albernaz’s account, this scene presents most sharply what is at work
                in oblique ways throughout the novel: an entanglement with an other who, in this
                case, is “a (non)-person marked by slavery” and therefore by radical
                de-humanization. For Albernaz, this possibility points forward to a landscape
                without man that instead contains a solidarity with others whose otherness is no
                longer filtered through the category of the human and all its particular others,
                human or otherwise.</p>
            
            <p> Amanda Goldstein’s contribution, “Utopian Pastoral and the Inhuman Trade” extends
                Albernaz’s exploration of the way Romantic political ecology sets about questioning
                the centrality of human rights–-bearing subjects and the universality of Man through
                the category of racial difference. She does so by focusing her attention on the
                genre of Golden Age pastoral in relation to Erasmus Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">The
                    Economy of Vegetation,</hi> and by setting up her interpretation of Darwin as a
                riposte to various contemporary new materialisms and post-humanisms that tend to
                reduce the question of the human to a generality—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> human<hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi>and its various non-human others. As Goldstein argues,
                Erasmus Darwin’s work centers around an ecology that recognizes how specific classes
                or groups of humans exploit <hi rend="italic">other humans</hi> and non-humans
                together— an exploitation that collectively becomes the basis of their mode of life.
                Darwin thus provides a needed corrective to, or politicization of, traditional
                political ecology by bringing the problem of slavery and colonialism into its
                account of the natural world, and by figuring “nature” and its various non-humans
                (including dehumanized slaves) as active agents of rebellion against their own
                exploitation and enslavement. Whereas earlier versions of pastoral “ecological
                jubilee” depicted nature as taking sides with the laboring class, Goldstein’s argues
                that Darwin’s parables take the idea of “ecological retribution” further by
                depicting the supposedly extra-political domain of the Earth as released from its
                indifference, taking up arms against unfettered resource extraction and chattel
                slavery. These depictions, Goldstein argues, project emancipation and abolitionism
                not as the domain of enlightened (human, white) benefactors, but as the direct and
                violent retribution of the enslaved. In short, Darwin projects a non-human agency
                found in the human, vegetal, and lithic “resources” upon which the rights-bearing
                colonial subject depends. The result, according to Goldstein, is a political ecology
                through and through, where the elemental forces of the Earth themselves become
                agents of justice rather than of indifferent necessity, and where both civil and
                natural law are seen as thoroughly malleable. </p>
            
            <p> The essays collected here examine the various modalities of Romantic political
                ecology as a “multi-naturalism,” treating the mutual imbrication of concepts of
                nature and the particular vision of the political that flows from it without
                reducing one to the other. As such, they demonstrate the breadth and possibility of
                Romantic political ecology that remains to be examined, along with the fecundity of
                the questions it continues to raise: How does one understand the relation between
                the human and the non-human? How does this very question elide the problem of race
                or colonialism? Is nature a transcendent backdrop for the sovereign rights-bearing
                subject, or precisely that which potentially undermines it? How does a thinking of
                the Earth demonstrate the mutual imbrication of the human world with nature? In the
                midst of the current focus on the ecological fate of the planet, this collection
                hopes to offer some historical counter-examples of modes of thought that exceeded
                the dominant mode of politics (and ecology avant la lettre) of its time.</p>
