            <p>There is no outside: —this is the main watchword of our time; the second one is that
                there is no nature. <note place="foot" resp="author">Cyclonopedia : Complicity with
                                Anonymous Materials.</note> My hypothesis is that
                there is a secret complicity between the foreclosure (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Verwerfung</hi>) of the outside, which causes a psycho-political illness that I
                call <hi rend="italic">exophobia</hi> (the fear of the outside), and the rejection
                of nature, the <hi rend="italic">anaturalism</hi> constituting the technophilic
                basis of the Anthropocene and its geo-engineering fantasies. Romanticism could be
                used as a cure for both exophobia and anaturalism.</p>
            
            <p> Leaning on a genealogy that extends from Heraclitus and the Greek atomists to
                Friedrich Nietzsche, I first want to offer a metaphysical explanation of the
                healthful rejection, by the philosophies of immanence, of the idea of a transcendent
                outside. Devoted to this ontological rejection, the first section of my essay will
                especially focus on the way Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels tied the rejection of the
                outside to the disappearance of nature, a rejection and a disappearance that could
                not be understood without considering the rise of capitalism and its social,
                industrial anthropization of nature. In the second section, I will shed some light
                on a crucial difference between thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave
                (amongst others: Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard, and Luce
                Irigaray) and those who belong to the second post-structuralist one (Bruno Latour
                and Antonio Negri) –— a difference that is, to me, not underlined enough in
                contemporary debates striving to evaluate post-structuralism in order to go beyond
                it and to develop a new kind of theory, be it under the name of new materialism,
                object-oriented philosophy, speculative realism, or the anthropology of ontological
                turn. The thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave strengthened and developed
                the calling into question of the great divides (between nature and culture, male and
                female, and so on) and the rejection of any kind of transcendent Outside, a
                rejection and a questioning that was initiated by thinkers of immanence (as we will
                have seen in the first section of my essay). The second poststructuralist wave, on
                the other hand, put things this way: 1) Yes, there is no transcendent Outside, and,
                    <hi rend="italic">consequently</hi> there is no outside at all <note place="foot" resp="author"> Recently, Latour gave a
                            performance lecture in New York entitled “Inside” (<ref

                                >http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/755</ref>).</note>; 2)
                Yes, nature and society are indistinguishable, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >consequently</hi> nature does not exist any longer.<note place="foot" resp="author"><hi rend="italic">Ecology without

            <p> In the three last sections of my essay, I will object to these two problematic
                consequences that, I argue, underpin the Anthropocene and its disastrous
                environmental consequences. To support my philosophical objection, I will devote the
                third section to an explanation of what I call the <hi rend="italic">field of
                    existential differences</hi>, a concept leaning on the following thesis: indeed,
                there is no <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> Outside, but there is
                an<hi rend="italic"> infinity of outsides</hi>, as innumerable
                as there are singular existences. Each outside opens itself inside each existing
                being – —“chose inouïe, c’est au-dedans de soi qu’il faut regarder le dehors”
                (surprisingly, it is inside yourself that you can look at the outside),” argues
                Victor Hugo (<hi rend="italic">Préface</hi>PO, 699).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Henceforth cited as
                        (PO).</note> This internal outside is the condition of the
                possibility of relationality, or more accurately of communication: existing beings
                can communicate thanks to their internal openness. Communication occurs between
                different beings – —that is to say, beings defined by their existential difference;
                furthermore, each existential difference (each existing being) reveals a field to
                which it belongs. This field is not a pre-existing substance, but an ontological
                domain transformed by the appearance of new forms of existence.</p>
            
            <p> Once my existentialist proposition is explained, I will be able to revisit the
                concept of nature. Instead of liquidating nature – —killing it;, turning it into
                asubstantial, fungible things, resources for human “progress” – —I will lean on
                several Romantic writers to describe, in the fourth and fifth sections, nature as a
                field of existential differences. As a form of thought, Romanticism was always
                subject to several metaphysical oscillations: between the natural and the
                supernatural, between revolutionary stances and reactionary retractions, and between
                a militant optimism (Percy Shelley’s “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” in
                his “Ode to the West Wind" and a dark pessimism (Lord Byron’s “better not to
                be” at the end of “Euthanasie"). Instead of too quickly favoring only one dimension
                of Romantic thought, I’d rather argue in this essay that these oscillations draw a
                space of fundamental polarities that still help us to understand our contemporary
                situation. Romanticism is of course historically datable, and we can track its
                origins, its forerunners, and its acme; but Romanticism also constitutes an event, à
                la Alain Badiou, that is to say, a figure of truth that is still available, a
                “surviving Romanticism” –— to borrow from Sara Guyer (18-–20) —that we can still
                solicit for our present. </p>
            
            <p> In this sense, I agree with Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre when they define
                Romanticism as a transhistorical vision having as its center “a reaction against the
                way of life in capitalist societiesy” (17) – —a reaction giving rise to
                revolutionary statements <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to Gérard de Nerval’s “black sun of Melancholia.” 
                We thus must not forget that, insofar as society is still capitalist, Romanticism is
                still topical. For Löwy and Sayre, “Far from conveying an outsiders’ view, far from being a critique rooted in some
                elsewhere, the Romantic view constitutes modernity’s self-criticism. ” (21). Yet I claim that it’s only because Romanticism reveals or produces outsides <hi
                    rend="italic">from within</hi> that Romanticism can—still—constitute an
                alternative to capitalism. When the present is too compact, too immanent, too
                anthropomorphized, too enclosed in itself, we need thinkers and activists risking an
                elsewhere – —revealing, building, and, in the end, communicating an outside to
                everyone, at least potentially. My hypothesis is that it’s possible to save the
                concept of nature, not as a stable transcendent entity on which racist and sexist
                politics could be built, but as an element of disruption. Leaning on Victor Hugo and
                Jean-Jacques Rousseau, I will define nature as 1). something that can neither be
                reduced to a transcendent part nor to an immediate and visible aspect and 2. ) a
                plural mediation enabling a political critique of society. Nature is plural; , but
                this plurality does not lead to considering the world as a collection of
                ontologically equivalent entities; rather, natures are profoundly different,
                profoundly different, sometimes contradictory, always deceiving our expectations
                along with our unfortunate attempt to reduce them to something or to nothing.
                Natures disrupt both the human/non-human divide and the attempt to erase it in a
                peaceful liberal world that a Parliament of humans orand/and or things could govern.
                If we want to prevent the Anthropocene from becoming cosmophagic – —from eating,
                swallowing, destroying the non-human universe - —and in the end from becoming
                anthropophagic for lack of otherness, then we must leave a place for an updated
                concept of nature that could foster an anti-Anthropocenic
                politics.</p>

                <head>End of the Outside, End of Nature</head>
            
            <p> Here is my opening question: what has motivated the radical reconsideration of any
                figure of otherworldliness or outer-worldliness? With such a question, the name of
                Friedrich Nietzsche comes to mind. In <hi rend="italic">Twilight of the Idols</hi>,
                he showed “how the ‘true world’ finally became a fable” (17). This Nietzschean
                detonation tends to extinguish not only the Christian religion but also Plato,
                insofar as Christianity, Nietzsche says in <hi rend="italic">Beyond Good and
                    Evil</hi>, was nothing more than a “Platonism for the people”
                (3). If this destruction affects both God and the so-called platonic intelligible world, our investigation
                should on the one hand look for the historical, religious, and philosophical
                sources of the theme of the Death of God, and on the other hand grasp the way in
                which many thinkers kept trying to avoid the ontological separation between the
                here-below and the beyond that Plato is said to have opened.</p>
            
            <p> Regarding the topic of the Death of God, I will note that this is already present
                in many authors before Nietzsche. Jean Paul writes in 1796: “‘’Christ, is there no
                God?’ And he answered: ‘There is none!’,” (336). In fact, the death of God was only
                a nightmare, not a reality, for this early German Romantic; but this bad dream will
                haunt Romanticism -— as I will explain again at the end of my essay -— and beyond it
                all of German Idealism.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            “Formerly, the infinite grief existed historically in the formative
                            process of culture. It existed in the feeling that ‘God Himself is
                            dead.’” (G.  W.  F. Hegel, <hi rend="italic">Faith and Knowledge</hi>,
                            Albany, SUNY Press, 1977, 190). I read the persistent nightmare of
                            God’s death as the “return of the repressed”: Christianity is founded on
                            the death of God as son, despite his resurrection and his supposed
                            return at the end of times.</note></p>
                
            <p> The question of ontological separation would require an investigation that cannot
                be completed in this essay: I would have to show how Baruch Spinoza defines
                substance as “indivisible,” how Denis Diderot argues that everything is “sentient,”
                shifting without discontinuity from inertia to living bodies, and how Heraclitus,
                Epicurus, and Lucretius argue that everything flows.<note place="foot" resp="author"> That is why, for Heraclitus, “One cannot step twice into the same river” 
                    (<hi rend="italic">The Art and Thought of Heraclitus</hi>). Concerning Spinoza, cf. <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> 227. Concerning Diderot, cf. (for example) “Spinozist.”</note>
                            
                
                All these authors, from Heraclitus and the Greek atomists to the Nietzsche of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gay Science</hi>, produced an ontology of nature —or an
                ontology of life — rejecting the idea of a transcendent Outside. Yet it’s only with
                Marx and Engels that the world was, for the first time, defined as <hi rend="italic"
                    >practically</hi> and <hi rend="italic">historically</hi> one, enclosed on
                itself. The diagnosis of these two authors still determines our contemporary
                relation with nature and the outside, which is why I want to shed some light on
                their theoretical matrix. </p>
            
            <p>Indeed, starting with
                the<hi rend="italic"> Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts </hi>of
                1844, Marx argued that nature and society are concretely indistinguishable: Nature,
                he wrote, is inserted into the “self-generation” of Humanity
                (356). In other words, Nature is “man’s <hi rend="italic">inorganic
                    body</hi>” that is to say not only “a direct means of life” but first and foremost “the matter, the object
                and the tool of his life activity” (328). In <hi rend="italic">The German
                    Ideology</hi>, which was written in the wake of the 1844 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manuscripts</hi>, Marx and Engels explain that the transformation of Nature is
                the effect of a global industrial process: capitalism is but a megamachine turning
                the whole world into a gigantic Marketplace, reducing nature to a mere product.
                During this process, Nature lost any kind of exteriority:
                
            <quote>Of course, in all this the priority of external nature remains unassailed, and all
                this has no application to the original men produced by <hi rend="italic">generatio
                    aequivoca</hi> [spontaneous generation]; but this differentiation has meaning
                only insofar as man is considered to be distinct from nature. For that matter,
                nature, the nature that preceded human history, is not by any means the nature in
                which Feuerbach lives, it is nature which today no longer exists anywhere (except
                perhaps on a few Australian coral-islands of recent origin). (<hi rend="italic">The
                    German Ideology</hi> 63)</quote>
                
            <hi rend="italic">Capital</hi> will show how, with the reign of commodities, every
                terrestrial reality loses its singularity and becomes an element of a specific
                immanence: the equivalence of everything with everything, which is not so far away,
                according to Alexander Galloway, from the world flat ontologies —and
                object-oriented philosophies that strive to go beyond the post-structuralist mode of
                thinking - —describe. In 1863, in a famous unpublished chapter of <hi rend="italic">Capital</hi> Marx proposes
                two important concepts for our inquiry: “formal subsumption” of labor to capital - (
                when capital subordinates preexisting productive forces) and “real subsumption”
                (when capital becomes able to produce its own means, its own machines and methods of
                production, reshaping everything on the basis of its own requirements) (128–36).
                Real subsumption is the capitalist name for the end of the outside, the process
                through which capitalism reconfigures everything on Earth –in other words, the
                beginning of geo-capitalism and its anthropocenic effects.</p>
            
            <p> In this regard, we could say that the (celebrated or wished-for) end of the Great
                divides between nature and society/culture/technology, the disappearance of the
                Outside, and the melting of nature into anthropogenic activities, are not new ideas
                coming from 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> twentieth-century constructivist
                thinkers, or Actor-Network Theory promoters, but from Marx and Engels, 150 years ago. Like Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Epicurus, Marx and Engels were
                thinkers of immanence who fought against transcendence (of God, of “Man,” of
                commodities and their fetishism, etc.) and against the divisions opened up by
                transcendence. However, unlike Democritus, Diderot, Spinoza, or Nietzsche, Marx and
                Engels did not anyno longer needed an ontology of nature to destroy the great
                divides and absolute transcendence. Instead of ontology, they appealed to economics:
                they wanted to grasp the <hi rend="italic">nomos</hi> of our capitalist <hi
                    rend="italic">oikos</hi>, the rules of an industrial globalization in the
                process of swallowing the Earth, regurgitating it as <hi rend="italic">partes extra
                    partes</hi> commodities. Since the advent of modernity and its geo-capitalist
                scaffolding, we could say, parodying Wittgenstein,: if nature could talk, only
                commodities would understand it.</p></div>

            <p> From cybernetics to object-oriented philosophies through post-structuralism, a
                theoretical challenge has been advanced: who will be able to definitively erase the
                difference between living and non-living beings, nature and artifacts, organisms and
                machines? What will be – —please, forgive my irony - —the best theory able to
                justify in ontological terms what capitalism already began to perform in the
                nineteenth century? During the last 30 years,
                sociologist Ulrich Beck, meta-sociologist Bruno Latour, and cyber-feminist Donna
                Haraway and Bruno Latour –— authors who belong to what I call the second
                post-structuralist wave –— have blurred the theoretical division between nature and
                society, human beings, animals, and artificial beings.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Here post-structuralism becomes post-humanism. 
                    Consider two books of Donna Haraway’s: <hi rend="italic">Simians, Cyborgs, and Women:
                                The Reinvention of Nature</hi>, in which we can find in this book her famous “Cyborg Manifesto,” and 
                            <hi rend="italic">The Companion Species
                                Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness</hi>. I
                                agree with Haraway’s approach, I just question one of its
                                consequences.</note> 
                French anthropologist Philippe Descola —a proponent of
                what I have called in the introduction the anthropology of ontological turn, which
                aims to replace the concept of structure inherited from Claude Levi-Strauss with
                ontological propositions about cultures —has recently shown that we have to think
                “beyond nature and culture." And so? Is there anything here that is theoretically objectionable? </p>
            
            <p> Certainly not. The critique of the Great divides was necessary because these
                divisions were based on the concept of a transcendent Outside. This Outside, as I
                explained, was demolished by the attacks of Lucretius, Spinoza, Diderot, Nietzsche,
                and Marx. Besides, I find incredibly thoughtful and generous the way Donna Haraway
                thinks, the relations she produces between split domains of thought, and the
                capacity that she has to follow and tie different scientific, social, philosophical,
                political threads together. I still learn a lot from her, from her last
                theorizations about what she calls the “Chthulucene” (an Anthropocene conceptually
                reconfigured from a non-human, non-Western, non-phallocentric perspective), and I
                enjoy translating her work.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See my
                            translation of her fabulous “Anthropocene, Capitalocene,

                            https://www.cairn.info/revue-multitudes-2016-4-page-75.htm?contenu=resume).</note>
                
                But many contemporary thinkers belonging to the second post-structuralist wave drew
                these two very problematic conclusions. First, if there is no absolute Outside,
                then there is no outside at all. Let us listen to Michael Hardt’s and Antonio
                Negri’s voices, in <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi>: “One primary effect of
                globalization is the creation of a common world, a world that, for better or worse,
                we all share, a world that has no ‘outside’” (vii). Second, if nature and
                society are indistinguishable, then nature does not exist any longer. “Thank God,
                nature is going to die,” Bruno Latour writes in <hi rend="italic">Politics of
                    Nature</hi> (25): “There is no rupture” between the world of the so-called
                “things ‘as they are’ and human ‘representations’ of these things” (12). This
                lack of rupture was theorized by Ulrich Beck
                in<hi rend="italic"> Risk Society</hi> (the French edition of
                this book being prefaced by Latour). Like Marx and Engels, Beck speaks about “the
                end of the antithesis between nature and society”: nature is “a historical product,”
                a “second nature” (80-–81).</p>
            
            <p> What is wrong here? The fact that the theorists I have just quoted have melted two
                distinct concepts: cleavage (split, <hi rend="italic">Spaltung</hi>) and difference.
                Thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave, like Derrida, Deleuze, or Irigaray,
                were thinkers of difference: they fought against cleavages, that is to say,
                <hi rend="italic">absolute </hi>separations whose goal is to
                avoid any real relation between the considered terms. An <hi rend="italic"
                    >absolute</hi> difference is nothing but the denial of difference itself, the
                denial of the relation that a difference is itself able to produce, even through its
                repetition, as Deleuze argues in <hi rend="italic">Difference and Repetition</hi>. 
                Actually, a cleavage is always an attempt to shape and to preserve, as I will explain in the next section, an identity, an
                imaginary “pure” identity, and not a difference. To shed some light on my last
                statement, let’s focus on philosopher and feminist Luce Irigaray’s 1977 influential
                book <hi rend="italic">This Sex Which is Not One</hi>, where she develops her
                radical approach to sexuality and male/female “difference.” The phallocentric
                cleavage poses, on the one hand, the only existing sex, the male One-sex, its
                identity and its norms (to be active, to not cry, to master nature, etc.), and on
                the other hand a sex “which is not one,” the female sex that is <hi rend="italic">un
                    sexe qui n’en est pas un</hi>, to re-establish the French original text and its
                main meaning: <hi rend="italic">this sex that is not a sex</hi>, that is to say,
                this sex that does not really <hi rend="italic"
                >exist</hi>. In other words, the phallocentric cleavage produces the absolute gap between a (male) identity=1 and
                a (female) non-identity=0. In this respect, the fight against phallocentrism
                consists less in overcoming a Great divide —between two (id)entities —than in
                uncovering the Great annihilation of a difference (the female one) in favor of the
                only recognized identity (the male one).</p>
            
            <p> We see the same logics of annihilation in the way modernity sets the (non)relation
                between nature and culture/technology/human society: if we want to understand this
                (non)relation, that is to say, this cleavage, we have to begin our investigation not
                with Romanticism and its so-called idealization of nature (I will question this weak
                idea in the fourth section), but with the fact that nature was reduced, since the
                    seventeenth century, to nothingness. It
                is because René Descartes at first said that nature is not a “deity” but a
                mathematizable area that we can use nature –— or the Earth –— at will, digitalizing,
                reprogramingreprogramming, and printing it in 3D: "By ‘Nature’ here, Descartes wrote in 1630’s, I do not mean some deity or other sort
                of imaginary power. Rather, I use the word to signify matter itself” (25). 
                Since nature is nothing by itself –according to Descartes, but we could add
                Francis Bacon, and Galileo Galilei –it is a mere quantity without qualities and
                can therefore be turned into anything humans want.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Hence the “death of nature” (Merchant). </note>
                The scientific revolution of the seventeenth century paved the way to the enchanted
                world of commodities – —that we studied with Marx and Engels in the last part of the
                first section -— and its anaturalist basis. In this modern world, only technologies,
                sciences, cultures, and human values are considered as real, active, and capable of
                giving an identity –<hi rend="italic">their</hi> identity –to the rest of the
                world. To sum up: Humans = identity = 1; nature = non-identity = 0.</p>
            
            <p> Yet it is not the same thing to say that two things are <hi rend="italic"
                    >separated</hi>, as opposed to saying that two things are <hi rend="italic"
                    >split</hi>. The difference produced by a separation does not prevent a
                relation—quite the contrary. I argue that separation is the condition of possibility
                for relation. Separation precedes communication, an ontological statement that
                Romanticism exemplifies as I will show below. In this respect, I argue that
                exophobia - —the fear of the outside - —is an effect of a misunderstanding of what
                it means to connect, a misunderstanding that I attribute to the second wave of
                post-structuralism. It was believed that, in order to render relations possible, one
                had to ward off the outside; my argument is that in warding off the infinity of
                outsides, one renders relations impossible – —one merely overexposes everything to
                an oppressive light under which relations become irons. Let us develop this
                point.</p></div>
            
            <div type="section">
                <head>The Field of Existential Differences</head>
            
            <p> The lesson of the former section is the following: let us think twice when we plan on
                ending the Great divides, as they may hide Great annihilations: —the first ones need
                to be contested in light of the second ones. Along with contemporary philosopher
                Catherine Malabou, I argue that it is necessary nowadays to “change difference” in
                the name of a radical existentialism able to challenge the Great annihilations and
                the divides underpinning them. Strategically, the goal of the existentialism
                I propose is to insert a sort of retroactive bifurcation between the first and the
                second post-structuralist waves , in order to avoid the mere proliferation of
                theories – —like OOO – —that, under the cover of an ontological equality that erases
                the Great divides, maintains the social, political, and environmental inexistence
                that these dominant systems produce. In doing so, I will avoid the ontological
                indifferentiation that follows from the rejection of differences and separations in
                the name of the abolition of cleavages. </p>
            
            <p> But the radical existentialism I offer also needs to avoid a second danger (which is
                symmetrical to ontological indifferentiation): a bad reaction against the necessary
                fight against the Great divides, a reaction I call <hi rend="italic">the morals of
                    symbolic identities</hi>. Let us think about the way some French psychoanalysts
                and anthropologists have used the notion of the sSymbolic oOrder, which they have
                reshaped through a very restrictive reading of Jacques Lacan and Claude
                Levi-Strauss, in order to justify rigid sexual identities, the prohibition of gay
                marriage, and the refusal of the adoption of children by non-heterosexual
                    parents.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a critique of this misreading of Levi-Strauss, see Patrice Maniglier’s, “L’humanisme interminable de Lévi-Strauss.”</note>
                These thinkers, who participated in the building of a reactionary discourse that is
                nowadays well established in France, use the concept of a fixed sSymbolic oOrder in
                order to legitimate the worst reactionary splits (between, for example, the good
                symbolic-born parents and the bad natural ones). In order to avoid at once
                ontological indifferentiation and the morals of symbolic identities, I argue in
                favor of a field of existential differences that will be able to describe what links
                singularities without obliterating their separation, their reciprocal
                extraterritoriality. </p>
            
            <p> Let us briefly discuss what constitutes the field of existential differences. First, a field is not a substance: asubstantial, invisible, “potential,” the field
                only reveals itself after bodies have emerged. Only existing beings can attest to
                the ontological field: before they exist, there is no difference between the field
                and nothingness, and in this sense –— against any sort of ontological turn trying to
                re-establish, in contemporary anthropology and philosophy, the preeminence of a
                metaphysics <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> uttering what should be said on
                cultures, politics, and aesthetics -— there is no possible ontology prior to any
                existentialism, understood as what gives priority to the emergence as such of
                entities. Yet when object-oriented philosopher Graham Harman argues, on the basis of
                his reading of Latour, that there are only “actants” and no “potential,” no
                “virtual,” no “pre-individual” reality, he actually erases the dynamic difference
                between existences and the ontological field that we need to recognize
                retrospectively —– that is, only after the fact of existence.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Graham Harman writes: “Recall that there is no such thing for Latour as a
                            ‘becoming’ that would exceed individual actors. Nor is there any
                            ‘virtuality’ that exceeds them, just as potentiality does not exceed
                            them. The much-discussed difference between potential and virtual, so
                            often wielded like a billy club in our time by Deleuzian hooligans, is
                            irrelevant here—both terms fail Latour’s standard for concreteness in
                            exactly the same way” (<hi rend="italic">Prince of
                                Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics</hi>, 101).
                            Elsewhere, he notes, “In short, I reject both the potential <hi
                                rend="italic">and</hi> the virtual in favor solely of the actual”
                            (Graham Harman, “on disappointing realisms,”).</note>
                This erasure could lead to the idea of a “flat” immanent world that –, I argue -,
                denies existence and its depth of field. Flatness or depth: this is the crucial
                philosophical alternative of our time.</p>
            
            <p> Second, coming into existence is only possible through an internal
                separation leading to polarities (left/right, high/low, inside/outside, but also
                visible/invisible, light/dark, etc.) that are not initially splits, but rather
                constitute a depth of field that wherein a subject experiments with her or his
                reason or senses. In this regard, a subject can be defined as an instance of
                mediation, as a moment of communication, the last term signifying, à la Bataille,
                the excess through which polarities reveal their unfathomable difference.</p>
            
            <p> At the core of the existentialism that I argue for lies the term “existence.”
                Etymologically, <hi rend="italic">ek-sistere</hi> means: to be outside, or more
                precisely to constitute oneself from the outside. The outside –— each outside
                —acts as a fundamental disjuncture, something that we might call, with Lucretius, a
                    <hi rend="italic">clinamen</hi>.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I have devoted a book to these questions: <hi
                                rend="italic">Clinamen. Flux, Absolu et Loi
                                Spirale</hi></note> A clinamen is a deviation vis-à-vis
                straight lines, social norms, ethograms (that is to say, the inventory of all
                behaviors or actions exhibited by an animal), or thermodynamic equilibriums. At
                the beginning - of the universe, as of each thing, - was the clinamen. A clinamen is
                the opening onto an outside -— a break, an empty space, a non-functional element,
                all the existential spacings that can appear, for instance, in the form of a
                non-signifying signifier in a poem, in an act of political resistance, or in André
                Breton’s “amour fou,” etc. The outside is the mark of the singularity of each
                crucial experience, each notable artistic or political event, and, in the end, each
                existing being. Any ordinary life is the singular way through withwhich an existing
                being experiences her own depth of field.</p>
            
            <p> The outside also explains why philosophy is always disoriented, displaced by the
                contingency of the clinamen. For an existence-disoriented philosophy, there is no
                Outside; but there is an infinity of outsides, as innumerable as there are singular
                existences. Each outside opens itself inside each existing being, and this internal
                exteriority is the condition of possibility for relations. Existing beings can
                communicate thanks to their internal openness. Conversely, if immanence were
                compact, full, and substantial, there would be no gap, no separation between
                existing beings, and consequently no relations. Relations require separation –an
                idea that Bataille kept repeating: we communicate, we really communicate not because
                we are connected, but first and foremost because we are “<hi rend="italic">discontinuous</hi>
                beings,” that is, because of the impossibility of an absolute fusion of what would be the definitive erasure of
                differences (12).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Bataille, death, that which interrupts any life, appears to the eyes of discontinuous beings as “continuity” itself, that is to say, what makes possible a form of communication (<hi rend="italic">Death and Sensuality</hi> 13).</note> 
                In the event of such fusion, there would not be any communication, but a magmatic lack of relation
                and of difference in favor of an identity preventing any possible singularization
                from happening.</p>
            
            <p> To sum up, the field of existential differences is activated by the presence of
                existing beings that are opened up by their internal outside, which is neither a
                subtracted substance, nor an object hidden behind its expressions, but the
                contingent effect of an event.</p></div>
            
            <div type="section">
                <head>Nature, Supernature, and Natures</head>
            
            <p>In the two final parts of my essay, I want to examine what I said about nature and the field of existential differences in relation to Romanticism. 
                For many contemporary thinkers who attempt to get rid of the concept of nature and to create an ecology without or against nature, 
                Romanticism is the target. Let us take the example of contemporary thinker Timothy Morton who argues that, in our “ecological age,” 
                “we are realizing that absolutely everything is absolutely connected to absolutely everything else” (“Ecology after Capitalism” 47). 
                Timothy Morton argues that nature is an “ideological construct”: “What if, finally, Nature as such, the idea of a radical outside to 
                the social system, was a capitalist fantasy, even precisely 
                <hi rend="italic">the</hi> capitalist fantasy?” (57).</p>
            
            <p> Yet this statement raises two difficulties. First, it is, unfortunately, possible to reverse Morton’s statement: 
                what if, finally, the lack of a radical outside to the capitalist system was precisely <hi rend="italic">the</hi> capitalist fantasy, 
                the technological-capitalist program informing the financial sphere? 
                Second, I am not at all sure that the main strategy of romanticism was to turn nature into a 
                transcendental principle. The fact, quoting Morton, that nature “wavers between the divine and 
                the material,” between “essence” and “substance,” has to be understood not as a theoretical 
                weakness or a dead end, as Morton thinks but as a problem (
                <hi rend="italic">Ecology without Nature</hi> 14, 16); etymologically speaking, what is thrown
                    (<hi rend="italic">ballein</hi>) before (<hi rend="italic">pro</hi>)
                    us is what we have to deal with. Maybe the reduction of
                    nature to a pure material product or to the supernatural, namely the divine,
                    represents two bad solutions to this problem; maybe nature is a milieu
                    encompassing these two extreme existential states. In order to highlight my
                    approach, I would like to focus on two figures of Romanticism: Victor Hugo, and
                    Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
            
            <p> Hugo’s works illustrates my definition of romanticism as a space of fundamental polarities: the last lines
                    that the poet wrote were “c’est ici le combat du jour et de la nuit” (here is the struggle between day and night) 
                    — “here” being a place such as the Earth or Hugo himself (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Essential</hi> 464–65). <note place="foot" resp="author"> Henceforth cited as (E).</note>
                All of Hugo’s poetry is the affirmation of an infinite darkness, redeemed in extremis by the superior 
                infinity of God: we are “lost in the deep unfathomable night;” but “fleetingly,” we can “glimpse, 
                lit up by some flare of light, / The glass pane of Eternity” (E 271). In a text titled “Préface philosophique,” 
                Hugo situates humankind as a milieu between two forms of darkness: the “impenetrable” Earth and the 
                “immeasurable” sky. Yet darkness also constitutes humankind’s interiority and, in this sense, humankind 
                is a “microcosmos” (<hi rend="italic">Œuvres Complètes</hi> 340,
                    370).<note place="foot" resp="author">Henceforth cited as
                    (OC).</note> In the dark universe through which rare illuminations persist, everything is continuous, 
                “immanent” (a term Hugo keeps repeating); there is no gap between life and death: “Everything, even rot, is mixed with vitality . . . Nothing comes to an end;
                everything that ends one thing sketches another one; all the dead give birth” (OC
                346). Yet the following lines disrupts this feeling of continuity:
                
            <quote> Nothing amalgamates, everything is
                    balanced . . . the interstice is the law of being; more or less density, that’s the 
                    whole difference between the stone and the cloud; granite is a fog; the ax that cuts a 
                    head is a vapor; between two atoms, as between two universes, there is space; and the 
                    interval is as impassable from the molecule to the molecule in the infinite from below as 
                    from the sun to the sun in the infinite from above. Explaining is not more possible than 
                    denying (OC 346).</quote>
                
             This is Hugo’s ontology: 1) Everything communicates, immanence reigns, in a fundamentally dark form. 
             2) Yet communication is not fusion: a spacing – —recall the terms “space,” “intervals,” or “interstices” 
             -prevents entities from melting into an indistinct magma. 3) In this regard, what is communicated is not 
             a common substance, but a common interval. As with everything else, —the Earth, the ocean, or the sky, —nature is 
             subjected to a form of polarization through which a non-melting communication occurs, that is to say, the 
             communication of darkness, of the immeasurable. In a text entitled “Préface de mes œuvres et post-scriptum 
             de ma vie” (Preface of my Works and Post-Scriptum of my Life), Hugo argues that nature 
            
                <quote> exists alone and contains everything. Everything is. There is the part of nature that we perceive, and 
                there is the part of nature that we do not perceive. Pan has one visible side and one invisible side. 
                Because on this invisible side, you contemptuously throw the word <hi rend="italic">supernaturalism</hi>, 
                    will this invisible part less exist? X remains X. The
                    Unknown withstands your vocabulary. To deny is not to destroy. 
                    Supernaturalism is immanent. (PO 703) </quote>
                
            Thus even supernaturalism is
                    natural, immanent, the opposite of transcendent —“Le surnaturalisme, c’est la
                    nature trop loin,” that is to say, supernaturalism is nature too far away (PO
                    699). Hugo enables us to understand that there are two bad ways to deal with
                    nature: the first one is to detach a transcendent part; the second one is to
                    reduce nature to its immediate and visible aspect. To explain the effect of such
                    a reduction, Hugo uses a marvelous formula: “Vous n’avez pas voulu voir le
                    visage de l’Inconnu; vous verrez son masque” (you refused to see the face of the
                    Unknown; you will see its mask)” (PO 704). A too quick reading might make us
                    think that here Hugo opposes nature (the face) and the mask as man-made, in the
                    same way that Romantic writers are supposed to oppose “here” (where we are) and “elsewhere” (another world). 
                    However, Hugo actually says something very different: he argues that the mask is still an 
                    emanation of nature, but in the guise of the denial of its invisible part. A mask is not 
                <hi rend="italic"> absolutely </hi> detached from nature, in the sense that a communication 
                between them is still possible. That is why Hugo writes, in his poem <hi
                    rend="italic">Ce que dit la bouche d’ombre</hi> (What the Mouth of Darkness Says): “le dedans du masque est 
                encore la figure” (the inside of the mask is still a figure) (
                <hi rend="italic">Les Contemplations</hi> 365). <note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Henceforth cited as (LC).</note></p>
            
            <p> Of course, it would be easy to show that Hugo’s writing is haunted by the desire to 
                surpass nature. In “Magnitudo Parvi," the poet defines contemplation as a way to detach oneself from matter: “contempler
                les choses, / c’est finir par ne plus les voir. La matière tombe détruite” (to contemplate things, / it is eventually to see them
                    no longer. Matter falls apart) (LC 183). But the poem does not finish on these
                    words and Hugo writes: “La matière tombe détruite / devant l’esprit aux yeux de
                    lynx" (matter falls apart / before the spirit with the eyes of a lynx). Spirit, Hugo tells us, needs animal abilities to go beyond matter. 
                    In the same line, even if Hugo, in <hi rend="italic">Ce que dit la bouche d’ombre</hi>, associates matter with evil, he adds that a stone
                    is not only a “hideous blind,” but also something “pensif,” pensive, on the verge of thinking (LC 364).
                    “Everything speaks,” Hugo writes, as if the Universe was structured like a
                    language (LC 362). That is why
                    
            <quote> sous ces épaisseurs de matière et de nuit, 
                Arbre, bête, pavé, poids que rien ne soulève, 
                Dans cette profondeur terrible, une âme rêve”
            (roughly speaking: souls of the trees, beasts and cobblestones dream under depths of matter 
            and night). (LC 371).</quote>
                
            Even as immanent, even getting out
                    of a transcendent division, nature seems to be theorized by Hugo only on the
                    basis of a dual perspective. Can we imagine a Romanticism going beyond this
                    dualism? What might be a romantic pluralistic nature? This question is
                    especially important in the contemporary context of anthropologists who, aware
                    of the dangerous dead end of anaturalism, claim that, instead of getting rid of
                    nature, we should rather consider its multiplicity: I think here exemplarily to
                    Eduardo Viveiros de Castro who invented the term “multinaturalism,” which does
                    not mean a multiplicity of representations of nature, but rather multiple
                    natures as variation without a unity (65–-75). However, Rousseau’s philosophy
                    might be read as an earlier exemplification of Viveiros de Castro’s
                    multinaturalism, and I will use Rousseau’s approach toward nature to temper
                    Hugo’s excessive ontological polarizations. To understand this approach, it is
                    useful – —as a theoretical detour that will help us to identify Rousseau’s
                    originality - —to see first how Paul de Man saw Rousseau’s conception of nature.
                    In the first chapter of<hi rend="italic" resp="author"> The Rhetoric of Romanticism</hi>, Paul de Man notices in Hölderlin’s, 
                Wordsworth’s, and Rousseau’s writings, the same tendency to pass “from a certain type of nature, earthly and material, 
                to another nature which could be mental and celestial” (13). To establish his hypothesis, de Man highlights 
                the fact that, in Letter XXIII of the first part of <hi
                    rend="italic">La Nouvelle Héloïse</hi>, Rousseau says “nature seems to take pleasure in
                    self-opposition”: “radical contradictions abound in each of the passages” of
                    this letter, de Man adds (14). <note place="foot" resp="author">Henceforth cited as
                    (NH). </note> Here again, as in the case of Hugo’s poetry, an excessive polarization prevails, 
                – and we seem far away from any sort of multinaturalism. </p>
            
            <p> Indeed, Rousseau uses the word “contradiction,” but just after he mentions this word he speaks 
                about difference. He says that nature is “différente en un même lieu sous divers aspects” 
                (nature is different in the same place under various aspects) (NH 44). For Rousseau, 
                contradiction is just one possibility amongst others and not the only determination of nature. 
                Just before this paragraph, Rousseau actually describes a multiplicity of natures: mild nature, 
                cultivated nature, and “un mélange étonnant de la nature sauvage et de la nature cultivée” 
                (a surprising melding of wild nature and cultivated nature)” (NH 44) —the sort of inextricable 
                naturecultures ( to use the concepts of Latour and Haraway) that postmodern thinkers like to describe. 
                But de Man does not quote this paragraph; he also does not mention the fact that this strange multiplicity of 
                natures interrupts the Rousseau’s meditation: “Je voulais rêver, et j’en étais toujours détourné par quelque 
                spectacle inattendu” (I wanted to dream, but I was always diverted by an unexpected spectacle) (NH 44). 
                A spectacle or a “vrai théâtre” (a real drama), as Rousseau says at the end of his description, occurs when natures 
                appear in their multiplicity becoming a sort of weird, natural, man-made scene. </p>
         
            
            <p> Polarizations, contradictions, differences, a multiplicity, and an interrupting force: are these aspects of
                    nature too different, too irremediably disparate? Should we then get rid of the category of nature?</p></div>
           
            <div type="section">
                <head>Deep Nature</head>
            
            <p> Getting rid of nature? My aim is quite different. I suggest the following hypothesis: nature is a milieu of 
                communication subjected to its own power of interruption or darkness —the “impenetrable” and the “immeasurable” 
                (Hugo, OC 340, 370) —since it is what relates and separates. To produce the
                    ontological image of nature as a disruptive milieu, let’s try to superimpose
                    Hugo’s perspective on Rousseau’s perspective,; let’s draw a diagram of natures,
                    composed of 1) naturecultures, 2) the wild, and 3) technological
                    beings.</p>
            
            <p> In the middle of this image
                    stands an intertwining of nature, culture, and technology, exactly what Donna
                    Haraway calls “naturecultures” (12). Subjected to what Ulrich Beck called its total “societalization,” 
                    the nature at stake here is a nature that “can no longer be understood <hi rend="italic" resp="author">outside</hi> of society, or society
                    <hi rend="italic" resp="author">outside</hi> of nature” (80). Ventriloquizing Marx and Engels’s
                <hi rend="italic">The German Ideology</hi>, Beck adds that “not a hair or a crumb of [nature] is
                    still ‘natural’, if ‘natural’ means nature being left to itself” (81). As we
                    see, Beck’s risk society looks like what we today call Anthropocenic society;
                    yet what Beck and the constructivist trend are sometimes unable to see, or to
                    highlight, is that the entanglement of nature and culture only defines one
                    aspect, one becoming of nature amongst others.</p>
            
            <p> On the left side of the picture, we can see nature without human intervention. 
                Let us think, for example, about the burning core of the Earth, all the earthquakes that 
                are not caused by hydraulic fracturing, or what speculative realist philosopher Quentin Meillassoux calls, 
                in <hi rend="italic">After Finitude</hi>, the “ancestral” realm: the “Great Outdoors” of the
                    universe that precedes even our appearance on Earth, and in this sense has no
                    relation of any kind to us (11-15). However, the problem with Meillassoux’s
                    ancestrality is, to paraphrase Hugo, the following: ancestrality is an outside
                    that is too far away. Wild, “inhuman” (Clark 2010), escaping our attempt to
                    master it, nature’s otherness is also on Earth, in Earth, in every one of its
                    components. Let us call this dimension of nature “the wild”; not wilderness, or what results from 
                    the displacement of Native Americans, but the wild as what has been really untouched by human beings (even
                    though such an idea upsets any colonial drive).</p>
            
            <p> On the right side of the picture, we can identify all the machines, all the technology that, 
                from synthetic biology to geo-engineering, strives to master, to replace, and, in the end, 
                to erase nature. But why do I include technology in a diagram of natures? Is it not important 
                to identify technological beings as existentially specific, as forms of being that cannot, or should not, 
                be reduced to non-artificial entities? Certainly yes, but let us remember what I said in the third section 
                about the field of existential differences: any ontological knowledge must only be 
                retroactively constituted, after the reality of existing beings has being been recognized. 
                In the same manner, it is only retroactively that we can argue that nature is ontologically everywhere, even in a computer or a
                    smartphone. This is possible only retroactively because we first need to
                    acknowledge existential differences. When this acknowledgment is assured, we can
                    speak about a natural field and its ontological continuity (as Spinoza and,
                    these days, the New Materialists do). We can then, but only then say with Lawrence Buell:
                    
                <quote> Even if people were to become as “posthuman” as the bionic characters of cyberpunk fiction, 
                    they would likely remain physically embodied and permeable to the influences of water 
                    cycle, photosynthesis, macroclimate, seismology, bacterial resistance to
                    pharmaceuticals, and the “natural” advantages and disadvantages of regional
                    habitats. (6)</quote>
                
             The problem is that sometimes we are
                    not able to recognize nature in commodities, high-tech objects, or cyborgs –
                    nature’s mask seems to have swallowed both flesh and face. However, it is not
                    because we are not unable to see something that it does not exist. That is why
                    we have to give some depth to the field of differences, which is anything but
                    flat. So, if in our diagram we can see, horizontally, three specific areas
                    – naturecultures in the middle, machines on the right, and
                    wild nature on the left – we also need to acknowledge a vertical dimension severing naturecultures, 
                    wild nature, and technological beings from a dark, invisible, unknown nature: 
                    what I call <hi rend="italic">deep nature</hi> is the encounter between the vertical and horizontal 
                dimensions, – which reveals a depth of field.</p>
           
            <p> In the diagram of natures, the
                    function of depth is to host the invisible, the unknown, the frightening
                    darkness that Jean Paul has identified as the “empty, bottomless socket” of God
                    (337), a metaphor that strongly influenced the French romantic tradition. In
                    “Magnitudo Parvi,” Hugo exclaims: “L’oeil est crevé!” (the eye (of God) is
                    punctured!)” – a gruesome deed that he attributes to Spinoza and Lucretius,
                    those atheists who refuse to see God also in the “abyss,” in what — for Hugo —falsely appears as devoid of 
                    the divine (169). A few years after Hugo’s poem, Nerval writes in “Christ at Gethsemane”: 
                    
                    <lg type="stanza">
            <l>Seeking the eye of God, I’ve only seen a pit, </l>
            <l>Huge, bottomless, black, from whence eternal night</l>
            <l>Streams out over the world and ever deepens. (229)</l></lg>

                
            All this distress should not conceal
                    what Hugo completely understood: bottomless darkness is also the condition of
                    possibility for freedom, that is to say, for an ontological chance. F. W. J.
                    Schelling – who was maybe the decisive German Romantic philosopher explains this point in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of
                    Human Freedom</hi>. In God, Schelling writes, there
                    is an “inner ground” that is not God but “precedes” his existence. Schelling
                    also calls this ground “nature” (27-28). If creatures can exist as such,
                    different from God, it is thanks to the inner ground that, in God, is not God.
                    In other words, the inner ground is what ontologically differentiates God from
                    himself. Freedom thus comes from this interval, this separation between God and
                    what Schelling also calls “the original ground” or the “non-ground,” in the
                    sense that the inner ground does not exist, since it is what precedes any
                    existence. In my terms, this inner ground is a pure field. The non-ground can be
                    interpreted as a principle of ontological an-archy, an absolute freedom that,
                    for Hugo, Satan, represents. In “The Plume of Satan,” God calls “freedom”
                    the feather of Satan’s wings that did not fall 
                (<hi rend="italic">Selected Poems</hi> 104).<note place="foot" resp="author">Henceforth cited as
                    (SP).</note> This leather is “au bord du gouffre ténébreux” (on the edge of the dark abyss) (SP 102), “près du puits de la chute infinite” 
                (near the well of the infinite fall)” (SP 104), that is to say, in between, in the interval.</p>
            
            <p> To sum up, natures constitute a plurality, a field in which we can pass from technology to naturecultures and
                    from naturecultures to the wild and from the wild to technology. Every time an
                    entity as such appears, be it a machine or a tree, a distinction retroactively
                    appears in the field, a difference that any existing being traces. The condition
                    of possibility of any existence is the darkness, the non-ground thanks to which
                    the universe is not compact, deadly, or immanent. Bottomless, deep nature keeps 
                    composing an existential myriad that no ontology could have calculated <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>.</p></div>

                <head>A Political Ccommunication of the Outside</head>
                
            <p> If the universe coming from deep
                    nature is a deep field of existential differences, then we can think anew the
                    relation between nature and the outside; we can escape the enclosed world of
                    the Anthropocene and its real subsumption of nature; we can cure exophobia.
                    Instead of fearing nature or trying to erase it, we can leave it a place —or
                    several places. This is the condition of possibility of an anti-Anthropocenic
                    politics. Of course, this expression seems ridiculous, since the Anthropocene is
                    supposed to last for millennia: is it not too late to be anti-Anthropocenic? 
                    Is it even still possible to speak in terms of political ecology? 
                    My answer is that we have no choice: yes, an anti-Anthropocenic ecopolitics is impossible, 
                    but it is exactly the impossible that we need to make happen, as soon as possible, 
                    if we want to avoid being swept away by global ecocide and its geo-technological ally. 
                    So, let us attempt to ascertain how the diagram of natures I sketched out can offer some 
                    philosophical help to imagine an anti-Anthropocenic ecopolitics.</p>
           
            <p> First, the diagram of natures that I propose enables the
                    possibility of thinking of nature as a form of otherness –not a mother, or a father, 
                    not Gaia or Ouranos, but a foreign agent. Indeed, one of the fundamental dangers of 
                    the Anthropocene is to irremediably close humanity in upon itself. 
                    In the end, the anthropogenic eating of nature cannot but become anthropophagy. 
                    <hi rend="italic">Soylent Green</hi>–Richard Fleischer’s famous 1973 environmental film
                    -does not show the apocalypse that follows the collapse of
                    the global civilization. Rather, it reveals that this collapse leans on the
                    previous short-circuit of humankind that eats itself. Anthropophagy is not a
                    post-apocalyptic practice. Rather, it defines the supreme condition of a
                    civilization that ate –—destroyed –—the whole non-human world. If <hi
                    rend="italic">Soylent Green’s</hi> opening montage puts together standardization and the Industrial Revolution, 
                it is less to insist on the problem of overpopulation than on the disappearance of non-human forms 
                of life that I call cosmophagy. <note place="foot" resp="author"> I explore the concept of cosmophagy and its 
                    relations with the eco-apocalyptical cinema in “Cosmophagie. Cinéma éco-apocalyptique, anthropocène et anthropophagie.”</note>
                In other words, anthropophagy is the last step of
                    cosmophagy. At this point, when the Anthropos has swallowed the Earth, when
                    nature is performatively said to no longer exist, when human beings and every
                    form of life merge with one another, the face – to use Hugo’s words – is nothing but the mask.</p>
                
            <p> In this regard, to speak about the
                    Unknown, à la Hugo, might be a way to leave some play between the mask and the
                    face, in order to leave a place to other forms of existence. I will not resist
                    the temptation to say that the more we refuse the face of the unknown, the more
                    we risk several more Fukushimas. Here the unknown is not the “asylum of
                    ignorance,” to quote Spinoza, but on the contrary an aware knowledge of the unpredictable. 
                    It does not dismiss engineers, companies, and political leaders from their responsibilities 
                    vis-à-vis ecological disasters like Katrina or Fukushima, rather it engages another relation 
                    with what is not us. Concerning the last point, I am not sure that the word 
                <hi rend="italic">non-human</hi> is good enough to deal with the unknown, because <hi
                    rend="italic">nonhuman</hi> is an adjective that leaves unscathed the notion of human centrality, 
                through its negation. If we do not really and deeply take into account the Unknown, then the following 
                alternative end to <hi rend="italic">The Novices of Saïs</hi>, written by Novalis in 1798, 
                might be our predictable fate: “One person succeeded — he lifted the veil of the goddess at Saïs — But what
                    did he see? He saw - nightmare of nightmares — himself” (76).</p>
                
            <p> To be honest, I have made a small
                    change in this quotation: instead of “nightmare of nightmares,” Novalis wrote:
                    “wonder of wonders.” This friendly update leads to the political dimension of
                    the deep field of existential differences. Such a field does not prevent the
                    possibility of contradictions, understood as the extreme state of differences.
                    When Rousseau, in <hi rend="italic">La Nouvelle Héloïse</hi>’s Letter XXIII, uses the quasi-magic, 
                supernatural nature that he feels in the high mountains as a means to contest a modern society 
                consumed with greed, business, and earnings, and as a way to envisage what an egalitarian society 
                should look like, this contradiction does not turn nature into a transcendental principle that we 
                should save from reality, but rather uses nature as a necessary exterior able to engage a radical 
                critique of society and call for a change in reality. “Once the social compact is violated,” 
                that is to say, when a “master” deprives the people of its sovereignty, 
                Rousseau explains in <hi rend="italic">On the Social Contract</hi>, “each person then regains his first rights 
                and resumes his natural liberty, while losing the conventional liberty for which he
                    renounced it” (<hi rend="italic">Basic Political Writings</hi> 140). In other words, 
                “The very moment there is a master,
                    there no longer is a sovereign, and thenceforward the body politic is
                    destroyed”
                    (<hi rend="italic">Basic Political Writings </hi> 154). 
                Nature is therefore, for Rousseau’s politics, the
                    outside that can be generated and regenerated when the social order becomes its
                    own negation, that is, when the “social contract” —which is the event thanks
                    to which a people is constituted as a people —is broken. Nature is the Trojan
                    horse able to blow a revolutionary wind into the core of the polis.</p>
                
           <p>This romantic revolutionary wind
                    communicates the outside.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the relation between Romanticism and 
                        revolution, see Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre, <hi
                                rend="italic">Esprits de feu: Figures du

                        As I explained in this essay, the outside is not an object far away from us; it constitutes us. To 
                <hi rend="italic">ek-sist</hi>, as I said, means, literally, to stand out, to be outside, or, better, to <hi
                    rend="italic">be</hi> the outside. Thanks to Romantic poetry, the “immeasurable” of the sky and the “impenetrable” 
                        of the Earth is expressed as what is the most intimate share of the human, its inhuman core. 
                        With words, but also music, and paintings, the outside can be communicated as a reminder of the interval 
                        from which everything came into being –— each thing, and the universe itself, that rose up less from a Big Bang than from a Big Spacing. 
                        Not only is communicating the outside communicating the darkness or the unground — thanks to which singularities can appear —but this 
                        communication can also stay hidden, and preserved. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in 2019, I heard Anna Tsing explain how, in 
                        Indonesia, she saw some animals unable to
                    hide any longer, forced to be visible, because of the deforestation caused by
                    the settlement of plantations. These animals have lost the existential and vital
                    experience to be hidden in forests.</p>
           
            <p> I was struck by Tsing’s powerful
                    illustration of the global situation of overexposure – a situation touching all
                    species, including the human. What must nowadays be preserved is as much
                    biodiversity as psychodiversity. In a time of digital overexposure, when data
                    mining reigns, when the empty eye of God is filled with FAANG’s marketing
                    intrusions, it is crucial to be able to preserve the opacity of that which
                    exists. Needless to say, Facebook should be deserted. That is the paradox of our
                    time: to communicate the outside, we need to disconnect from the inside, to
                    create what Deleuze called “vacuoles of non-communication” (175). We need to encrypt what we say, 
                    in the same way that “phusis kruptestai philein” (nature loves to hide) (Heraclitus).</p></div>
