                call <hi rend="italic">exophobia</hi> (the fear of the outside), and the rejection
                of nature, the <hi rend="italic">anaturalism</hi> constituting the technophilic
                basis of the Anthropocene and its geo-engineering fantasies. Romanticism could be
                used as a cure for both exophobia and anaturalism.</p>
            <p>Leaning on a genealogy that extends from Heraclitus and the Greek atomists to
                Friedrich Nietzsche, I first want to offer a metaphysical explanation of the
                healthful rejection, by the philosophies of immanence, of the idea of a transcendent
                outside. Devoted to this ontological rejection, the first section of my essay will
                especially focus on the way Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels tied the rejection of the
                outside to the disappearance of nature, a rejection and a disappearance that could
                not be understood without considering the rise of capitalism and its social,
                industrial anthropization of nature. In the second section, I will shed some light
                on a crucial difference between thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave
                (amongst others: Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard, and Luce
                Irigaray) and those who belong to the second post-structuralist one (Bruno Latour
                and Antonio Negri) –— a difference that is, to me, not underlined enough in
                contemporary debates striving to evaluate post-structuralism in order to go beyond
                it and to develop a new kind of theory, be it under the name of new materialism,
                object-oriented philosophy, speculative realism, or the anthropology of ontological
                turn. The thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave strengthened and developed
                the calling into question of the great divides (between nature and culture, male and
                female, and so on) and the rejection of any kind of transcendent Outside, a
                rejection and a questioning that was initiated by thinkers of immanence (as we will
                have seen in the first section of my essay). The second poststructuralist wave, on
                the other hand, put things this way: 1)/ Yes, there is no transcendent Outside, and,
                    <hi rend="italic">consequently</hi> there is no outside at all<hi

            <p>In the three last sections of my essay, I will object to these two problematic
                consequences that, I argue, underpin the Anthropocene and its disastrous
                environmental consequences. To support my philosophical objection, I will devote the
                third section to an explanation of what I call the <hi rend="italic">field of
                    existential differences</hi>, a concept leaning on the following thesis: indeed,
                there is no <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> Outside, but there is
                an<hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve"> infinity of outsides</hi>, as innumerable
                as there are singular existences. Each outside opens itself inside each existing
                being – —“chose inouïe, c’est au-dedans de soi qu’il faut regarder le dehors”
                (surprisingly, it is inside yourself that you can look at the outside),” argues
                Victor Hugo (<hi rend="italic">Préface</hi>PO, 699).<hi rend="endnote_reference"
                        ><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text"> Henceforth cited as
                        (PO).</p></note></hi> This internal outside is the condition of the
                possibility of relationality, or more accurately of communication: existing beings
                can communicate thanks to their internal openness. Communication occurs between
                different beings – —that is to say, beings defined by their existential difference;
                furthermore, each existential difference (each existing being) reveals a field to
                which it belongs. This field is not a pre-existing substance, but an ontological
                domain transformed by the appearance of new forms of existence.</p>
            <p>Once my existentialist proposition is explained, I will be able to revisit the
                concept of nature. Instead of liquidating nature – —killing it;, turning it into
                asubstantial, fungible things, resources for human “progress” – —I will lean on
                several Romantic writers to describe, in the fourth and fifth sections, nature as a
                field of existential differences. As a form of thought, Romanticism was always
                subject to several metaphysical oscillations: between the natural and the
                supernatural, between revolutionary stances and reactionary retractions, and between
                a militant optimism (Percy Shelley’s “If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” in
                his “<anchor type="commentRangeStart" n="75"/>Ode to the West Wind<anchor
                    type="commentRangeEnd" n="75"/><hi rend="annotation_reference"><note

                        page.</hi></note></hi>”) and a dark pessimism (Lord Byron’s “better not to
                be” at the end of “<anchor type="commentRangeStart" n="76"/>Euthanasie<anchor
                    type="commentRangeEnd" n="76"/><hi rend="annotation_reference"><note

                            /><hi rend="background(yellow)">Please add to the Works Cited
                        page.</hi></note></hi>”). Instead of too quickly favoring only one dimension
                of Romantic thought, I’d rather argue in this essay that these oscillations draw a
                space of fundamental polarities that still help us to understand our contemporary
                situation. Romanticism is of course historically datable, and we can track its
                origins, its forerunners, and its acme; but Romanticism also constitutes an event, à
                la Alain Badiou, that is to say, a figure of truth that is still available, a
                “surviving Romanticism” –— to borrow from Sara Guyer (18-–20) - —that we can still
                solicit for our present. </p>
            <p>In this sense, I agree with Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre when they define
                Romanticism as a transhistorical vision having as its center “a reaction against the
                way of life in capitalist societiesy” (17) – —a reaction giving rise to
                revolutionary statements <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to Gérard <anchor
                    type="commentRangeStart" n="94"/>de Nerval’s “black sun of Melancholia.”<anchor
                    type="commentRangeEnd" n="94"/><hi rend="annotation_reference"><note
                        place="comment" resp="#Copyeditor" n="94"><date when="2022-08-15T18:53:00Z"

                            this source to the Works Cited.</hi></note></hi> (Löwy and Sayre, 1-56).
                We thus must not forget that, insofar as society is still capitalist, Romanticism is
                still topical. For Löwy and Sayre, “</p>
            <p>Far from conveying an outsiders’ view, far from being a critique rooted in some
                elsewhere, the Romantic view constitutes modernity’s self-criticism. ” (21). </p>
            <p>Yet I claim that it’s only because Romanticism reveals or produces outsides <hi
                    rend="italic">from within</hi> that Romanticism can – —still - —constitute an
                alternative to capitalism. When the present is too compact, too immanent, too
                anthropomorphized, too enclosed in itself, we need thinkers and activists risking an
                elsewhere – —revealing, building, and, in the end, communicating an outside to
                everyone, at least potentially. My hypothesis is that it’s possible to save the
                concept of nature, not as a stable transcendent entity on which racist and sexist
                politics could be built, but as an element of disruption. Leaning on Victor Hugo and
                Jean-Jacques Rousseau, I will define nature as 1). something that can neither be
                reduced to a transcendent part nor to an immediate and visible aspect and 2. ) a
                plural mediation enabling a political critique of society. Nature is plural; , but
                this plurality does not lead to considering the world as a collection of
                ontologically equivalent entities; rather, natures are profoundly different,
                profoundly different, sometimes contradictory, always deceiving our expectations
                along with our unfortunate attempt to reduce them to something or to nothing.
                Natures disrupt both the human/non-human divide and the attempt to erase it in a
                peaceful liberal world that a Parliament of humans orand/and or things could govern.
                If we want to prevent the Anthropocene from becoming cosmophagic – —from eating,
                swallowing, destroying the non-human universe - —and in the end from becoming
                anthropophagic for lack of otherness, then we must leave a place for an updated
                concept of nature that could foster an anti-Anthropocenic
                politics.<hi rend="endnote_reference" xml:space="preserve"> </hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">End of the Ooutside, Eend of Nnature</hi></p>
            <p>Here is my opening question: what has motivated the radical reconsideration of any
                figure of otherworldliness or outer-worldliness? With such a question, the name of
                Friedrich Nietzsche comes to mind. In <hi rend="italic">Twilight of the Idols</hi>,
                he showed “how the ‘true world’ finally became a fable” (17). This Nietzschean
                detonation tends to extinguish not only the Christian religion but also Plato,
                insofar as Christianity, Nietzsche says in <hi rend="italic">Beyond Good and
                    Evil</hi>, was nothing more than a “Platonism for the people”
                (3).<hi rend="endnote_reference" xml:space="preserve"> </hi>If this destruction
                affects both God and the so-called platonic intelligible world, our investigation
                should, 1. on the one hand look for the historical, religious, and philosophical
                sources of the theme of the Death of God, and 2. on the other hand grasp the way in
                which many thinkers kept trying to avoid the ontological separation between the
                here-below and the beyond that Plato is said to have opened.:</p>
            <p>a. Regarding the topic of the Death of God, I will note that this is already present
                in many authors before Nietzsche. Jean Paul writes in 1796: “‘’Christ, is there no
                God?’ And he answered: ‘There is none!’,” (336). In fact, the death of God was only
                a nightmare, not a reality, for this early German Romantic; but this bad dream will
                haunt Romanticism -— as I will explain again at the end of my essay -— and beyond it
                all of German Idealism.;<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p>
                            “Formerly, the infinite grief existed historically in the formative
                            process of culture. It existed in the feeling that ‘“God Himself is
                            dead.’”” (G.  W.  F. Hegel, <hi rend="italic">Faith and Knowledge</hi>,
                            Albany, SUNY Press, 1977, 190)). I read the persistent nightmare of
                            God’s death as the “return of the repressed”: Christianity is founded on
                            the death of God as son, despite his resurrection and his supposed
                            return at the end of times.</p></note></hi></p>
            <p>b. The question of ontological separation would require an investigation that cannot
                be completed in this essay: I would have to show how Baruch Spinoza defines
                substance as “indivisible,” how Denis Diderot argues that everything is “sentient,”
                shifting without discontinuity from inertia to living bodies, and how Heraclitus,
                Epicurus, and Lucretius argue that everything flows.<hi rend="endnote_reference"

                and fifty150 years ago. Like Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Epicurus, Marx and Engels were
                thinkers of immanence who fought against transcendence (of God, of “Man,” of
                commodities and their fetishism, etc.) and against the divisions opened up by
                transcendence. However, unlike Democritus, Diderot, Spinoza, or Nietzsche, Marx and
                Engels did not anyno longer needed an ontology of nature to destroy the great
                divides and absolute transcendence. Instead of ontology, they appealed to economics:

                Is there anything here that is theoretically objectionable?</p>
            <p>Certainly not. The critique of the Great divides was necessary because these
                divisions were based on the concept of a transcendent Outside. This Outside, as I
                explained, was demolished by the attacks of Lucretius, Spinoza, Diderot, Nietzsche,
                and Marx. Besides, I find incredibly thoughtful and generous the way Donna Haraway
                thinks, the relations she produces between split domains of thought, and the
                capacity that she has to follow and tie different scientific, social, philosophical,
                political threads together. I still learn a lot from her, from her last
                theorizations about what she calls the “Chthulucene” (an Anthropocene conceptually
                reconfigured from a non-human, non-Wwestern, non-phallocentric perspective), and I

                But many contemporary thinkers belonging to the second post-structuralist wave drew
                these two very problematic conclusions.: First,: iIf there is no absolute Outside,
                then there is no outside at all. Let us listen to Michael Hardt’s and Antonio
                Negri’s voices, in <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi>: “One primary effect of
                globalization is the creation of a common world, a world that, for better or worse,
                we all share, a world that has no “‘outside”” ’” (vii).; Second: , iIf nature and
                society are indistinguishable, then nature does not exist any longer. “Thank God,
                nature is going to die,” Bruno Latour writes in <hi rend="italic">Politics of
                    Nature</hi> (25): “Tthere is no rupture” between the world of the so-called
                “things ‘as they are’” and human “‘representations” ’ of these things” (12). This
                lack of rupture was theorized by Ulrich Beck
                in<hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve"> Risk Society</hi> (the French edition of
                this book being prefaced by Latour).: Llike Marx and Engels, Beck speaks about “the
                end of the antithesis between nature and society”: nature is “a historical product,”
                a “second nature” (80-–81).</p>
            <p>What is wrong here? The fact that the theorists I have just quoted have melted two
                distinct concepts: cleavage (split, <hi rend="italic">Spaltung</hi>) and difference.
                Thinkers of the first post-structuralist wave, like Derrida, Deleuze, or Irigaray,
                were thinkers of difference: they fought against cleavages, that is to say,
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">absolute </hi>separations whose goal is to
                avoid any real relation between the considered terms. An <hi rend="italic"
                    >absolute</hi> difference is nothing but the denial of difference itself, the
                denial of the relation that a difference is itself able to produce, even through its
                repetition, as Deleuze argues in <anchor type="commentRangeStart" n="322"/><hi

                shape and to preserve, as I will explain in the next section, an identity, an
                imaginary “pure” identity, and not a difference. To shed some light on my last
                statement, let’s focus on philosopher and feminist Luce Irigaray’s 1977 influential
                book <hi rend="italic">This Sex Which is Not One</hi>, where she develops her
                radical approach to sexuality and male/female “difference.” The phallocentric
                cleavage poses, on the one hand, the only existing sex, the male One-sex, its
                identity and its norms (to be active, to not cry, to master nature, etc.), and on
                the other hand a sex “which is not one,” the female sex that is <hi rend="italic">un
                    sexe qui n’en est pas un</hi>, to re-establish the French original text and its
                main meaning: <hi rend="italic">this sex that is not a sex</hi>, that is to say,
                this sex that does not really <hi rend="italic"
                >exist</hi>.<hi rend="endnote_reference" xml:space="preserve"> </hi>In other words,
                the phallocentric cleavage produces the absolute gap between a (male) identity=1 and
                a (female) non-identity=0. In this respect, the fight against phallocentrism
                consists less in overcoming a Great divide – —between two (id)entities – —than in
                uncovering the Great annihilation of a difference (the female one) in favor of the
                only recognized identity (the male one).</p>
            <p>We see the same logics of annihilation in the way modernity sets the (non)relation
                between nature and culture/technology/human society: if we want to understand this
                (non)relation, that is to say, this cleavage, we have to begin our investigation not
                with Romanticism and its so-called idealization of nature (I will question this weak
                idea in the fourth section), but with the fact that nature was reduced, since the
                    seventeenth17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Centurycentury, to nothingness. It
                is because René Descartes at first said that nature is not a “deity” but a
                mathematizable area that we can use nature –— or the Earth –— at will, digitalizing,
                reprogramingreprogramming, and printing it in 3D:</p>
            <p> “</p>
            <p>By ‘Nature’ here, Descartes wrote in 1630’s, I do not mean some deity or other sort
                of imaginary power. Rather, I use the word to signify matter itself” (<anchor

            <p> Since nature is nothing by itself – —according to Descartes, but we could add

                first section -— and its anaturalist basis. In this modern world, only technologies,
                sciences, cultures, and human values are considered as real, active, and capable of
                giving an identity – —<hi rend="italic">their</hi> identity – —to the rest of the

                relation—quite the contrary. I argue that separation is the condition of possibility
                for relation. Separation precedes communication, an ontological statement that
                Romanticism exemplifies as I will show below. In this respect, I argue that
                exophobia - —the fear of the outside - —is an effect of a misunderstanding of what
                it means to connect, a misunderstanding that I attribute to the second wave of
                post-structuralism. It was believed that, in order to render relations possible, one
                had to ward off the outside; my argument is that in warding off the infinity of
                outsides, one renders relations impossible – —one merely overexposes everything to
                an oppressive light under which relations become irons. Let us develop this

                I propose is to insert a sort of retroactive bifurcation between the first and the
                second post-structuralist waves , in order to avoid the mere proliferation of
                theories – —like OOO – —that, under the cover of an ontological equality that erases
                the Great divides, maintains the social, political, and environmental inexistence
                that these dominant systems produce. In doing so, I will avoid the ontological

                Levi-Strauss, in order to justify rigid sexual identities, the prohibition of gay

                These thinkers, who participated in the building of a reactionary discourse that is
                nowadays well established in France, use the concept of a fixed sSymbolic oOrder in
                order to legitimate the worst reactionary splits (between, for example, the good
                symbolic-born parents and the bad natural ones). In order to avoid at once
                ontological indifferentiation and the morals of symbolic identities, I argue in
                favor of a field of existential differences that will be able to describe what links
                singularities without obliterating their separation, their reciprocal
                extraterritoriality. </p>

            <p>- 1. A a field is not a substance: asubstantial, invisible, “potential,” the field
                only reveals itself after bodies have emerged. Only existing beings can attest to
                the ontological field: before they exist, there is no difference between the field
                and nothingness, and in this sense –— against any sort of ontological turn trying to
                re-establish, in contemporary anthropology and philosophy, the preeminence of a
                metaphysics <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> uttering what should be said on
                cultures, politics, and aesthetics -— there is no possible ontology prior to any
                existentialism, understood as what gives priority to the emergence as such of
                entities. Yet when object-oriented philosopher Graham Harman argues, on the basis of
                his reading of Latour, that there are only “actants” and no “potential,” no
                “virtual,” no “pre-individual” reality, he actually erases the dynamic difference
                between existences and the ontological field that we need to recognize
                retrospectively retrospectively—– that is, only after the fact of existence - to
                    recognize.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="No Spacing">
                            Harman writes: “Recall that there is no such thing for Latour as a
                            ‘becoming’ that would exceed individual actors. Nor is there any
                            ‘virtuality’ that exceeds them, just as potentiality does not exceed
                            them. The much-discussed difference between potential and virtual, so
                            often wielded like a billy club in our time by Deleuzian hooligans, is
                            irrelevant here—both terms fail Latour’s standard for concreteness in
                            exactly the same way” (Graham Harman, <hi rend="italic">Prince of

                This erasure could lead to the idea of a “flat” immanent world that –, I argue -,
                denies existence and its depth of field. Flatness or depth: this is the crucial
                philosophical alternative of our time.;</p>
            <p>- 2.Second, Coming coming into existence is only possible through an internal
                separation leading to polarities (left/right, high/low, inside/outside, but also
                visible/invisible, light/dark, etc.) that are not initially splits, but rather
                constitute a depth of field that wherein a subject experiments with her or his
                reason or senses. In this regard, a subject can be defined as an instance of
                mediation, as a moment of communication, the last term signifying, à la Bataille,
                the excess through which polarities reveal their unfathomable difference.</p>

                straight lines, social norms, ethograms (that is to say, the inventory of all
                behaviors or actions exhibited by an animal), or thermodynamic equilibriums. InAt
                the beginning - of the universe, as of each thing, - was the clinamen. A clinamen is
                the opening onto an outside -— a break, an empty space, a non-functional element,
                all the existential spacings that can appear, for instance, in the form of a
                non-signifying signifier in a poem, in an act of political resistance, or in André
                Breton’s “amour fou,” etc. The outside is the mark of the singularity of each
                crucial experience, each notable artistic or political event, and, in the end, each
                existing being. Any ordinary life is the singular way through withwhich an existing
                being experiences her own depth of field.</p>
            <p>The outside also explains why philosophy is always disoriented, displaced by the
                contingency of the clinamen. For an existence-disoriented philosophy, there is no
                Outside; but there is an infinity of outsides, as innumerable as there are singular
                existences. Each outside opens itself inside each existing being, and this internal
                exteriority is the condition of possibility for relations. Existing beings can
                communicate thanks to their internal openness. Conversely, if immanence were
                compact, full, and substantial, there would be no gap, no separation between
                existing beings, and consequently no relations. Relations require separation – —an
                idea that Bataille kept repeating: we communicate, we really communicate not because
                we are connected, but first and foremost because we are “<anchor

For many contemporary thinkers who attempt to get rid of the concept of nature and to create an ecology without or against nature, Romanticism is the target. Let us take the example of contemporary thinker Timothy Morton who argues that, in our “ecological age,” “we are realizing that absolutely everything is absolutely connected to absolutely everything else” (“Ecology after Capitalism”EC, 47). Timothy Morton argues that nature is an “ideological construct”: “What if, finally, Nature as such, the idea of a radical outside to the social system, was a capitalist fantasy, even precisely </hi>

Second, I am not at all sure that the main strategy of romanticism was to turn nature into a transcendental principle. The fact, quoting Morton, that nature “wavers between the divine and the material,” between “essence” and “substance,” has to be understood not as a theoretical weakness or a dead end, as Morton thinks</hi>

                    encompassing these two extreme existential states. In order to highlight my
                    approach, I would like to focus on two figures of Romanticism: Victor Hugo, and

                    of a transcendent division, nature seems to be theorized by Hugo only on the
                    basis of a dual perspective. Can we imagine a Romanticism going beyond this
                    dualism? What might be a romantic pluralistic nature? This question is
                    especially important in the contemporary context of anthropologists who, aware
                    of the dangerous dead end of anaturalism, claim that, instead of getting rid of
                    nature, we should rather consider its multiplicity: I think here exemplarily to
                    Eduardo Viveiros de Castro who invented the term “multinaturalism,” which does
                    not mean a multiplicity of representations of nature, but rather multiple
                    natures as variation without a unity (65–-75). However, Rousseau’s philosophy
                    might be read as an earlier exemplification of Viveiros de Castro’s
                    multinaturalism, and I will use Rousseau’s approach toward nature to temper
                    Hugo’s excessive ontological polarizations. To understand this approach, it is
                    useful – —as a theoretical detour that will help us to identify Rousseau’s
                    originality - —to see first how Paul de Man saw Rousseau’s conception of nature.

He says that nature is “différente en un même lieu sous divers aspects” (nature is different in the same place under various aspects)”. (NH, 44). For Rousseau, contradiction is just one possibility amongst others and not the only determination of nature. Just before this paragraph, Rousseau actually describes a multiplicity of natures: mild nature, cultivated nature, and “un mélange étonnant de la nature sauvage et de la nature cultivée” (a surprising melding of wild nature and cultivated nature)” (NH, 44), )—the sort of inextricable naturecultures (– to use the concepts of Latour and Haraway) – that postmodern thinkers like to describe. But de Man does not quote this paragraph; he also does not mention the fact that this strange multiplicity of natures interrupts the Rousseau’s meditation: “Je voulais rêver, et j’en étais toujours détourné par quelque spectacle inattendu” (I wanted to dream, but I was always diverted by an unexpected spectacle)” (NH, 44). A spectacle or a “vrai théâtre” (a real drama)”, as Rousseau will says at the end of his description, occurs: when natures appear in their multiplicity , the spectacle becomingmes a sort of weird, natural, man-made scene. </hi>
