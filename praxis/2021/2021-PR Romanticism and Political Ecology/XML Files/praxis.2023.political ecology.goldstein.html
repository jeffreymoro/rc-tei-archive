               <h2><span class="head">Introduction: We Fight for Grass</span></h2>
               <p>What may be the first appearance of “political ecology” in print offers no distinct
                  definition or theorization. Yet Frank Thone’s little think piece entitled “We Fight
                  for Grass,” which appeared under that heading in the <span style="font-style:italic">Science News Letter</span> of January 5, 1935, does articulate a strange, age-old parable of colonial avarice
                  and climatic revenge. The topos long predates both the inauguration of the natural
                  science of “ecology” in the 1860s and its self-conscious politicization in the 1970s,
                  not to mention the splashy advent of a quite different sense of “political ecology”
                  in (post) humanistic theory by way of Jane Bennett’s 2010 monograph, <span style="font-style:italic">Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things</span>. Visions of what might be called “ecological retribution” — and their utopian counterpart,
                  “ecological jubilee” — were to be the subject of this essay, for the sake of ecocriticism
                  and Romantic “political ecology” avant la lettre, long before I stumbled upon a variant
                  here, at one minor, modern origin of the phrase. Yet its presence, I think, promotes
                  Thone’s much-dismissed “We Fight for Grass” into a revealing emblem for the ongoing
                  challenge of “political ecology” in the text-based disciplines and a concise introduction
                  to the present essay.</p>
               <p>In Thone’s 1935 iteration of “political ecology,” the fantasy of ecological retribution
                  arrives at the height of an unwieldy analogy that compares the incursions of Imperial
                  Japan in Outer Mongolia to “the Indian Fighting days of our own West” (14). While
                  “to be sure, there are differences,” Thone boils both conflicts down to an age-old
                  antagonism between settlers and nomads: native peoples who “fight for grass” — pasture
                  for their ruminant food sources — against the conquering plowshares of an “emergent
                  empire” (14). The terms of the analogy are thus technically mythic even before the
                  author actually compares Mongolian horsemen to “Centaurs” (14). The toil of tilling
                  the soil divides fallen life from Paradise in Judaeo-Christian theology and the Golden
                  Age from the rest in Greco-Roman cosmogony; Reformation theology and Enlightenment
                  stadial historicism redefined such declension as progress and ranked human societies
                  accordingly. None of these mythic backgrounds are incidental to the present inquiry.
                  But what matters most is the moral climax of “We Fight for Grass,” when Thone suddenly
                  pivots to the Dust Bowl then afflicting the North American prairies. His political
                  ecology casts this catastrophe as a modality of attenuated, indigenous revenge: <span class="quote">‘The Indians fought for grass. They lost. The plow broke sod farther and farther westward,
                     until in the mad, wheat-hungry years of the World War grasslands that never should
                     have been turned over at all were broken and put into grain. Then came drought, grass-hoppers,
                     dust storms; the Indians were in part avenged. Now we seek to replace the vanished
                     grass. (14)’</span> At a distance of 85 years, the ideologies in play make easy targets. Grasslands “turned
                  over” by an agentless “plow” elide their seizure through genocidal acts of “Indian
                  Removal” (juridical, military, and biopolitical) that the author will neither query
                  nor name. “We seek to replace the vanished grass,” Thone concludes, yet fail to imagine
                  reparations for the (putatively) “vanished” people, let alone grasp how the two projects
                  would be inseparable. Though a tone of regret replaces that of triumph, Thone’s grass-up,
                  ecological retelling of political conflict leaves the fatalist logic of Manifest Destiny
                  and its myth of the Vanishing Indian intact.</p>
               <p>Yet it is precisely this heady mix of ecological regret and ethnocultural unaccountability
                  that may make Thone’s New Deal “political ecology” a still-pertinent emblem for the
                  state of our art. Rewriting episodes of imperial conquest from the angle of the grass,
                  the effort prefigures now familiar forms of an ecologically motivated “nonhuman turn”
                  and its increasingly notorious political shortcomings when it comes to those Sylvia
                  Wynter names “Man’s human Others” (Wynter and Scott 174). Influential new materialist,
                  object-oriented, posthumanist, and Anthropocene theories have been charged justly
                  with “resounding silence” on matters of race and colonial history, above all by scholars
                  in Black and critical ethnic studies whose thought, by force rather than belated epiphany,
                  has proceeded in proximity to categories like animality, thing-hood and the land (Z.
                  I. Jackson 216; Karera, 34, 47). The elision of pertinent non-white, non-Northern
                  expertise marks the recent genealogy of “political ecology” as well. Giving the term
                  new life in <span style="font-style:italic">Vibrant Matter</span>, Bennett neglected to acknowledge the the full-fledged academic discipline that already
                  bore the same name. Centered in the study of the global South, Political Ecology was
                  born among mid-century decolonization struggles and infused the purportedly apolitical
                  natural science of ecology with the insights and methods of critical geography, Marxian
                  structural analysis, cultural ecology, peasant and agrarian studies, and systems and
                  dependency theory, frequently in open opposition to Third World development policies
                  and in open alliance with indigenous and peasant movements.<a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>What is the connection between eliding minoritized people and thought in some variants
                  of “political ecology” and the tendency to figure climate catastrophe as a modality
                  of their revenge? In what ways does “Anthropocene” discourse license again, and with
                  all scientific rigor, an understanding of the weather as payback for crimes of history?
                  Can such moralization constitute anything other than repressed theology? The theological
                  echoes in this essay's key terms, ecological "retribution" and "jubilee,” are meant
                  to welcome this latter question. The following contribution to the problem of “political
                  ecology” seeks to explore this ideologically fraught mode of merging, or submerging,
                  human histories of exploitation into the action of (also exploited) terrestrial elements
                  — including some improbably radical, utopian variations on the theme.</p>
               <p>Limits of time and training do not permit me to remedy the missed encounter between
                  the two materialist formations of “political ecology” sketched above — the one a critical
                  natural and social science, the other a posthumanist ontology of relation — by properly
                  interdisciplinary, hemispheric means. What I can do is plumb my European Romantic
                  archive for the site that prefigures this encounter with the greatest intensity, soliciting
                  a practice of reading informed by critical ecologies of race. This site is the highly
                  vulnerable, even confused conjuncture between materialist natural philosophy, Jacobin
                  internationalism, antislavery and commercial empire bodied forth as <span style="font-style:italic">botany</span> (c.f. “We Fight for Grass”) in Erasmus Darwin’s 1791 epic, <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation.</span> Exemplifying the wider logic of “ecological retribution” and “ecological jubilee”,
                  Darwin’s materialist epic and associated satire envision elements of exploited earth
                  <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> dispossessed people conspiring to avenge or overthrow regimes of colonization, expropriation,
                  and enslavement. I take seriously the way this problematic gesture contests, at a
                  stroke, the progress of empire, the rule of “natural law,” and normative expectations
                  about which kinds of terrestrial beings are capable of moral and political action.</p>
               <p>The first part of this essay locates the poetic and political roots of Jacobin ecological
                  jubilee in Golden Age pastoral, with that tradition's peculiar credulity regarding
                  the political partisanship of other-than-human natures. Darwin’s engagement with this
                  tradition is never finally dissociable from the English Enlightenment ideologies of
                  which his “Lunar Society” circle formed the liberal and dissenting vanguard, including
                  familiar and still fatal forms of techno-utopian optimism. Yet I attempt to isolate
                  that aspect of Darwin’s techno-pastoral that exceeded such mystifications and apologetics,
                  frightening his contemporaries with a vision of communal luxury that extended past
                  both the rights-bearing category of the citizen-subject and the purportedly universal
                  community of humanitarian sentiment, into the (supposedly) extra-political terrain
                  of the earth.<a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                        (2)
                        </sup></a></p>
               <p>Turning from ecological jubilee to ecological retribution, the second part of this
                  essay delves into the most geological and abolitionist canto of Darwin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Economy of Vegetation</span>, teasing out the overdetermined connections between racialized blackness and the
                  energetic humus of appropriated earth that Darwin’s poetry confusedly mobilizes. The
                  section focuses on Darwin’s repeated engagements with the period’s most iconic antislavery
                  icon, Josiah Wedgwood’s mass-produced cameo of a pleading slave in chains. I argue
                  that Darwin’s due diligence to the extractive sources of both industrial manufacture
                  and geological knowledge combines with his “relief poetics” — a compositional commitment
                  to bestowing figure on the material that usually passes for ground — to issue distinctly
                  anti-humanitarian and illiberal incitements to vengeance against slavery and colonization.
                  In the militant visions of ecological retribution that ensue by the close of this
                  “Earth Canto,” human and inhuman victims of this process collaborate <span style="font-style:italic">to inhume</span> the transatlantic traffic known as “The Inhuman Trade.”</p>
               <p>In contrast to the new materialist vogue for leveling hierarchies in the domain of
                  ontology, I argue, Darwin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Economy of Vegetation</span> belongs to the prehistory of ecological reckoning with social class, racial caste,
                  and colonial history — that is, with the differential distribution of harm, culpability,
                  resistance, and reparation that is the substance of ecological justice. Taken together,
                  the Jacobin and abolitionist dimensions of his materialist “economy of nature” illuminate,
                  in their intersection, both the ideological and the utopian horizons of a genuinely
                  <span style="font-style:italic">political </span>ecology.</p>

               <p>After several decades of restitution by historians of literature and science, Erasmus
                  Darwin’s encyclopedic oeuvre at last requires no general introduction in a venue such
                  as this.<a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  the doctor-poet’s prosody, philosophy, and politics, <span style="font-style:italic">The Botanic Garden</span> (1791) is now recognized quite simply as “the most popular and the most controversial
                  nature poem of the 1790s” (Bewell <span style="font-style:italic">Natures </span>53). The poem in fact comprises two epic, didactic parts, <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">The Loves of the Plants</span>.<a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  our ultimate focus is <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation</span>. Following the Lucretian trick of shifting focus from single, bounded, perceptible
                  bodies to the plural, subliminal, elemental media that pass through and between them,
                  <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation</span> treats botanical bodies — in so far as they metabolize water, light, earth, and air
                  — as privileged organs for the disclosure, the making phenomenal, of every chemical
                  and energetic interchange on the globe. In each of the poem’s four Cantos, the “Goddess
                  of Botany” summons one elemental constituency (Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, respectively),
                  and proceeds to chronicle the action of its members “as they may be supposed to affect
                  the growth of vegetables” (v).<a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  in this poem comes into view. As we can see from “the Argument” of any given Canto
                  (Figure 1), the poem leaps from chemical to mythological, natural philosophical, technological,
                  and even world-historical registers, compassing celebrations of the “Liberty of America;
                  of Ireland; of France” and denunciations of the slave trade and the Spanish colonial
                  “Destruction of Mexico” (57-58).</p>
               <p>My aim in this section is to take seriously (if no less comedically!) the pertinence
                  of revolutionary, anti-colonial, and abolitionist causes of an <span style="font-style:italic">Economy of Vegetation</span>, right up to the absurd, limit-possibility of politically partisan vegetables. Previous
                  scholars have shown that Darwin’s critics on the British right provide acute diagnoses
                  of the political and aesthetic threats his botany posed in the 1790s.<a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Bewell urged Romanticists to zero in on the tiny flower-seller (Figure 3) in the distant
                  middle ground of the image, just before the ad hominem caricatures of political figures
                  and their works fade into an anonymous popular mob. The flowers in the seller’s basket
                  are blossoming into a riot of bonnet rouges, and the little label beneath reads “Zoonomia”
                  — the title of Erasmus Darwin’s medical magnum opus on animal life (1794–96) — followed
                  by the perfectly incriminating subtitle, “Jacobin Plants.” “Zoonomia or Jacobin Plants”:
                  pithy proof that Darwin’s botany was perceived as a partisan endeavor in the 1790s
                  and of whose side it was on. Bewell moved outward from here to reevaluate botany in
                  the period as the locus of a “radical form of pastoral poetry”. Thanks to his reading

                  132). Darwin’s “flowery porn,” as Tristanne Connolly put it, outraged conservative
                  critics, not least because the pleasures of botanical reading were so frequently enjoyed
                  by women.<a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

                  connects to the adjective “Jacobin” that would seem to stand instead, in Gillray’s
                  cartoon and in the English conservative imagination, as a loose cipher for a somewhat
                  different social threat — that of popular, transnational Revolutionism. Visually,
                  the blooming Liberty Caps in Darwin’s basket amplify the raised arms and open mouths
                  of a threatening, jubilant mob.</p>
               <p>Let’s, then, draw out the cartoon’s stranger and more hilarious accusation that Darwinian
                  botany is a botany in which plants take a political side, sporting or sprouting Phyrigian
                  caps as partisans of liberty. Might other-than-human natures have moral and political
                  prowesses and preferences, in addition to, or even as a subset of, their <span style="font-style:italic">Loves</span>? Here it is as if, to quote that later, flower-powered, libidinal revolutionist,
                  Herbert Marcuse “Nature, too, awaits the Revolution” (74).<a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">

                  to something very like this thesis: not only flowers, but fish, fowl, reptiles, amphibians,
                  and other mammals swell the ranks of the revolutionary invasion. A metamorphic front
                  of half-human chimera (avian, simian, reptilian . . . asinine!) conveys the purportedly
                  degrading message that it is the animal in human beings that drives their transnationally
                  militant works and acts (in the guise of Jacobin “phil-anthropy”).</p>
               <p>We are supposed to laugh, of course, but also to be afraid. In the eyes of his critics,
                  it seems, Darwin and his crew of enthusiastic, polymathic, dissenting Enlightenment
                  savants — the Lunar Society, as they called themselves — represented a dangerous,
                  Francophilic form of socially Utopian naturalism that drew force and authority from
                  the wider, para-juridical domain of the earth. This position is clearly part — but
                  not, I think, a well-grasped part — of the long-term rise of “natural right” political
                  philosophy in general and of Jacobin “natural Republicanism” in particular (Edelstein
                  1–25). It is also clearly connected, as Devin Griffiths has recently argued, to Darwin’s
                  increasing notoriety as a theorist of biological evolution.<a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">

                  obvious attempt to clothe the “broad,” “brawny” butts of the Paris street in decorous
                  poetic pantaloons. “Attend,” calls the poem’s pseudo-Darwin to his sans-culottist
                  comrade, “While in Rhyme’s Galligaskins I enclose / The broad posteriors of thy brawny
                  prose” (B2).</p>
               <p>Like Gillray’s cartoon, <span style="font-style:italic">The Golden Age</span> parody singles out for special ridicule the theme of nonhuman natures collaborating
                  and rejoicing in the Revolution. “Skip, skip ye Mountains! Forests lend your Ears!,”
                  calls “Darwin (5).” For under the rule of “red-capt Liberty” and “fair Philosophy”
                  that the poem heralds, tongue-in-cheek, a two-fold revolution transpires (5, 4): while
                  the human sans-culottes level their social hierarchy “to the mean muck of low Equality,”
                  the curse of human labor relaxes, and other natures assert their own technicity (11).
                  Plants spontaneously metamorphose into luxurious foodstuffs and manufactures, much
                  to the delight of the rural and urban poor, who are left idle by the newfound productivity
                  of louche, transgressively animate Darwinian vegetables. In a return to the effortless
                  luxury of the mythic Golden Age, stock Georgic characters like the busy dairymaid
                  swiftly regress to lazily gathering “Rich Cream and Butter from [a] herd of Trees”
                  (10). By the climax of this part of the poem, plants have assumed the manufacture
                  of complex commodities and luxury goods: “Tallow Candles tip the modest Thorn, / Candles
                  of Wax the prouder Elm adorn!”; atop another grove, “Where leaves once grew, now periwigs
                  of Hair!” (7).</p>
               <p>The most obvious target of the parodist’s extravagant vegetable grotesques is a certain
                  form of techno-scientific hubris. Darwin, Beddoes, and their Lunar Society cohort
                  were at the forefront of the coal-, steam-, and expropriation-powered industrial modernization
                  of the English Midlands; at the dawn of an “Anthropocene” age frequently dated to
                  their precise generation and social set, they helped pioneer a now familiar and still
                  feckless variety of techno-utopian futurism. In places in <span style="font-style:italic">The Botanic Garden</span>, Darwin apostrophizes steam power, prophecies air travel, and projects geo-engineering
                  as a modality of climate control.<a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">

                  to the point of caricature, a different, though perhaps equally delusive and damaging,
                  form of techno-utopian ecology in Erasmus Darwin’s sans-culottist botanical poetry.
                  For beyond the epigraph in this instructive spoof, cessation of labor becomes its
                  crucial theme: pastoral <span style="font-style:italic">otium </span>is the key of freedom from toil, carrying with it release from the exigency to transform,
                  combat, coerce, or exchange other natures. What humans (specifically, the “frisky

                  that lays Royalty, Monarchy, Ministry, Bigotry, Slavery, and God “low” (12–14). What
                  other natures do, in the solidarity that the parodist sarcastically calls their “happiness”
                  and “triumph,” is pitch in to resolve the resultant crisis in production. Their generous,
                  generative metamorphoses realize and surpass that fundamental demand of the sans-culottes
                  — "Equality <span style="font-style:italic">and Bread</span>!” — which itself pushed past the domain of liberal political rights and into the
                  realm of “animal” need (Soboul 43–52; Simmons 1–12). <span style="font-style:italic">The Golden Age </span>epistle culminates in a materialist burlesque in which the people Burke famously characterized
                  as a “swinish multitude” party with an actual multitude of pigs (among other flora
                  and fauna), flourishing on uncoerced plenty and rejoicing in their general “<span style="font-style:italic">nudity of Breech!</span>” (15, 12)</p>
               <p>Sketched here in negative, unflattering caricature, then, would seem to be a vision
                  of not-merely-human “communal luxury” that, as an ecological ethos, would be deliciously,
                  improbably predicated on working <a class="note_back" href="#Note16" id="Note16_return"><sup class="super">

                  in their intensive transformation and domination of the (rest of the) natural world.
                  And rather than occasioning a reversion to wilderness or (ig)noble savagery, this
                  cessative ethos gives place to the ingenuity, artfulness, and technics of natures
                  not usually credited with such powers. Deriving the latter vision from Darwin requires
                  little hyperbole: <span style="font-style:italic">The Botanic Garden</span>, as we shall see, everywhere attributes technical and cultural ingenuity to flora,
                  in extension of their powers of erotic and physiological transformation. Belonging,

                  poetry, and belly-centric Land of Cockaigne folklore, the Lunar Society’s experimental
                  philosophy and poetry thus hazards the insane, intoxicating possibility that the supposedly
                  immutable “natural law” said to govern the non-human realm may be as fungible as our
                  “positive” and “civil” law. What if scarcity, competition, and toil were “necessities”
                  not of Nature but of liberal political economy, laws of a zero-sum system transposed
                  (and enforced) upon an Earth quite capable of behaving differently? If the rules of
                  the <span style="font-style:italic">oikos</span> were changed, do we really know what other natures would do? On what grounds do we
                  assume that moral, cultural, technical, and political capacity in nature actually
                  begin and end in those beings currently overrepresented as rights-bearing citizens
                  and subjects of moral sensibility? “Shout, shout, ye Meads! . . . ye Corn-fields,
                  raise your happy heads!” (15)</p>
               <p>Lest deriving this eco-utopian vision of multinatural jubilee from its derisive caricature
                  seem farfetched, consider that the apocryphal <span style="font-style:italic">Golden Age </span>epistle seemed so very like something Erasmus Darwin would write that he felt compelled
                  to publicly disavow authorship in the <span style="font-style:italic">Derby Mercury</span> (King-Hele 250). Though hardly a subtle piece of work, the anonymous parody persists
                  in “the odd distinction of having been read ‘straight,’” and it continues, to this
                  day, to be misattributed to Erasmus Darwin in some library catalogs and criticism
                  (Faubert 454; Reiman xii–ix; Priestman 199n12). Martin Priestman convincingly suggests
                  that an embarrassing similarity between anti-Jacobin parodies like <span style="font-style:italic">The Golden Age </span>and an epic that Darwin actually had underway in the late 1790s — a poem in which,
                  according to extant notes, “Liberty returns, and leads the golden age” under the aegis
                  of “mild Philosophy” and Nature in the Lucretian shape of <span style="font-style:italic">“Immortal Love!</span>” — may have motivated Darwin to abandon that genuine Golden Age project (Priestman
                  Chapt. 10). Satire and sincerity, original and parody, thrilling possibility and risible
                  absurdity blur so thoroughly in the reception of such utopian political ecology that
                  one begins to suspect that — as with the term <span style="font-style:italic">utopian</span> itself — the assumption of derogatory or aspirational connotations, the placement
                  of the line between vision and farce, reveals less about the text itself than about
                  a given reader's degree of attachment to the present order of things.</p>
               <p><span style="font-style:italic">The Golden Age </span>parody will not let readers forget there is classical precedent for all this. The

                  visionary naturalism is that Virgil’s <span style="font-style:italic">Eclogue </span>borrowed the stirring, Golden Age topos of an unforced, unstinting earth — “the fruitful
                  earth unforced bare . . . fruit abundantly and without stint” to mortals “free from
                  toil and grief — and cast this condition of uncoerced terrestrial luxury as subject
                  to political restitution (Hesiod 117–18, 113). An encomium to his patron Pollio, consul
                  at the time of composition, Virgil’s poem augurs the return of the Golden Age under
                  his stewardship, prophesying the birth of a divine ruler whose advent brings the very
                  earth to pour forth gifts of flowers, fruits, milk, and grain. The anonymous author
                  of <span style="font-style:italic">The Golden Age</span> satire of Darwin suggests that the Lunar Society cohort likewise expects the wholesale
                  “renovation of the world," albeit "under the benign influence of French Freedom” (5n).</p>
               <p>And here, in fact, is the first politico-ecological feature to mark the classical
                  Golden Age tradition associated, by the 1790s, with experimental utopianism and Jacobin
                  internationalism: the notion that plants and animals and winds and waters will participate
                  in a new political dispensation, altering the very face of the earth. On the horizon
                  of the faltering republic, Virgil’s fourth eclogue forecasts a form of theologico-political
                  expiation felt deep into the earth: an alteration that would “free the lands from
                  lasting fear" (Lee 57; Virgil 13–14).<a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">

                  harks back to an anarcho-communism of terrestrial elements: the earth (<span style="font-style:italic">humus</span>) “had been a common good, one all could share,” “just like the sunlight and the air”
                  (Mandelbaum 8; Ovid 1:135–36). Justice was immanent in such an earth, as we learn
                  when She flees it (in person of the goddess Astraea, 1:150); or which we knew already,
                  since everything and everyone moves “uncompelled” (<span style="font-style:italic">inmunis</span>) but righteously (Mandelbaum 6; Ovid 1:101). When Ovid writes that “the Age” — not
                  just its men — cultivated faith and rectitude of itself, without law, and without
                  judge or protector, he gathers persons, animals, plants, and planet together, in an
                  epoch of unforced generativity and righteousness (Ovid 1:89–90).<a class="note_back" href="#Note19" id="Note19_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Though their political valences differ diametrically, then, both the Ovidian and the
                  Virgilian strains of Golden Age myth share the vision of a nature that answers to
                  justice, rather than necessity. They also share in the enactment of a poetic reprieve
                  from the labor of coercion that is felt both by those who work the land and the land
                  that they work, together: “the soil will suffer hoes no more, nor vines the hook”
                  (non rastros patietur humus, non uinea falcem) (Lee 59; Virgil 40). Yet Virgil also
                  presses to the point of irony, perhaps to the point of transparent fantasy, the Golden
                  Age vision of spontaneous luxury and worklessness without privation. As the <span style="font-style:italic">Eclogue</span>’s landscape “spontaneously” overflows with goods that conform to aristocratic taste,
                  Virgil — and Darwin’s parodist after him — manages to underscore the eye-brow-raising
                  convenience for (certain) humans of that which the earth is said to give freely (<span style="font-style:italic">sponte sua</span>) in her golden mood.<a class="note_back" href="#Note20" id="Note20_return"><sup class="super">

                  where "nature" is poetically induced past fruiting and farming into textile manufacture
                  and manipulation, there is an emblem for the hubris of experimental philosophy and

                  freedom can appear to differ precious little from her forcible transformation: do
                  not other natures live to serve human desires in Golden Age ecology? Celebrating their
                  creative powers à la Darwin (like their “resilience,” in a contemporary idiom), may
                  be little more than an alibi for subjecting them to every serviceable transformation.<a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">

                  \ in so far as they would break the frame of the politics of nature that triumphed
                  in the interim, up to and including our normative sense of political ecology.</p>
               <p>The first feature concerns pastoral <span style="font-style:italic">adynata</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">impossibilia</span> — those “miraculous dislocations of natural law", like sheep that turn colors and
                  trees that grow wigs, that have been hallmarks of pastoral rhetoric since Theocritus
                  (Rosenmeyer 216). While these expressions are typically read as tropes for impossibility
                  itself, if not signs of divine intervention, they also effect, as I suggested above,
                  a provocative decoupling of the concept of nature from those of necessity and determination.
                  In such figures, nature ceases to play the role of indifferent background to human
                  suffering and triumph, or of the repetitive cycle from which the arrow of human history
                  breaks, or of the ironclad physical determination from which we wrest our uniquely
                  human moral freedom. Instead, other natures freely take part in the action in a manner
                  that cannot quite be explained away as anthropomorphism.<a class="note_back" href="#Note25" id="Note25_return"><sup class="super">

                  rather than their supposed necessity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the eco-utopian pastoral imaginary that I have traced through Darwin to
                  Virgil and Ovid’s Golden Ages manifests an unfamiliar, indeed anti-Promethean, form
                  of technophilia. Though present in Ovid’s self-cultivating grains, and, especially,
                  in Virgil’s “technicolor animals,” images of the spontaneous technicity of other natures
                  may reach their literary climax in Darwin’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Loves of the Plants</span>. There, Flax is cast as the “Inventress” of weaving, ably fashioning her own fibrous
                  body into a textile; the Carline Thistle plays the “fair Mechanic” whose far-floating
                  seeds precede the Montgolfier brothers in the “invention” of the hot air balloon,
                  and Papyra [papyrus] is credited with introducing semiotic systems into human cultures
                  (2:66–84, 7–66, 105–18). Darwin’s suspicious parodist reads such images of vegetable
                  ingenuity as covert allegories for the experimentalists’ own plans to manipulate plant
                  biology. But taken straight, Darwin’s notion of vegetable ingenuity emerges from a
                  thoroughgoing naturalist perspective that has ceased to respect the anthropo- and
                  androcentric distinction between the fruits of biological generation and the works
                  of technical genius.<a class="note_back" href="#Note27" id="Note27_return"><sup class="super">

                  from familiar technologies of domination, were it not for the copresence of the pastoral
                  insistence on leisure. Only the pause that the pastoral mode places on the workaday
                  world and the working day ensures that the visionary technics in evidence arise not
                  from increased human manipulation but, on the contrary, from giving space or leaving
                  room for other beings to take up, differently, the activity of transformation to which
                  some human societies have relentlessly subjected the other constituents of the earth.<a class="note_back" href="#Note29" id="Note29_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>Finally, this strange form of techno-pastoral utopianism permits a political ecology
                  to come into view that foregrounds the authentically political axis of freedom and
                  coercion, as opposed to the now common preoccupation with the ontological axis of
                  “human” and/versus “nonhuman” being. It is true that an open ontology — an ontology
                  that does not presume to dictate the capacities of various kinds of being in advance
                  and that does not invest in the human “exception” — is propitious, if not prerequisite,
                  for an ecological point of view. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that abolishing hierarchy
                  among categories of being accomplishes anybody’s political liberation. In fact, where
                  ontological leveling masquerades as <span style="font-style:italic">political</span> ecology achieved, it necessarily thwarts and mystifies the basic politicization of
                  ecology.<a class="note_back" href="#Note30" id="Note30_return"><sup class="super">
                        (30)
                        </sup></a> This is because matters of justice, exploitation, and repair in the realm of ecology
                  have never concerned the human and/versus the non-human; they have instead to do with
                  <span style="font-style:italic">certain </span>humans exploiting <span style="font-style:italic">certain</span>other human and nonhuman beings. An analytic grounded in ontological categories of
                  being has no means to grasp this asymmetrical and differential distribution of responsibility
                  and harm. In this context, parables of ecological jubilee acquire their peculiar utopian,
                  counter-ideological purchase. For, however distortedly, they begin by imagining not
                  ontological equivalency but an end to coercion. This, I would argue, is a genuinely
                  political gambit.</p>
               <p>How, then, does this peculiar eco-utopian imaginary we have been tracing comport with
                  the facts of racialization, colonization, and enslavement that enabled and fractured
                  “the human” and his rights during Darwin’s era of their revolutionary ascendancy and
                  counter-reaction? To explore this question, I turn, finally, to Darwin’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation</span>, focusing on the political ecology of slavery and abolition in that poem. Here, the
                  human and non-human “Others of Man” welcomed into the poem’s Jacobin ecology clearly
                  emerge as demanding and exacting allies, rather than, as I worried above, figures
                  of wish-fulfillment or alibis for the history of technological and colonial domination.
                  Darwin’s techniques of figuring earth and ground in <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy</span>, I argue, push past the interests of his own bustling, industrial bourgeois milieu
                  to issue in distinctly illiberal, anti-humanitarian incitements to multinatural vengeance
                  against chattel slavery and settler colonialism. In black counterpoint to our visions
                  of “ecological jubilee,” <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy</span>’s parables of “ecological retribution” attempt to join forces with the many expropriated
                  natures (human, nonhuman, dehumanized) forced into complicity by the transatlantic
                  slave trade on the eve of a militant <span style="font-style:italic">black</span> Jacobinism.</p>

               <p>If the class politics of Darwin’s visions of communal luxury were transparent enough
                  to make for easy parody, grasping the ecological intersection between race and class
                  in his work requires a subtler appreciation of the poet’s figurative and compositional
                  tactics. The brilliant Swiss-English graphic artist Henri Fuseli’s frontispiece to
                  the <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation</span> provides a perfect introduction (Figure 4). The frontispiece is supposed to represent
                  the Goddess of Botany, “Flora, attired by the Elements,” in correspondence with the
                  four, element-focused cantos through which the poem purports to tell the “physiology
                  of plants.” And indeed, Fuseli’s frontispiece provides an allegorical persona for
                  each element: Air, with her dashing butterfly hat; Fire, with a mirror to represent
                  the action of light; Water, with an appropriate vase; and Earth offering up a sampling
                  of her gorgeous vegetation. But who, then, is the extra, extra-earthy figure in the
                  very bottom of the frame, reaching up from the ground, as plants do, but with brawny
                  arms and a cap of weeds?</p>
               <p>As Fuseli intimates with this picture, supernumerary, subterranean figures like this
                  one proliferate in the second canto of <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation</span>, the one that is devoted to the elemental activity of “earth.” Here, the actions
                  of soils, earths, and minerals are at stake and all manner of quasi-animate beings,
                  from slumbering seeds to incipient statues, Bastilled prisoners, oppressed Irishmen,
                  and Africans in irons, linger in stony latency to release themselves, or be released,
                  from the ground. As the syntax of that last sentence suggests, the distribution of
                  agency and patience across figure and background is particularly fraught when it comes
                  to the canto’s joint task of personifying elements of earth — that is, figuring the
                  ground—and depicting the action of that and those who have been, in Darwin’s phrase,
                  “disanimated” or reduced to that terrestrial matrix. <a class="note_back" href="#Note31" id="Note31_return"><sup class="super">
                        (31)
                        </sup></a> The addressees of this Earth canto, elements of ground whom Darwin personifies as
                  “Gnomes,” bear this figural burden: they operate as a force of frankly de-carceral
                  natality, even as they do not quite cease to embody the inhuman, inanimate states
                  of imprisonment and (social) death in which certain beings are interred, not to mention
                  the stony walls, tombs, and prisons that contain them. In any case, their personification
                  means allowing the background to surge into relief, usually at the cost of someone
                  or something else (Canto 1, l.73). Reading Darwin’s Earth canto alongside anticolonial
                  ecologies of race allows us to see how the kitschy, elastic, preternatural figure
                  of the “Gnomes” — etymologically, <span style="font-style:italic">earth-men</span> — come to signify the condition of imposed identification and possible allegiance
                  between varieties of exploited ground and the racialized classes of beings conscripted
                  to work them. Such earths and such human beings are linked by economies of extraction
                  that Darwin cannot but trace in doing due diligence to the sites and sources of Enlightenment
                  geological and mineralogical knowledge.</p>
               <p>But before leaving Fuseli’s image, notice its ekphrastic function: as an engraving
                  of a (fictional) cameo, the frontispiece offers another indispensable clue to Darwin’s
                  mediatic art in <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy</span>. Critics, then and now, have agreed that Erasmus Darwin’s poetic style is highly
                  visual, rife with allegorical personifications and written “principally to the eye,”
                  as he put it himself, as if in proper neoclassical deference to poetry’s “sister art,”
                  painting (<span style="font-style:italic">ut pictura poeisis</span>) ("Loves" 48). But the meaning of writing “to the eye” changes in light of Darwin’s
                  understanding of the neurophysiology of sight. To address the eye with a printed word,
                  he explains in his biomedical masterwork, <span style="font-style:italic">Zoonomia</span>, is to trigger cascades of associated tactile experience, literally disposing the
                  reader’s nerves of touch to reconstitute the three-dimensional feel of the signified
                  with her own body (Goldstein “Nerve poetry”). Darwin’s allegories of reading thus
                  stress the kinesthetic reconstitution of poetic lines as three-dimensional forms:
                  William Cowper attested to the effect as “Meet[ing] the eye with a <span style="font-style:italic">boldness of projection</span> unattainable by any hand but that of a master” (qtd. in Packham 147). Given this
                  foundational semiotic relation between plastic plenitude and visual abstraction, it
                  is no wonder that specimens of relief sculpture (tomb decorations, architectural ornaments,
                  medallions, cameos, and coins) are privileged objects of Darwin’s poetic attention
                  in the <span style="font-style:italic">Botanic Garden</span>.<a class="note_back" href="#Note32" id="Note32_return"><sup class="super">

                  sculpted or molded in bas-relief were ready allegories for the kind of cognitive experience
                  Darwin hoped to produce through poetry by virtue of the physiology of reading.</p>
               <p>As the prototype for Darwin’s poetry, the minor art of bas-relief declines to produce
                  autonomous, free-standing forms, in favor of scenes in which form continually issues
                  from a material ground. Likewise, Darwin’s didactic figural strategies systematically
                  redistribute attention towards grounds and surroundings, refusing (or failing) to
                  extricate focal agents and objects from their contextual supports and dramatizing
                  the difficulty of selecting what to bring into relief. In addition to explaining much
                  readerly disorientation, Darwin’s dizzying commitment to foregrounding backgrounds
                  and magnifying the minor accounts for the most distinctive and obvious formal feature

                  and chattel slavery in the (Political) <span style="font-style:italic">Economy of Vegetation</span> comes to a head when Darwin embeds the most iconic token of the contemporary transatlantic
                  abolitionist movement in the middle of his Earth canto (Figure 5). This bas-relief
                  medallion first appears in the course of the canto’s survey of the formation of clays
                  and the manufacture of ceramics. Commissioned in 1787 as the seal for the London Committee
                  of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade (SEAST), the image was
                  a smash hit in abolitionist circles, especially after Darwin’s Lunar Society friend
                  and collaborator, the porcelain manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood, put it into mass production
                  as a wearable cameo at his state-of-the-art factory, Etruria (Figure 6). In an irony
                  apparently lost on contemporaries, the SEAST’s emblem against human commodification
                  became quite the fashionable commodity: the cameo was set in snuffboxes and worn in
                  bracelets and hairpins; like an earlier modern “meme,” it crossed the channel and
                  the Atlantic, switching genders, settings, and media in diverse adaptations (Clarkson
                  191–92; Hamilton 631–52). Responding to a batch he received from Wedgwood in a 1798
                  letter, Lunar Society foreign correspondent Benjamin Franklin described a marked alteration
                  in “the countenances” of those to whom he had distributed the cameo, attesting to
                  the medallion’s particular power as a plastic relief artifact: “I have seen such marks
                  of being affected by contemplating the figure of the supplicant (which is admirably
                  executed) that I am persuaded it may have an effect equal to that of the best written
                  pamphlet in procuring favour to those afflicted people” (qtd. in Hamilton 635).<a class="note_back" href="#Note35" id="Note35_return"><sup class="super">

                  Revolution, <span style="font-style:italic">The Daughter of Adoption</span>, John Thelwall put the logic of what Marcus Wood calls “the horrible gift of freedom”
                  in the mouth of a revered old white philanthropist in St. Domingue who surprises a
                  radical young friend by <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>celebrating the news that the islands’ slaves “have thrown off the yoke” (160). “‘And
                  is it possible, sir, after what I have heard from your lips,” the young man asks incredulously,
                  “that you can be averse to the emancipation of your sable brethren?’” The older man
                  replies: “I would die to emancipate them; but I cannot wish for their revolt” (160).
                  At the core of the white Englishman’s stated, humanitarian preference for the “slow”
                  but “certain” operation of “the sympathy of mankind,” then, Thelwall reveals a refusal
                  to relinquish that power to emancipate the slave in which the colonist’s supremacy
                  is staked at a value equal to that of his own life.</p>

               <p> Commenting on passages such as this some thirty years ago, Maureen McNeil shrewdly
                  observed that Darwin’s industrial poetry erased workers from the scene, instead attributing
                  labor “to ‘gnomes’ who magically perform the work required” (17, 19). Yet equipped
                  with mining and prospecting hammers, presiding over kilns, grinding pigments with
                  a “strong arm,” molding and glazing forms with a “charm’d . . . touch,” these “GNOMES”
                  certainly insinuate the working people at Wedgwood’s factory and across his far-flung
                  supply and production chain. Rather than eliminate human producers, Darwin’s incessant
                  apostrophes to earth-men in the plural encompass human laborers together with the
                  materials, tools, and machines they work, conjoining both sources of occulted value
                  that contribute to the animate “magic” of commodities. “Charm’d by your touch,” Darwin
                  repeats, the molten metals pour, harden, refine, take shape, and shine: “The bold
                  Cameo speaks, the soft Intaglio thinks.” What ultimately “speaks” and “thinks” through
                  the “bold Cameo” in this passage is an industrial supply and production chain, from
                  clay harvesting to mineral mining, chemical processing, and factory finishing. At
                  stake is a kind of proto-Marxist prosopopoeia that makes the commodity’s power an
                  indexical expression of the human labor and globally-sourced materials that went into
                  its production.<a class="note_back" href="#Note37" id="Note37_return"><sup class="super">
                        (37)
                        </sup></a> Darwin’s remediation makes clear that these occulted agencies (“GNOMES”) contribute
                  to the semiotic and affective efficacy of the cameo (its power to “speak,” “think,”
                  and “call the pearly drops from Pity’s eye, / Or stay Despair’s disanimating sigh”).
                  But as we will see, it is not quite clear that their meaning agrees with its milquetoast

               <p>On the earthen side of Darwin’s gnomic conjunction, a “new” materialist emphasis on
                  nonhuman agency — particularly on the kind of “natural technicity” I explored in the
                  previous section — is indeed emphatic in this section of <span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Vegetation</span>. Mineral processes of taking shape and appearing, including in splendid, highly wrought
                  forms, are literally and scientifically at stake in the Earth Canto, as in this passage
                  on the process by which acids transmute chalk into gemstones: </p>

               <p> In another context, to speak of stones weaving, folding, printing, and tinting their
                  garments — to write of stones molding spheres and cubes, painting landscapes, or “roll[ing]
                  their lucid eyes” back at the spectator — would constitute gross and indecent anthropomorphism.
                  But such figures operate differently in a poem that systematically traces the chemical
                  and geological production of spectacular mineral forms, revealing very real, yet very
                  nonhuman powers to fashion the kind of shapes that humans achieve largely through
                  artistry and technique. These mineral productions include not only rigorously geometrical
                  forms but also mimetic similitudes of other natures: rocks and gemstones that assume
                  the shape of wisps of hair, floral petals and spines, striated sands and tree rings,
                  land- and seascapes. The Earth canto also explores the mineral dimension of plant
                  and animal vitality: Darwin traces the blush of blood-borne iron beneath a rosy human
                  cheek and the “dark mould, white lime, and crumbling sands” that nourish and awaken
                  dormant seeds (542). By virtue of the recently discovered chemical processes of oxidation,
                  respiration, and photosynthesis traced in the poem, moreover, elements of earth actually
                  effectuate animation and its signs in the poem: breath, energy, growth, motion.</p>
               <p>Darwin’s scientific realism on the question of the relation between earthly materiality
                  and technical artistry, between geochemistry and biological animation, means that
                  his “GNOMES” certainly personify a sphere of suppressed identity between “earths”
                  and “men,” bodying forth at once the action of minerals in and on human beings and
                  of human beings in and on the earth. But as usual, summation at the level of human/nonhuman
                  ontology will occlude the political burden of the not-quite-, not-merely-human “gnomes”
                  in their pointed marginality and plural, collective action. Reading Darwin’s Earth
                  canto in its entirety fact helps mitigate the present tendency to mistake ontology
                  for political ecology that is writ large those theories of the “Anthropocene” that
                  urge the suppression of difference under the (negative) universal sign of human peril.<a class="note_back" href="#Note38" id="Note38_return"><sup class="super">

                        </sup></a> To repeat what ought to be obvious, at stake in the ecological predicament said to
                  have begun in Darwin’s generation is not a question of the relation between the anthropos
                  and the earth but of <span style="font-style:italic">certain</span> human societies exploiting certain other human societies <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the nonhuman beings that condition their existence. And it is in the latter side
                  of this asymmetrical relation — the human and nonhuman beings brought together as
                  expendable resources throughout the history of New World colonization and capitalization
                  — that the gnomic conjunction <span style="font-style:italic">earth-men</span> increasingly figures forth in Darwin’s poem. Such conjunctions are crucial to a political
                  ecology capable of recognizing historical reparations as intrinsic to any project
                  of ecological repair.</p>
               <p>From the perspective of critical geography, Kathryn Yusoff has suggestively sketched
                  the conjunction between (certain) earths and (certain) men at stake in the pre-history
                  of fossil capital and “Anthropocene” geology. The “coal-black” subjects of chattel
                  slavery and the earths subjected to fossil fuel extraction were forcibly conjoined,
                  she argues, by “blackness” as an “inhuman categorization” that marked those who bore
                  it as appropriable energy sources for colonial expansion and industrialization. To
                  foreground just one literal, metabolic example of the link between England’s industrialization
                  and its expanding colonial empire, West Indian plantation sugar and East Indian tea
                  fueled the “wage slaves” at the base of England’s new industrial economy, those soot-blackened
                  persons that populate both William Blake’s <span style="font-style:italic">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</span> and Darwin’s West Midlands region, known as the “Black Country.”<a class="note_back" href="#Note39" id="Note39_return"><sup class="super">
                        (39)
                        </sup></a> Yet Yusoff’s theory of “black inhumanist poetics,” like Monique Allewaert’s notion
                  of “parahuman” allegiance among the beings yoked together by plantation ecology/economy,
                  reveals not only histories of subjugation but also illicit practices of “freedom<span style="font-style:italic">in </span>the earth” unleashed when expropriated subjects of “inhuman categorization” tip their
                  compulsory intimacy with the land into strategic alliance and multinatural insurgency
                  (Yusoff xii, 15; Allewaert 7).<a class="note_back" href="#Note40" id="Note40_return"><sup class="super">
                        (40)
                        </sup></a> When Yusoff suggests that early American black inhumanist artistry can attest to
                  “a gravitational force so extravagant, it defies gravity” (100), we can perceive the
                  elective affinity between the long history of Afro-futurism and the eco-utopian “suspensions
                  of natural law” this essay has traced by way of pastoral (100). At stake is a form
                  of multinatural allegiance that upends not only positive laws but also the natural
                  laws taken for their necessary ground.</p>
               <p>Written from the contradictory heart of a dissenting, abolitionist Enlightenment centered
                  in England’s industrializing Midlands, Darwin’s poetry ultimately manages to limn
                  and solicit such insurgent potential within the differentially “inhuman” terrestrial
                  collectivities that it apostrophizes without being able to activate or control. Though
                  critics from the <span style="font-style:italic">Anti-Jacobin </span>forward have mocked the topical miscellany character of Darwin’s poem, there is a
                  logic to the poem’s movement in the Earth canto, and it is frankly and increasingly
                  - anti-colonial. In fact, Darwin traces, with subtle but intensifying condemnation,
                  the very trajectory mapped by Yusoff’s “inhuman geography,” the geo-logic that unites
                  the histories of fossil capital with that of colonial slavery.</p>
               <p>Here, in brief, is that sequence of movements. From industrial-scale cameo-production
                  in Wedgewood’s factory, Darwin next surveys the nearby fields of “sable COAL,” pointedly
                  touching on the dark distillates of “fossil oil”: “pitchy” Naptha, and Jet, eponymously
                  black (349, 351–52). He gives particular attention to Amber, a petroleum sublimate
                  whose electrical properties, in Darwin’s lithic retelling, galvanize the American
                  and French Revolutions (“man electrified man” [368]) through the person of Benjamin
                  Franklin only to stumble on the long colonial history of the Americas and, again,
                  the present reality of black enslavement (353–94). In such sequencing, the volatile
                  blackness of fossil earth forms a link between the poem’s repeated confrontations
                  with chattel slavery in an Age of Revolution, as if the racialized conjunction between
                  usable earth and useable people held the key to grasping the <span style="font-style:italic">non</span>contradiction between the victory of the Rights of Man and an ongoing “inhuman trade.”</p>
               <p>Darwin builds to a second engagement with Wedgwood’s medallion by castigating his
                  countrymen as successors to the Spanish colonial profiteers who “slaughter’d half

               <p> The closing anti-slavery exhortation, paraphrasing the Wedgwood cameo’s scene and
                  motto, has the ring of a sentimental set piece: an appeal to universal brotherhood
                  keyed to the supposed humanitarian impulse of a British readership.</p>
               <p>But the passage also stages a limit to this fashionable, consumable form of speaking
                  and feeling for the enslaved person. There is more to say, it seems, but “sorrow”
                  — whether the enslaved person's or the poet’s, in his overweening sympathy — “choaks
                  the rest.” And here the poem itself emphatically “chokes” on a kind of grievance not
                  so easily produced and consumed: the lines sputter apart in a flurry of dashes, chiasmi,
                  and an awkward enjambment that together shatter Darwin’s highly regular meter and
                  end-stopped lineation. At this breaking point, the materialist nature poem capitulates
                  into a kind of curse or prayer (the language is biblical) that radicalizes Darwin’s
                  overall poetics of deflecting attention towards the background. Calling on the elemental
                  milieu for relief - “AIR! bear to heaven upon they azure flood / Their innocent cries!
                  — EARTH! cover not their blood!”<span style="font-style:italic">—</span>the speaker cedes to these elemental media that quintessential artistic power of lifting
                  something up for notice or preservation. Now the air is to bear up the slaves’ protest,
                  the earth to ensure that their wrongly-spilled blood continues to surface. In the
                  absence of a divine Book of Judgment, the vast material and semiotic re-combinatory
                  that Darwin scientifically believes the globe to be is called upon to retain the evidence
                  of the damage, to amplify the smothered voices, to enact retribution or reparation.
                  This scene of natural justice seems to me the moral counterpart of the joyous multi-natural
                  jubilee that tore hierarchies to the (fertile) ground.</p>
               <p>If this were a canonical Romantic lyric poem, if it operated according to good negative
                  aesthetic principles, it would probably stop here, at the threshold that marks the
                  unsayable, even sublime, alterity of the Other’s suffering. But this poem is didactic,
                  scholarly, thorough. And it is after material retribution. Having diligently followed
                  the minerals, so to speak, through that zig-zag, transatlantic course that connects
                  the precious metal mines of Spanish colonial Mexico and Peru (which first fueled the
                  demand for enslaved African labor) — home to the coalfields of the English Midlands
                  (whose incipient industrial working classes are fueled by West Indian sugar) — across
                  the channel to revolutionary France (about to be galvanized by insurrection in Saint-Domingue),
                  Darwin’s “GNOMES” have picked up a racialized and explicitly militant charge: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">When Heaven’s dread justice smites in crimes o’ergrown</div>
                     <div class="l">The blood-nursed Tyrant on his purple throne, </div>
                     <div class="l">GNOMES! YOUR bold forms unnumber’d arms outstretch,</div>

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> And indeed, Darwin finishes out the canto by seeking evidence of what I called, at
                  the outset “ecological retribution” — that is, he sifts through his vast natural historical
                  archive for signs of elemental forces departing from the moral indifference usually
                  presumed to be their law.</p>
               <p>What emerges across the canto’s remaining episodes is a revisionist natural history
                  in which terrestrial elements conspire with racialized subjects to reverse and avenge
                  the progress of empire. Darwin reprises the ancient story of the Persian general Cambyses
                  II, who attempted to “subdue Ethopia,” only to have his armies subsumed by burning
                  sandstorms in the deserts of Northeast Africa: “wave after wave the driving desert
                  swims, / Bursts over their heads, and <span style="font-style:italic">inhumes</span> the struggling limbs” (435n, 489–90; emphasis added).<a class="note_back" href="#Note41" id="Note41_return"><sup class="super">
                        (41)
                        </sup></a> In this retelling, what seems like natural disaster is fostered by the “vindictive
                  hands” of the canto’s ever-present “Gnomes” — those half-human, half-earthen collectivities
                  that have changed over the course of the canto from solicitous minsters of the poem’s
                  every topical whim to militant, “resistless” agents of political violence (460, 487).
                  Their “infuriate surge” inhumes the invaders in “one great earthy Ocean” (487, 494).
                  Night then “bow[s] his Ethiop brow,” as if to sanctify the action, before the poem
                  turns to celebrate the “Afric Warrior,” Hannibal, to whom the very Alps yielded passage,
                  that he might “sh[ake] the rising empire of the world” (495, 529–41). Implicitly over
                  the course of this movement, Darwin has threatened that the earth will <span style="font-style:italic">inhume</span> that is, smother with earth, the "inhuman trade" in which his own well-being is implicated
                  and which gives the lie to the contemporary pretenses at universal humanism and humanitarian
                  sentimentalism alike.</p>
               <p>Are such dark pastoral <span style="font-style:italic">adynata</span>, no less than the Golden, utopian ones — for in both cases, other-than-human beings
                  suspend the laws of nature by taking a moral or political side — simply preposterous
                  and ironic, <span style="font-style:italic">impossibilia </span>connoting impossibility itself? Are the twinned, utopian poles of multinatural vengeance
                  and multinatural jubilee anything other than “bad faith” in the presumptively materialist
                  context of Darwin’s poem — examples of the eschatology for atheists that Steven Goldsmith
                  has detected in much new materialist thought or of unchallenging recourse to a common
                  form of Providentialism, in which the elements are once again instruments of a just
                  God? ("Almost Gone" 417) Maybe. Yet in the present context of global climate destabilization,
                  it feels difficult not to read the destructive behavior of the elements as commentary
                  on the history of human production and consumption as well as to recognize that the
                  Holocene regularities we have known have never been as immutable as “natural law.”
                  Moreover, and more to the point of Darwin’s groping attempts at a natural philosophy
                  and poetics of abolition, some Black Studies scholars’ critiques of mainstream Anthropocene
                  and new materialist theory advocate a similar form of attention to the poetic conjuncture
                  between other-than-human beings and human subjects of dehumanization — between what
                  is called “nature” and those “genres of being human” rendered illegible by one ethno-class’s
                  over-representation <span style="font-style:italic">as </span>Man (Wynter, "Re-Enchantment" 183, 186; "Unsettling" 273, 281, 316-18, 331).</p>
               <p>Zakiyyah Iman Jackson observes that because the racialization of some expressions
                  of humanity as insufficiently human structures the very field of <span style="font-style:italic">non</span>-human being for modern Western metaphysics, attempts to move “<span style="font-style:italic">beyond</span> the human” without confronting race as intrinsic to the matter at hand cannot but
                  perpetuate humanism’s historical ignorance and silence regarding black critiques and
                  praxes — not least those “irreverent to the normative production of ‘the human’” all
                  along (216). It ought to go without saying that other-than-white thought and practice,
                  early and late, has a good deal to teach Anthropocene perpetrators about comporting
                  otherwise with other-than-human beings. Yet although the precedence and brilliance
                  of minoritized thought on this score frequently goes unacknowledged, the inherence
                  of racialization in the actual and theoretical territory of ecological concern for
                  other-than-human beings is not optional: “terrestrial movement toward the nonhuman
                  is simultaneously movement toward blackness, whether blackness is embraced or not”
                  (Z. I. Jackson 217).</p>
               <p>By turning so incessantly to the ground in his <span style="font-style:italic">Economy of Vegetation</span>, has Darwin found a way of registering — the threat and promise of a kind of terrestrial
                  justice meted out by and for subjects scarcely discernible therefrom — sustaining,
                  and threatening his gorgeous <span style="font-style:italic">Botanic Garden</span> with its inhuman, inhuming power? Not so improbably, perhaps, when the glaring fact
                  of the “inhuman trade” revealed to anyone who cared to see that the other-than-human
                  realm was rife with human being uncounted as such. For a natural philosopher and poet
                  such as Erasmus Darwin, moreover, such dispossessed subjects shared space with genres
                  of plant, animal, and mineral being whose capacity for meaning-making and historical
                  transformation was likewise undreamt and underestimated in mainstream metaphysics.</p>
               <p>I hope to have suggested that, issuing from deep within the culture of the perpetrators,
                  the doggedly terrestrial movement of Erasmus Darwin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Botanic Garden </span>cannot but express the historical, epistemological, metabolic, and metonymic associations
                  between the earth’s energetic darkness and that of its (literally) denigrated subjects.
                  But more than this: the poetics draws this racialized dimension of the ground into
                  relief, apostrophizing the human humus in such a way as to hail the retributive and
                  reparative ingenuity of this association without enfolding it in the discourse of
                  Man. Darwin’s awkward, impure anti-colonialism appeals not to the wrath and rapture
                  of God but to that of the <span style="font-style:italic">interred</span>, those scarcely distinguishable from the ground and thereby able to partake, for
                  better or for worse, of its more-than-human power. Who knows what other natures, in
                  their freedom, might do, were we to cease foreclosing that possibility, by force and
                  by philosophy?</p>

               term “libertine botany” from Meeker and Szabari, who deftly theorize an early modern
               modality of botanical erotics that treats plant life as “animated by desire yet witho
               ut interiority,” capable of multiplying affect, animation, and pleasure across different
               kind of material bodies—rather than subjecting plants to an Enlightenment logic of
               analogy that constrains them to model human sexuality or subjectivity (479–80). Darwin’s
               <span style="font-style:italic">Loves of the Plants</span> occupies an ambivalent place in this brilliant analysis, evincing at once a profoundly
               libertine “affective involvement in animated matter,” driven by plants’ ability to
               “engender the technologies that allow us to be affected by them,” and a tendency to
               foreclose such possibilities through the anthropocentric conceit of plant “marriage”
               (485–86).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Griffiths has persuasively argued that the intensifying vitriol (and satirical assault)
               against Darwin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Botanic Garden</span> in the later 1790s had much to do with the poems’ reappraisal through the prism of
               his later, biomedical masterwork <span style="font-style:italic">Zoonomia </span>(1794–96), which advanced an overtly evolutionary theory of organic life. In hindsight,
               Griffiths argues, the <span style="font-style:italic">Botanic Garden</span> was reread as a threatening “evolutionary epic”. On this reading, the metamorphic,
               multispecies advance of Gillray’s “New Morality” primarily represents (conservative
               skepticism of) an all-encompassing, progressive theory of evolution (79–80), rather
               than his politics of revolution. Indeed, Griffith ultimately concurs with such critics
               that Darwin “powerfully confused biological development with social progress” (80),
               arguing that his epic evolutionism foundered on an inability to discover a “less teleological”
               historicism that could “admit diversification, uncertainty, and the contingency of
               change” (55): <span class="quote">‘In its implicit addresses to an audience that comprises not merely all of humanity,
                  but all of nature, the <span style="font-style:italic">Botanic Garden</span> gestures toward a unitary history without granularity or uncertainty. It is a fatal
                  problem, in so far as it leaves the poem unable to address the most important event
                  of its day. Despite Darwin’s noted advocacy, and the most suspicious readings of Canning,
                  Frere, and others, the French Revolution finds no place in the poem, even as the revolution
                  reflects the poem’s guiding problem: whether order emerges from freedom. (80)’</span> In the context of Griffith’s serious and important new reading, it is puzzling that
               this final assertion is, frankly, false. <span style="font-style:italic">The Botanic Garden </span>in fact contains a famous and immediately influential passage on the French Revolution
               (<span style="font-style:italic">Economy of Vegetation</span>, Canto 2, ll.377–94), and the poem’s notoriously willy-nilly (far from “teleological”)
               incorporation of topical events is precisely what must be explained (see Packham,
               n13, below). Darwin’s sense of natural and social history is, moreover, “granular”
               and “contingent” in an a technical, neo-Lucretian sense, rigorously theorizing the
               connection between natural and cultural pattern-formation through a sense of “habit”
               that extends deep into nonhuman being (Goldstein, “Nerve Poetry” #). Perhaps Griffith’s
               criticism was meant for Darwin’s later epic, <span style="font-style:italic">The Temple of Nature</span> (1803), rather than <span style="font-style:italic">The Botanic Garden</span>? It would then need to contend with Martin Priestman’s work on the political and
               social arguments contained in that poem’s suppressed outline, <span style="font-style:italic">The Progress of Society</span>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">“Multinaturalism” comes from the Amerindian anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro’s
               studies of Indigenous American cosmological perspectivalism in its difference from
               modern Western multiculturalism. While multiculturalism presumes “the unity of nature
               and the plurality of cultures,” or many partial representations of one natural reality
               external to representation, Amerindian perspectivalism supposes “one ‘culture,’ multiple
               ‘natures,’” wherein radically different beings have in common the figure that “one
               sees of oneself when one says ‘I’” (58–60). I import the term not in its full anthropological
               specificity but rather to emphasize a commitment to natures, plural, and the effects
               of such pluralization. It seems to me that in the radical pastoral perspective under
               discussion, nature is no guarantor of unity or lawfulness, and yet attributes of mental/moral
               culture usually reserved for human subjects are presumed throughout. Bewell separately
               coins the term “multi-naturalism” in <span style="font-style:italic">Natures in Translation</span> to denote a modern, “cosmopolitan” sense of “nature” that is no longer bound to place:
               the nature discoverable in botanic gardens was “composed of strangers, of immigrants,
               of foreign plants that have traveled from far across the globe” whose diversity represents
               the reach and interests of British commercial empire (74, 79). “Multinaturalism” in
               this sense thus operates as analogue and corollary (rather than inversion) of modern
               Western “multiculturalism.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">The <span style="font-style:italic">Epistle </span>was published by the loyalist press of Francis and Charles Rivington, founders of
               the periodical <span style="font-style:italic">British Critic</span>; as there are no line numbers, I give page number citations. On Beddoes, his Lunar
               and Romantic relations, and the politics and afterlives of his experimentalism, see
               Mike Jay, who discusses the <span style="font-style:italic">Epistle </span>and its effects at 108–9. And compare Packham’s discussion of the <span style="font-style:italic">Epistle </span>and its critical reception (159–62). In a convincing counterpoint to Griffiths’ argument
               about Darwin’s unitary “teleology,” Packham emphasizes how conservative satires of
               Erasmus Darwin’s work in fact stressed its aleatory qualities. Caricaturing the “fundamental
               failure of any system of literary or intellectual order or hierarchy” in his poems,
               such critics effectively indicted the “chaos” of democratic politics with the same
               brush (166–67). Their reinvestment in literary decorum, Packham shows, was pitched
               against practices of creative compilation characteristic of the radical journals friendlier
               to Darwin’s poetry (169–71).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               thinking than the parody lets on. The excerpted question comes at the end of an anything-but-fantastical
               passage on the healthful and useful properties of existing botanical butters. Beddoes
               wants to know whether some such plant could be bred and cultivated in England, and,
               in a question of ongoing ecological import, whether a plant-based diet might better
               and more efficiently nourish the British populace. In fact, in general, his <span style="font-style:italic">Observations</span>’ sense of how science could alleviate social misery has less to do with “techno-fixes”—the
               hallmark of which is to avoid or cut through the messy realm of political contestation—than
               with the social reorganization of science that Revolution must entail. He literally

               obviating the need to dye their wool or skins (see n. 27 below). In Virgil’s “technicolor”
               animal skins (Rosenmeyer 217), the later parodist of Erasmus Darwin finds his mark:
               where “nature” is poetically induced past fruiting and farming into textile manufacture
               and manipulation, there is an emblem for the hubris of experimental philosophy and
               textual artistry at the dawn of the Industrial Age. (<span style="font-style:italic">The Golden Age</span> both adapts these lines and provides the Latin in a footnote to make sure no one
               misses the reference [5, 5n]).The parodist clearly sees a distinction without a difference
               between trying to intervene technically in plant fertility (to “regulat[e] the vegetable
               functions”) and the Golden Age vision of their spontaneous technicity that he summons
               to ridicule that project (#). The latter is ideological cover for the former, and
               both instantiate what <span style="font-style:italic">Anti-Jacobin </span>satirists on the British right would soon distill as the core Darwinian/Jacobin fallacy:
               “Whatever is, is wrong” (a perversion of the quiescent motto of that responsible couplet

               least constituents the power to “break the bonds of fate,” lest nothing different
               would or could ever arise, or have arisen, in the cosmos. Since this tradition equates
               that which is familiarly called “chance” in the realm of physics with that which is
               called “freedom” in the realm of ethics, it carves out a broad space for moral, cultural,

               and fiction, but between spontaneity and coercion. In Virgil’s Latin, in fact, nature

         <div class="note" id="Note36"><span class="noteLabel">36. </span><span class="noteBody">In Marcus Wood’s analysis, this paradigm of emancipation tees up an ethos of white
               British self-congratulation for the eventual abolition of the trade in 1807 that persisted
               well into the bicentennial celebrations of 2007, which failed to commemorate, for
               instance, the fact that slaveholders and not slaves were financially compensated for
               their “loss.” Without disputing this overall analysis, Hamilton has shown that the
               visual rhetoric of the kneeling slave was somewhat more nuanced, alluding to the heroic
               endurance and (potentially threatening) strength of Hercules. I would also note that
               Darwin’s own, neurophysiological theory of the operation of sympathetic mimesis through
               various perceptual media suggests that such a complex object’s text and sculptured
               image may not have acted in concert on the body of a person who simultaneously sees,
               reads, and holds it. True, the motto “Am I Not A Man and A Brother?” projects its
               <span style="font-style:italic">reader</span> as the addressee and adjudicator of this rhetorical question, empowered to grant
               or withhold humanity and kinship from the “imploring” slave. But because the bas-relief
               pictures the slave in profile, it positions its viewer as witness, instead, to a scene
               in which the slave beseeches someone else. This position of complicit remove was well-keyed
               to the English mainland situation, in which citizens could (and frequently did) congratulate
               themselves on the effective illegality of slavery on their soil, while profiting magnificently
               from the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Less suspiciously read, this effect correlates
               with Menely’s keen observation that humanitarian abolitionist poetics extend the scope
               of existing sympathetic identification where “the collective addressee witnesses not
               only the suffering slave but its own witnessing of the slave’s suffering” (65). Finally,
               Darwin’s understanding of ideation as bodily mimicry of the object by the senses,
               particularly in the case of touch, suggests that the palpable medallion may not only
               constrain the agency of the depicted slave but also bring the perceiver to his or
               her (virtual) knees, forcing their nerves to rehearse like attitudes of humiliation.
