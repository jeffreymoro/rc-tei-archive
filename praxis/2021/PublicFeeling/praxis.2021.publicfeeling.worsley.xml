                    In his abolitionist poem <title level="a">The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave 
                        Trade</title> (1799), Robert Southey ventriloquizes the story of a sailor who has 
                    murdered an enslaved woman onboard a “Guineaman.” Southey explains in a note to the poem 
                    that the sailor’s confession is a true story, which he wishes to make “as public as possible.” 
                    At the same time, however, Southey leaves many subtle clues that he is also imitating Samuel 
                    Taylor Coleridge’s ballad, “The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere” (1798). As he draws out the 
                    possibility that Coleridge’s mariner’s guilt is an allegory for the guilt involved in the 
                    Atlantic trade, Southey presses on the “public” uses the ballad form can be put to. A 
                    comparison between these poems therefore offers a case study for broader questions about 
                    the ethics of representation in abolitionist ballads designed to capture public feeling.</p>

            <p>In <title level="a">The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade</title>
                (1799), Robert Southey tells the story of a dissenting minister in Bristol who hears
                the confession of a sailor who has murdered an unnamed enslaved woman aboard a ship.
                The sequence of events that the poem narrates begins when the enslaved woman
                protests her subjugation by refusing her food. The captain of the ship orders the
                sailor to whip the woman in order to make her eat, but she continues to refuse food.
                The woman subsequently suffers torture so horrific that she dies from her wounds the
                following day. As the poem begins, the minister finds the sailor praying alone in a
                hovel. Although the sailor insists that the murder was unintentional, he registers his guilt
                in his descriptions of the way that the image of the dying woman follows him
                everywhere he goes. Finally, he begs the dissenting minister for
                help: “O give me comfort if you can— / Oh tell me where to fly / And bid me hope, if
                there be hope, / For one so lost as I” (lines 113–6).<note place="foot" resp="author"> All references to <title level="a">The Sailor</title>
                            are from the 1799 version of Southey’s poem, reprinted in <title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works, 1793–1810</title>, unless otherwise stated. As this edition
                            notes, <title level="a">The Sailor</title> was first published in <title level="m">Poems</title>
                            (1799), extensively revised for
                            <title level="m">Minor Poems</title> (1815, 1823),
                            and also included in
                            <title level="m">Poetical Works</title> (1837)
                            (288).</note> In the earliest version of the poem, the minister
                responds by encouraging the sailor to flee the hovel and instead go to find a church
                in which to pray for his sins. In the later versions, Southey has the minister join
                the sailor in prayer in the hovel and enjoins others to do the same.</p>
            <p>Implicit in this abolitionist narrative is a theory of
                how one individual's guilt might be converted into a public feeling, and how this, in turn, might inspire political action—alongside a series of ethical
                questions about what it means to use representations of the suffering of enslaved
                people in order to incite such feeling. Presumably, Southey believes that
                confronting people with this murder scene and its aftermath might convince them to
                adopt the abolitionist cause. Yet the ethics of Southey’s decision to use this story
                for abolitionist ends are deeply riven, since Southey himself, like the sailor,
                lacks empathy for the enslaved woman he represents. Not only does Southey refuse to grant
                her the dignity of a name; he also dehumanizes her when he instrumentalizes her pain for the benefit of his abolitionist audience. The abolitionist moral relies on the idea that
                forgiveness is still possible, not only for the sailor, but for British society as a
                whole—but this happens at the expense of the enslaved woman, who is not allowed any
                space to tell her own story. Marcus Wood has argued that <title level="a">The Sailor</title> is a “truly
                woeful ballad in every sense of the word . . . in which the slave inevitably emerges
                not as a suffering human but as a catalyst for the sailor ’s suffering” (201–2). By
                choosing to speak from the perspective of the sailor, rather than from the point of
                view of his victim, Southey capitulates to the biases of his majority-white
                audience.</p>
            <p>The complications surrounding Southey’s positionality in
                relation to this story multiply, however, when one realizes that this poem has been
                written in dialogue with Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s ballad, <title level="a">The Rime of the Ancyent
                Marinere, in Seven Parts</title> (1798).<note place="foot" resp="author"> All references to <title level="a">The Rime</title>
                            are from the 1798 edition of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>
                            in <title level="m">Coleridge’s Poetry and Prose</title>.</note>
                At first glance, Southey’s graphic narration of the murder of an enslaved woman
                appears to have very little in common with Coleridge’s poem: a supernatural tale
                that depicts a series of strange events leading on from the moment the mariner
                shoots an albatross. Yet the <title level="a">Rime,</title> at its root, is another
                ballad about a lonely sailor who has committed sins at sea and thus becomes obsessed
                with his own guilt, even if his crime differs vastly in scale from that of Southey’s sailor.
                Both the sailor and the mariner ask for sympathy, even as they refuse to reflect on
                their responsibility for their actions. Focused on the past and unable to engage
                with the present, they each inhabit a different temporality from the people they
                encounter and are isolated by their compulsive storytelling. Just as the ancient
                mariner sees spirits aboard his Spectre-Bark, Southey’s sailor is haunted by “the
                wicked one” (line 106) everywhere he goes. Finally, while Southey’s sailor asks the
                dissenting minister for help, Coleridge depicts the mariner asking the hermit to
                shrieve him (“Oh shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!” (line 607)); both the sailor and
                the mariner, (at least in the 1799 version of Southey’s poem), end up at church.</p>
            <p>Southey directly echoes Coleridge’s diction several
                times, suggesting he was inviting his audience to hear echoes of the <title level="a">Rime</title> in his
                poem. The mariner’s reflection on the moment he shoots the albatross, “And I had
                done a hellish thing” (line 89), clearly resounds in two of Southey’s sailor’s
                outbursts; “Oh I have done a wicked thing! / It haunts me night and day” (line 25),
                and “Oh I have done a cursed deed!” (line 53). The sailor stresses that the hovel he
                inhabits is “lonely” (line 26), just as the mariner stresses that he is “all alone”
                on the ship (line 224). Southey advertised his imitation of Coleridge much more
                boldly in 1815 than in 1799, when he changed his poem’s first line to read “It was a
                Christian Minister” (in order to directly echo the first line of Coleridge’s poem,
                “It was an Ancient Mariner”). Although these echoes are easy to catalogue, however, the
                question of what Southey might have meant to communicate in these echoes of the <title level="a">Rime</title> is
                more difficult to answer. In what follows, I argue that the changes Southey makes to Coleridge’s poem in his imitation reveal a fundamental difference in his methodological stance toward the cultivation of public feeling. Although the ballad might intuitively be called a “public” form, each poet imagines the way that this form mediates the relationship between the characters in the ballad and their audiences very differently.</p>
            <p>The question of whether Southey understood himself to be
                translating the subject matter of Coleridge’s poem to an entirely new context, or
                whether he aimed to bring its underlying abolitionist message to the fore is
                debatable, though by now, it is commonly (though not universally) accepted that
                Coleridge’s poem can already be read as an abolitionist allegory in itself.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Malcolm Ware referenced Southey’s poem when he first made this claim.
                            William Empson, Barbara T. Paul-Emile, Patrick Keane, Peter Kitson, and
                            Debbie Lee have also explored the status of Coleridge’s poem as
                            antislavery allegory. Marcus Wood objects to the argument that Coleridge
                            thought of his poem as an abolitionist text, however, calling that
                            argument a failed experiment. Emphasizing Coleridge’s superior sense of
                            tact in avoiding the subject of slavery, Wood argues that Coleridge
                            understood “the essential selfishness of the cult of sensibility, and of
                            its inappropriateness as an imaginative resource for interpreting
                            slavery” in a way that Southey did not (219).</note>
                Coleridge’s mariner’s overwhelming sense of guilt, as several critics have noted,
                seems disproportionate to his crime of shooting the albatross and so might be best
                explained by his repressed confession of involvement in the triangular trade.<note place="foot" resp="author"> John
                            Livingston Lowes argues that the ancient mariner’s “punishment, measured
                            by the standards of a world of balanced penalties, palpably does not fit
                            the crime” (274–5), yet, through the lens of Ware’s argument, the
                            ancient mariner’s fascination with his guilt becomes more appropriate.</note> Southey’s imitation means that he was in effect the first
                critic to note this. His ability to see the allegory at work in the <title level="a">Rime</title> was
                likely informed by his friendship with Coleridge during the time they had both spent
                living in Bristol in the mid-1790s. In 1795, Southey had witnessed Coleridge give
                his <title level="a">On the Slave Trade</title> lecture in Bristol and was also making plans with him to
                emigrate to America to build a new Pantisocratic community. Their plans for their
                utopian society unraveled over time, partly because Southey wanted to take servants
                to the banks of the Susquehanna. This paved the way for further poetic
                disagreements. By October 1798, Southey’s review of the <title level="a">Rime</title> in the <title level="j">Critical Review</title> publicly accused Coleridge of being too
                obscure (“We do not sufficiently understand the story to analyze it . . . ”). This
                negative review is one of the things that Southey became best known for in the
                twentieth century, as Lynda Pratt has observed, and has therefore had a
                disproportionate influence on how his own poem has been read<note place="foot" resp="author">Lynda Pratt, “Introduction: Robert Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism,” Robert Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism. Routledge 2016, xviii.</note>.</p>
            <p>Because Coleridge’s poem is much longer and more complex
                than Southey’s—with its supernatural themes, mythic elements, and confusing
                symbolism—discussions of Southey’s imitation of Coleridge have tended to argue that
                he simplified his source text. Southey has often been characterized as a more
                “public” poet than Coleridge.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Simon Bainbridge emphasizes Southey’s role as “public” poet when he
                            argues that, “Marilyn Butler has presented the political, public Southey
                            as an alternative exemplary Romantic figure to the Wordsworth that she
                            sees constructed by the quietest, intellectual agendas of the academy”
                            (Butler, <title level="a">Repossessing</title> 64–84).” Bainbridge himself argues that Southey
                            offers “a manifesto for a different poetic mode to the one normally
                            defined as Romantic, one that is politically committed and speaks with
                            what Southey terms in another poem of 1798 ‘the calm, collected public
                            voice’” (Bainbridge par. 2).</note> As Mary Jacobus puts it, in
                an influential 1971 article on <title level="a">Southey’s Debt to the <title level="m">Lyrical
                    Ballads</title></title>: <quote>What is idiosyncratic or disturbing in the poetry of
                Wordsworth and Coleridge is replaced by a topical or humanitarian interest of a
                quite straightforward kind: the poems become not simply shallower, but more public…
                A generalized, symbolic study of guilt and alienation [in <title level="a">The Rime</title>] becomes an
                anti-slave-trade poem, its theme given immediate topical resonance and its
                underlying moral emphasis made explicit. Gothic accretions and psychological depth
                are stripped away to leave horror of an entirely straightforward kind. (30) </quote>
            Jacobus also stresses that Southey’s style is defined by his magazine audience—“In
                some cases, poems from <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> are returned firmly to
                the level of the magazine poetry from which they had been raised, stripped of their
                new thematic depth and sophistication” (24)—and notes that Southey might also have
                been offering his poem as a corrective to the complexity of the <title level="a">Rime.</title> “One has to concede that his… borrowings represent a
                deliberate attempt to put right what he had criticized in his review” (24), Jacobus
                concludes. This argument has been very influential in readings of the poem. For
                instance, Patrick Keane concurs that his ballad is a “straightforward” version of
                Coleridge’s poem (158). Christopher Smith sees the poem as “an answer to Coleridge”
                (par. 3), arguing that “Southey converts the disturbing open-endedness of Wordsworth
                and Coleridge’s work to sententious, clear-cut, rapidly-moving stories, or emblems
                of suffering” (par. 8). Chris Rubenstein argues that “Either Southey in his poem
                tells us . . . what Coleridge ought to have written in the ‘Rime;’ or he writes—and
                I prefer this alternative—what he is reasonably certain Coleridge had in mind” (24).
                More recently, David Chandler has aimed to correct this consensus by offering
                Southey’s poem <title level="a">The Old Woman of Berkeley</title> as a more persuasive “answer” to
                Coleridge’s poem, arguing <quote> There is no reason to question Southey’s assertion that his ballad was inspired by a
                real story (<title level="m">Poems</title> 105), however, and if that story was, in
                the telling, fertilized with ideas from <title level="a">The Ancient Mariner,</title> it does not mean that
                Southey conceived of it as an “answer” to the problems he found in Coleridge’s poem.
                As he fully accepted and happily contributed to the genre of the supernatural
                ballad, he must have realized that a political, “natural” ballad like <title level="a">The Sailor</title>
                was generically too distinct from <title level="a">The Ancient Mariner</title> to challenge plausibly
                Coleridge’s experiment. (par. 5)</quote></p>
            <p>A tendency to criticize the simplistic nature of
                Southey’s didactic poem is balanced with a generalized sense of admiration for
                Coleridge’s psychologically subtle approach to the representation of guilt in the
                critical conversation about the possibility of an abolitionist allegory in the
                “Rime.” Coleridge has been lauded for his success at cultivating a disturbing
                feeling of identification with the mariner’s guilt in his audience, precisely
                because he avoids describing why the mariner shoots the albatross, or what this
                action might signify.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See, for instance, Tim Fulford: “distancing himself
                            from contemporary events allowed Coleridge to find terms which would let
                            readers share the mental state that, he argued, was produced by, and in
                            turn reproduced, those events” (50). See also Joan Baum, who argues in a
                            reading of Wordsworth’s poem on Toussaint L’Ouverture that “the genius
                            of Romantic poetry is to avoid palpable or overt moral purpose, and
                            explore the imaginative consciousness of both the poet and humanity”
                            (146).</note> This argument has a different logic when read in
                conversation with criticism of Southey’s poem, however, than when read in relation
                to Coleridge’s poem alone. The juxtaposition reveals a strange paradox, whereby <title level="a">The
                Rime</title> has not only been called a more successful poem than <title level="a">The Sailor,</title> but has
                also subtly been framed as a more successful abolitionist poem—despite never
                directly mentioning the topic of slavery. Considering how many people have read and
                discussed the <title level="a">Rime</title> without referencing the context of Atlantic slavery, however,
                questions remain about how useful the generalized sense of guilt that Coleridge
                summons was to the project of abolition.</p>
            <p>The critical consensus that Southey’s poem is simplistic
                also requires reconsideration, since Southey complicates the status of Coleridge’s
                poem as abolitionist allegory while simplifying its underlying plot. For instance,
                he often seems to read Coleridge’s poem psychoanalytically, suggesting that Coleridge’s use of supernatural imagery might be read as a sign of the way
                that mention of the Atlantic trade has been repressed in the poem. In <title level="a">The Rime,</title> a “million
                million slimy things” haunt the ancient mariner’s field of vision after the mass
                death of the ship’s crew (lines 227–35); this image resurfaces in Southey’s
                description of the way that the enslaved woman’s dead body seems to refuse to sink
                after she has been thrown overboard. This perhaps implies that Coleridge was himself
                repressing a reference to the murdered bodies of enslaved people in his description
                of the “rotting sea” (line 232). Southey further excavates the unconscious of
                Coleridge’s poem by drawing a connection between the way the sailor describes his
                torture of the enslaved woman and the vision of his crime that later haunts him.
                Southey uses the verb “twist” twice; first to describe the enslaved woman’s pain—
                “She twisted from the blows” (line 81), and then later to describe how the sailor
                sees his victim’s dead body “twisting everywhere” in the water, long after the sea
                has closed “over her” (line 101). He thereby suggests there is a connection between
                the symbolic vehicle the sailor’s guilt takes on and the reason for the guilt itself
                and invites readers to think about whether this might also be true in the case of
                Coleridge’s poem. When he examines the unplumbed abolitionist depths of some of
                Coleridge’s supernatural symbolism, Southey draws attention to the way in which
                Coleridge allows some readers to disregard the context of slavery, in a way he will
                not himself allow.</p>
            <p>Beyond Southey’s decision to make his poem obviously abolitionist, and to translate supernatural
                references into descriptions of how the unconscious works, his decision to preface his version of the poem with a headnote that addresses the poem's "public" audience also offers a subtle commentary of Coleridge's methodology. He makes several further
                 alterations to the setting and plot of Coleridge’s poem, when he decides to set the poem in a hovel, to convert
                the character of the wedding guest into the character of the dissenting minister, to
                add the character of a captain, and to introduce the question of whether the poem
                should end in prayer. None of these changes are merely incidental; each of them
                subject the mechanisms of Coleridge’s allegory to scrutiny, and many of them
                complicate, rather than simplify, Coleridge’s text. In what follows, I examine the
                effects of each of these revisions to Coleridge’s poem in detail, putting special
                emphasis on how they work to cultivate public, as well as private, feeling. In doing
                so, I do not mean to recuperate Southey’s poem, so much as offer a case study of the
                way in which abolitionist poetry's overt public purpose has changed the way it has
                been read.</p></div>

            <head>The Headnote</head>
            <p>Southey never directly spoke of his poem as an imitation; instead, he repeatedly claimed
                that the motivation for the poem came from a real-life encounter. In a letter to his
                friend John May (26 September 1798), in which he first shares the poem, he describes
                how he first heard the narrative from the Bristol publisher, Joseph Cottle:<quote>
            A dissenting minister here, a man of unquestioned
                veracity, discovered the sailor as you will find related: only last week &amp; Cottles mother
                took down the account from his mouth. I have verified it as the best means of a
                story that ought to be widely known. You will not I think object to the frequent
                ejaculations when you recollect the effect which the whole is intended to produce.
                (<title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works</title> 288) </quote>
            Southey recounts the same details in a note to his
                brother Tom in October 1798 (although this time he states that it was Cottle’s
                “friend,” rather than his “mother,” who first heard the account): “This my dear Tom
                which Edith has copied for you is a true story. It is about six weeks since a friend
                of Cottle found a sailor thus praying in a cowhouse and held conversation with him
                of which the exact substance is in the ballad” (qtd. in Rubinstein, 24).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Rubenstein notes that the
                            postmark to this letter is obscured; however, comparing the references
                            in the letters to Tom and May (“one week” and “six weeks”) makes it
                            likely that the letter was sent in October 1798.</note></p>
            <p>If the sailor’s story does indeed have a basis in truth,
                notwithstanding Southey’s confusion about whether Cottle heard the story from his
                mother or his friend, it was mediated several times before Southey came across it.
                An ungenerous reading of Southey’s claim that the dissenting minister was the only
                source for his poem is that he was surreptitiously diverting attention away from his
                borrowings from Coleridge. Chris Rubenstein argues that “Southey must have
                fictionalized the origin of ‘The Sailor…’” (24). It is certainly possible that
                Southey could have invented the story of the sailor wholesale, as a kind of cover
                for his influence. However, the fact of the imitation does not discount the
                possibility that Southey had heard a story like the sailor’s and was therefore moved
                to think differently about Coleridge’s poem, or that he adapted a story he had heard
                in service of an imitation of the “Rime.” Since Southey leaves so many clues for
                observant readers that his poem is in conversation with the
                <title level="a">Rime,</title> however, I will set aside this
                unsolvable question, in order to instead focus on the effects of reading <title level="a">The
                Sailor</title> as an imitation.</p>
            <p>The headnote itself can also be read as a self-conscious
                experiment with—and revision to—the <title level="a">Advertisement</title> of the
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798). With the status
                of the poem as imitation in view, echoes of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s
                <title level="a">Advertisement</title> abound in Southey’s headnote:<quote>
            In September, 1798, a Dissenting Minister of Bristol,
                discovered a Sailor in the neighbourhood of that City, groaning and praying in a
                hovel. The circumstance that occasioned his agony of mind is detailed in the annexed
                Ballad, without the slightest addition or alteration. By presenting it as a Poem,
                the story is made more public; and such stories ought to be made as public as
                possible. (<title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works</title> 289)</quote>
            Southey’s reference to the date, 1798, and his emphasis
                on the authenticity of the ballad indicates that his interaction with the
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> is hiding in plain
                    sight.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The
                            phrase Southey uses to describe the psychological results of the
                            sailor’s guilt in his headnote, too, “agony of mind,” recalls
                            Coleridge’s mariner’s line, “And Christ would take no pity on / My soul
                            in agony” (lines 226–7).</note> In his emphasis on the veracity
                of his source, Southey, like Wordsworth and Coleridge, builds on tradition that
                Thomas Percy began when he traveled extensively around the British Isles to collect
                and record folk ballads in his
                    <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title> (1765).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Southey’s transformation of his source
                            text into a poem also chimes with Percy’s tendency to correct or make
                            changes to the songs he recorded, which was well documented by this
                            period.</note> In keeping with the trend which valued ballads
                directly transcribed from singers’ mouths more highly than those already written
                down, and presenting himself as a kind of ethnographer, Southey privileges the
                orality of his text. His insistence that there has been no “addition or alteration”
                to the sailor’s words obviously contradicts his statement that the story is being
                “presented” as a poem, yet he preserves a sense of verisimilitude by noting that he
                has merely fitted the sailor’s words to verse, rather than asking readers to imagine
                that the sailor originally spoke in ballad meter. By removing the mention of Cottle
                as an intermediary in the headnote (as opposed to the letters), Southey instead
                makes the ballad form itself the vessel for the transmission of the tale. He
                presents the ballad as a medium that takes a story, changes it in a way that makes
                it more likely to be shared, and then relies on its audience for distribution (akin
                to something like a meme today). The story has already passed from one member of the
                public (the sailor) to another (the dissenting minister); the ballad form will allow
                it to spread much further. As song, the ballad will become the agent of its own
                re-creation, even beyond the circulation of the printed text. Southey’s suggestion
                that converting the sailor’s story to ballad meter makes it more transmissible
                anticipates Wordsworth’s statement in the later <title level="a">Preface</title> to the
                    <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1802), that the story of <title level="a">Goody Blake and Harry Gill</title> was
                “communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it, had it
                not been narrated as a Ballad” (112).<note place="foot" resp="author"> William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <title level="a">Preface,</title> to the

            <p>By drawing attention to the way he has “presented” the
                speech as a ballad, Southey coyly aligns his project with Wordsworth and Coleridge’s

                    Ballads</title> of their wish to experiment with the question of how far “the

                acknowledges that he thinks it necessary to “present” the sailor’s story as a poem,
                he hints that he thinks his audience might only be persuaded to listen to truths
                about the Atlantic trade if its horrors are aestheticized or packaged in “a poem.”
                Yet swapping an emphasis on imitation for one on mediated speech is also a
                Coleridgean method. Maureen McLane and Celeste Langan have explored the ways in
                which Wordsworth and Coleridge highlight the status of their ballads as mediated
                texts. In the end, Southey’s experiment in mediation seems truer to the principles
                in the <title level="a">Advertisement</title> than Coleridge’s poem itself: a comparison between Southey’s
                poem and Coleridge’s (especially the first version, with the antiquated spelling
                which Wordsworth so disliked), reveals Southey to be closer to “the language of
                conversation” than Coleridge was.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                his headnote or his letters can, from this perspective, be read as evidence of his
                commitment to his imitation, rather than his desire to cover it up.</p>
            <p>Even the language Southey uses to
                frame the poem’s origins in the private letters echoes the themes of the
                <title level="a">Advertisement.</title> His insistence that the ballad was taken down “from the mouth” of
                the sailor and his apparent misgivings about the style of the sailor’s diction in
                his “frequent ejaculations,” for instance, mimics Wordsworth and Coleridge’s concern
                that readers might think “the author has sometimes descended too low, and that many
                of his expressions are too familiar, and not of sufficient dignity”
                (<title level="a">Advertisement,</title> 3). Cottle was the person responsible for showing Southey the <emph>MS</emph> version of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in May
                1798 (see Jacobus 21), so he was certainly the intermediary who carried the
                inspiration for the poem to Southey, one way or another, and Southey’s reference to
                Cottle’s role as conduit for the story could even be a coy way of gesturing toward
                this. Cottle’s mother (or friend) could also be considered an avatar of the wedding
                guest, who receives a version of the poem from the mariner’s mouth, unmediated by
                text.</p></div>

            <head>The Public and the People</head>
            <p>Once the similarities between Southey’s headnote and the
                1798 <title level="a">Advertisement</title> are clear, it becomes easier to see how Southey
                also diverges from Coleridge’s example in <title level="a">The Rime</title> when he emphasizes the "public" nature of his ballad. This stands out as a crucial difference between his framing of his poem and Coleridge's. Where Coleridge prefers to locate his ballad in
                a mythical landscape, Southey prompts his audience to recognize the poem’s currency
                by noting the date (September 1798). Southey also encourages his audience to imagine
                themselves as part of the “public” in a way that Coleridge avoids. Rather than
                relying on a pre-established category for defining the public, the headnote calls
                its own public into being. Since such a small percentage of the population of
                Britain could vote in 1799, it seems less likely that Southey straightforwardly
                equates the phrase “the public” with the “voting public,” than that he also
                envisions his public to also include disenfranchised citizens as he incites readers
                to coalesce as a group.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “A survey conducted in 1780 revealed that the

            <p>Whereas Southey openly displays his
                poem’s didactic purpose, Coleridge was more wary of doing so. In <title level="m">Table Talk</title>, he recalls Anna Barbauld’s objection that the <title level="a">Rime</title> had no
                moral, in order to underline that he considered the “obtrusion of moral sentiment” a
                “chief fault” in the poem.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In a
                            reflection on <title level="a">The Ancient Mariner</title> in

                            “Mrs Barbauld once told me that she admired The Ancient Mariner very
                            much, but that there were two faults in it—it was improbable, and had no
                            moral. As for the probability, I owned that that might admit some
                            question; but as to the want of a moral, I told her that in my own
                            judgement the poem had too much; and that the only, or chief fault, if I
                            might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the
                            reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure
                            imagination” (vol. I, 272).</note> As Malcolm Ware notes,
                Coleridge’s poem does conclude a version of a moral, in the aphoristic line, “He
                prayeth well who loveth well, / Both man and bird and beast,” (lines 645–6) and the
                wedding guest leaves his encounter “a sadder and a wiser man” (line 657). Yet this
                was as much as Coleridge was willing to offer in terms of didacticism: the statement
                “as public as possible” is anathema to his methodology. Since both Wordsworth and
                Coleridge’s criticism of the “public” became increasingly vehement, Southey’s
                emphasis on making the story “as public as possible” has made his poem seem less and
                less Coleridgean as time has gone on. The 1802 “Preface” to the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> speaks briefly of its wish to appeal to “the approbation
                of the Public” (115) but after this, Wordsworth and Coleridge quickly begin to
                vilify this group.</p>
            <p>Although it seems counterintuitive
                that Wordsworth and Coleridge attack the public while also valorizing “the real
                language of men,” the position makes more sense in light of the knowledge that they
                did not use the term “public” to denote the “public sphere.” Instead, they used it
                in a more complex way to describe a group of people whose views were governed by
                tastemakers and trends. Both Wordsworth and Coleridge distinguished between the
                “public” (whom they disliked) and the “people” (whom they admired). The most famous
                explanation of the way they each understood the distinction can be found in
                Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Essay Supplementary to the Preface</title> of his <title level="m">Poems</title> (1815), where he draws on Edmund Burke to argue that the People are
                worthy of much more respect than the made-up category of “the Public”:<quote>
            Still more lamentable is his error who can believe that
                there is any thing of divine infallibility in the clamour of that small though loud
                portion of the community, ever governed by factitious influence, which, under the
                name of the PUBLIC, passes itself, upon the unthinking, for the PEOPLE. Towards the
                Public, the Writer hopes that he feels as much deference as it is entitled to: but
                to the People, philosophically characterized, and to the embodied spirit of their
                knowledge, so far as it exists and moves, at the present, faithfully supported by
                its two wings, the past and the future, his devout respect, his reverence, is due.
                (661–2)</quote>
            As Georgina Green summarizes, Wordsworth is interested
                here in the opposition between a group interested in “transitory” versus
                “transhistorical” ideals (<title level="m">The Majesty</title> 146). Wordsworth summed
                up this argument more laconically when he famously quipped that “The people would
                love the poem of <title level="m">Peter Bell,</title> but the Public (a very different
                being) will never love it” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 329). Like Wordsworth,
                Coleridge also often referred to his dislike of the public. In the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria,</title> for instance, he disparages “the multitudinous
                PUBLIC,” as “shaped into personal unity by the magic of an abstraction” (59); he
                objects to the notion that a multitude might think in the same way.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Coleridge
                            also calls the Public a “misgrowth of our luxuriant activity,” as if the
                            practice of reviewing has not been properly pruned (“To T. G. Street”).
                        </note></p>
           <p>Wordsworth and Coleridge’s argument about the difference
                between the public and the people has political consequences for their work, though
                it had humbler beginnings, since it seems to have largely resulted from a defensive
                reaction to negative reviews of the
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads.</title> Anthony Harding’s
                explanation that Wordsworth and Coleridge’s use of the term “public” might make more
                sense if understood as a reference to a “reading public” is useful here (113). In
                various letters written in the wake of the <title level="a">Rime,</title> Coleridge insists that no one
                person should imagine they can speak for the public’s opinion. He calls the public
                “an imaginary word” which is “of pernicious effect by habituating every Reader to
                consider himself as the Judge &amp; therefore the Superior of the Writer who yet if
                he has any justifiable claim to write ought to be his Superior” (<title level="m">Biographia</title> 57, note 3). At the same time, however, Coleridge argues that
                the way literary reviewers conceive of “the public” will, in turn, impact the way
                politics are conducted, hinting at the way that his own decision to disavow the
                public has political implications. Coleridge foresees in the new tendency for
                critics to describe how the public will receive texts the advent of an era in which
                individual readers cannot be expected to have their own opinion, or individually
                evaluate what they read, which will then affect how “the State” treats them:<quote>
            The Root of the Evil is a Public—and take my word for
                it, this will wax more prolific of inconvenience, that at length it will scarcely be
                possible for the State to suffer any truth to be published, because it will be
                certain to convey a dangerous falsehood to 99 out of a hundred. (“To T.G. Street”
                713)</quote>
            Essentially, Coleridge is suggesting here that once the
                public assent to the idea that they are part of a group whose opinions can be formed
                by publications, the status of “truth” itself will become suspect. Thus Coleridge’s
                disgust for the notion that the public would all respond in a similar way after
                reading a review aligns with his disinterest in allowing a didactic abolitionist
                moral to intrude in “The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere.” The problem with Wordsworth
                and Coleridge’s resistance to imagining their audience as a public, however, is that
                the cause of abolition requires imagining an audience situated in a particular
                historical moment, and also requires people to be persuaded to act by means of the
                “clamour” of a “small though loud portion of the community.” Coleridge likely did
                not expect his ideas about “the public” to affect the way other people’s abolition
                poems were received, yet his decision to dwell on the difference between the public
                and the people has had this unfortunate effect.</p></div>

            <head>Entering the Hovel</head>
            <p>The opening of the <title level="a">Rime</title> perhaps models Coleridge’s
                preferred relationship to the audience external to the poem, as members of the
                “people,” rather than as “public”:<quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>IT is an ancyent Mariner,</l>
            <l> And he stoppeth one of three:</l>
            <l>By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye,</l>
            <l> “Now wherefore stopp’st thou me?” (1798, lines 1–4)</l></lg></quote>
            Coleridge begins by demonstratively portraying the
                mariner separating the wedding guest from a group of people in order to tell him his
                tale. Though this emphasis on “one of three” has sometimes been read as a Biblical
                allusion (since Jesus is unrecognized as one of the three travelers on the road to
                Emmaus [Luke 24:13–35]), the lines also emphasize the one-on-one interaction between
                the mariner and the wedding guest. Coleridge’s 1834 marginal gloss also emphasizes
                the singularity of the wedding guest: “An ancient Mariner meeteth three gallants
                bidden to a wedding feast, and detaineth one” (Norton 61). This creates an
                opportunity for single readers to imagine that they receive an individual hearing of
                the poem. When Coleridge explains that the mariner will melancholically repeat his
                tale over and over again, he further encourages individual readers of “The Rime” to
                imagine themselves being stopped, one by one, in order to hear the next iteration of
                the tale.</p>
            <p>Although Coleridge emphasizes the way he wants his
                readers to form their own opinions, however, he does not give the internal audience
                in his poem a choice about whether to listen to his tale. Instead, the mariner
                compels the wedding guest to submit to his story by separating him from the group
                and performing a supernatural kind of hypnotism on him. By emptying the wedding
                guest of volition, Coleridge makes him a kind of vessel for the mariner’s story to
                fill:<quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>He holds him with his glittering eye</l>
            <l> The wedding guest stood still</l>
            <l>And listens like a three year’s child;</l>
            <l> The Marinere hath his will.</l></lg>
            <lg type="stanza"><l>The wedding-guest sate on a stone,</l>
            <l> He cannot chuse but hear:</l>
            <l>And thus spake on that ancyent man.</l>
            <l> The bright-eyed Marinere. (1798, lines 17–24)</l></lg></quote>
            Whereas the mariner intrudes into a scene of sociability
                in order to assault the wedding guest with his tale, Southey suggests the minister
                has more of a choice about whether to cross the threshold of the hovel to enter into
                this withdrawn space. Thus, Southey also encourages his poem’s readers to feel that
                they also have a choice about whether to listen to the sailor’s story, alongside the
                minister. In this, he grants his readers a sense of agency about whether to count
                themselves among the number of the “public” he refers to in the headnote.</p>
            <p>Southey’s hovel provides a location where a collective
                abolitionist public can form, allowing his audience to conceptualize a space in
                which they might metaphorically gather, despite being physically separated by time
                and space:<quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>He stopt, — it surely was a groan</l>
            <l> That from the hovel came!</l>
            <l>He stopt and listened anxiously</l>
            <l> Again it sounds the same.</l></lg>
           <lg type="stanza"><l>It surely from the hovel comes!</l>
            <l> And now he hastens there,</l>
            <l>And thence he hears the name of Christ</l>
            <l> Amidst a broken prayer.</l></lg>
            <lg type="stanza"><l>He entered in the hovel now,</l>
            <l> A sailor there he sees,</l>
            <l>His hands were lifted up to Heaven</l>
            <l> And he was on his knees. (lines 1–12)</l></lg></quote>
            When the minister enters into the confined space of the
                hovel, he also metaphorically enters into the intimate space of a confessional box;
                a space situated somewhere between the public and the private sphere. Just as the
                confessional is an enclosed space which two people occupy within the larger space of
                the church, the hovel is situated within the city of Bristol and yet also separate
                from its hurry. Southey’s decision to situate the poem here, a significant departure
                from the <title level="a">Rime,</title> also provides a spatial metaphor for how the public’s entrance into
                the space of the sailor’s consciousness might work. One might imagine that the
                sailor would immediately break off his lament on seeing the minister enter, but as
                Southey depicts him, he hardly notices the entrance of the minister into the hovel.
                Instead, he continues to “groan” (line 18) and say his prayers as if no change had
                occurred. The subtle way Southey figures the setting for his sailor’s confession
                means that the minister is not merely a proxy for individual listeners; he is also a
                metonym for the “public” that Southey mentions in the headnote, as they collectively
                enter into the space of the sailor’s mindset.</p></div>

            <head>Speaking with the Sailor</head>
            <p>To be part of Southey’s “public” is to first be asked to
                witness the sailor’s confession from the perspective of the dissenting minister, and
                then to be asked to imagine oneself in the role of the confessant himself. Southey
                not only encourages members of his poem’s public to identify with the sailor’s
                subject position when he asks them to enter the hovel; he also does so sonically, by

                ballad (whether they recite out loud or inwardly).<note

                            also emphasizes a sense of community within the hovel since prayer is a
                            familiar form of communal speech. Since the public knew the Lord’s
                            Prayer, that the sailor forgot, they might find themselves filling his
                            silences.</note> When the sailor uses the first-person pronoun
                to say he has done a “cursed deed,” readers must also say this pronoun:<quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>Oh I have done a cursed deed</l>
            <l> The wretched man replies,</l>
            <l>And night and day and every where</l>

            Despite his repeated insistence that his “sin” torments
                him, the sailor remains unreflective about the events that led up to his crime. The
                sailor was not “innocent” at the point that he took “three hundred” people onto a
                ship, yet still insists on continuing to willfully overlook the violence of the act
                he participated in. When Southey slips in the detail that the sailor’s ship, like
                Coleridge’s ship, embarks “merrily” (line 63), he not only indicts the sailor for
                his carelessness, but also the ancient mariner as well. The bouncing merriness of
                Southey’s ballad meter is obviously opposed to the sailor’s subject matter,
                emphasizing the profanity of the idea that anyone could believe that this kind of
                ship could sail “merrily.” Nonetheless, an audience has to viscerally participate in
                the sailor’s use of meter, and so is also forced to confront this tension.</p>
            <p>In his depiction of the sailor’s insouciance, Southey
                subtly reminds his readers that people not directly involved in the violence of the
                Atlantic trade are still guilty of perpetuating the system, even if they consider
                themselves “innocent” (line 60). At a time when consumer habits drove the violence
                forward, William Wilberforce often made the argument that slavery was a moral
                degradation for all members of the British public, not just the people directly
                involved in it. In a speech he made on 12 May 1789, he cast all citizens in the role
                of those who had done “cursed deeds”:<quote>
            We are all guilty. We ought to plead guilty, and not to
                exculpate ourselves by throwing the blame on others… when we reflect it is we
                ourselves that have degraded them to that wretched brutishness and barbarity which
                we now plead as the justification of guilt.” (qtd. in Sonoi 28)</quote>
            Southey encourages individual members of the public to
                realize that they share in the blame for the sailor’s crime, even if they have not
                themselves committed it.</p>
            <p>The ballad form also emphasizes this sense of a shared
                “public” guilt. Anyone who reads Southey’s ballad reads it knowing that many others
                have spoken, and will speak, in chorus with him. Even if the sailor seems to be
                voicing private pain, he does so using a “public” form. Susan Stewart’s theory of
                lyric possession, alongside readings of abolitionist poems that rely on it, such as
                Ivan Ortiz’s work on <title level="a">Lyric Possession in the Abolitionist Ballad,</title> is instructive
                    here.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Ivan Ortiz, <title level="a">Lyric
                            Possession in the Abolition Ballad.</title></note> The sailor’s
                voice, <emph>qua</emph> ballad, is always already inhabited by other
                voices, joining in a chorus that transcends time and space: speaking singly and
                communally at once. Both the hovel and the ballad form are containers for Southey’s
                public: the ballad, like the hovel, marks out a space for a collective confession,
                spoken through the sailor’s only seemingly individual voice. The way the ballad form
                functions as a middle space between the private and the public can be conceptually
                compared with the way the hovel functions as a middle space between the sailor’s
                private life and the public space of Bristol which surrounds him.</p>
            <p>The ancient mariner also speaks in ballad meter, which
                means that his audience outside the poem can also recognize his narrative as an
                entrance into a form of collective consciousness with other readers outside the
                space of the poem. In Coleridge’s poem, however, even those readers who identify
                with the mariner’s sense of guilt, and acknowledge that other readers are also doing
                so, can still escape a confrontation with their own role in the complicity in the
                violence of slavery, because the allegorical mode allows them security. For a reader
                reciting Southey’s ballad, by contrast, there is no refuge in metaphor. No member of
                Southey’s public can join voices with the sailor without also confronting the brutal
                horror of the “cursed deeds” that the lack of an abolition ruling was causing.</p></div>
                <div type="section">
            <head>The Violence of Representation</head>
            <p>The ethical value of asking an audience to put
                themselves in the position of the guilty sailor becomes increasingly strained as the
                poem continues, however. Although Southey’s sailor sounds very like Coleridge’s
                mariner in the opening lines of his speech, his confession suddenly takes on a very
                different tone when he starts to narrate the way he was forced to torture the
                enslaved woman, while also emphasizing his own suffering. No sooner has the sailor
                confessed to the murder than he begins to insist on his own status as a victim,
                harping on the pain his guilt causes. Perhaps Southey may have defended his
                representation of such extreme selfishness by arguing that he was parodying the
                Coleridge’s mariner’s focus on himself. Certainly, the mariner comes to seem more
                culpable through the lens of Southey’s poem: <title level="a">The Sailor</title> offers an implicit
                critique of how problematic Coleridge’s emphasis on the mariner’s obsession with his
                own suffering becomes if the poem is read in an abolitionist context. Yet this
                section of the sailor’s narration of his crime is violent in other ways, too, and
                should come with a content warning:<quote><lg type="stanza">

            <l> My hand to hear her cry.</l></lg>
            <lg type="stanza"><l>She groan’d, she shriek’d — I could not spare</l>
            <l> For the Captain he stood by —</l>
            <l>Dear God! that I might rest one night</l>
            <l> From that poor woman’s cry!</l></lg>
           <lg type="stanza"><l>She twisted from the blows — her blood</l>

            <l>And still the Captain would not spare —</l>
            <l> Oh he was worse than me! (lines 65–84)</l></lg></quote>
            When Southey adds the character of the captain to his
                depiction of this scene of torture, he may be referencing Isaac Cruikshank’s
                well-known image of a notorious scene in which Captain Kimber ordered an enslaved
                woman to be whipped. In this image, which I have chosen not to reprint here, the
                woman who is being whipped by a sailor has been stripped of her clothes, suggesting
                that she has been sexually assaulted, while a lascivious captain in the foreground of
                the frame unabashedly meets the viewer’s gaze. The euphemistic title of the image
                also draws attention to the way she has been assaulted: <title level="a">The abolition of the slave
                trade Or the inhumanity of dealers in human flesh exemplified in Captn. Kimber’s
                treatment of a young Negro girl of 15 for her virjen (sic) modesty.</title> The “public”
                Southey addresses would likely have heard of this case, because Wilberforce
                referenced it in a speech denouncing Kimber in the early 1790s.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See “Curator’s Comments” on
                            Cruikshank’s print: <title level="a">The abolition of the Slave Trade.</title></note>
                This intertext points to the way that any reference to the torture of an enslaved
                woman can be understood to be sexualized, even if Southey does not make overt
                reference to sexual assault. Yet by asking viewers to meet the captain’s gaze,
                Cruikshank also dramatizes the way in which viewers to some extent participate in a
                scene like this when they observe it. Even if Cruikshank might defend his picture by
                saying that the representation of such a scene is designed to limit violence, he
                also encourages viewers to become complicit onlookers to violence within the scene
                itself.</p>
            <p>Southey’s description of the torture of the enslaved
                woman, like Cruikshank’s drawing, also enacts violence, as well as recording it. His
                representation of the sailor’s confession is a stark example of the violence often
                inherent in the representation of violence done to Black bodies by white
                abolitionists (and primarily for white abolitionists). The very fact of his decision
                to represent this scene is ethically problematic, because of the way that it makes
                the woman’s pain instrumental. Critical reactions to the recordings and
                representations of Black suffering today offer a theoretical lens through which to
                understand the harm that Southey’s abolitionist tactic causes. Reflecting on the
                videos of the beating of Rodney King in 1991, Elizabeth Alexander has noted that the
                video of King’s assault circulated in such a way as to inure viewers to the
                violence, even when those circulating the images did so with the intention of
                bringing justice. Alexander’s argument, which details the ways in which the
                recordings of violence can function as a tool of white supremacy, can also be
                applied to representations of violence. Christina Sharpe also explores the ethics of
                representation when she provides a chronology through which to understand the
                critique of Dana Schutz’s painting of Emmett Till. Sharpe’s logic can be applied to
                a viewing of Southey’s tableau: when he chooses to represent the murder of an
                enslaved Black woman, he also incites associations with previous representations of
                enslaved women, which have taught viewers to exert their gaze in a different way
                than they might confront images of violence done to white bodies. Looking at such
                violence is not simply a passive condition: it is an act that participates in a
                hierarchical structure imbued with its own history of violence.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Bakary Diaby
                            also discusses the Dana Schutz controversy in relation to the protocols
                            of Romanticism: “The Open Casket affair…
                            participates in a long tradition of Black women serving as the occasion
                            for a sustained discourse on race while remaining in the shadows of that
                            discourse…We see a similar dynamic play out, I will suggest, in
                            contemporary scholarship on Romanticism” (249).</note></p>
            <p>The sailor has not learned from his representation of
                his victim’s suffering to understand the woman’s humanity. He twice calls the woman
                he has murdered “sulky” for her decision to refuse food, dismissing her act of
                protest (lines 65, 69). The violence Southey himself does to the enslaved woman
                continues in the way he has the sailor describe her death: “She groan’d and
                groan’d, but her groans grew / Fainter at morning tide (lines 93–4). Thus the
                enslaved woman’s suffering is slowly rendered inaudible as she dies, her subjecthood
                growing “fainter” alongside her groans. By emphasizing the way in which she
                seemingly disappears as her groans diminish, the sailor also diminishes the force of
                her suffering, in order to turn his attention back towards his own groans in the
                hovel—“So I came here alone, / That I might freely kneel and pray, / And call on
                Christ and groan” (lines 29–31). The sailor further heightens the sense that he has
                learned very little when he begins to complain that his suffering is worse than the
                woman’s. Repeatedly trivializing his victim’s pain, the sailor seems incapable of
                understanding it, despite having put himself in the woman’s position for other more
                selfish reasons. His frequent comparisons of himself to her are outrageous: “She
                could not be more glad than I / When she was taken down” (lines 85–6), he says. His
                assertion that he is envious of the “rest” his victim has been granted in death is
                also grotesque:<quote><lg type="stanza">           
            <l>They flung her overboard; — poor wretch</l>
            <l> She rested from her pain, —</l>
            <l>But when — o Christ! o blessed God!</l>
            <l> Shall I have rest again! (lines 97–100)</l></lg></quote>
            Looking back at the beginning of the poem through the
                lens of these lines, the sailor seems increasingly self-obsessed. Early in the poem,
                for instance, the sailor says he wishes he had drowned before he committed the
                murder, only to later describe how the sea did in fact swallow the enslaved woman.
                The status of the poem as an imitation or parody does not absolve Southey of the
                violence of his representation at moments like this.</p></div>
                <div type="section">
            <head>“The Captain He Stood By”</head>
            <p>Southey’s addition of the character of the
                captain—another departure from the narrative of the <title level="a">Rime</title>—might also be seen to
                increase the violence of Southey’s representation, as compared with Coleridge’s
                poem. Whereas Coleridge’s mariner stresses that it was his own decision to commit
                his crime (even though he doesn’t understand why he did it), Southey’s sailor argues
                that he was forced to do so. His argument that the captain was “worse” than him
                seems designed to absolve himself of blame, and Southey could be seen to be
                absolving the sailor of his sin when he encourages the public to channel their
                outrage at the captain, rather than the sailor himself. From the sailor’s
                perspective, it is as if the captain refuses to “spare” him, as well as the woman,
                when he orders the whipping.</p>
            <p>From another perspective, however, Southey’s decision to
                exaggerate the sailor’s self-interest could be read as a critique of the sailor’s
                denial of his responsibility. The way that Southey introduces the character of the
                captain just at the moment that the true force of his violence emerges exposes the
                sailor’s inability to accept culpability for his crime, and therefore a lack of true
                contrition. To this extent, his insistence that he was not in control of his own
                “hand” does not absolve him of the crime. This exploration of how a network of
                blame-shifting allows the slave trade to function looks forward to Hannah Arendt’s
                theory of the banality of evil.<note place="foot" resp="author">

            <p>The status of Southey’s own ethical position
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</foreign> the sailor also becomes much
                more complex when Coleridge’s lecture <title level="a">On the Slave Trade</title> in Bristol in 1795 is
                brought into view as another intertext for the poem. Although there is no “Captain”
                in the <title level="a">Rime,</title> Coleridge had emphasized the plight of sailors at the hands of such
                captains in the lecture. In Bristol, Coleridge looked forward to an argument Thomas
                Clarkson would also make, when he described the brutal psychological and physical
                damage that sailors press-ganged into going to sea suffered and argued that they
                should also be considered victims. The printed version of the lecture, published in
                    <title level="j">The Watchman</title> (1796), offers a crucial intertext for
                Coleridge’s representation of the mariner, and also offers the possibility that
                Southey may have seen himself to be amplifying a message he finds in Coleridge’s
                poem about the sympathy that mariners were due:<quote>

                of buying, selling, and torturing human Flesh, must from the moral necessity of

                of their Captain and the unwholesomeness of the Climate through which they pass, it
                has been calculated that every Slave Vessel from the Port of Bristol loses on
                average almost a fourth of the whole Crew—and so far is the Trade from being a
                nursery for Seamen, that the Survivors are rather shadows in their appearance than
                men and frequently perish in Hospitals after the completion of their Voyage . . .

                “brutality” of a “Captain” in his poem. Although Southey’s sailor has not become
                fully dead to confession in the way Coleridge describes, he could be said to live a
                kind of undead life after he murders the woman. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker
                note that sailors often saw themselves on a continuum with the enslaved, since the
                predominance of press-gangs meant that they were not always in control of their
                decision to go to sea.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Linebaugh and Rediker: “For sailors,
                            the press-gang represented slavery and death: three out of four pressed
                            men died within two years, with only one in five of the dead expiring in
                            battle. Those lucky enough to survive could not expect to be paid, as it
                            was not uncommon, writes John Ehrman, the preeminent scholar of the navy
                            of the 1690s, for a seaman to be owed a decade's wages. The figure of
                            the starving, often lame sailor in the seaport town became a permanent
                            feature of European civilization, even as the motley crew became a
                            permanent feature of modern navies” (151).</note> Southey gives
                many clues that the sailor considers himself to be at the mercy of the captain. The
                ambiguity of subject and object in the sailor’s utterance, “We were forced by
                threats and blows to make them eat,” means that it is unclear whether the sailor is
                the only one doing the beating or is also himself being beaten and threatened as he
                is forced to act. The title Southey gives to his poem, <title level="a">The Sailor who had <emph>Served</emph> in the Slave Trade</title> (my emphasis), also invites a
                comparison between servitude and enslavement. Southey perhaps even subtly invokes a
                sonic link between the sailor as “chattel” and “cattle” when he says he “has no
                place to pray onboard” and decides to exile himself in a “cow-house,” as the
                1815 <title level="m">Preface</title> puts it.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I am grateful
                            to Susan Wolfson, who pointed this echo between “cattle” and “chattel”
                            out in a graduate seminar at Princeton University.</note></p>
            <p>Whether or not Southey meant to defend the sailor’s
                position, the presence of the captain in his poem draws attention to how the
                structures of slavery work to disperse guilt; a strategy that is not so apparent in
                Coleridge’s poem. When Southey adds the detail that the captain authored the woman’s
                murder by merely <emph>standing by</emph>, he underlines the fact that
                guilty actors are not necessarily the people who commit the violence, they are also those
                who insist their hands are clean while creating the conditions in which violence
                occurs. Speaking on the issue of police brutality today, Angela Davis has argued
                that it is not enough to blame the individual police officers who have committed
                murder, or demand that they be punished. Instead, she argues, the emphasis must be
                on collective consciousness of collective responsibility: “The major challenge of
                this period is to infuse a consciousness of the structural character of state
                violence” (22). Southey’s addition of the character of the captain, when read in
                relation to his phrase, “as public as possible,” might be read as a similar call to
                draw attention to the need for structural change, rather than merely focus attention
                on individual actors.</p>
            <p>By dramatizing the sailor’s indictment of the captain
                alongside evidence of his monstrous self-interest, Southey demonstrates that the
                functioning of Atlantic slavery relies on people trying to absolve themselves of
                guilt by creating a hierarchy of blame, drawing attention to the way in which a
                logic of individualized guilt allows the continuation of violence. Because of the
                way Southey triangulates the agency of the sailor’s crime, readers cannot condemn
                either the sailor or the captain without also implicating themselves in the guilt of
                the system he decries. That is, as soon as a reader condemns either the sailor’s or
                the captain’s violence, that reader becomes someone who justifies their own role in
                the system of the slave trade by also blaming someone else. The moment that readers
                decide that either the captain <emph>or</emph> the sailor is “worse than”
                them, they also suddenly employ the sailor’s logic of shifting the blame. Thus,
                Southey complicates Coleridge’s plot, and once again foregrounds his interest in
                inciting a collective sense of responsibility in the public, as he subtly confronts
                them with the question of whether they might themselves be guilty of tacitly
                “standing by” as others commit violence on their behalf. The addition of the captain
                not only implicates Southey’s “public” in the dispersal of guilt, it also asks them
                to cohere on that basis.</p></div>

            <head>Praying Together in 1815</head>
            <p>Another way that Southey complicates Coleridge’s poem is
                to problematize the question of what it means for the mariner to end up being
                allowed to pray in the church at the end of the <title level="a">Rime.</title> In the 1799 version of his
                poem, Southey merely echoes the end of Coleridge’s poem, when he pictures the
                minister sending the sailor out of the hovel and towards the church, where he can
                “hear the word of God” (line 123). The minister assures the sailor that he can find
                “help” there (line 124); and that “All sins shall be forgiven” (line 120). In the
                <title level="a">Rime,</title> Coleridge had similarly stressed the mariner’s transition from isolation to
                “goodly company,” emphasizing the mariner’s joy at being able to go to church with
                other people after his time alone on the ship. If Coleridge’s poem is read as an
                allegory about a slave-ship, the mariner benefits from the doctrine of “Amazing
                Grace” when he is rescued by the hermit and allowed “To walk together to the Kirk /
                And all together pray” (lines 637–8).</p>
            <p>When Southey revises his poem in 1815, however, he makes
                the sailor’s—and the public’s—passage to absolution seem less easy, since he
                de-emphasizes the idea that the sailor will straightforwardly be granted forgiveness
                for his sins. Rather than allowing the sailor to go to church, he decides to leave
                the sailor in the hovel, frustrating the sense of hope and resolution granted to him
                in 1799. At this very moment, he also demonstratively ushers the poem’s readers into
                the space of the hovel when he suddenly asks a question about whether they will pray
                alongside the sailor and the minister. In this way, the presence of the listening
                “public” Southey appeals to in his headnote suddenly becomes visible in the poem
                itself:<quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>He bade him pray, and knelt with him,</l>
            <l>And joined him in his prayers;</l>
            <l>And some who read the dreadful tale</l>
            <l>Perhaps will aid with theirs. (1815, lines 124–8)</l></lg></quote><note place="foot" resp="author"> This ending to the poem does not
                            appear in the editorial apparatus to the poem in <title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works,
                                1793–1810</title>, but I have
                            verified it in the original version.</note>
            This new ending introduces a question about whether
                readers will choose to pray for the sailor or not. “Some” will pray; others may
                decide the sailor is not worthy of such “aid.” Even as Southey notes that the sailor
                may not deserve such attention, however, he may also be indicting those contemporary
                readers who choose not to pray, since the rest of the poem has asked them to
                consider their own complicity in the violence of the Atlantic trade, and their own
                need for contrition. In other words, he may not only be asking readers to pray for
                the sailor, but also for their own sins. Where Coleridge is focused on the mariner’s
                singular crime and singular guilt, Southey is focused on how one prayer might become
                many prayers, as he tries to transform Coleridge’s emphasis on the mariner’s
                individual “soul in agony” into a sense of communal responsibility. At the same
                time, there is still an obvious ethical tension in Southey’s decision to allow the
                minister to pray for the sailor. The 1815 ending to the poem, like the 1799 version,
                centers on white guilt more than Black suffering, meaning that Marcus Wood’s point
                about the poem’s perspective still stands, despite this revision.</p>
                    <p>Where there is optimism for what this ballad might
                        achieve in the public sphere and about the public’s power to effect change, however,
                        there is also an implicit indictment of the public for allowing slavery to continue.
                        Southey’s decision to use one term, “public,” to include both those who allowed
                        slavery to continue and those who sought to end it (as well as those who were aware
                        of their complicity and those who weren’t) is more complex than it might seem. In
                        his headnote, Southey presages <foreign xml:lang="de">Jürgen Habermas’</foreign> theory of the relation between the
                        public and the counterpublic, by asking readers to identify themselves as part of a
                        group that has the potential to form its own countervailing discourse against
                        predominant public norms, while also acknowledging their own position within the
                        broader public sphere that is complicit in their production.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>I have aimed, here, to give an abolitionist poem the
                same quality of attention that other only seemingly simple poems in the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> have received. As responses to Southey’s poem
                show, Wordsworth and Coleridge’s disparagement of “the public” not only defined the
                taste by which Southey’s poems have been read by, but also, much more broadly,
                influenced the conditions in which antislavery poetry has been reproduced and
                received. This is a legacy that persists. It has long been acknowledged that the
                field of Romanticism has been subject to a structural problem that has meant it has
                evaluated abolitionist texts differently than other texts from the same period, yet
                even after that critique, biases remain. <title level="a">The Sailor</title> is one of the few abolitionist
                poems routinely found in anthologies: this is perhaps precisely because it bears a
                relationship to Coleridge’s more well-known poem. In closing, then, I wish to
                acknowledge that the process of tracing responses to Southey’s poem has caused me to
                reflect on my own decision to begin to write about it. As Marlon Ross has argued,
                many Romanticists focus “almost exclusively on how writers of the period approached
                abolition debates concerning the slave trade and colonial slavery” (25),
                perpetuating a system that has privileged white perspectives of slavery above the
                voices of enslaved people themselves. I close, then, with a reminder that the voices
                of the sailor and the mariner are heard against the backdrop of the forced silence
                of enslaved people themselves. The question of how to make this brutal act of
                silencing “as public as possible” still remains.</p></div>
