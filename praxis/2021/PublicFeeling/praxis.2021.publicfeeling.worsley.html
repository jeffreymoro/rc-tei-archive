            <p class="noCount">In his abolitionist poem 
               “The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade”
               (1799), Robert Southey ventriloquizes the story of a sailor who has murdered an enslaved
               woman onboard a “Guineaman.” Southey explains in a note to the poem that the sailor’s
               confession is a true story, which he wishes to make “as public as possible.” At the
               same time, however, Southey leaves many subtle clues that he is also imitating Samuel
               Taylor Coleridge’s ballad, “The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere” (1798). As he draws
               out the possibility that Coleridge’s mariner’s guilt is an allegory for the guilt
               involved in the Atlantic trade, Southey presses on the “public” uses the ballad form
               can be put to. A comparison between these poems therefore offers a case study for
               broader questions about the ethics of representation in abolitionist ballads designed
               to capture public feeling.</p>

               <p>In 
                  “The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade”
                   (1799), Robert Southey tells the story of a dissenting minister in Bristol who hears
                  the confession of a sailor who has murdered an unnamed enslaved woman aboard a ship.
                  The sequence of events that the poem narrates begins when the enslaved woman protests
                  her subjugation by refusing her food. The captain of the ship orders the sailor to
                  whip the woman in order to make her eat, but she continues to refuse food. The woman
                  subsequently suffers torture so horrific that she dies from her wounds the following
                  day. As the poem begins, the minister finds the sailor praying alone in a hovel. Although
                  the sailor insists that the murder was unintentional, he registers his guilt in his
                  descriptions of the way that the image of the dying woman follows him everywhere he
                  goes. Finally, he begs the dissenting minister for help: “O give me comfort if you
                  can— / Oh tell me where to fly / And bid me hope, if there be hope, / For one so lost
                  as I” (lines 113–6).

                           “The Sailor”
                           are from the 1799 version of Southey’s poem, reprinted in Robert Southey: Poetical
                           Works, 1793–1810, unless otherwise stated. As this edition notes, 
                           “The Sailor”
                           was first published in Poems (1799), extensively revised for Minor Poems (1815, 1823),
                           and also included in Poetical Works (1837) (288).</span></div>
                  </div> In the earliest version of the poem, the minister responds by encouraging the sailor
                  to flee the hovel and instead go to find a church in which to pray for his sins. In
                  the later versions, Southey has the minister join the sailor in prayer in the hovel
                  and enjoins others to do the same.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Implicit in this abolitionist narrative is a theory of how one individual's guilt
               might be converted into a public feeling, and how this, in turn, might inspire political
               action—alongside a series of ethical questions about what it means to use representations
               of the suffering of enslaved people in order to incite such feeling. Presumably, Southey
               believes that confronting people with this murder scene and its aftermath might convince
               them to adopt the abolitionist cause. Yet the ethics of Southey’s decision to use
               this story for abolitionist ends are deeply riven, since Southey himself, like the
               sailor, lacks empathy for the enslaved woman he represents. Not only does Southey
               refuse to grant her the dignity of a name; he also dehumanizes her when he instrumentalizes
               her pain for the benefit of his abolitionist audience. The abolitionist moral relies
               on the idea that forgiveness is still possible, not only for the sailor, but for British
               society as a whole—but this happens at the expense of the enslaved woman, who is not
               allowed any space to tell her own story. Marcus Wood has argued that 
               “The Sailor”
               is a “truly woeful ballad in every sense of the word . . . in which the slave inevitably
               emerges not as a suffering human but as a catalyst for the sailor ’s suffering” (201–2).
               By choosing to speak from the perspective of the sailor, rather than from the point
               of view of his victim, Southey capitulates to the biases of his majority-white audience.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The complications surrounding Southey’s positionality in relation to this story multiply,
                  however, when one realizes that this poem has been written in dialogue with Samuel
                  Taylor Coleridge’s ballad, 
                  “The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere, in Seven Parts”
                   (1798).

                           (2)

                           “The Rime”
                           are from the 1798 edition of the Lyrical Ballads in Coleridge’s Poetry and Prose.</span></div>
                  </div> At first glance, Southey’s graphic narration of the murder of an enslaved woman appears
                  to have very little in common with Coleridge’s poem: a supernatural tale that depicts
                  a series of strange events leading on from the moment the mariner shoots an albatross.
                  Yet the 
                  “Rime,”
                   at its root, is another ballad about a lonely sailor who has committed sins at sea
                  and thus becomes obsessed with his own guilt, even if his crime differs vastly in
                  scale from that of Southey’s sailor. Both the sailor and the mariner ask for sympathy,
                  even as they refuse to reflect on their responsibility for their actions. Focused
                  on the past and unable to engage with the present, they each inhabit a different temporality
                  from the people they encounter and are isolated by their compulsive storytelling.
                  Just as the ancient mariner sees spirits aboard his Spectre-Bark, Southey’s sailor
                  is haunted by “the wicked one” (line 106) everywhere he goes. Finally, while Southey’s
                  sailor asks the dissenting minister for help, Coleridge depicts the mariner asking
                  the hermit to shrieve him (“Oh shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!” (line 607)); both
                  the sailor and the mariner, (at least in the 1799 version of Southey’s poem), end
                  up at church.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Southey directly echoes Coleridge’s diction several times, suggesting he was inviting
               his audience to hear echoes of the 
               “Rime”
               in his poem. The mariner’s reflection on the moment he shoots the albatross, “And
               I had done a hellish thing” (line 89), clearly resounds in two of Southey’s sailor’s
               outbursts; “Oh I have done a wicked thing! / It haunts me night and day” (line 25),
               and “Oh I have done a cursed deed!” (line 53). The sailor stresses that the hovel
               he inhabits is “lonely” (line 26), just as the mariner stresses that he is “all alone”
               on the ship (line 224). Southey advertised his imitation of Coleridge much more boldly
               in 1815 than in 1799, when he changed his poem’s first line to read “It was a Christian
               Minister” (in order to directly echo the first line of Coleridge’s poem, “It was an
               Ancient Mariner”). Although these echoes are easy to catalogue, however, the question
               of what Southey might have meant to communicate in these echoes of the 
               “Rime”
               is more difficult to answer. In what follows, I argue that the changes Southey makes
               to Coleridge’s poem in his imitation reveal a fundamental difference in his methodological
               stance toward the cultivation of public feeling. Although the ballad might intuitively
               be called a “public” form, each poet imagines the way that this form mediates the
               relationship between the characters in the ballad and their audiences very differently.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The question of whether Southey understood himself to be translating the subject matter
                  of Coleridge’s poem to an entirely new context, or whether he aimed to bring its underlying
                  abolitionist message to the fore is debatable, though by now, it is commonly (though
                  not universally) accepted that Coleridge’s poem can already be read as an abolitionist
                  allegory in itself.

                           Barbara T. Paul-Emile, Patrick Keane, Peter Kitson, and Debbie Lee have also explored
                           the status of Coleridge’s poem as antislavery allegory. Marcus Wood objects to the
                           argument that Coleridge thought of his poem as an abolitionist text, however, calling
                           that argument a failed experiment. Emphasizing Coleridge’s superior sense of tact
                           in avoiding the subject of slavery, Wood argues that Coleridge understood “the essential
                           selfishness of the cult of sensibility, and of its inappropriateness as an imaginative

                  </div> Coleridge’s mariner’s overwhelming sense of guilt, as several critics have noted,
                  seems disproportionate to his crime of shooting the albatross and so might be best
                  explained by his repressed confession of involvement in the triangular trade.

                           standards of a world of balanced penalties, palpably does not fit the crime” (274–5),
                           yet, through the lens of Ware’s argument, the ancient mariner’s fascination with his
                           guilt becomes more appropriate.</span></div>
                  </div> Southey’s imitation means that he was in effect the first critic to note this. His
                  ability to see the allegory at work in the 
                  “Rime”
                   was likely informed by his friendship with Coleridge during the time they had both
                  spent living in Bristol in the mid-1790s. In 1795, Southey had witnessed Coleridge
                  give his 
                  “On the Slave Trade”
                   lecture in Bristol and was also making plans with him to emigrate to America to build
                  a new Pantisocratic community. Their plans for their utopian society unraveled over
                  time, partly because Southey wanted to take servants to the banks of the Susquehanna.
                  This paved the way for further poetic disagreements. By October 1798, Southey’s review
                  of the 
                  “Rime”
                   in the <em>Critical Review</em> publicly accused Coleridge of being too obscure (“We do not sufficiently understand
                  the story to analyze it . . . ”). This negative review is one of the things that Southey
                  became best known for in the twentieth century, as Lynda Pratt has observed, and has
                  therefore had a disproportionate influence on how his own poem has been read

               <p>Because Coleridge’s poem is much longer and more complex than Southey’s—with its supernatural
                  themes, mythic elements, and confusing symbolism—discussions of Southey’s imitation
                  of Coleridge have tended to argue that he simplified his source text. Southey has
                  often been characterized as a more “public” poet than Coleridge.

                           Butler has presented the political, public Southey as an alternative exemplary Romantic
                           figure to the Wordsworth that she sees constructed by the quietest, intellectual agendas
                           of the academy” (Butler,

                           poetic mode to the one normally defined as Romantic, one that is politically committed
                           and speaks with what Southey terms in another poem of 1798 ‘the calm, collected public
                           voice’” (Bainbridge…</span></div>
                  </div> As Mary Jacobus puts it, in an influential 1971 article on 
                  “Southey’s Debt to the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>”
                  : <span class="quote">‘What is idiosyncratic or disturbing in the poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge is replaced
                     by a topical or humanitarian interest of a quite straightforward kind: the poems become
                     not simply shallower, but more public… A generalized, symbolic study of guilt and
                     alienation [in 
                     “The Rime”
                     ] becomes an anti-slave-trade poem, its theme given immediate topical resonance and
                     its underlying moral emphasis made explicit. Gothic accretions and psychological depth
                     are stripped away to leave horror of an entirely straightforward kind. (30)’</span> Jacobus also stresses that Southey’s style is defined by his magazine audience—“In
                  some cases, poems from <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> are returned firmly to the level of the magazine poetry from which they had been raised,
                  stripped of their new thematic depth and sophistication” (24)—and notes that Southey
                  might also have been offering his poem as a corrective to the complexity of the 
                  “Rime.”
                   “One has to concede that his… borrowings represent a deliberate attempt to put right
                  what he had criticized in his review” (24), Jacobus concludes. This argument has been
                  very influential in readings of the poem. For instance, Patrick Keane concurs that
                  his ballad is a “straightforward” version of Coleridge’s poem (158). Christopher Smith
                  sees the poem as “an answer to Coleridge” (par. 3), arguing that “Southey converts
                  the disturbing open-endedness of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s work to sententious, clear-cut,
                  rapidly-moving stories, or emblems of suffering” (par. 8). Chris Rubenstein argues
                  that “Either Southey in his poem tells us . . . what Coleridge ought to have written
                  in the ‘Rime;’ or he writes—and I prefer this alternative—what he is reasonably certain
                  Coleridge had in mind” (24). More recently, David Chandler has aimed to correct this
                  consensus by offering Southey’s poem 
                  “The Old Woman of Berkeley”
                   as a more persuasive “answer” to Coleridge’s poem, arguing <span class="quote">‘There is no reason to question Southey’s assertion that his ballad was inspired by
                     a real story (<em>Poems</em> 105), however, and if that story was, in the telling, fertilized with ideas from 
                     “The Ancient Mariner,”
                      it does not mean that Southey conceived of it as an “answer” to the problems he found
                     in Coleridge’s poem. As he fully accepted and happily contributed to the genre of
                     the supernatural ballad, he must have realized that a political, “natural” ballad
                     like 
                     “The Sailor”
                      was generically too distinct from 
                     “The Ancient Mariner”
                      to challenge plausibly Coleridge’s experiment. (par. 5)’</span></p>

               <p>A tendency to criticize the simplistic nature of Southey’s didactic poem is balanced
                  with a generalized sense of admiration for Coleridge’s psychologically subtle approach
                  to the representation of guilt in the critical conversation about the possibility
                  of an abolitionist allegory in the “Rime.” Coleridge has been lauded for his success
                  at cultivating a disturbing feeling of identification with the mariner’s guilt in
                  his audience, precisely because he avoids describing why the mariner shoots the albatross,
                  or what this action might signify.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See, for instance, Tim Fulford: “distancing himself from contemporary events allowed
                           Coleridge to find terms which would let readers share the mental state that, he argued,
                           was produced by, and in turn reproduced, those events” (50). See also Joan Baum, who
                           argues in a reading of Wordsworth’s poem on Toussaint L’Ouverture that “the genius
                           of Romantic poetry is to avoid palpable or overt moral purpose, and explore the imaginative
                           consciousness of both the poet and humanity” (146).</span></div>
                  </div> This argument has a different logic when read in conversation with criticism of Southey’s
                  poem, however, than when read in relation to Coleridge’s poem alone. The juxtaposition
                  reveals a strange paradox, whereby 
                  “The Rime”
                   has not only been called a more successful poem than 
                  “The Sailor,”
                   but has also subtly been framed as a more successful abolitionist poem—despite never
                  directly mentioning the topic of slavery. Considering how many people have read and
                  discussed the 
                  “Rime”
                   without referencing the context of Atlantic slavery, however, questions remain about
                  how useful the generalized sense of guilt that Coleridge summons was to the project
                  of abolition.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The critical consensus that Southey’s poem is simplistic also requires reconsideration,
               since Southey complicates the status of Coleridge’s poem as abolitionist allegory
               while simplifying its underlying plot. For instance, he often seems to read Coleridge’s
               poem psychoanalytically, suggesting that Coleridge’s use of supernatural imagery might
               be read as a sign of the way that mention of the Atlantic trade has been repressed
               in the poem. In 
               “The Rime,”
               a “million million slimy things” haunt the ancient mariner’s field of vision after
               the mass death of the ship’s crew (lines 227–35); this image resurfaces in Southey’s
               description of the way that the enslaved woman’s dead body seems to refuse to sink
               after she has been thrown overboard. This perhaps implies that Coleridge was himself
               repressing a reference to the murdered bodies of enslaved people in his description
               of the “rotting sea” (line 232). Southey further excavates the unconscious of Coleridge’s
               poem by drawing a connection between the way the sailor describes his torture of the
               enslaved woman and the vision of his crime that later haunts him. Southey uses the
               verb “twist” twice; first to describe the enslaved woman’s pain— “She twisted from
               the blows” (line 81), and then later to describe how the sailor sees his victim’s
               dead body “twisting everywhere” in the water, long after the sea has closed “over
               her” (line 101). He thereby suggests there is a connection between the symbolic vehicle
               the sailor’s guilt takes on and the reason for the guilt itself and invites readers
               to think about whether this might also be true in the case of Coleridge’s poem. When
               he examines the unplumbed abolitionist depths of some of Coleridge’s supernatural
               symbolism, Southey draws attention to the way in which Coleridge allows some readers
               to disregard the context of slavery, in a way he will not himself allow.</p>
            <p>Beyond Southey’s decision to make his poem obviously abolitionist, and to translate
               supernatural references into descriptions of how the unconscious works, his decision
               to preface his version of the poem with a headnote that addresses the poem's "public"
               audience also offers a subtle commentary of Coleridge's methodology. He makes several
               further alterations to the setting and plot of Coleridge’s poem, when he decides to
               set the poem in a hovel, to convert the character of the wedding guest into the character
               of the dissenting minister, to add the character of a captain, and to introduce the
               question of whether the poem should end in prayer. None of these changes are merely
               incidental; each of them subject the mechanisms of Coleridge’s allegory to scrutiny,
               and many of them complicate, rather than simplify, Coleridge’s text. In what follows,
               I examine the effects of each of these revisions to Coleridge’s poem in detail, putting
               special emphasis on how they work to cultivate public, as well as private, feeling.
               In doing so, I do not mean to recuperate Southey’s poem, so much as offer a case study
               of the way in which abolitionist poetry's overt public purpose has changed the way
               it has been read.</p>

               <p>Southey never directly spoke of his poem as an imitation; instead, he repeatedly claimed
                  that the motivation for the poem came from a real-life encounter. In a letter to his
                  friend John May (26 September 1798), in which he first shares the poem, he describes
                  how he first heard the narrative from the Bristol publisher, Joseph Cottle:<span class="quote">‘A dissenting minister here, a man of unquestioned veracity, discovered the sailor
                     as you will find related: only last week &amp; Cottles mother took down the account from
                     his mouth. I have verified it as the best means of a story that ought to be widely
                     known. You will not I think object to the frequent ejaculations when you recollect
                     the effect which the whole is intended to produce. (<em>Robert Southey: Poetical Works</em> 288)’</span> Southey recounts the same details in a note to his brother Tom in October 1798 (although
                  this time he states that it was Cottle’s “friend,” rather than his “mother,” who first
                  heard the account): “This my dear Tom which Edith has copied for you is a true story.
                  It is about six weeks since a friend of Cottle found a sailor thus praying in a cowhouse
                  and held conversation with him of which the exact substance is in the ballad” (qtd.
                  in Rubinstein, 24).

                           the references in the letters to Tom and May (“one week” and “six weeks”) makes it
                           likely that the letter was sent in October 1798.</span></div>

            <p>If the sailor’s story does indeed have a basis in truth, notwithstanding Southey’s
               confusion about whether Cottle heard the story from his mother or his friend, it was
               mediated several times before Southey came across it. An ungenerous reading of Southey’s
               claim that the dissenting minister was the only source for his poem is that he was
               surreptitiously diverting attention away from his borrowings from Coleridge. Chris
               Rubenstein argues that “Southey must have fictionalized the origin of ‘The Sailor…’”
               (24). It is certainly possible that Southey could have invented the story of the sailor
               wholesale, as a kind of cover for his influence. However, the fact of the imitation
               does not discount the possibility that Southey had heard a story like the sailor’s
               and was therefore moved to think differently about Coleridge’s poem, or that he adapted
               a story he had heard in service of an imitation of the “Rime.” Since Southey leaves
               so many clues for observant readers that his poem is in conversation with the 
               “Rime,”
               however, I will set aside this unsolvable question, in order to instead focus on the
               effects of reading 
               “The Sailor”
               as an imitation.</p>

               <p>The headnote itself can also be read as a self-conscious experiment with—and revision

                  “Advertisement”
                   of the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798). With the status of the poem as imitation in view, echoes of Wordsworth and
                  Coleridge’s 
                  “Advertisement”
                   abound in Southey’s headnote:<span class="quote">‘In September, 1798, a Dissenting Minister of Bristol, discovered a Sailor in the neighbourhood
                     of that City, groaning and praying in a hovel. The circumstance that occasioned his
                     agony of mind is detailed in the annexed Ballad, without the slightest addition or
                     alteration. By presenting it as a Poem, the story is made more public; and such stories
                     ought to be made as public as possible. (<em>Robert Southey: Poetical Works</em> 289)’</span> Southey’s reference to the date, 1798, and his emphasis on the authenticity of the
                  ballad indicates that his interaction with the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> is hiding in plain sight.

                           in his headnote, too, “agony of mind,” recalls Coleridge’s mariner’s line, “And Christ
                           would take no pity on / My soul in agony” (lines 226–7).</span></div>
                  </div> In his emphasis on the veracity of his source, Southey, like Wordsworth and Coleridge,
                  builds on tradition that Thomas Percy began when he traveled extensively around the
                  British Isles to collect and record folk ballads in his <em>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</em> (1765).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s transformation of his source text into a poem also chimes with Percy’s tendency
                           to correct or make changes to the songs he recorded, which was well documented by
                           this period.</span></div>
                  </div> In keeping with the trend which valued ballads directly transcribed from singers’
                  mouths more highly than those already written down, and presenting himself as a kind
                  of ethnographer, Southey privileges the orality of his text. His insistence that there
                  has been no “addition or alteration” to the sailor’s words obviously contradicts his
                  statement that the story is being “presented” as a poem, yet he preserves a sense
                  of verisimilitude by noting that he has merely fitted the sailor’s words to verse,
                  rather than asking readers to imagine that the sailor originally spoke in ballad meter.
                  By removing the mention of Cottle as an intermediary in the headnote (as opposed to
                  the letters), Southey instead makes the ballad form itself the vessel for the transmission
                  of the tale. He presents the ballad as a medium that takes a story, changes it in
                  a way that makes it more likely to be shared, and then relies on its audience for
                  distribution (akin to something like a meme today). The story has already passed from
                  one member of the public (the sailor) to another (the dissenting minister); the ballad
                  form will allow it to spread much further. As song, the ballad will become the agent
                  of its own re-creation, even beyond the circulation of the printed text. Southey’s
                  suggestion that converting the sailor’s story to ballad meter makes it more transmissible
                  anticipates Wordsworth’s statement in the later 
                  “Preface”
                   to the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1802), that the story of 
                  “Goody Blake and Harry Gill”
                   was “communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it, had
                  it not been narrated as a Ballad” (112).

                  </div> From a cynical perspective, when Southey acknowledges that he thinks it necessary
                  to “present” the sailor’s story as a poem, he hints that he thinks his audience might
                  only be persuaded to listen to truths about the Atlantic trade if its horrors are
                  aestheticized or packaged in “a poem.” Yet swapping an emphasis on imitation for one
                  on mediated speech is also a Coleridgean method. Maureen McLane and Celeste Langan
                  have explored the ways in which Wordsworth and Coleridge highlight the status of their
                  ballads as mediated texts. In the end, Southey’s experiment in mediation seems truer
                  to the principles in the 
                  “Advertisement”
                   than Coleridge’s poem itself: a comparison between Southey’s poem and Coleridge’s
                  (especially the first version, with the antiquated spelling which Wordsworth so disliked),
                  reveals Southey to be closer to “the language of conversation” than Coleridge was.

               His insistence that the ballad was taken down “from the mouth” of the sailor and his
               apparent misgivings about the style of the sailor’s diction in his “frequent ejaculations,”
               for instance, mimics Wordsworth and Coleridge’s concern that readers might think “the
               author has sometimes descended too low, and that many of his expressions are too familiar,
               and not of sufficient dignity” (
               “Advertisement,”
               3). Cottle was the person responsible for showing Southey the <em>MS</em> version of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> in May 1798 (see Jacobus 21), so he was certainly the intermediary who carried the
               inspiration for the poem to Southey, one way or another, and Southey’s reference to
               Cottle’s role as conduit for the story could even be a coy way of gesturing toward
               this. Cottle’s mother (or friend) could also be considered an avatar of the wedding
               guest, who receives a version of the poem from the mariner’s mouth, unmediated by
               text.</p>

               <p>Once the similarities between Southey’s headnote and the 1798 
                  “Advertisement”
                   are clear, it becomes easier to see how Southey also diverges from Coleridge’s example
                  in 
                  “The Rime”
                   when he emphasizes the "public" nature of his ballad. This stands out as a crucial
                  difference between his framing of his poem and Coleridge's. Where Coleridge prefers
                  to locate his ballad in a mythical landscape, Southey prompts his audience to recognize
                  the poem’s currency by noting the date (September 1798). Southey also encourages his
                  audience to imagine themselves as part of the “public” in a way that Coleridge avoids.
                  Rather than relying on a pre-established category for defining the public, the headnote
                  calls its own public into being. Since such a small percentage of the population of
                  Britain could vote in 1799, it seems less likely that Southey straightforwardly equates
                  the phrase “the public” with the “voting public,” than that he also envisions his
                  public to also include disenfranchised citizens as he incites readers to coalesce
                  as a group.

               <p>Whereas Southey openly displays his poem’s didactic purpose, Coleridge was more wary
                  of doing so. In <em>Table Talk</em>, he recalls Anna Barbauld’s objection that the 
                  “Rime”
                   had no moral, in order to underline that he considered the “obtrusion of moral sentiment”
                  a “chief fault” in the poem.

                           “The Ancient Mariner”
                           in Table Talk, Coleridge noted “Mrs Barbauld once told me that she admired The Ancient
                           Mariner very much, but that there were two faults in it—it was improbable, and had
                           no moral. As for the probability, I owned that that might admit some question; but
                           as to the want of a moral, I told her that in my own judgement the poem had too much;
                           and that the only, or chief fault, if I might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral
                           sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such
                           pure imagination” (vol. I, 272).</span></div>
                  </div> As Malcolm Ware notes, Coleridge’s poem does conclude a version of a moral, in the
                  aphoristic line, “He prayeth well who loveth well, / Both man and bird and beast,”
                  (lines 645–6) and the wedding guest leaves his encounter “a sadder and a wiser man”
                  (line 657). Yet this was as much as Coleridge was willing to offer in terms of didacticism:
                  the statement “as public as possible” is anathema to his methodology. Since both Wordsworth
                  and Coleridge’s criticism of the “public” became increasingly vehement, Southey’s
                  emphasis on making the story “as public as possible” has made his poem seem less and
                  less Coleridgean as time has gone on. The 1802 “Preface” to the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> speaks briefly of its wish to appeal to “the approbation of the Public” (115) but
                  after this, Wordsworth and Coleridge quickly begin to vilify this group.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Although it seems counterintuitive that Wordsworth and Coleridge attack the public
                  while also valorizing “the real language of men,” the position makes more sense in
                  light of the knowledge that they did not use the term “public” to denote the “public
                  sphere.” Instead, they used it in a more complex way to describe a group of people
                  whose views were governed by tastemakers and trends. Both Wordsworth and Coleridge
                  distinguished between the “public” (whom they disliked) and the “people” (whom they
                  admired). The most famous explanation of the way they each understood the distinction
                  can be found in Wordsworth’s 
                  “Essay Supplementary to the Preface”
                   of his <em>Poems</em> (1815), where he draws on Edmund Burke to argue that the People are worthy of much
                  more respect than the made-up category of “the Public”:<span class="quote">‘Still more lamentable is his error who can believe that there is any thing of divine
                     infallibility in the clamour of that small though loud portion of the community, ever
                     governed by factitious influence, which, under the name of the PUBLIC, passes itself,
                     upon the unthinking, for the PEOPLE. Towards the Public, the Writer hopes that he
                     feels as much deference as it is entitled to: but to the People, philosophically characterized,
                     and to the embodied spirit of their knowledge, so far as it exists and moves, at the
                     present, faithfully supported by its two wings, the past and the future, his devout
                     respect, his reverence, is due. (661–2)’</span> As Georgina Green summarizes, Wordsworth is interested here in the opposition between
                  a group interested in “transitory” versus “transhistorical” ideals (<em>The Majesty</em> 146). Wordsworth summed up this argument more laconically when he famously quipped
                  that “The people would love the poem of <em>Peter Bell,</em> but the Public (a very different being) will never love it” (<em>Letters</em> 329). Like Wordsworth, Coleridge also often referred to his dislike of the public.
                  In the <em>Biographia Literaria,</em> for instance, he disparages “the multitudinous PUBLIC,” as “shaped into personal unity
                  by the magic of an abstraction” (59); he objects to the notion that a multitude might
                  think in the same way.

            <p>Wordsworth and Coleridge’s argument about the difference between the public and the
               people has political consequences for their work, though it had humbler beginnings,
               since it seems to have largely resulted from a defensive reaction to negative reviews
               of the <em>Lyrical Ballads.</em> Anthony Harding’s explanation that Wordsworth and Coleridge’s use of the term “public”
               might make more sense if understood as a reference to a “reading public” is useful
               here (113). In various letters written in the wake of the 
               “Rime,”
               Coleridge insists that no one person should imagine they can speak for the public’s
               opinion. He calls the public “an imaginary word” which is “of pernicious effect by
               habituating every Reader to consider himself as the Judge &amp; therefore the Superior
               of the Writer who yet if he has any justifiable claim to write ought to be his Superior”
               (<em>Biographia</em> 57, note 3). At the same time, however, Coleridge argues that the way literary reviewers
               conceive of “the public” will, in turn, impact the way politics are conducted, hinting
               at the way that his own decision to disavow the public has political implications.
               Coleridge foresees in the new tendency for critics to describe how the public will
               receive texts the advent of an era in which individual readers cannot be expected
               to have their own opinion, or individually evaluate what they read, which will then
               affect how “the State” treats them:<span class="quote">‘The Root of the Evil is a Public—and take my word for it, this will wax more prolific
                  of inconvenience, that at length it will scarcely be possible for the State to suffer
                  any truth to be published, because it will be certain to convey a dangerous falsehood
                  to 99 out of a hundred. (“To T.G. Street” 713)’</span> Essentially, Coleridge is suggesting here that once the public assent to the idea
               that they are part of a group whose opinions can be formed by publications, the status
               of “truth” itself will become suspect. Thus Coleridge’s disgust for the notion that
               the public would all respond in a similar way after reading a review aligns with his
               disinterest in allowing a didactic abolitionist moral to intrude in “The Rime of the
               Ancyent Marinere.” The problem with Wordsworth and Coleridge’s resistance to imagining
               their audience as a public, however, is that the cause of abolition requires imagining
               an audience situated in a particular historical moment, and also requires people to
               be persuaded to act by means of the “clamour” of a “small though loud portion of the
               community.” Coleridge likely did not expect his ideas about “the public” to affect
               the way other people’s abolition poems were received, yet his decision to dwell on
               the difference between the public and the people has had this unfortunate effect.</p>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Coleridge begins by demonstratively portraying the mariner separating the wedding
               guest from a group of people in order to tell him his tale. Though this emphasis on
               “one of three” has sometimes been read as a Biblical allusion (since Jesus is unrecognized
               as one of the three travelers on the road to Emmaus [Luke 24:13–35]), the lines also
               emphasize the one-on-one interaction between the mariner and the wedding guest. Coleridge’s
               1834 marginal gloss also emphasizes the singularity of the wedding guest: “An ancient
               Mariner meeteth three gallants bidden to a wedding feast, and detaineth one” (Norton
               61). This creates an opportunity for single readers to imagine that they receive an
               individual hearing of the poem. When Coleridge explains that the mariner will melancholically
               repeat his tale over and over again, he further encourages individual readers of “The
               Rime” to imagine themselves being stopped, one by one, in order to hear the next iteration
               of the tale.</p>
            <p>Although Coleridge emphasizes the way he wants his readers to form their own opinions,
               however, he does not give the internal audience in his poem a choice about whether
               to listen to his tale. Instead, the mariner compels the wedding guest to submit to
               his story by separating him from the group and performing a supernatural kind of hypnotism
               on him. By emptying the wedding guest of volition, Coleridge makes him a kind of vessel
               for the mariner’s story to fill:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">

            <p> Whereas the mariner intrudes into a scene of sociability in order to assault the
               wedding guest with his tale, Southey suggests the minister has more of a choice about
               whether to cross the threshold of the hovel to enter into this withdrawn space. Thus,
               Southey also encourages his poem’s readers to feel that they also have a choice about
               whether to listen to the sailor’s story, alongside the minister. In this, he grants
               his readers a sense of agency about whether to count themselves among the number of
               the “public” he refers to in the headnote.</p>
            <p>Southey’s hovel provides a location where a collective abolitionist public can form,
               allowing his audience to conceptualize a space in which they might metaphorically
               gather, despite being physically separated by time and space:</p>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> When the minister enters into the confined space of the hovel, he also metaphorically
               enters into the intimate space of a confessional box; a space situated somewhere between
               the public and the private sphere. Just as the confessional is an enclosed space which
               two people occupy within the larger space of the church, the hovel is situated within
               the city of Bristol and yet also separate from its hurry. Southey’s decision to situate
               the poem here, a significant departure from the 
               “Rime,”
               also provides a spatial metaphor for how the public’s entrance into the space of the
               sailor’s consciousness might work. One might imagine that the sailor would immediately
               break off his lament on seeing the minister enter, but as Southey depicts him, he
               hardly notices the entrance of the minister into the hovel. Instead, he continues
               to “groan” (line 18) and say his prayers as if no change had occurred. The subtle
               way Southey figures the setting for his sailor’s confession means that the minister
               is not merely a proxy for individual listeners; he is also a metonym for the “public”
               that Southey mentions in the headnote, as they collectively enter into the space of
               the sailor’s mindset.</p>

                  </blockquote> Despite his repeated insistence that his “sin” torments him, the sailor remains unreflective
                  about the events that led up to his crime. The sailor was not “innocent” at the point
                  that he took “three hundred” people onto a ship, yet still insists on continuing to
                  willfully overlook the violence of the act he participated in. When Southey slips
                  in the detail that the sailor’s ship, like Coleridge’s ship, embarks “merrily” (line
                  63), he not only indicts the sailor for his carelessness, but also the ancient mariner
                  as well. The bouncing merriness of Southey’s ballad meter is obviously opposed to
                  the sailor’s subject matter, emphasizing the profanity of the idea that anyone could
                  believe that this kind of ship could sail “merrily.” Nonetheless, an audience has
                  to viscerally participate in the sailor’s use of meter, and so is also forced to confront
                  this tension.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In his depiction of the sailor’s insouciance, Southey subtly reminds his readers that
               people not directly involved in the violence of the Atlantic trade are still guilty
               of perpetuating the system, even if they consider themselves “innocent” (line 60).
               At a time when consumer habits drove the violence forward, William Wilberforce often
               made the argument that slavery was a moral degradation for all members of the British
               public, not just the people directly involved in it. In a speech he made on 12 May
               1789, he cast all citizens in the role of those who had done “cursed deeds”:<span class="quote">‘We are all guilty. We ought to plead guilty, and not to exculpate ourselves by throwing
                  the blame on others… when we reflect it is we ourselves that have degraded them to
                  that wretched brutishness and barbarity which we now plead as the justification of
                  guilt.” (qtd. in Sonoi 28)’</span> Southey encourages individual members of the public to realize that they share in
               the blame for the sailor’s crime, even if they have not themselves committed it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The ballad form also emphasizes this sense of a shared “public” guilt. Anyone who
                  reads Southey’s ballad reads it knowing that many others have spoken, and will speak,
                  in chorus with him. Even if the sailor seems to be voicing private pain, he does so
                  using a “public” form. Susan Stewart’s theory of lyric possession, alongside readings
                  of abolitionist poems that rely on it, such as Ivan Ortiz’s work on 
                  “Lyric Possession in the Abolitionist Ballad,”
                   is instructive here.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> The sailor’s voice, <em>qua</em> ballad, is always already inhabited by other voices, joining in a chorus that transcends
                  time and space: speaking singly and communally at once. Both the hovel and the ballad
                  form are containers for Southey’s public: the ballad, like the hovel, marks out a
                  space for a collective confession, spoken through the sailor’s only seemingly individual
                  voice. The way the ballad form functions as a middle space between the private and
                  the public can be conceptually compared with the way the hovel functions as a middle
                  space between the sailor’s private life and the public space of Bristol which surrounds
                  him.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The ancient mariner also speaks in ballad meter, which means that his audience outside
               the poem can also recognize his narrative as an entrance into a form of collective
               consciousness with other readers outside the space of the poem. In Coleridge’s poem,
               however, even those readers who identify with the mariner’s sense of guilt, and acknowledge
               that other readers are also doing so, can still escape a confrontation with their
               own role in the complicity in the violence of slavery, because the allegorical mode
               allows them security. For a reader reciting Southey’s ballad, by contrast, there is
               no refuge in metaphor. No member of Southey’s public can join voices with the sailor
               without also confronting the brutal horror of the “cursed deeds” that the lack of
               an abolition ruling was causing.</p>

               <p>The ethical value of asking an audience to put themselves in the position of the guilty
                  sailor becomes increasingly strained as the poem continues, however. Although Southey’s
                  sailor sounds very like Coleridge’s mariner in the opening lines of his speech, his
                  confession suddenly takes on a very different tone when he starts to narrate the way
                  he was forced to torture the enslaved woman, while also emphasizing his own suffering.
                  No sooner has the sailor confessed to the murder than he begins to insist on his own
                  status as a victim, harping on the pain his guilt causes. Perhaps Southey may have
                  defended his representation of such extreme selfishness by arguing that he was parodying
                  the Coleridge’s mariner’s focus on himself. Certainly, the mariner comes to seem more
                  culpable through the lens of Southey’s poem: 
                  “The Sailor”
                   offers an implicit critique of how problematic Coleridge’s emphasis on the mariner’s
                  obsession with his own suffering becomes if the poem is read in an abolitionist context.
                  Yet this section of the sailor’s narration of his crime is violent in other ways,
                  too, and should come with a content warning:

                  </blockquote> When Southey adds the character of the captain to his depiction of this scene of torture,
                  he may be referencing Isaac Cruikshank’s well-known image of a notorious scene in
                  which Captain Kimber ordered an enslaved woman to be whipped. In this image, which
                  I have chosen not to reprint here, the woman who is being whipped by a sailor has
                  been stripped of her clothes, suggesting that she has been sexually assaulted, while
                  a lascivious captain in the foreground of the frame unabashedly meets the viewer’s
                  gaze. The euphemistic title of the image also draws attention to the way she has been
                  assaulted: 
                  “The abolition of the slave trade Or the inhumanity of dealers in human flesh exemplified
                  in Captn. Kimber’s treatment of a young Negro girl of 15 for her virjen (sic) modesty.”
                   The “public” Southey addresses would likely have heard of this case, because Wilberforce
                  referenced it in a speech denouncing Kimber in the early 1790s.

                  </div> This intertext points to the way that any reference to the torture of an enslaved
                  woman can be understood to be sexualized, even if Southey does not make overt reference
                  to sexual assault. Yet by asking viewers to meet the captain’s gaze, Cruikshank also
                  dramatizes the way in which viewers to some extent participate in a scene like this
                  when they observe it. Even if Cruikshank might defend his picture by saying that the
                  representation of such a scene is designed to limit violence, he also encourages viewers
                  to become complicit onlookers to violence within the scene itself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Southey’s description of the torture of the enslaved woman, like Cruikshank’s drawing,
                  also enacts violence, as well as recording it. His representation of the sailor’s
                  confession is a stark example of the violence often inherent in the representation
                  of violence done to Black bodies by white abolitionists (and primarily for white abolitionists).
                  The very fact of his decision to represent this scene is ethically problematic, because
                  of the way that it makes the woman’s pain instrumental. Critical reactions to the
                  recordings and representations of Black suffering today offer a theoretical lens through
                  which to understand the harm that Southey’s abolitionist tactic causes. Reflecting
                  on the videos of the beating of Rodney King in 1991, Elizabeth Alexander has noted
                  that the video of King’s assault circulated in such a way as to inure viewers to the
                  violence, even when those circulating the images did so with the intention of bringing
                  justice. Alexander’s argument, which details the ways in which the recordings of violence
                  can function as a tool of white supremacy, can also be applied to representations
                  of violence. Christina Sharpe also explores the ethics of representation when she
                  provides a chronology through which to understand the critique of Dana Schutz’s painting
                  of Emmett Till. Sharpe’s logic can be applied to a viewing of Southey’s tableau: when
                  he chooses to represent the murder of an enslaved Black woman, he also incites associations
                  with previous representations of enslaved women, which have taught viewers to exert
                  their gaze in a different way than they might confront images of violence done to
                  white bodies. Looking at such violence is not simply a passive condition: it is an
                  act that participates in a hierarchical structure imbued with its own history of violence.

            <p>The sailor has not learned from his representation of his victim’s suffering to understand
               the woman’s humanity. He twice calls the woman he has murdered “sulky” for her decision
               to refuse food, dismissing her act of protest (lines 65, 69). The violence Southey
               himself does to the enslaved woman continues in the way he has the sailor describe
               her death: “She groan’d and groan’d, but her groans grew / Fainter at morning tide
               (lines 93–4). Thus the enslaved woman’s suffering is slowly rendered inaudible as
               she dies, her subjecthood growing “fainter” alongside her groans. By emphasizing the
               way in which she seemingly disappears as her groans diminish, the sailor also diminishes
               the force of her suffering, in order to turn his attention back towards his own groans
               in the hovel—“So I came here alone, / That I might freely kneel and pray, / And call
               on Christ and groan” (lines 29–31). The sailor further heightens the sense that he
               has learned very little when he begins to complain that his suffering is worse than
               the woman’s. Repeatedly trivializing his victim’s pain, the sailor seems incapable
               of understanding it, despite having put himself in the woman’s position for other
               more selfish reasons. His frequent comparisons of himself to her are outrageous: “She
               could not be more glad than I / When she was taken down” (lines 85–6), he says. His
               assertion that he is envious of the “rest” his victim has been granted in death is
               also grotesque:</p>

            <p> Looking back at the beginning of the poem through the lens of these lines, the sailor
               seems increasingly self-obsessed. Early in the poem, for instance, the sailor says
               he wishes he had drowned before he committed the murder, only to later describe how
               the sea did in fact swallow the enslaved woman. The status of the poem as an imitation
               or parody does not absolve Southey of the violence of his representation at moments
               like this.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Southey’s addition of the character of the captain—another departure from the narrative
               of the 
               “Rime”
               —might also be seen to increase the violence of Southey’s representation, as compared
               with Coleridge’s poem. Whereas Coleridge’s mariner stresses that it was his own decision
               to commit his crime (even though he doesn’t understand why he did it), Southey’s sailor
               argues that he was forced to do so. His argument that the captain was “worse” than
               him seems designed to absolve himself of blame, and Southey could be seen to be absolving
               the sailor of his sin when he encourages the public to channel their outrage at the
               captain, rather than the sailor himself. From the sailor’s perspective, it is as if
               the captain refuses to “spare” him, as well as the woman, when he orders the whipping.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>From another perspective, however, Southey’s decision to exaggerate the sailor’s self-interest
                  could be read as a critique of the sailor’s denial of his responsibility. The way
                  that Southey introduces the character of the captain just at the moment that the true
                  force of his violence emerges exposes the sailor’s inability to accept culpability
                  for his crime, and therefore a lack of true contrition. To this extent, his insistence
                  that he was not in control of his own “hand” does not absolve him of the crime. This
                  exploration of how a network of blame-shifting allows the slave trade to function
                  looks forward to Hannah Arendt’s theory of the banality of evil.

               <p>The status of Southey’s own ethical position <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">vis-à-vis</span> the sailor also becomes much more complex when Coleridge’s lecture 
                  “On the Slave Trade”
                   in Bristol in 1795 is brought into view as another intertext for the poem. Although
                  there is no “Captain” in the 
                  “Rime,”
                   Coleridge had emphasized the plight of sailors at the hands of such captains in the
                  lecture. In Bristol, Coleridge looked forward to an argument Thomas Clarkson would
                  also make, when he described the brutal psychological and physical damage that sailors
                  press-ganged into going to sea suffered and argued that they should also be considered
                  victims. The printed version of the lecture, published in <em>The Watchman</em> (1796), offers a crucial intertext for Coleridge’s representation of the mariner,
                  and also offers the possibility that Southey may have seen himself to be amplifying
                  a message he finds in Coleridge’s poem about the sympathy that mariners were due:<span class="quote">‘For the officers, employed as the immediate instrument of buying, selling, and torturing
                     human Flesh, must from the moral necessity of their circumstances become dead to every
                     feeling of confession. From the brutality of their Captain and the unwholesomeness
                     of the Climate through which they pass, it has been calculated that every Slave Vessel
                     from the Port of Bristol loses on average almost a fourth of the whole Crew—and so
                     far is the Trade from being a nursery for Seamen, that the Survivors are rather shadows
                     in their appearance than men and frequently perish in Hospitals after the completion
                     of their Voyage . . . (238).’</span><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">

                           the violence they commit, might find an echo in his depiction of the dead crew aboard
                           the ship in

                  </div> Southey perhaps mimics the argument of the <em>Lecture</em> when he foregrounds the “brutality” of a “Captain” in his poem. Although Southey’s
                  sailor has not become fully dead to confession in the way Coleridge describes, he
                  could be said to live a kind of undead life after he murders the woman. Peter Linebaugh
                  and Marcus Rediker note that sailors often saw themselves on a continuum with the
                  enslaved, since the predominance of press-gangs meant that they were not always in
                  control of their decision to go to sea.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Linebaugh and Rediker: “For sailors, the press-gang represented slavery and death:
                           three out of four pressed men died within two years, with only one in five of the
                           dead expiring in battle. Those lucky enough to survive could not expect to be paid,
                           as it was not uncommon, writes John Ehrman, the preeminent scholar of the navy of
                           the 1690s, for a seaman to be owed a decade's wages. The figure of the starving, often
                           lame sailor in the seaport town became a permanent feature of European civilization,
                           even as the motley crew became a permanent feature of modern navies” (151).</span></div>
                  </div> Southey gives many clues that the sailor considers himself to be at the mercy of the
                  captain. The ambiguity of subject and object in the sailor’s utterance, “We were forced
                  by threats and blows to make them eat,” means that it is unclear whether the sailor
                  is the only one doing the beating or is also himself being beaten and threatened as
                  he is forced to act. The title Southey gives to his poem, 
                  “The Sailor who had <em>Served</em> in the Slave Trade”
                   (my emphasis), also invites a comparison between servitude and enslavement. Southey
                  perhaps even subtly invokes a sonic link between the sailor as “chattel” and “cattle”
                  when he says he “has no place to pray onboard” and decides to exile himself in a “cow-house,”
                  as the 1815 <em>Preface</em> puts it.

            <p>Whether or not Southey meant to defend the sailor’s position, the presence of the
               captain in his poem draws attention to how the structures of slavery work to disperse
               guilt; a strategy that is not so apparent in Coleridge’s poem. When Southey adds the
               detail that the captain authored the woman’s murder by merely <em>standing by</em>, he underlines the fact that guilty actors are not necessarily the people who commit
               the violence, they are also those who insist their hands are clean while creating
               the conditions in which violence occurs. Speaking on the issue of police brutality
               today, Angela Davis has argued that it is not enough to blame the individual police
               officers who have committed murder, or demand that they be punished. Instead, she
               argues, the emphasis must be on collective consciousness of collective responsibility:
               “The major challenge of this period is to infuse a consciousness of the structural
               character of state violence” (22). Southey’s addition of the character of the captain,
               when read in relation to his phrase, “as public as possible,” might be read as a similar
               call to draw attention to the need for structural change, rather than merely focus
               attention on individual actors.</p>
            <p>By dramatizing the sailor’s indictment of the captain alongside evidence of his monstrous
               self-interest, Southey demonstrates that the functioning of Atlantic slavery relies
               on people trying to absolve themselves of guilt by creating a hierarchy of blame,
               drawing attention to the way in which a logic of individualized guilt allows the continuation
               of violence. Because of the way Southey triangulates the agency of the sailor’s crime,
               readers cannot condemn either the sailor or the captain without also implicating themselves
               in the guilt of the system he decries. That is, as soon as a reader condemns either
               the sailor’s or the captain’s violence, that reader becomes someone who justifies
               their own role in the system of the slave trade by also blaming someone else. The
               moment that readers decide that either the captain <em>or</em> the sailor is “worse than” them, they also suddenly employ the sailor’s logic of
               shifting the blame. Thus, Southey complicates Coleridge’s plot, and once again foregrounds
               his interest in inciting a collective sense of responsibility in the public, as he
               subtly confronts them with the question of whether they might themselves be guilty
               of tacitly “standing by” as others commit violence on their behalf. The addition of
               the captain not only implicates Southey’s “public” in the dispersal of guilt, it also
               asks them to cohere on that basis.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Praying Together in 1815</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>Another way that Southey complicates Coleridge’s poem is to problematize the question
               of what it means for the mariner to end up being allowed to pray in the church at
               the end of the 
               “Rime.”
               In the 1799 version of his poem, Southey merely echoes the end of Coleridge’s poem,
               when he pictures the minister sending the sailor out of the hovel and towards the
               church, where he can “hear the word of God” (line 123). The minister assures the sailor
               that he can find “help” there (line 124); and that “All sins shall be forgiven” (line
               120). In the 
               “Rime,”
               Coleridge had similarly stressed the mariner’s transition from isolation to “goodly
               company,” emphasizing the mariner’s joy at being able to go to church with other people
               after his time alone on the ship. If Coleridge’s poem is read as an allegory about
               a slave-ship, the mariner benefits from the doctrine of “Amazing Grace” when he is
               rescued by the hermit and allowed “To walk together to the Kirk / And all together
               pray” (lines 637–8).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>When Southey revises his poem in 1815, however, he makes the sailor’s—and the public’s—passage
                  to absolution seem less easy, since he de-emphasizes the idea that the sailor will
                  straightforwardly be granted forgiveness for his sins. Rather than allowing the sailor
                  to go to church, he decides to leave the sailor in the hovel, frustrating the sense
                  of hope and resolution granted to him in 1799. At this very moment, he also demonstratively
                  ushers the poem’s readers into the space of the hovel when he suddenly asks a question
                  about whether they will pray alongside the sailor and the minister. In this way, the
                  presence of the listening “public” Southey appeals to in his headnote suddenly becomes
                  visible in the poem itself:
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">He bade him pray, and knelt with him,</div>
                        <div class="l">And joined him in his prayers;</div>
                        <div class="l">And some who read the dreadful tale</div>
                        <div class="l">Perhaps will aid with theirs. (1815, lines 124–8)</div>
                     </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note25" id="Note25_return"><sup class="super">
                           (25)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This ending to the poem does not appear in the editorial apparatus to the poem in
                           Robert Southey: Poetical Works, 1793–1810, but I have verified it in the original
                           version.</span></div>
                  </div> This new ending introduces a question about whether readers will choose to pray for
                  the sailor or not. “Some” will pray; others may decide the sailor is not worthy of
                  such “aid.” Even as Southey notes that the sailor may not deserve such attention,
                  however, he may also be indicting those contemporary readers who choose not to pray,
                  since the rest of the poem has asked them to consider their own complicity in the
                  violence of the Atlantic trade, and their own need for contrition. In other words,
                  he may not only be asking readers to pray for the sailor, but also for their own sins.
                  Where Coleridge is focused on the mariner’s singular crime and singular guilt, Southey
                  is focused on how one prayer might become many prayers, as he tries to transform Coleridge’s
                  emphasis on the mariner’s individual “soul in agony” into a sense of communal responsibility.
                  At the same time, there is still an obvious ethical tension in Southey’s decision
                  to allow the minister to pray for the sailor. The 1815 ending to the poem, like the
                  1799 version, centers on white guilt more than Black suffering, meaning that Marcus
                  Wood’s point about the poem’s perspective still stands, despite this revision.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Where there is optimism for what this ballad might achieve in the public sphere and
               about the public’s power to effect change, however, there is also an implicit indictment
               of the public for allowing slavery to continue. Southey’s decision to use one term,
               “public,” to include both those who allowed slavery to continue and those who sought
               to end it (as well as those who were aware of their complicity and those who weren’t)
               is more complex than it might seem. In his headnote, Southey presages <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Jürgen Habermas’</span> theory of the relation between the public and the counterpublic, by asking readers
               to identify themselves as part of a group that has the potential to form its own countervailing
               discourse against predominant public norms, while also acknowledging their own position
               within the broader public sphere that is complicit in their production.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>I have aimed, here, to give an abolitionist poem the same quality of attention that
               other only seemingly simple poems in the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> have received. As responses to Southey’s poem show, Wordsworth and Coleridge’s disparagement
               of “the public” not only defined the taste by which Southey’s poems have been read
               by, but also, much more broadly, influenced the conditions in which antislavery poetry
               has been reproduced and received. This is a legacy that persists. It has long been
               acknowledged that the field of Romanticism has been subject to a structural problem
               that has meant it has evaluated abolitionist texts differently than other texts from
               the same period, yet even after that critique, biases remain. 
               “The Sailor”
               is one of the few abolitionist poems routinely found in anthologies: this is perhaps
               precisely because it bears a relationship to Coleridge’s more well-known poem. In
               closing, then, I wish to acknowledge that the process of tracing responses to Southey’s
               poem has caused me to reflect on my own decision to begin to write about it. As Marlon
               Ross has argued, many Romanticists focus “almost exclusively on how writers of the
               period approached abolition debates concerning the slave trade and colonial slavery”
               (25), perpetuating a system that has privileged white perspectives of slavery above
               the voices of enslaved people themselves. I close, then, with a reminder that the
               voices of the sailor and the mariner are heard against the backdrop of the forced
               silence of enslaved people themselves. The question of how to make this brutal act
               of silencing “as public as possible” still remains.</p>

               was first published in <em>Poems</em> (1799), extensively revised for <em>Minor Poems</em> (1815, 1823), and also included in <em>Poetical Works</em> (1837) (288).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Barbara T. Paul-Emile, Patrick Keane, Peter Kitson, and Debbie Lee have also explored
               the status of Coleridge’s poem as antislavery allegory. Marcus Wood objects to the
               argument that Coleridge thought of his poem as an abolitionist text, however, calling
               that argument a failed experiment. Emphasizing Coleridge’s superior sense of tact
               in avoiding the subject of slavery, Wood argues that Coleridge understood “the essential
               selfishness of the cult of sensibility, and of its inappropriateness as an imaginative
               resource for interpreting slavery” in a way that Southey did not (219).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">John Livingston Lowes argues that the ancient mariner’s “punishment, measured by the
               standards of a world of balanced penalties, palpably does not fit the crime” (274–5),
               yet, through the lens of Ware’s argument, the ancient mariner’s fascination with his
               guilt becomes more appropriate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Simon Bainbridge emphasizes Southey’s role as “public” poet when he argues that, “Marilyn
               Butler has presented the political, public Southey as an alternative exemplary Romantic
               figure to the Wordsworth that she sees constructed by the quietest, intellectual agendas
               of the academy” (Butler, 
               “Repossessing”
               64–84).” Bainbridge himself argues that Southey offers “a manifesto for a different
               poetic mode to the one normally defined as Romantic, one that is politically committed
               and speaks with what Southey terms in another poem of 1798 ‘the calm, collected public
               voice’” (Bainbridge par. 2).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">See, for instance, Tim Fulford: “distancing himself from contemporary events allowed
               Coleridge to find terms which would let readers share the mental state that, he argued,
               was produced by, and in turn reproduced, those events” (50). See also Joan Baum, who
               argues in a reading of Wordsworth’s poem on Toussaint L’Ouverture that “the genius
               of Romantic poetry is to avoid palpable or overt moral purpose, and explore the imaginative
               consciousness of both the poet and humanity” (146).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the references in the letters to Tom and May (“one week” and “six weeks”) makes it
               likely that the letter was sent in October 1798.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">The phrase Southey uses to describe the psychological results of the sailor’s guilt
               in his headnote, too, “agony of mind,” recalls Coleridge’s mariner’s line, “And Christ
               would take no pity on / My soul in agony” (lines 226–7).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey’s transformation of his source text into a poem also chimes with Percy’s tendency

               much, but that there were two faults in it—it was improbable, and had no moral. As
               for the probability, I owned that that might admit some question; but as to the want
               of a moral, I told her that in my own judgement the poem had too much; and that the

               dead expiring in battle. Those lucky enough to survive could not expect to be paid,

               the 1690s, for a seaman to be owed a decade's wages. The figure of the starving, often
               lame sailor in the seaport town became a permanent feature of European civilization,
