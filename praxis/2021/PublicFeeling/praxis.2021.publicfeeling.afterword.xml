                    The varied explorations of "public feeling" in this volume all attend to the
                    affective convergence of helplessness and guilt, injury and incrimination. This
                    afterword tracks the mood of complicity through the collection, with the aim of
                    elucidating how the co-implication of emotions and ethics brought to the fore in
                    each of the essays seems also to require new ways of speaking about agency—even
                    while reckoning with individual and collective powerlessness.

            <epigraph><quote>It is true of a great deal of what goes on in me that normally if it is to be known I must tell it, or give expression to it. But for nothing in me is this absolutely true. Whatever in me I have to conceal I may betray exactly by the way in which I conceal it. Just that is what is concealed; the concealment of what it is up to me to express is a perfect expression of it—the slight edge to my denials, the
                    over-casualness of my manner . . . There are those who know how to read such
                    concealments. —Stanley Cavell, <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title></quote></epigraph>
                <div type="section">
            <p>Let me begin by suggesting that the phrase “public
                    feeling” might involve redundancy in the same way that “public language,” and
                    “private feeling” might be as much an impossibility as “private language.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Indeed, the
                            question of private language in Wittgenstein’s <title level="m">Philosophical Investigations</title> (especially par. 243–315) is
                            inseparable from questions about the privacy of sensation and the
                            communicability of feeling.</note>
                I do not mean that we do not often, for good reason,
                    wonder about “what is going on in his head,” or worry that “she’s keeping it all
                    bottled up inside,” or mutter about “never understanding what they want.” Such
                    utterances are themselves articulations of feeling—frustration, apprehension,
                    bewilderment—issued in response to words and deeds that may well include
                    unmistakably apparent suppressions of feeling such as the concealments Stanley
                    Cavell describes in my epigraph. To assume an existential rift or metaphysical
                    divide between what is hidden (“private feeling”) and what is expressed (“public
                    feeling”) is to deny (perhaps inadvertently) how well we ordinarily read one
                    another. Even resolute withholding, cold indifference, and blank impassivity are
                    recognizably expressive. The depth and extent of our feeling together entails no
                    singular or important “feat of cognition,” as Cavell reminds us, but is an
                    incumbent “call upon us,” an ongoing task that is shared even if rarely mutual
                    (435).
            </p>
            <p>The editors of this volume ask how poetry “interferes in,
                    perpetuates, or rearticulates feelings circulated in zones of sociality loosely
                    denoted as public,” and in so doing they begin with the kind of acknowledgment
                    Cavell urges. To recognize that emotions pass between us as expressions and
                    outcries (and also as the felt silencing of expressions and outcries) is also to
                    acknowledge that there is no other “zone” in which they circulate: the
                    “publicness” of feeling is coeval with its forms of expression.</p>
            <p>The contributions gathered here expand the region of the public in a way that invites us to consider that even the precincts of privacy are shaped by sociality. The first essay stakes itself on the grounds of just such a paradox. Anastasia Eccles begins with the juxtaposition of two apparently contradictory assertions from Godwin’s <title level="m">Political Justice</title>: the first stating as a given the necessary
                    interdependence of all persons (“no man… can stand alone”); the second asserting
                    the prospect of independence: “We ought to be able to do without one
                    another.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Eccles, “Feeling Complicit in William Godwin’s
                                <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>.” The quotations from the
                            <title level="m">Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</title> come
                            from the Appendix <title level="a">Of Cooperation, Cohabitation, and Marriage</title> in the
                            revised third edition (London: G.G. and J. Robinson, 1798), Volume II,
                            499 and 505.</note>
                The phrasing of the latter formulation is curious.
                    Prescriptive and wistful at once, it draws attention to the interrelation
                    between the tone or mood of an utterance and the conceptual possibilities it
                    allows and forecloses. “We ought to be able to do without one another” sounds
                    rather more like “we ought to be in Rome” (the reverie of a busy afternoon when
                    the prospect of such an escape is impracticable) than “we ought to pay down this
                    debt” (an imperative that might or might not be possible). If the “ought”
                    commands the impossible, and thereby intimates a wish, then the sentiment itself
                    seems in disagreement with the grammatical subject of the sentence: the
                    inclusive second person plural. Godwin’s “we” joins us together in conceding the
                    fleeting, occasional desire for an independence that is impossible precisely
                    because we know that “no man stands alone.” I am suggesting that “We ought to be
                    able” in this phrase is akin to “I (sometimes) wish I could,” but that Godwin’s
                    syntax lays stress on the collective and shared fantasy of doing “without one
                    another.” Let’s say that Godwin counts on, and elicits, our complicity in this
                    “ought” that is really a wish.
            </p>
            <p> “No man stands alone” is best understood as a “sociological” fact and a “third
                person” epistemic claim rather than a “first person” testimony. We are all, each one
                of us, existentially interdependent, shaped by and vulnerable to political and
                economic conditions, historical encumbrances, material constraints, and so forth.
                Kant would classify such considerations as matters for “practical anthropology.” By
                contrast, an assertion (or is it rather an exclamation?) such as “We ought to be
                able to do without one another” expresses a determination, a discovery (or is it a
                longing?) freed from all empirical considerations. Godwin’s oddly phrased
                counterfactual wish corresponds to the imaginable, unreal, and unrealizable autonomy
                that is the stubbornly held aspiration of Kant's metaphysics of morals——the
                “precarious position” philosophy must somehow hold “firm” though there is “nothing
                on heaven or on earth” on which it is based (Kant 35).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For the
                            distinction between “practical anthropology” and “morals,” see pp.
                            2–3.</note> The distinction between the subject matter of
                “practical anthropology” and the concerns of what Kant calls “morals” is meant to
                clear the way for theorization of a “pure will,” the activity of which can never be
                proven or verified by our experience but is nevertheless not fantasy either. We are
                not being asked to choose between anthropology and morals, between “sociological
                fact” and speculative fiction or theory, but to recognize how the form of an inquiry
                itself shapes the object of the inquiry. This methodological insight is especially
                germane to the claims made in this collection about the epistemic contributions of
                poetic form. Maintaining a strict “division of labor” between empirical and
                non-empirical modes of inquiry is crucial, Kant thinks, in order to meaningfully
                account for, and to take seriously, intuitions involving freedom, obligation,
                respect, and dignity that seem to have no foundation in “things as they are.” But if
                those intuitions are without empirical basis, why take them seriously at all? It is
                fair to say that all the essays in this collection argue that it is the work of
                literature to bring us to know something—about power, about guilt, about aversion,
                 fear, and resolution—which can only be recognized as such if we grant the
                possibility of what the editors term a “poetics of knowledge."</p>
            <p>As the editors note in their introduction, the essays collected here vary widely in
                method, subject matter, and historical sweep, but they all address the imbrication
                of aesthetic form and emotions, and each finds, in that imbrication, points of
                ethical inflection. The opening proposition of the collection—that “feeling is part
                of a structured world”—itself suggests a movement away from approaches to affect
                influenced by evolutionary psychology and neuroscience. There is no effort made in
                these essays to seek consilience with, or corroboration from, research in other
                disciplines. And if no single theoretical framework guides this movement away from a
                scientistically-inclined interdisciplinarity, there is nevertheless a tacit
                methodological commitment to the practice of close reading that is (as Jonathan
                Kramnick has recently argued) the most specific competency of literary studies as a
                discipline (4). It is from the renewed commitment to close reading in these essays
                that emotional and ethical response emerge as mutually determining. The question is
                how to understand that co-implication without losing the specificity of its
                articulation in literary form.</p>
            <p>The emphasis on complicity that is present in all the essays emerges from careful
                attention to subtle shadings of emotion, to spectrums of affective intensity, and to
                judgments that combine feeling, cognition, and bodily sensation. Even that most
                visceral of reactions—disgust—is shown to have such a composite structure. What the
                collection as a whole can be taken to argue is that certain forms of moral
                experience and reflection given to us in literature become available to us as
                readers only insofar as we resist the temptation to translate—and thereby
                subordinate—their logic and their poetry to explanatory frameworks (sociological,
                physiological, historicist).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Amanda Anderson has recently urged us to be wary of the convergence of
                            two dominant intellectual currents: the “deflation” of ideals of
                            considered deliberation and ethical reasoning found in the cognitive and
                            neurosciences on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the decentering
                            of agency, the emphasis on “forces that take place behind the backs of
                            individual subjects,” that is paradigmatic of post-structuralist and
                            post-humanist approaches in the humanities (24). For a useful account of
                            how the “zeal of theory construction” hardens distinctions between the
                            always “mutually implicated categories” of emotion, cognition, belief,
                            desire and judgments, see Amélie Oksensberg Rorty, <title level="a">Enough Already with
                            ‘Theories of the Emotions'</title> (270, 273).</note> Moreover, and as
                the emphasis upon complicity suggests, the co-implication of emotions and ethics
                that all the essays in this collection attend to seems also to require new ways of
                speaking about agency—even while reckoning with individual and collective
                powerlessness. To return briefly to Kant, the “precarious position” the philosopher
                holds, ungrounded by anything “on heaven or on earth,” is the fragile “standpoint”
                upon which each thinks of herself as (if) “under the idea of freedom.” Something
                other than, or more than, mystification or delusion might be at work in imagining
                ourselves as capable of recognizing and resisting powers the determining force of
                which we also recognize. In much the same way, the feeling of complicity, even
                though it accompanies a sense of powerlessness, seems to depend on some “idea of
                freedom,” even as (only) a kind of negative capability.</p>
            <p>To take the first-person perspective seriously is to acknowledge that an adequate and
                complete explanatory account of our conditions (of “things as they are” for us and
                between us) is incommensurate with the bases upon which we expect and demand an
                accounting from one another. Christine Korsgaard (among the most important
                revisionist readers of Kant in the past half century) situates this first-person
                perspective in the “intersubjective” realm within which we hold one another
                responsible—for what we do together and apart, for how we fail one another, and
                even, yes, for how we feel.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See the influential titular essay in <title level="m">Creating the Kingdom of Ends</title> (188–221, especially
                            204–5 and 210–12).</note> Crucially, to say that the
                first-person perspective is non-empirical is <emph>not</emph> to say that
                it is a kind of mistaken evasion of the material determinants that the third-person
                perspective discloses. The first-person perspective is not an illusion to be
                demystified. “We ought to be able to do without one another” does not aspire to be a
                counter-factual denial of “no man stands alone.” It is an utterance in a different
                register, so to speak. The complicity the phrase assumes and elicits—and elicits
                precisely <emph>by assuming it</emph>—depends on my assent in a way that
                “no man stands alone” does not. I must acknowledge, at the very least, that I know
                what it might mean to wish to do without another, that I get the gist of that
                sentiment even if (I say to myself) that I do not share it. (We may understand
                Godwin’s phrase as a speech act of the kind that Eric Lindstrom attends to in his
                reading of the poetic powers conjured by Audre Lorde and Percy Shelley.)</p>
            <p>Taking complicity in the narrowly negative sense of “unwilled and dysphoric”
                participation, Eccles suggests that the familiarity of the indictment in
                ideologically inflected critique has had the paradoxical effect of desensitizing and
                numbing. We readily identify complicity as we read, but do not ourselves feel
                complicit. This numbing or desensitization to aesthetic experience in ideological
                critique is analogous to the trajectory Samalin traces whereby unrepressed
                expressions of disgust at “things as they are” are transformatively sanitized in the
                ostensibly affectively neutral observations of early sociology.</p>
            <p>But of course, complicity is more capacious than its narrowly negative definition of
                feeling responsible for atrocities and injustice beyond our immediate control, just
                as ethics involves more of our speech and behavior than any isolated moment of
                choice. The conceptual and ethical valences of complicity are expansive—encompassing
                the vast extent of our co-implication with one another. In <title level="m">Caleb
                    Williams</title>, Eccles understands the interdependence of the two central
                characters as a “collective agency” that operates formally and structurally as an
                expression of our existential entanglement with one another. A similar insight is at work in Amelia Worsley’s essay on Coleridge and Southey, which reminds us that the abolitionist ballad, "The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade," (1799) makes explicit the political and ethical commitments allegorized in the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (1798).  Worsley understands that the feeling of complicity arises from a disruption of safe distance (be it spatial, temporal, or conceptual) between witness and perpetrator, and thus locates the complicity of the reader rather than the guilt and penance of the protagonist at the heart of both poems. Crowded with bystander figures, Southey's poem insistently draws the reader
                into the ambit of the sailor’s psyche, forcing a “collective, identificatory feeling
                of guilt” and a recognition of the urgency and immediacy of atrocities only
                allusively present in Coleridge’s abstract narrative of incrimination.</p>
            <p>Ultimately the sense of responsibility entailed in the very idea of complicity
                appears to be diffused into what Eccles describes as an “aesthetics of atmosphere”
                that encloses characters and readers together in a miasma of culpability within
                which participant and bystander are indistinguishable. Is this, as Eccles argues, a
                phenomenology of collective politics, or is the (aesthetic) “experience of
                responsibility that can neither be refused nor fully discharged” a despair-inflected
                version of the censorious insights of ideological critique? This may be the most
                challenging question posed by the arguments in this collection. After all, the
                <emph>feeling</emph> of complicity, understood as an
                anxious sensitivity to the unresolvable and the unforgiveable, is surely salutary in
                its persistence—unlike the attenuation of unrestrained disgust that Zachary Samalin
                gives us good reason to lament in his essay, <title level="a">The Vomiting Mill.</title> For Samalin, what
                late nineteenth century urban sociologists diagnosed as a deficiency of feeling (the
                pathologically “indifferent,” “emotionless” and benumbed forms of interaction in the
                modern metropolis) is etiologically linked to powerful feelings of “aversion” and
                “repulsion.” Samalin's primal scene of modern disgust is Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Residence in
                London</title> from <title level="m">The Prelude</title> (1805), a text that anticipates the
                strange condensation of “repulsion with alienation, of excess feeling with
                pathological unfeeling” that he finds determining the character of sociology as a
                discipline. Barely disguised or irrepressible disgust seems in Wordsworth's
                recollections of London and in Friedrich Engels’s later descriptions of the
                “offensive and repellent” conditions of industrial Manchester to be just the
                opposite of complicity—revulsion being also a kind of revolt at things as they are.
                If “social theory” in Samalin’s provocative formulation, is born from “the spirit of
                disgust," then the expurgation of “feeling from method” called for by Emile
                Durkheim, Georg Simmel and other originators of the social sciences necessarily
                entails a pacification of affective intensity as a mode of description and also as
                resource for critique. Neutrality of tone portends conceptual constraint, sets a
                limit on what a social scientific description aims to achieve. And in that way,
                neutrality itself can be construed as another form of complicity.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps symptomatic of our moment that this inquiry into “public feeling” limns
                the co-implication of aesthetic form, ethics and feeling by mapping bleak regions of
                sensibility to injustice, suffering, the unforgivable, and the irremediable. Turned
                inward, revulsion at things as they are risks turning into a sour mood of
                acquiescence, every passing moment of passive non-resistance being felt, in a
                stomach-churning sort of way, to be, in effect, a capitulation. For Eric Lindstrom
                this collective “mood of helplessness,” the “paradox of passive agency,” is
                precisely what the late Romantic Shelley contends with in the <title level="a">Defense of Poetry</title>
                (1821). Lindstrom offers a willfully forward-looking alignment of poetics and the
                re-imagining of forms of community via a reading of Shelley’s “Defense” as a radical
                theorization of the distinction between value and fact. In Samalin’s genealogy, the
                aspiration to separate (social) fact from (subjective) value in sociology is traced
                back to a moment when they were conjoined in inescapably pressing emotional response
                to the “mean” and “vulgar shapes” of urban despair “forced upon my sight” (1805 <title level="m">Prelude</title> Book 8: 804). That feeling—unwanted, unwilled, as
                undeniable and visceral as physical pain—was itself a powerful index of value, of
                what <emph>matters</emph>. On Samalin’s account, alienated numbness is at
                once a diagnostic posture and the lingering symptom of a revulsion that is at once
                involuntary and humane. On Eccles’s and Worsley’s accounts, complicity evinces a
                helpless paralysis that would not be felt at all were it not for the acutely present
                tension of stifled dissent. In this context, as Lindstrom argues in his essay, a
                utopian document such as Shelley's <title level="a">Defense of Poetry,</title> with its bold avowal of the
                power of the counterfactual, can only conjure the possibility of its "love-politics"
                by repressing and disowning "ugly" feelings of fear and anger.</p>
            <p>Shelley's idealism seems an extraordinarily unabashed effort to inhabit the Kantian
                standpoint that is (in fact) “nowhere in heaven or earth" but in which we dwell
                "under the idea of freedom." The lightning speed of the poet's conceptual movements
                from aesthetics to ethics to politics betray a kind of desperate flight from the
                very feelings of terror, disgust, rage, aversion and helplessness that are the
                needful indices of the deplorable state of "things as they are." If Romanticists see
                something familiar in Audre Lorde's insistence that "thought is inextricable from
                feeling and its expressive formalization," Lindstrom asks us to understand that the
                "critical-creative" force of this "philosophical poetics" cannot be assimilated to
                the poetry of those Lorde identified as the “the white fathers [who write] . . . in
                order to cover their desperate wish for imagination without insight” (<title level="a">Poetry is not
                a Luxury</title>). In Lorde, Lindstrom finds a near-contemporary articulation of the
                "love-politics" that Romanticists recognize as Shelleyean, but in his essay’s
                accounting for the crucial differences and discontinuities between the two poets,
                the "denied metaphysical reality" of anger and fear emerges as necessarily
                constitutive of aesthetics as a utopian resource rather than as a collection of dark
                affective intensities to be overcome or transcended.</p>
            <p>To recall my epigraph from Cavell, if "the concealment of what it is up to me to
                express is a perfect expression of" what I wish to conceal, then there is no hiding
                of our shames—but perhaps something will come from imagining how to be shame-faced
                with one another, to avow complicities that clamor for articulation in words we
                cannot choose but share.</p></div>
