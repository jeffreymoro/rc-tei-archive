                <p rend="noCount">This essay considers the role of disgust in the emergence of sociological theory over
                    the course of the nineteenth century. It argues that what began as the bourgeois
                    social analyst’s disgust towards the modern city gradually transformed, over the
                    course of the century, into the modern sociological theorization of alienation as a
                    form of low-level repulsion. To track these changes in the function of disgust
                    within social analysis, the essay begins with a reading of William Wordsworth’s
                    description in <title level="m">The Prelude</title> of London as a "vast mill, /
                    …vomiting, receiving on all sides, / Men, women, three-years’ children, babes in
                    arms,” before turning to Friedrich Engels’s claim that “the very turmoil of
                    [London’s] streets has something repulsive, something against which human nature
                    rebels.”</p>

            <p>“Feeling is an object for scientific study,” Émile
                Durkheim declares in <title level="m">The Rules of Sociological Method</title> (1895),
                “not the criterion of scientific truth” (39–40). Emotional bias and sentimental
                attachment needed to be “rooted out” from the sociologist’s method, he insists, in
                order for the discipline to establish itself as a legitimate branch of scientific
                knowledge distinct, crucially, from the socially critical ambitions of realist or
                naturalist literature in the same period. However, social phenomena posed a special
                problem to this process of excluding emotions, precisely because they were so
                deeply, constitutively value laden. “We enthuse over our political and religious
                beliefs and moral practices very differently from the way we do over the objects of
                the physical world,” Durkheim goes on. Indeed, the uncritical, reflexive emotional
                bonds formed with the social are so potent, he writes, “they will not tolerate
                scientific examination. The mere fact of subjecting them . . . to cold, dry analysis
                is repugnant to certain minds.” Feeling therefore not only clouds judgment, in
                Durkheim’s view, but defends the social from critical investigation in the first
                place, deflecting inquiry. This twofold methodological problem had dogged
                disciplinary sociology from the start. Herbert Spencer, for instance, devoted an
                entire chapter of his 1873 methodological treatise <title level="m">The Study of
                    Sociology</title> to “Subjective Difficulties—Emotional”: “How, then,” he asks,
                “with such perverting emotions, is it possible to take a rational view of
                sociological facts?” (144).</p>
            <p>Durkheim asserted that it was imperative for the
                sociologist to overcome the protective feelings of repugnance shielding social
                phenomena from scientific analysis. The failure to disentangle fact from feeling, to
                root out emotion, he warns, would mean “the negation of all science" (40). Compared
                to some of his contemporaries, this wholesale repudiation of emotion represented a
                polemical position. Max Weber, by contrast, remained unconvinced throughout his
                career that the objects of the social world could be entirely isolated from the
                evaluative presuppositions and subjective attachments which constituted them to
                begin with. Nevertheless, Durkheim’s strong, unambivalent stance captures something
                of the fin-de-siècle mood of residual Enlightenment enthusiasm over the possibility
                of producing a modern scientific knowledge of the social domain freed from
                superstition and emotional prejudice. This enthusiasm was shared across all the
                emerging social scientific disciplines, each of which took a pronounced interest in
                bringing a methodological objectivity modeled on the natural sciences to bear on the
                study of the affective life of the subject. The neoclassical economists of the late
                nineteenth century epitomized this tendency, at once intensifying their focus on the
                pleasures and desires of the utilitarian subject while deriving their increasingly
                impersonal methodological premises from mathematics and the physical sciences.
                Alfred Marshall, for example, understood the ebb and surge of human appetites to be
                the principal engine of social and economic life—but he modeled his conception of
                appetite on the law-bound, measurable oscillation of a pendulum.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For an extensive account of economic discourse’s aspirational relationship to the physical sciences, see Mirowski, <title level="m">More Heat than
                                Light</title>; for Marshall’s strained, catachrestic metaphor of the pendulum see his <title level="m">Principles</title>, 405.</note> Affective life
                was at the heart of the social, but in order to study it, feeling needed to be
                overcome.</p>
            <p> In the following pages, I offer a condensed
                genealogical account of how this particular social scientific coordination of
                feeling and unfeeling came to take on its commonsense character, such that, having
                emotions would come to seem like an impediment to understanding emotions, rather
                than a prerequisite or an aid. I focus in particular on the prominent role that the
                negative emotion of disgust played in this historical process. I examine two scenes
                of proto-sociological repulsion from the nineteenth century: Friedrich Engels’s
                disgust at Londoners’ alienation, and William Wordsworth’s description, in the
                seventh book of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, of London’s Bartholomew Fair “as
                if the whole were one vast mill, / Are vomiting, receiving on all sides, / Men,
                women, three-years’ children, babes in arms” (7.692–4). By comparing Engels and
                Wordsworth, and the work of later social analysts, like Georg Simmel, I build on and
                extend canonical readings by Raymond Williams and Steven Marcus, among others. These
                works sought to excavate and analyze a tradition of city writing that cut across
                genres and disciplines and reflected a new awareness of the material conditions of
                social life under nineteenth-century capitalism. My aim is different. While Williams
                was interested in analyzing the changes in what he influentially called the
                structure of feeling of modern urban life, I focus more specifically on the role of
                feeling within the development of the increasingly scientific techniques of social
                analysis in the period. In so doing, I hope to unsettle the presumed continuity that
                Williams and others have ascribed to what feeling meant in the nineteenth century. I
                also hope to shed light on the contradictory parts it played in the description of
                modern social life.</p>
            <p>This difference in focus has important methodological
                consequences for the way that I view the relationship between the literary and
                non-literary texts I read in this article. Although I do regard Wordsworth’s
                “Residence in London” as an important starting point for a genre-crossing tradition
                of modern city writing, my analysis also takes into account the role of feeling and
                affect in the entanglement of literary and sociological writing over the course of
                the nineteenth century, as well as in their ultimate disaggregation as separate
                disciplines. When I turn at length to Wordsworth’s description of London as a
                vomiting mill, or to his diagnosis of the metropolis as the place “where the human
                heart is sick,” I do so partly because they anticipate later analyses of urban
                alienation as an affective sickness, but more crucially because they reflect an
                early nineteenth-century moment when such analysis had yet to be subjected to the
                methodological interdiction of feeling that Durkheim so forcefully articulated at
                the close of the century. Thus, while each of the “scenes” of modern sociological
                repulsion I examine—Wordsworth, followed by Engels, then back to 1900—dramatizes an
                encounter with the malady of feeling first diagnosed by Wordsworth, what changes is
                the underlying normative sense of what feelings are, what they are meant to do, and
                what constitutes their deformation.</p>
            <p>Disgust played a special part in the slow emergence of
                nineteenth-century sociology. One can already begin to trace the outline of
                disgust’s sociological function in Durkheim’s ascription of a special function to
                repugnance. Repugnance here exemplifies the benighted irrationality of emotion in
                general, a distortion of rational judgment that demands the practiced restraint of
                the social scientist in order to be overcome. Yet even this rather boilerplate
                dualism turns out not to be so simple, since Durkheim also implies that repugnance
                is a medium of restraint in its own right. It is an emotion, he suggests, whose
                articulation fends off the claims of reason. Hence feeling was to be resisted, but
                some feelings also exerted their own forms of resistance. How then could one
                distinguish between the disciplinary restraint of the sociologist and the affective
                resistances that were to be overcome?</p>
            <p>This complexity in the sociological conception of
                disgust is best approached through a related problematization of feeling that arose
                specifically out of the study of urban life over the course of the nineteenth
                century, and which came to inform social theory in the opening decades of the
                twentieth. Approached from the perspective of urban sociology, the salient problem
                of modern social relations was not human emotionality per se, but alienation. That
                is, it was not the overabundance or primacy of feeling that was central to social
                theoretical analysis, but rather its deficiency, absence, overregulation, or
                deformation through life in the modern capitalist city. Indeed, the characterization
                of urban sociality as indifferent or emotionless was typical of turn of the century
                social thought. In Simmel’s influential formulation, for example, life in the
                capitalist metropolis is characterized by its emotional “reserve”: the “blasé
                attitude” whose “essence is an indifference towards the distinctions between
                things,” which stemmed from the preeminence of economic exchange (<title level="m"
                    >Metropolis</title> 331). Weber, too, writes of the “impersonality” of city life
                    (<title level="m">City</title> 77), while Durkheim develops his conception of
                anomie—a "hatred or disgust for the prevailing order”—out of
                what he saw as the specific mismatch between the normative strictures of industrial
                society and the “bottomless abyss” of the human “capacity for feeling” (<title level="m">Suicide</title> 337, 208).</p>
            <p>The widespread diagnosis of alienation as a state devoid
                of feeling or of deformed feeling was bound up with an equally prevalent set of
                ideas about the centrality of disgust to human sociality. This focus on disgust as a
                social affect was shared by social theorists working with a variety of different
                conceptual idioms. Most notably, in Simmel’s conception of the blasé attitude,
                indifference and the absence of feeling shade into what he describes as “a slight
                aversion, a mutual strangeness and repulsion [<emph><foreign xml:lang="de">Abstoßung</foreign></emph>]”
                    (<title level="m">Metropolis</title> 331). For Simmel, repulsion was a primary
                negative force operating beneath the veneer of interpersonal neutrality. Without
                such “feelings of mutual strangeness and repulsion,” he writes in his long essay of
                1908, <title level="a">Conflict,</title> “we could not imagine what form modern urban life…might possibly
                take” (<title level="m">Conflict</title> 21).<note place="foot" resp="author"> On this point, see Harvey’s discussion of Simmel, <title level="a">Revulsion and Revolt,</title> in <title level="m">The Urban Experience</title> (180–5).</note>
                Norbert Elias, too, memorably describes the slow formation of what he called the
                civilized habitus, over the course of the medieval and early modern periods, as the
                outcome of “advances in the threshold of repugnance” (102). Elias argues that the
                emotional restraint that characterized modern social life was, counterintuitively,
                produced by <emph>heightened</emph> disgust. In a more bombastic idiom,
                Georges Bataille would proclaim, in the first of a pair of 1938 lectures on
                “Attraction and Repulsion,” that “everything leads us to believe that early human
                beings were brought together by disgust and common terror.” “The social nucleus is,
                in fact…untouchable and unspeakable,” Bataille declared, “[it is] the object of a
                fundamental repulsion” (106). Cool indifference and alienation might be the
                affective states that best diagnosed modern life, but stronger feelings of disgust,
                antipathy and repulsion were never too far off. As Simmel puts it, repulsion is “the
                inner side” of indifference.</p>
            <p> The identification of repulsion with alienation posed
                an implicit conceptual problem for early social theory, one that I am arguing ought
                to be understood as having arisen out of particular historical circumstances and
                transformations. On the one hand, the conflation of the two affective states and
                their installation at the heart of modern social life would seem to exemplify
                Durkheim’s call for sociology to treat feeling as an object of scientific analysis
                rather than a criterion of scientific judgment. The wager was that affective life
                could be studied objectively, impersonally, without feeling creeping into the
                sociological method. Yet on the other hand, the counterintuitive discovery that
                strong, binding feelings of disgust lurk beneath the veneer of affective neutrality
                introduced a complication. For now, it began to seem as though negative affects such
                as antipathy and repugnance might in some sense be preconditions for the practiced
                restraint and distanced impassivity of the modern social scientific habitus itself.
                Were the social scientific enthusiasm for objectivity, and the call to root out
                feeling from method, modern disciplinary innovations that would illuminate
                heretofore concealed dimensions of social life? Or were they themselves part of the
                processes of emotional discipline and deformation that seemed increasingly evident
                to those social theorists who followed the entangled threads of feeling, unfeeling,
                and unwanted feeling through the modern city?</p>
            <p>Addressing these questions requires pushing back into
                the nineteenth century and examining the role of disgust not only in the
                proto-sociology of the 1840s and 1850s, but also in the literary archive of the
                period. As has often been observed, the emergence of disciplinary sociology—and
                urban sociology in particular—over the second half of the nineteenth century
                depended not only on the appropriation of natural scientific and statistical methods
                for the study of social life, but on sharpening the distinction between the literary
                and the sociological to the point where they would eventually appear as
                self-evidently separate and even mutually exclusive domains.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For an important account foregrounding the centrality of feeling to this process of differentiation and disaggregation see Lepenies, <title level="m">Between Literature and

                was gradual and uneven. Throughout the century, one is as likely to encounter
                proto-sociological texts that draw on literary conventions—Henry Mayhew’s reliance
                on characterization and anecdote, for instance, or Harriet Martineau’s direct
                appeals to readerly sympathy—as one is to encounter novelists articulating their
                social scientific ambitions. Indeed, prominent late nineteenth-century authors
                sought to frame the literary text itself as a scientific laboratory in which the
                passions and pathologies of social life could be examined and controlled, as with
                Émile Zola’s notion of the “experimental novel” and Thomas Hardy’s elaboration of a
                “science of fiction.” Even though the emergence of disciplinary sociology depended
                on progressively sharpening its distinction from literature, literary realism in
                this very period shared a horizon of sociological ambition.</p>
            <p> Questions of feeling and, in particular, of unwanted
                feeling, were central to this process of disciplinary entanglement and
                disaggregation. At the close of the century, such questions revolved largely around
                the status of disgust as an emotion to be surmounted or set aside. Indeed, one does
                not need to dig deep to find literary preemptions of Durkheim’s call to overcome the
                repugnance that protects social reality from analysis. An 1884 preface to the
                English translation of Zola’s <title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="fr">L’Assommoir</foreign></title>, to name one
                example, argues that in order to read Zola properly “you must conquer the first
                feeling of repugnance; then, whatever may be the final judgment pronounced upon the
                writer, you are glad to have read his works, and you arrive at the conclusion that
                you ought to have read them…even if it bring with it an odour not altogether
                agreeable” (De Amicis 1). By the same token, criticism of the realist or naturalist
                novel often took issue precisely with its failure to transcend its merely
                sociological ambitions, which were framed as a kind of quasi-scientific prurience.
                Historically speaking, these allegations of realism’s insensitivity to the
                grotesque, and of its morbid obsession with the deformed, have appealed to a broad
                ideological spectrum of literary critics. It is in this vein, for instance, that
                John Ruskin accuses realists, including Zola and Dickens, of reducing literary art
                simply to a “science of fiction, concerned mainly with the description of…[the]
                forms of disease” of industrial society and of being motivated only by the
                “curiosity of science in morbid phenomena” (269). In a very different idiom, György
                Lukács repeats the claim that Zola’s “descriptive method” had degraded the novel
                form by “attempt[ing] to make literature scientific, to
                transform it…into sociology,” thus “intensifying the decay” of modern culture under
                bourgeois capitalism (127).<note place="foot" resp="author">Eric Auerbach made a similar case, but he saw
                                innovation where Lukács perceived the debasement of literature. “It
                                is surprising but undeniable,” Auerbach writes, “that the inclusion
                                of the fourth estate [i.e. the proletariat] in serious realism was
                                decisively advanced by those, who in their quest for new aesthetic
                                impressions, discovered the attraction of the ugly and pathological”

            <p>Before delving deeper into the nineteenth century and
                turning to Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Residence in London,</title> I want to flesh out more fully the
                emotional grammar of the process of disciplinary knowledge formation I am
                describing. At the turn of the century, we have seen, novelists and sociologists
                alike shared a sense that the production of the form of objectivity specific to
                analysis of the social domain required the management of the observer’s disgust.
                From this perspective, the sociological impulse appears to depend on an idea of
                emotion as a reflexive impulse that can be restrained or “conquered”; the diagnosis
                of modern society’s complex problems is only possible if one’s disgust is expelled,
                kept in, or otherwise overcome.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Here and throughout my thinking is informed by and indebted to Joshua Wilner’s work on internalization in Romantic poetry and psychoanalytic thought, <title level="m">Feeding on Infinity: Readings
                                in the Romantic Rhetoric of
                                Internalization</title>. Wilner observes that, in both of these paradigms, to internalize can mean either to bring something into the self from without or to keep something internal that seeks to get out. I am suggesting here a similar (or perhaps inverted) confusion in the phenomenology of the sociological conception of disgust: it is an emotion whose paradigmatic expressions can be seen either as an expulsive form of externalization (vomiting) or a corking up of the self (holding one’s nose). The conceptualization of disgust might therefore be said to alternate between a characterization of the emotion as opening the body up and a characterization of it as a form of enacted closure. The question of what it means to overcome or conquer one’s disgust looks different, I would argue, depending on which characterization one has in mind.</note>
                By contrast, from the perspective of critics who saw the rise of the sociological
                ambition as part of a more general cultural malady, the absence of feeling was
                itself the pathology to be diagnosed. Yet it is important to note that this position
                also staked its claim in a conception about the overcoming of disgust; the
                disagreement concerned whether or not overcoming feeling was the poison or the cure.
                In both cases, then, what is needed in order to understand the emergence of the
                sociological impulse is a clearer sense of what it meant to conquer one’s disgust or
                overcome it.</p>
            <p>Turning to an earlier text such as Wordsworth’s
                <title level="a">Residence in London</title> can help to disentangle these interweaving questions of
                feeling and unfeeling in the sociological method. Indeed, the seventh book of
                <title level="m">The Prelude</title> has often struck readers as
                a kind of proximal origin for a tradition of urban sociological writing that
                includes figures like Engels and Simmel, though it of course shares neither the
                disciplinary nor the scientific ambitions of these later accounts of modern city
                life. Raymond Williams, for one, saw <title level="a">Residence in London</title> as “one of the major
                early records of new ways of seeing the city,” describing Wordsworth’s account of
                urban alienation as “the first expression of what has since become a dominant
                experience of the city” (150). In a whole range of later poets, novelists and
                sociologists, Williams identifies and describes a “way of seeing London that has a
                clear continuity from Wordsworth,” which stems from “the sense of paradox: that in
                the great city itself, the very place and agency—or so it would seem—of collective
                consciousness, it is an absence of common feeling, an excessive subjectivity, that
                seems to be characteristic” (215). Less attuned to the historical development of
                this structure of feeling, Steven Marcus likewise finds “similar if not identical
                tendencies” in Engels’s, Simmel’s, and Wordsworth’s accounts of urban life (148).
                This critical consensus continues to characterize more recent criticism, as well.
                For instance, James Chandler and Kevin Gilmartin have persuasively detailed the
                affinities between <title level="a">Residence in London</title> and later social theoretical accounts of
                the modern metropolis, most notably Walter Benjamin’s writings on Baudelaire’s Paris
                and Simmel’s on Berlin; while Eugene Stelzig argues that “the negative presentation
                of the city of London in Book 7 of
                <title level="m">The Prelude </title> is part of a larger and
                well-known literary typecasting, Romantic <emph>and</emph> Modern, that scripts the city as a
                site of extreme alienation and even a kind of necropolis” (184).</p>
            <p>More specifically, readers of <title level="m">The
                    Prelude</title> have long noted the precision with which Wordsworth details the
                aspects of the experience of alienation that would come to seem characteristic in
                the century after his writing. Foremost among these are the sense that one is
                surrounded by and yet cut off from others—that Londoners live “even next-door
                neighbours (as we say) yet still / Strangers, and not knowing each other’s names”
                (1805, 7.119–20); and the sense that all sociality has been reduced to economic
                exchange—and that consumption and production have been fundamentally confused “amid
                that concourse of mankind / Where Pleasure whirls about incessantly, / And life and
                labour seem but one” (1850, 7.69–81). As in later accounts of alienation, Wordsworth
                also describes the emotional deformation and inauthenticity of city life, “where the
                human heart is sick” and one lives “among the wretched and the falsely gay” (1805,
                13.202, 7.396). The general movement is outward, from the recognition of the city as
                a space of overwhelming sensory confusion—“the quick dance / Of colours, lights, and
                forms; the Babel din; The endless stream of men, and moving things”—to the analysis
                of that sensory experience as part of a broader social phenomenon that transcends
                mere loneliness and perceptual overstimulation (1805, 7.162–4). This complex account
                of urban alienation finds its figure most famously in the poet’s confrontation with
                a blind beggar, whose explanatory placard seems to Wordsworth “a type / Or emblem of
                the utmost that we know / Both of ourselves and of the universe,” and whose
                disfiguration and isolation have long been taken by critics to represent
                Wordsworth’s most focused mediation on the social as well as the existential
                conditions of an incipient modernity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See for instance Hertz, <title level="a">The Notion of Blockage in the Literature of the Sublime,</title> and Friedman, <title level="a">History in the Background of Wordsworth’s ‘Blind Beggar.’</title>.</note></p>
            <p>The language of disgust supplies Wordsworth with a
                negative moral-sensory rhetoric that allows him to articulate the unwantedness of
                his experiences of the city. For instance, in the passage mentioned earlier, the
                poet describes the funhouse mayhem of London’s Bartholomew Fair “as if the whole
                were one vast mill, / …vomiting, receiving on all sides, / Men, women, three-years’
                children, babes in arms” (7.692–4). This figure of the city as a churning mill
                consuming and then spewing forth a stream of people is in keeping with Wordsworth’s
                numerous other epithets for London’s fallen world, most notably “parliament of
                monsters” (1805, 7.691) and, in the 1850 revision, “huge fermenting mass of
                human-kind” (1850, 7.621) and “monstrous ant-hill on the plain / Of a too busy
                world” (1850, 7.149–50). These grotesque epithets register the poet’s sensory
                revulsion as well as his moral disapprobation towards the crowded city and the
                undifferentiated “swarm of its inhabitants” (7.698). In the view of the poem, the
                metropolis is overeating and vomiting; it is yeasted, at once outgrowing itself and
                rotting; it is a teeming swarm of bugs. The negative affective charge of these
                epithets extends to the whole narrative of <title level="a">Residence in London</title>: Wordsworth gives
                readers a vivid image of London, but it is an image filtered through a condemnatory
                rhetoric of revulsion and sensory outrage; we see the city, but as an unwanted
                sight.</p>
            <p>It is possible to see in Wordsworth’s rhetoric of
                disgust a crystallization of precisely the kind of emotional prejudice that
                sociologists later in the century would describe as an impediment to the accurate
                knowledge of social life. The normative quality of the emotion influences the
                description of social perception to such an extent that it becomes difficult to
                separate the one from the other in the text. At the same time, the grotesque
                characterization of the city comes to seem, from this angle, like something
                projected onto the city, rather than something revealed by the poet’s insight. And
                indeed, even in his own day—and even to those who knew him—Wordsworth’s overwhelming
                antipathy for the city could seem inordinate and out of place. Charles Lamb, for
                instance, observes that “the very deformities of London, which give distaste to
                others, do not displease me. The endless succession of shops…excite in me no
                puritanical aversion. I gladly behold every appetite supplied with its proper food.
                The obliging customer, and the obliged tradesman…do not affect me with disgust…I
                love the very smoke of London.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a discussion of Lamb’s letter, see James A.W. Heffernan, <title level="a">Wordsworth’s London: The Imperial Monster.</title></note> Published in the
                <title level="j">Morning Post</title> in 1802 but adapted from a
                letter he had written to Wordsworth the year before, Lamb’s column anticipates
                <title level="a">Residence in London</title> almost point by point. The column takes aim at precisely the
                kind of strong aversive reaction to London that Wordsworth’s poem would reenact in
                1805, and it does so principally by attributing disgust to the unaccustomed
                spectator or outsider, for whom the mere sight of excessive consumption is
                repulsive. Disgust, distaste and aversion, Lamb suggests, cloud one’s perception of
                city life, deforming the way that social relations appear. More significantly, one’s
                disgust offers up powerful judgments, rooted in habituation, that nonetheless
                masquerade as neutral perceptions. “From habit I perceive nothing but urbanity,” he
                writes, “where other men, more refined, discover meanness.”</p>
            <p>I want to pause here to take stock of our discussion so
                far. In this section, I have outlined three components of what we might call the
                structure of unwanted feeling in Wordsworth’s poem of London. First, there is what
                has generally been understood by literary critics as Wordsworth’s anticipation of
                later influential accounts of urban alienation. Second, there is Wordsworth’s
                rhetorical presentation of his account of London through a condemnatory language of
                disgust, which draws on the conventions of the grotesque. And finally, there is
                Lamb’s allegation that disgust might be an unreliable guide to the city, insofar as
                it projects characterizations onto the social that are based solely on the
                habituated emotional reactions, or habitus, of the spectator. In what remains of
                this section, I want to contrast this structure of feeling with the genealogical
                problem I outlined at the opening of this essay. To recall, there were two contrary
                sides to that problem. The first was that feeling came to seem, by the close of the
                nineteenth century, like something that needed to be rooted out from the
                sociological method, whereas the second was that the strong, excessive feeling of
                disgust had come over the course of the same historical period to be identified with
                the deformation or absence of feeling constitutive of modern alienation.</p>
            <p>Contrasting the structure of feeling with the
                genealogical problem can help to illuminate several historical shifts and
                transformations that have otherwise remained indistinct in the critical consensus
                concerning the influence of <title level="a">Residence in London</title> on later city writing. For if
                Wordsworth’s account of alienation is understood to have anticipated and even
                structured later accounts, then what are we to make of the allegedly distorting
                quality of his disgust? Conversely, the fact of Wordsworth’s disgust towards the
                fallen world of London can hardly account for the later identification of repulsion
                with alienation. Instead, the rhetorical function of disgust in <title level="a">Residence of
                London</title> would seem to be Wordsworth’s insistence on maintaining a distance from what
                he disapprovingly sees. Whereas a century later Simmel would yoke together “feelings
                of strangeness and mutual repulsion,” in Wordsworth there is hardly even a minimal
                identification of his own feelings of moral and sensory disapproval with the
                sickness of the human heart those feelings serve to identify and diagnose. Reading
                Wordsworth’s poem in the context of later sociological accounts of city life is
                useful, then, not so much because it anticipates the latter as because it shows us
                how much would have to change over the course of the nineteenth century, even to the
                point of inversion, in order to arrive at the conceptually conflicted state of
                affairs out of which modern social theory emerged. On the one hand, the opposition
                between two seemingly opposed affective states would have to collapse, while on the
                other hand, the dependence of an entire habitus or observational mood on the
                evidence of strong and unwanted feelings would have to be overcome or disavowed.</p>
            <p>Much of what I am describing will come into sharp focus
                only by staging different scenes of sociological repulsion diachronically and
                analyzing its diverse rhetorical functions throughout the long nineteenth century.
                As we will see in the next section on Engels, my emphasis falls on change over time,
                rather than anticipation and continuity, though it is important to stress the
                continuities as well. Before moving on, however, I want to spend a bit more time
                with Wordsworth’s figure of London as a “vast mill” devouring and then vomiting out
                its inhabitants, and to suggest that this ambiguous figure does in fact illuminate
                something about the eventual conflation of repulsion with estrangement within
                sociological discourse. To recall, Wordsworth’s image is fundamentally one of
                confusion. After enumerating all of Bartholomew Fair’s “freaks of nature… / All
                jumbled up together to make up / This parliament of monsters,” the figure of the
                mill “vomiting, receiving, on all sides” suggests an inability to distinguish
                between comers and goers to the freak show, between lurid spectacle and grotesque
                spectator (1805, 7.688–91). This “blank confusion,” Wordsworth goes on, exemplifies
                “what the mighty city is itself”: a place in which distinctions between consumption,
                production, and excretion have been effaced, just as earlier in the poem a panorama
                painter is described as “with his greedy pencil taking in / A whole horizon on all
                sides,” as though the very implements of creativity and production were themselves
                the means of consumption.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For an extensive analysis of the panoramas in <title level="a">Residence in London</title> as well as in Walter Benjamin’s <title level="m">Arcades Project</title>, see Chandler and Gilmartin’s contextualizing discussion of Thomas Girton’s 1801 <title level="m">Eidometropolis</title> and P.J. De Louthenberg’s 1781 <title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Eidophusikon</foreign></title>. Chandler and Gilmartin not only provide an
                                illuminating account of the rise of the panorama form, but also give
                                a more granular narrative of the particular processes by which the
                                panoramic cityscape came to supplant the panoramic landscape, as the
                                relationship between country and city
                    transformed.</note> In the vomiting mill, we are led to believe,
                making devolves into making waste, eating into excreting, using into destroying, and
                pleasure into repulsion—it is a place where opposing processes have become
                identical, and even the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the organic (vomiting)
                and the industrial (mill) no longer seems so absolute.</p>
            <p>Another principal confusion embedded in Wordsworth’s
                figure is between the expression and the object of disgust, or between disgust and
                the disgusting. Indeed, it is one of the singular features of the emotion of disgust
                that vomiting—its paradigmatic form of expression—is often deemed in its own
                right to be an object of disgust. This is in part because of the emotion’s
                association with the lowly parts of the body, with the belly and its wastes, which
                perhaps stems from the primary confusion of boundaries and of organic functions that
                is inherent to the physiological experience of the emotion; few other emotions,
                after all, can throw the basic directionality of the digestive system fully into
                    reverse.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a good introduction to the
                                psycho-physiology of disgust, see Rozin and Fallon, <title level="a">A Perspective
                                on Disgust.</title></note> In this vein, Denise Gigante
                observes of the figure of the vomiting mill that “Wordsworth seems to have learned .
                . . that a powerful way to demonize someone is to portray him or her not in the act
                of logocentric expression but in a parodic version of unsignifying emission” (97).
                Yet beyond this denigrative function, I believe we can see in Wordsworth’s figure
                the rudimentary elements of the sociological association of repulsion with
                alienation, of excess feeling with pathological unfeeling. The confusion here
                requires a more complex understanding of the projection of disgust than that which
                Lamb described. Now it is not simply that the poet’s unwanted feelings color his way
                of seeing social phenomena, but that this reflux of unwanted emotion itself is
                poured out into “the vast receptacle” of London, coming to serve as a derogatory
                emblem of the city conceived as a whole. And even this does not quite fully capture
                the slippery, recursive character of this dynamic, in which what is projected is in
                its own right an image of projection or misplaced expulsion, as the metropolis
                extrudes itself.<note place="foot" resp="author"> It is important to note as well that Wordsworth’s strange, concatenated figure is a personification, and a more sustained analysis of this specific rhetorical structure would lead us down two distinct but mutually-reinforcing paths. First, historically speaking, after Wordsworth, variations of this grotesque figure of the city as a vomiting body would reemerge in certain strains of nineteenth-century social theory that stressed precisely the organic character of the so-called “social organism.” Marx, for instance, compares the processes of capital (production, circulation, etc.) to the “change of form and matter…in the organic body,” going on to detail the different rates of change at which a body sheds or repulses [the German word is once again <foreign xml:lang="de">Abstoßen</foreign>] and replenishes its “flesh, blood” and even its “skeleton.” See: Marx, <foreign xml:lang="de"><title level="m">Grundrisse</title></foreign>, 661. Second, there is also an important psychological and psychoanalytic tradition of theorizing disgust as an uncannily “animistic” emotion. “The meaning of the disgusting object often includes some animistic notions,” an influential study of the 1940s observes, “It is not regarded as belonging to the class of inorganic matter but as something related to life, as something ‘almost living’ which has the tendency or is endowed with the capacity to sneak up on, and to penetrate, the body in some unnatural way.” See: Angyal, <title level="a">Disgust and Related Aversions,</title> 397. Were there time to do so, this animistic psychological theory of disgust could be traced back to the British and German aesthetic theory of the second half of the eighteenth century and hence brought into even closer contact with Wordsworth’s rhetoric of grotesque personification. See, for instance, Menninghaus, <title level="m"> Disgust</title>, 25–101.</note>
                In this early nineteenth-century image, then, we see an association just barely
                forged between disgust and alienation, as well as a repudiation of feeling that is
                also in some manner an excess feeling.</p>
            <p>We can understand these shifts in the relationship
                between feeling and unfeeling over the course of the whole nineteenth century more
                precisely if we now turn to the analysis of city life at midcentury. Indeed, the
                five decades between Wordsworth’s first stabs at
                <title level="m">The Prelude</title> and its publication in 1850
                saw major upheavals in the writing and practice of social observation and analysis.
                In the first place, the bug-eyed sensory outrage of the figure in the city, which
                had been a source of innovation in Wordsworth’s poem, had by midcentury become a
                generalized feature of social investigation literature. Even in the most systematic
                and theoretically sophisticated proto-sociological texts of the mid-nineteenth
                century, disgust now appeared as the characteristic affective response of the
                bourgeois social investigator to unwanted social realities of the city. Moreover,
                what had been a relatively undefined aesthetic field of moral and sensory revulsion
                in Wordsworth now appeared unequivocally under the aegis of disgust. From Edwin
                Chadwick’s sanitary report to Friedrich Engels’s survey of Britain’s industrial
                towns, the explicit appeal to disgust at midcentury had developed into a dependable
                rhetorical technique. Most significantly, the appeal to disgust carried with it an
                implicit yet powerful expectation that collectively shared sense experience could
                serve as a basis for social agreement. In public discourse across a variety of
                genres and media, the appeal to disgust served to galvanize a public around a social
                or even civilizational wrong. In this regard the revolted spectator resembled what
                Lauren Berlant describes as “the subject of true feeling”: a wounded subject whose
                affective experiences lay claim to a “hard-wired truth, a core of common sense [that
                places it] beyond ideology, beyond mediation, beyond contestation” (<title level="m">True Feeling</title> 47).<note
                        place="foot" resp="author">For a closely related discussion, also see
                                Berlant, <title level="a">The Epistemology of State
                Emotion.</title></note></p>
            <p>In contrast, midcentury also saw decisive developments
                in the social sciences that tugged the still-coalescing sociological method away
                from its rhetorical dependency on the “true feeling” of disgust, and indeed away
                from the articulation of feeling in general. The most salient among these changes
                were advances in statistical analysis by Adolphe Quetelet in France, and Robert
                Jones, Charles Babbage, and T.R. Malthus and others in the Statistical Society of
                London; this burgeoning field was itself developing out of an increasing awareness
                that the subjectivity of individual perspectives rendered them incapable of
                accounting for changes in the social whole.<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Susan Faye Cannon has put it, statistics developed out of “an intricate dovetailing of inherited, ideological, moral, socioeconomic, intellectual and personal factors,” including” a heritage from the Enlightenment….a realization that great social changes were taking place that no one understood as a whole…a conclusion that social reform was needed but could not be justified without evidence…a desire to refute Ricardo and a general dissatisfaction with the deductive school of social theorists” (<title level="m">Science in Culture</title>, (240–4). Goldman quotes Cannon and expands on her discussion in <title level="a">The Origins of British ‘Social Science.’</title> Also see Porter, <title level="m">The Rise of Statistical
                            Thinking</title>.</note> This sense of
                the partiality of the individual perspective also underwrote the various critiques
                of political economy that emerged in the 1840s, most notably in Marx’s and Engels’s
                writings. Marxist social theorists often note a decades-long shift in Marx and
                Engel’s thought away from their early humanistic focus on the worker’s alienation
                and deformed subjectivity in the 1840s towards the objective analysis of his or her
                exploitation and the extraction of surplus value in <title level="m">Capital</title>
                (1867). However, even in Marx’s early writings on alienation, one sees for the first
                time the analysis of feeling [<emph><foreign xml:lang="de">fühlen</foreign></emph>] as a mutable social
                phenomenon subject to historical variation as well as change under political and
                economic pressure. This transformation of emotion and subjectivity into an object of
                analysis was, to recall Durkheim’s observation, representative of the overall
                development of the social sciences throughout the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Engels’s 1845 social survey of Britain’s industrial
                towns epitomizes this double movement in sociology, at once towards and away from
                the appeal to feeling as an epistemological basis for knowledge of the social. “The
                very turmoil of the streets has something repulsive [<emph><foreign xml:lang="de">etwas
                    Widerliches</foreign></emph>],” he writes in <title level="m">The Condition of the Working
                    Class in England</title>, “something against which human nature rebels”
                (36–7). What follows this
                articulation of disgust is one of the century’s most influential descriptions of
                urban alienation, culminating in Engels’s indictment of “the social war, the war of
                each against all,” and of capital, “the weapon with which this social warfare is
                carried on”:<quote>
            The very turmoil of the streets has something repulsive,
                something against which human nature rebels. The hundreds of thousands of all
                classes and ranks crowding past each other, are they not all human beings with the
                same qualities and powers, and with the same interest in being happy? And have they
                not, in the end, to seek happiness in the same way, by the same means? And still
                they crowd by one another as though they had nothing in common, nothing to do with
                one another, and their only agreement is the tacit one, that each keep to his own
                side of the pavement . . . while it occurs to no man to honour another with so much
                as a glance. The brutal indifference, the unfeeling isolation of each in his private
                interest becomes the more repellent and offensive, the more these individuals are
                crowded together, within a limited space. And, however much one may be aware that
                this isolation of the individual, this narrow self-seeking is this fundamental
                principle of our society everywhere, it is nowhere so shamelessly barefaced, so
                self-conscious as just here in the crowding of the great city. The dissolution of
                man into monads, of which each one has a separate principle and a separate purpose,
                the world of atoms, is here carried out to its utmost extreme.</quote>
            Much has been written about the vision of London and of
                capitalism that Engels offers in this passage, but I wish specifically to
                characterize the disgust that Engels articulates towards the alienation of the
                crowded streets of the city. Disgust, according to Engels, is the rebellion of human
                nature against the inhumanity of this historical state of “crude solitariness” that
                masks the violence of social warfare. The emotion rejects the inhuman social
                organization under capitalist political economy, the “discord of identical
                interests” that permits people to “regard each other only as useful objects,” by
                opposing it to a collective morality grounded in a shared human nature. What stands
                out foremost in this passage is the implicit expectation of disgust’s unique
                persuasiveness as a mode of response. Held up as the token of an underlying “human
                nature” in revolt against industrial capitalism, the emotion lays claim to a
                quasi-instinctual authenticity and force. Who could argue, Engels seems to ask, with
                the commonsense of disgust? The invocation of repulsion is in this sense meant to
                place Engels’s analysis beyond contestation in precisely the way Berlant attributes
                to the appeal to “true feeling.” Moreover, Engels means for his repulsion to
                evidence the ideological character of social life in the capitalist metropolis.
                Disgust is how we come to know that there is something wrong, something lurking
                behind the indifference of the metropolis. It is through the rhetorical presentation
                of his repulsion that Engels lays bare the emotional fragmentation that follows from
                the saturation of social relations by capital. We are in this sense far off from
                Durkheim’s notion of a repugnance that precludes social analysis. To the contrary,
                disgust here appears to play a necessary role in revealing society’s true
                nature.</p>
            <p>Engels’s account of the “offensive and repellant” nature
                of economic alienation establishes an antithesis between the two affective states.
                On the one hand there is “brutally indifferent” life in the metropolis—emotionless,
                artificial, monadic, and gray; on the other hand, there is the disgust of the
                bourgeois observer—unwanted but alive, human nature itself in revolt. Whereas life
                in the alienated city shuttles between the neutral and the negative, Engels here
                tacitly refers us to a full-throated wholeness or human essence that has not been
                drained of its vitality. However, I want to stress the new proximity that Engels
                establishes here between disgust and alienation, rather than their overt and
                conventional opposition. What is unique to Engels’s formulation is the implicit
                analogical relationship he establishes between his own repulsion and the alienation
                it diagnoses. Disgust is not only the proper, the natural, and the automatic
                response to the ravages of industrial capitalism, but it is also in a sense a
                reflection, however distorted, of the affective state of alienated life under this
                new mode of social organization.</p>
            <p>If we fast forward fifty years to Simmel’s analysis of
                metropolitan repulsion, or a full century to Sartre’s existentialist nausea, we see
                that this analogy progressively takes on the status of a commonplace. Alienation,
                    <emph>anomie</emph>, <emph><foreign xml:lang="it">la noia</foreign></emph>, <emph>angst</emph>, gradually
                become entangled, if not fully interchangeable, with <emph><foreign xml:lang="fr">la
                    nausée</foreign></emph>, the <emph><foreign xml:lang="la">taedium vitae</foreign></emph>, attraction-repulsion,
                primary repression, and other states of low-grade negativity that explicitly take
                disgust as their basis. This is not so in Engels, for whom the diagnosis of
                alienation depends on disgust without yet being fully identified with it. But
                repulsion is now specifically named as the unwanted affective response through which
                the alienation of the individual under the modern social system becomes
                recognizable; the points of contact between the two states are already becoming
                clear. I am suggesting that, historically speaking, part of the work Engels
                accomplishes in this passage is to establish a discursive link between his own
                excessive feeling and the pathological unfeeling he diagnoses. If social theory
                wound up conceptualizing repulsion as a fundamental truth of human relationships, it
                was precisely because disgust had already been so closely associated with the
                analysis of social life. Indeed, the sociologist’s disgust already claimed an
                affective and epistemological authority over the experience of the observed, such
                that Engels’s repulsion comes to seem like the missing truth of Londoners’
                alienation, a complement to their emotional deformation. The disgust of the
                bourgeois observer was the frame within which the experience of the observed could
                appear. </p>
            <p>In order to satisfy the increasingly scientific
                aspirations of disciplinary sociology, this disgust had to migrate from the observer
                to the observed, from the method of inquiry to the object of study, without
                abandoning the posture of observational authority. From one angle, this process
                clearly resembles the rooting out of feeling from method that the fin de siècle
                sociologists called for: affect’s shift from criterion of truth to scholarly object.
                Social science cannot depend on the feelings of the observer—this much was already
                apparent to Engels, though he had not fully processed it. One can feel the method of
                analysis pulling Engels in two opposing directions, at once towards the burning
                evidence of unwanted feeling, and the cold truths of inhumane political economic
                structures, which themselves find a strange reflection in the demand for an
                anaesthetized social science.</p>
            <p>But I also want to insist that there is something
                surreptitious about this transfer of affect, according to which the characteristic
                moral-visceral outrage of the bourgeois sociologist comes to be generalized as the
                innermost nature of the social itself. When Simmel writes that without “feelings of
                mutual strangeness and repulsion…we could not imagine what form modern urban
                life…might possibly take,” it would not be mistaken to say that he attributes what
                had been Engels’s vexed identification with the sight of industrial alienation to
                his own generalized definition of modern social relationships in the metropolis.
                From this perspective, feeling is not so much extracted from sociology as it is
                buried within it or projected onto the social domain—more concretely and directly
                here than in Wordsworth’s figure of the vomiting mill. Only a decade after Engels’s
                stated opposition between disgust and alienation, for example, Marx would turn to
                the language of repulsion [<emph><foreign xml:lang="de">Abstoßung</foreign></emph>] in order to theorize
                the social antagonism that binds people to their class.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The language recurs throughout Marx’s discussion of antagonism in the <title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Grundrisse</foreign></title>. See for instance: Marx, <title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="de">Grundrisse</foreign></title>, 453. As Gareth Stedman Jones has observed,
                                Marx’s dissertation had in fact delved deeply into the topic of
                                physical repulsion—at the level of the atom—in the philosophical
                                theories of Democritus and Epicurus. Unlike Epicurus, Marx accused
                                Democritus of having seen “in repulsion only the material side, the
                                fragmentation, the change, and not the ideal side, according to
                                which all relation to something else is negated and motion is
                                established as self-determination.” Quoted in Stedman Jones,<title level="m">Karl Marx: Greatness and
                                Illusion</title>, 81.</note> What could hardly have been meant as much more than a
                rhetorical convention rooted in uninterrogated beliefs about the grammar of
                sensation in Engels came to be inscribed as a core tenet of sociological and social
                theoretical discourse, as disgust
                <emph>towards</emph> alienation was slowly
                reconstituted as disgust
                <emph>as</emph> alienation.</p>
            <p>“[T]here is no science,” Durkheim writes, in the passage
                with which I opened this essay: "Which at its beginnings has not encountered similar
                resistances. There was a time when those feelings relating to the things of the
                physical world, since they also possessed a religious or moral character, opposed no
                less violently the establishment of the physical sciences. Thus, one can believe
                that, rooted out from one science after another, this prejudice will finally
                disappear from sociology as well, its last refuge, and leave the field clear for the
                scientist" (<title level="m">Rules</title> 40). Contra Durkheim, I have been arguing
                that the role disgust played in this process of rooting out emotional bias and
                superstition from the social scientific method cannot be explained straightforwardly
                in the terms of a progressive narrative—although it may at first blush seem to do
                just that. As our examination of Wordsworth and Engels has suggested, the genealogy
                of sociological attraction-repulsion can be made to hew closely to Durkheim’s
                proposed trajectory, according to which an emotion that had been erroneously taken
                as a “criterion of scientific truth” by the innovative but prescientific fumblers of
                the mid-nineteenth century was gradually transformed into an “object for scientific
                study” that could be shown to “have been shaped through history” at the century’s
                close.</p>
            <p>But as I hope to have shown, this story of the hard-won
                isolation of social fact from subjective value raises more questions than it
                settles. Perhaps most crucially, we have seen precisely how difficult it is to
                disentangle fact from value within the structures of unwanted feeling that gave rise
                to modern sociology. To the contrary, the rhetoric of disgust would seem to suggest
                instead that certain features of social life can only become legible in the first
                place through the filter of the repulsion they inspire—that is, can only become
                legible as unwanted facts. And in this regard, the problem of disgust begins to look
                like a condensation of the basic problem of determining the composition of social
                scientific knowledge, as it related to what Weber referred to as the “hair-thin
                line” separating objective fact and subjective value. Weber thought it was the
                proximity of fact and value in the sociological domain that gave the field its
                unique character because he believed that all social phenomena depended on the prior
                positing of an underlying value that allowed them to become sensible and
                recognizable as phenomena in the first place. “The
                <emph>objective</emph> validity of all empirical
                knowledge,” he writes, “rests, and rests exclusively, upon the fact that the given
                reality is ordered according to categories that are in a specific sense <emph>subjective</emph>, in that they form the
                <emph>precondition</emph> of our knowledge, and that
                are based upon the presupposition of the <emph>value</emph> of that truth
                which empirical knowledge alone is able to give us” (<title level="m">Objectivity</title> 137). The task that Weber sees falling to the social sciences
                is to explore these meeting points where the acts of valuation, which are the
                precondition for knowledge of the social world, allow for the production of
                knowledge itself.</p>
            <p>What I have been arguing throughout this essay is that
                the function of disgust in the gradual and uneven distinction of the sociological
                from the literary domain represents precisely one of these hinges between value and
                fact, but one which in certain contexts has also been invested in the surreptitious
                disavowal of its own rootedness in subjective feeling. For with the unwanted fact of
                repulsion, the fact is constituted by the very strength of its empirical, sensory
                appeal; the fact that it is unwanted houses the fact that it is real. While from a
                certain perspective, disgust’s disturbance of the Enlightenment distinction between
                fact and value might be dismissed as irredeemably irrational, I suggest instead that
                precisely this disruptive power had an intensely generative effect on the entangled
                trajectories of literature and social science over the course of the nineteenth
                century. A literary history of disgust in the period (which would include but exceed
                the literary history of the city) that started out from Wordsworth’s vomiting mill
                would, however, look very different from the outline of the emergence of sociology
                and its disavowal of feeling that I have traced in this essay. Even the most
                insistently realist of literary texts depends on an implicit avowal of something
                like Weber’s point that the reality or truth of its world derives from the affective
                value with which it has been invested. Disgust held out to a great variety of
                nineteenth-century novelists and poets, as well as literary and aesthetic theorists,
                the promise of a medium for exploring the instability of the relationship between
                unwanted fact and negative value: a recurrent motif for Baudelaire, a plot device
                for Gissing—Walter Pater went so far as to assert that “the way to perfection lies
                through a series of disgusts” (103). For sociology, by contrast, disgust served as
                the uncredited source of a series of fundamental concepts and premises. Foremost
                among them was the very idea of the social life of the modern city itself: the
                rotten and fermenting city, the distended mill vomiting out its Malthusian hordes of
                alienated citizens. The need to be rid of the unwanted fact of the social was not
                merely a starting point for social analysis, but the affective logic according to
                which the basic objects of sociological discourse were initially rendered legible
                and distinct as objects rather than as experiences—the affective logic that, over
                the long term, gave rise to the birth of social theory from the spirit of
                disgust.</p></div>
