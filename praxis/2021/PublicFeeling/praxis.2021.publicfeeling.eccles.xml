                <p rend="noCount">For all of its ubiquity in present discourse, complicity is also uniquely susceptible
                    to repression and disavowal: pervasive and totalizing, yet always somewhere else.
                    Working against the reflex to mystify complicity or to externalize it, this essay
                    recovers an aesthetics of complicity in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, a
                    novel that readers have long experienced as difficult to get beyond or to set at a
                    distance. As a mode of reading, complicity is defined by a mixture of intense
                    involvement and aversion, identification and disidentification. A story about
                    radiating damage that also implicates its readers in its harms, Godwin’s novel
                    ensures that any recognition of shared guilt will also amount to a claim in it. In
                    the process, it elaborates a politics grounded not in negative rights but in mutual
                    responsibility.</p>

                <div type="section">
           
            <p>The years of #metoo and the Trump presidency have seemed to install complicity as the
                universal diagnosis of our political present. They have also codified a now-familiar
                ritual of public disavowal: the deluge of personal and institutional statements in
                which denouncement doubles as self-exculpation. In other words: everyone is
                complicit; no one is complicit. I am less interested in the epistemological
                contradiction here than I am in the predictability of this phobic reflex: the
                assumption that complicity is, above all else, something to be shed or disclaimed.
                What forms of subjectivity, we might ask, does this circuit of response assume or
                nurture? What sort of politics do such disavowals enable, and what alternatives do
                they foreclose? What does it mean that the main form of collective agency we are
                capable of envisioning right now—the most recognizable instance of our condition of
                being-together—is also one that we cannot tolerate or own?</p>
            <p>In literary studies as in current political discourse, this peculiar state of
                mystified agency has proved remarkably easy to externalize: a condition we are in
                the business of recognizing, exposing, and implicitly disclaiming. This is one of
                the motivating projects of critique, as anatomized by recent challenges to depth
                    hermeneutics.<note place="foot" resp="author">For the now-standard accounts of structure of critique, see: Eve Sedgwick, <title level="a">Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading</title>; Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus, <title level="a">Surface Reading: An Introduction</title>; Bruno Latour, <title level="a">Why Has Critique Run out of Steam?</title>; and Rita Felski, <title level="m">The Limits of
                            Critique</title>.</note>
                On the other hand, the very pervasiveness of this condition—its diffuse structure
                and banal omnipresence—can easily conduce to desensitization and false
                consciousness. This is the script of ideology itself, of the open secret that is so
                familiar it is barely registered at all.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author">On ideology and the open secret, see Slavoj Žižek, <title level="a">The
                            Spectre of Ideology</title> and D. A. Miller, <title level="a">Secret Subjects, Open
                            Secrets.</title></note> Complicity thus sits at the intersection of a
                pair of powerful cultural scripts, at once the target of critique and the work of
                ideology. In both of these scenarios—whether it is exposed in others or repressed in
                ourselves—complicity would seem to be precisely <emph>what cannot be
                    felt</emph>. This is not to collapse the distance between critique and its object,
                but simply to draw out this initial inference: we seem to be good at identifying
                complicity, and bad at acknowledging it. Another way to put this is to say that it
                is hard to find a way of thinking complicity that is an adequate response to its
                basic shape (its banality, its scope) and that does not in some way reproduce its
                pitfalls (its tendency to replace responsibility with a mystified state of
                exception).</p>
            <p>This essay attempts to see a way beyond this impasse by theorizing complicity as a
                distinctive aesthetic response.<note place="foot" resp="author">For a concept that underpins the project of critique and that is casually invoked with some regularity as a reader response, complicity has attracted little sustained attention as a distinct aesthetic experience. Two important exceptions are Geoffrey Hartman’s brief but suggestive essay on the nouveau roman, <title level="a"> The Aesthetics of Complicity</title>, and Namwali Serpell’s chapter on “enfolding” in <title level="m">Seven Modes of Uncertainty</title>, which puts forward complicity as one of its related effects (see 112–3).</note> To do so, I turn to a text that helped shape
                both of these cultural scripts, William Godwin’s 1794 political novel <title level="m">Things As They Are, or The Adventures of Caleb Williams</title>.
                Frequently cited as the first detective story, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                has also been claimed as a founding parable of “ideology’s internalization” (Lynch
                464). On one level, then, the novel pivots around the very predicament I’ve just
                described. Casting its protagonist as both a paranoid reader-detective <emph>and</emph> a victim of ideological mystification, the novel levels a
                searing critique of “things as they are,” even as it seems to diagnose its
                inadequacy to the task of what Godwin calls “political justice.” In what follows I
                will for the most part be setting these familiar versions of the novel to one side
                in order to concentrate on a range of effects that operate at a different scale, at
                once above and below the privileged formal sites of plot and character. For all of
                its forward propulsion, the novel is often figured in its reception as a spreading,
                lingering atmosphere that enmeshes its readers and sticks with them long after
                reading. And in brief snatches of dialogue and narration, it experiments with forms
                of lyric address that confuse guilty characters and eavesdropping readers. Both
                techniques have the striking effect of making complicity available as a first-person
                experience, at once an object of feeling and a mode of reading. To identify
                complicity, in this context, is also already to take part in it. The
                counterintuitive wager at the heart of this paper is that we might need more, not
                less, complicity to carry ourselves from the injustice of “things as they are” to a
                more equitable world.</p></div>

            <head>Atmosphere</head>
            <p>It is hard to imagine a more succinct articulation of the aesthetic ideology—of the
                utopian belief in the power of fiction to remake subjects and worlds—than the
                ambition Godwin claimed for <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> in his later
                preface to <title level="m">Fleetwood</title> (1832): “I will write a tale, that shall
                constitute an epoch in the mind of the reader, that no one, after he has read it,
                shall ever be exactly the same man that he was before” (350).<note place="foot" resp="author">Although written for a new edition of
                            <title level="m">Fleetwood</title>
                            for Bentley’s Standard Novels series,
                                Godwin’s 1832 preface is in fact entirely dedicated to an account of
                                the writing of <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams</title>. As I will argue, this impulse to return to <title level="m">Caleb
                            Williams</title> in seemingly unrelated contexts is a continuing trope of its reception.</note>
                Formulated as a prediction but offered up only in retrospect, Godwin’s immodest
                aspiration can be read in part as a summary of the novel’s actual reception in the
                years between its publication and this preface. Around the same time, William
                Hazlitt offered a similar assessment of the novel’s cultural impact: “Few books have
                made a greater impression than <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> on its first
                appearance” (144). To paraphrase Godwin, I want to propose that the early critical
                discourse surrounding <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> is specific and
                consistent enough to constitute an event in the history of reading, although one
                that, for reasons that will become clear, has proved difficult to fully
                recognize.</p>
            <p>Some of the most revealing commentaries on the novel appear not in the first wave of
                reviews, but in a series of retrospectives tucked into reviews of other novels. Like
                Godwin in his later preface, these essays turn back to <title level="m">Caleb
                    Williams</title>, and specifically to the experience of reading
                    <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, as though still in its thrall. Many of them describe the
                experience in spatial terms, as an oppressive environment that is difficult to get
                outside of or to set at a distance. Here is John Gibson Lockhart, recalling his
                reading of <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> in an 1817 review of Godwin’s <title level="m">Mandeville</title> (1817):
                <quote>The impression which his story makes upon us is like that of a dismal dream, which we
                feel to be a fiction, and from which we are anxious to escape, but which sits, with
                a gloomy pertinacity, inflexible upon our breast, and compels us, in spite of reason
                and volition, to keep our eyes fixed and steadfast on its gliding phantoms and
                unearthly horrors. (270)</quote>
            In a twist on Coleridge’s formula for poetic illusion, Lockhart describes a
                phenomenon we might call the unwilling suspension of disbelief: a state of immersion
                that endures “in spite of reason and volition.” The quality of persistence finds
                various names in this passage—“inflexibility,” “fixity,” “steadfastness,”
                “pertinacity”—which together conflate the formal continuity of the work with the
                condition of rapt paralysis it engenders in the reader.</p>
            <p>For other readers, this persistence extends even beyond the reading experience. “We
                remember the first time of reading [<title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>] well,
                though now long ago,” recalls Hazlitt, in a review of Godwin’s <title level="m"
                    >Cloudesley</title> (1830); “There is no laying down the book till we come to the
                end; and even then the words still ring in our ears, nor do the mental apparitions
                ever pass away from the eye of memory” (144). The novel seems to diffuse here across
                its own borders, sustaining itself as an echo or an afterimage. The experience
                Hazlitt and Lockhart describe is both a spatial and a temporal condition, defined by
                its extension in space and its duration in time. If the reception of this novel is,
                as I am suggesting, an event in the history of reading, it is one defined precisely
                by its refusal to constitute itself as a self-contained episode or object. This is
                implicit in the double gesture of Hazlitt’s description—a “first time” reading that,
                it turns out, hasn’t really come to an end—as well as the recursive structure of all
                of these accounts, the compulsion to return to <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                in apparently distant contexts.</p>
            <p>In their tendency to describe the novel as an oppressive environment or an ongoing
                experience, Hazlitt and Lockhart point to a set of effects that gather under the
                aesthetic category of <emph>atmosphere</emph>, a term that acquired its
                wider figurative range of reference—including the particular sense of a text’s
                enveloping mood—during the Romantic period (“atmosphere”). In her study of the
                history of this now-dead metaphor, Jayne Elizabeth Lewis identifies the 1790’s, in
                particular, as a turning point in this process. If, in the eighteenth century,
                literary atmosphere maintained a vital connection to the investigation of air in
                natural philosophy, the very success of atmosphere as an aesthetic program in Gothic
                fiction led it to shed its original material associations. Published the same year
                as Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title>, <title level="m">Caleb
                    Williams</title> is significant precisely because it helped usher in this shift.
                Unlike Radcliffe’s novels, which are awash in descriptions of clouded landscapes and
                gloomy interiors, Godwin’s novel generates atmospheric effects that lack an obvious
                mimetic source or counterpart in the text. Notably spare in its physical and
                environmental descriptions, the novel instead offers a study in what we might call
                atmosphere’s metaphorization, recruiting the distinctive phenomenology of weather
                and air to new ends.</p>
            <p>These responses to <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> therefore offer a distinct
                perspective on literary atmosphere just when it was coming into its own as an
                autonomous category. For one thing, they provocatively recombine a set of aesthetic
                phenomena we conventionally oppose. On the one hand, the Gothic images that dominate
                these descriptions (“mental apparitions,” “gliding phantoms,” “unearthly horrors”)
                are the signal tropes of the experience Rita Felski calls enchantment, a “sense of
                intense involvement” in which the instincts of the ego and the demands of the world
                outside the text seem to fall away (<title level="m">Uses of Literature</title> 54).
                But as Lockhart’s “dismal dream” makes clear, this kind of reverie is unwilled and
                dysphoric, charged with a negativity we associate with the stance of critique. Moreover, in these accounts the state of reverie
                is strangely bound up with the apprehension of the work as a coherent form, what
                critics have consistently identified as its “oppressive” “unity of structure and
                atmosphere” (Tompkins 311) or “unity of design” (Kelly).<note place="foot" resp="author">David Perkins contrasts the discourse of Romantic reverie with “spatial metaphors such as ‘structure’ and ‘whole,’” which “name perceptions no reader has actually experienced” (189). What seems distinctive about the response to
                                <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams</title>, and the aesthetic category of atmosphere more generally, is its focus on the 
                            experiential correlates of uniformity and totality.</note>
                Godwin’s claustrophobic atmosphere blends the immersive effects of enchantment or
                reverie with the totalizing intuition of <emph>tone</emph>, another term
                for a work’s global disposition (though one we more readily ascribe to poems than to
                novels). Tone and atmosphere both produce strong “worlding” effects but register
                different kinds of relations between texts and readers. While tone is, as Sianne
                Ngai argues, a powerful resource for ideology critique precisely because of its
                status as an “unfelt” or alienable feeling (43–9), atmosphere,
                Lewis reminds us, is something that “cannot be stood outside of, so it can never be
                completely objectified, fixed, or, as a result, intellectually possessed” (6). If
                the question lurking behind a description of tone is whether a feeling belongs to a
                work or its reader, the question raised by an aesthetics of atmosphere is whether
                the reader might in some sense belong to the work. The sense of totality is
                perceived insofar as the reader also feels herself to be a part of that whole: this
                is a view of a world not from above or outside, but from within.</p>
            <p>In <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, then, atmosphere corresponds to a specific
                kind of readerly experience, in which a heightened impression of proximity and
                involvement is yoked to a sense of discomfort or dysphoria. This ambivalent relation
                diverges sharply from the forms of aesthetic subjectivity Romanticism has most often
                been understood to sponsor. From Coleridge’s willing suspension of disbelief to
                Schiller’s imaginative free play, the dominant strains of Romantic aesthetic theory
                tend to construe aesthetic experience as a pedagogy of negative freedom through
                which the individual subject achieves her most fully realized and self-conscious
                state. In their emphasis on consent, volition, and cognitive freedom, these ideas
                have often been understood either implicitly or explicitly to ground a liberal
                politics. But in these early responses to <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, we
                can discern the contours of another form of aesthetic and political subjectivity,
                which corresponds not to an achieved distance or independence but instead to a sense
                of unfulfilled involvement and obligation. The name I am giving to this alternative
                is complicity.</p></div>
            <div type="section"><head>Caleb and Falkland</head>
            <p>Two stark claims appear in the revised 1798 edition of Godwin’s <title level="m"
                    >Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</title> (first published in 1793), the
                galvanizing text of 1790s British radicalism and founding document of philosophical
                anarchism. “We ought to be able to do without one another,” Godwin pronounces at one
                point (<title level="m">PJ Variants</title> 337). But elsewhere he cautions: “No man
                stands alone, and can pursue his private conceptions of pleasure without affecting
                […] the persons immediately connected with him, and through them, the rest of the
                world” (<title level="m">PJ Variants</title> 210). Leaning with equal and opposite
                force on the preposition “without,” these statements crystallize a seeming paradox.
                On the one hand, Godwin champions the sovereignty of individual reason. He objects
                to any social structures (predictably, governments, schools, and marriage contracts;
                less predictably, theatrical productions, promises, and dinner parties) that
                constrain a person’s ability to think for herself at all times. On the other hand,
                Godwin’s metaphysics insists on the fundamental interdependence of all things in the
                universe. Where his “system of individuality” (PJ 455) seems to enshrine the autonomous
                subject, this “doctrine of necessity” calls the very notion of autonomy into
                question. A person, on this account, is simply the product of her relations, the
                result of forces extending outward in space and backward in time: “[m]an is in no
                case strictly speaking the beginning of any event or series of events that takes
                place in the universe, but only the vehicle through which certain causes operate”
                    (<title level="m">PJ</title> 168). Seen from this perspective, the private reason
                that Godwin wants to shelter from social control would seem never to have been
                private in the first place; as Frances Ferguson puts it, “Godwin conceives of the
                individual as requiring external impressions to be an individual at all” (100). He
                therefore sits uneasily at the junction of differing intellectual traditions,
                alternately assimilable to a lineage of liberal individualism and to a genealogy of
                social determinism.</p>
            <p>These two currents of Godwin’s political theory can be seen to intersect, or perhaps
                collide, in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, a novel that introduces two
                paradigmatic liberal subjects—an ingénue and an outcast—who become inextricably
                bound to one another through the discovery of a hidden crime.<note place="foot" resp="author">The major account of how these competing perspectives—the individualist and the deterministic—play out in <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams</title> is Ferguson’s chapter on the Gothic in <title level="m">Solitude and the
                                Sublime</title>. Much of the novel’s critical reception has itself been shaped by these alternative frameworks. For many years, Godwin’s rationalist individualism prevailed as a hermeneutic: Harvey Gross, Alex Gold, Gary Handwerk, and John Bender all read Caleb’s narrative as a quest for autonomy, however failed or compromised. More recently, Brian Michael Norton and Anna Maria Jones have drawn attention to Godwin’s necessitarianism, with Norton describing Godwin’s shift from a Stoic concept of personal happiness to an Epicurean concept of public welfare, and Jones reading
                                <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams</title> as a critique of the Gothic’s conflictual model of personal rights. In a compelling reading that seeks to
                                reconcile these views, Daniel Stout suggests that the novel calls
                                for a legal theory of “easement” that would maneuver between the
                                absolutist claims of private property and communal ownership. Taken
                                together, these last three arguments suggest the remarkable degree
                                to which the novel reclaims the quintessential Enlightenment
                                bequests of happiness (Norton), rights (Jones), and property (Stout)
                                as fundamentally social and transpersonal.</note>
                Caleb is an orphan who is hired as secretary to the reclusive landowner Ferdinand
                Falkland. As he digs into his employer’s past, he becomes increasingly obsessed with
                the mysterious death of Falkland’s neighbor. When Caleb extracts a confession from
                Falkland—that he killed his neighbor and allowed two innocent men to be executed in
                his place—their fortunes become permanently entwined. Caleb possesses the secret
                that could ruin Falkland, and Falkland has the full weight of a corrupt justice
                system to bring down on Caleb. Driven to desperation by Falkland’s persecution,
                Caleb finally resolves to expose him in public, ruining both of their lives in the
                process.</p>
            <p>As this synopsis makes clear, although <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> seems to
                promise a conventional novelistic account of an individual, it actually gives us the
                inseparable stories of two protagonists. This structure provocatively installs not a
                character but an enigmatic relation at the heart of the novel. The relationship
                between Caleb and Falkland has long been a crux of the novel’s criticism. Some
                critics have questioned whether they are separate characters at all, preferring to
                see their relationship as an internal drama of the psyche (Uphaus and Storch) or an
                allegory of the conflict between individual and society (Gross and Ferguson). Others
                have disagreed about the pathology that binds them together—whether this is a story
                about excessive love and self-loss on the one hand (Gold) or about animosity and
                self-regard on the other (Jones). The sheer variety of these accounts testifies to
                the difficulty of assimilating Caleb and Falkland to a normative sense of
                individuated personhood. If Caleb and Falkland aren’t exactly their own persons,
                they might instead be seen as each other’s accomplices.</p>
            <p>Such a characterization would seem overly specific if their relationship weren’t so
                emphatically determined by the novel’s overarching juridical framework of innocence
                and guilt. Thus, in the first half of the novel, Caleb’s growing attachment to
                Falkland is propelled by his intuition of Falkland’s guilt, just as, after Falkland
                frames Caleb for theft, Caleb’s quest for personal liberty depends on the
                demonstration of his own innocence. In this way, both halves of the novel—the
                mystery and the chase, or what Godwin called its “offensive” and “defensive”
                parts—bind a socio-formal question of relation to a moral determination of innocence
                or guilt. The force of Caleb’s famous closing lines—“I began these memoirs with the
                idea of vindicating my own character. I have now no character that I wish to
                vindicate” (303)—should be felt on both of these levels, as at once a surrender of
                proprietary selfhood (the kind of character he would call his “own”) and of his
                claims to innocence. In a narrative centered on the practice of framing—as Falkland
                first allows the Hawkinses to hang for the murder he committed, and then pins a
                robbery on Caleb—the scandal of the conclusion is essentially to assent to the
                framing. Just as it hesitates to claim Caleb or Falkland as its protagonist, the
                novel finally refuses to choose between innocence and guilt. They are guilty because
                they are together and together insofar as they are both guilty.<note place="foot" resp="author">This reading of the conclusion
                            dovetails with Stout’s resonant comments about the scene: “guilt is
                            shared and therefore comes to be something that is not quite, not <emph>properly</emph>, guilt. Quasi guilty or quasi innocent
                            is how things are left, is things as they are” (168).</note>
                Godwin suggests that innocence is only really achievable in the absence of other
                persons and that any form of sociality will involve, perhaps even originate in, a
                sharing of blame.</p>
            <p>Moreover, what is true of Caleb and Falkland holds for the novel’s minor characters
                too: the baffling proliferation of surrogates and bystanders who motivate, execute,
                or enable the actions of others (the henchmen Grimes and Jones, the informant
                Spurrel, Falkland’s half-brother Forester). The overwhelming impression is of
                overpopulation, of more characters than are needed to carry out the basic movements
                of the plot. Even the persecution of Caleb turns out to be the joint handiwork of
                Falkland and Forester. Perhaps most tellingly of all, the novel is entirely
                noncommittal in apportioning blame between them: we’re quite not sure, in the end,
                of who did what exactly, and it doesn’t seem to matter. Against the forensic clarity
                of the whodunit, against Caleb’s cherished conviction that guilt is what
                individuates (“I always declared…that I was the perpetrator of no guilt, but that
                the guilt wholly belonged to my accuser” [264]), the novel instead repeatedly
                implies that guilt is something we hold in common.</p>
            <p>If, in contemporary usage, complicity is a pejorative term—a condition to be shed or
                disavowed—in <title level="m">Political Justice</title> as in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, it emerges as the unexpected ground for Godwin’s ethics. The
                notion of a universe “connected and cemented in all of its parts” is in fact the
                premise behind Godwin’s concept of justice, the only absolute value in his system of
                morality (<title level="m">PJ</title> 68). Justice—“a rule of conduct originating in
                the connection of one percipient being with another” (<title level="m">PJ</title>
                49)—is precisely this principle of relation recast as an ethical injunction, a
                person’s obligation to contribute in every way possible to the welfare of humanity
                at large. Godwin’s absolutist notion of justice led him to an idiosyncratic
                rejection of individual rights, a position that set him well outside the mainstream
                of English liberal thought in the 1790s. If we take a “right” to be “a full and
                complete power of either doing a thing or omitting it, without the person’s becoming
                liable to animadversion or censure from another,” Godwin explains, “man has no
                rights, no discretionary power whatever” (<title level="m">PJ</title> 67).</p>
            <p>In its propensity to generalize blame, Godwin’s philosophy has clear affinities with
                the stringent logic of “tragic responsibility” that Sandra Macpherson has unearthed
                in eighteenth-century fiction and liability law. Like the realist novels Macpherson
                discusses, Godwin’s political theory insists on the responsibility we bear for the
                unintended effects of our actions. But alongside his attention to such
                externalities, Godwin retains a place for what Macpherson calls the “adventure of
                interiority” (23). At once more and less radical than this tradition of tragic
                realism, Godwin’s utopian anarchism cannot surrender the project of justice to a
                state empowered to mete out punishments and rewards. The “justice” in <title level="m">Political Justice</title> is not, therefore, the one contemplated by
                the law of torts, or by the law in general. It is an ongoing principle of action
                rather than a system of accountability for past actions. “If justice have any
                meaning,” Godwin explains, “it is just that I should contribute everything in my
                power to the benefit of the whole” (<title level="m">PJ</title>49). Godwin’s unusual
                recourse to the first-person pronoun in this definition makes it clear that even as
                the object of justice expands to humanity in general its execution remains a
                subjective problem. The peculiarity of Godwin’s political theory is this strenuous
                insistence on the welfare of “the whole” and the comportment of the individual. The
                problem of justice is to bring these incommensurable quantities into some kind of
                meaningful relationship, to turn the universal into a matter of intimate concern.
                The achievement of <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> is to explore what
                complicity might feel like, and how that kind of feeling might become a prompt for
                action—in Godwin’s terms, a way of making justice political.</p></div>
                <div type="section">
            <head>Feeling Complicit</head>
            <p>Even though he spends most of the novel under some form of restraint, Caleb often
                dwells on the sensuous, embodied experience of his own freedom. When he escapes from
                prison, he marvels: “The night was gloomy, and it drizzled with rain. But these were
                circumstances I had scarcely the power to perceive; all was sunshine and joy within
                me. I hardly felt the ground; I repeated to myself a thousand times, I am free. What
                concern have I with danger and alarm! I feel that I am free; I feel that I will
                continue so” (151). Caleb seems to have an intuitive sense of personal liberty,
                perceptible here as a feeling of movement and weightlessness, an acute
                self-awareness that is notably indexed to an attenuation of his physical
                surround.</p>
            <p>It is less obvious how the state of complicity might become an object of embodied,
                phenomenal knowledge. Indeed, more than anything, the consciousness of self in
                relation to a wider collective that <emph>Political Justice</emph>
                prescribes—the insight that “[w]e are not connected with one or two percipient
                beings, but with a society, a nation, and in some sense with the whole family of
                mankind” (<title level="m">PJ</title> 50)—poses a basic problem of apprehension. The
                expansive object of care that Godwin identifies as “the species,” “the whole and not
                a part,” or “the general weal” would seem to be by definition unavailable to
                anyone’s immediate sensory perception. But Caleb does intermittently experience a
                sense of involvement in an enveloping totality. Consider, for instance, the novel’s
                turning point, where Caleb impulsively decides to break into the chest he believes
                to be holding Falkland’s secret. The scene takes place during a fire, and Caleb
                specifically describes his “monstrous” deed as an effect of his surroundings: “This
                was the first instance in which I had witnessed a danger by fire. All was confusion
                around me, and all changed into hurricane within. The general situation to my
                unpracticed apprehension partook of the desperate, and I by contagion became alike
                desperate” (130). This scene describes an “involuntary sympathy” between self and
                circumstances, part and whole—a principle of “contagion” that is embodied in the
                spread of the fire itself.</p>
            <p>Something similar happens when Falkland is called to preside over the trial of a
                local peasant who has been accused of murder. Watching the proceedings, Caleb
                experiences a pressing sense of intimacy with Falkland, a strange compound of
                suspicion and sympathy: <quote>His countenance was embarrassed and anxious; he scarcely saw any body. The
                examination had not proceeded far, before he chanced to turn his eye to the part of
                the room where I was. […] [W]e exchanged a silent look, by which we told volumes to
                each other. Mr Falkland's complexion turned from red to pale, and from pale to red.
                I perfectly understood his feelings, and would willingly have withdrawn myself. But
                it was impossible; my passions were too deeply engaged; I was rooted to the spot;
                though my own life, that of my master, or almost of a whole nation had been at
                stake, I had no power to change my position. (123)</quote>
           These scenes of affective intensity pay a peculiar attention to scenery itself—in the
                first case, through Caleb’s heightened receptiveness to his material surroundings
                and, in this one, through a hyperawareness of bodies in space, of positions and
                sightlines. Here, in a notable inversion of foreground and background, we get a
                conspicuous focus on Caleb’s position and role as a bystander, a focus that is
                pointedly dramatized when Falkland turns his gaze upon Caleb, as though to draw him
                into the scene he thinks he is simply watching. That pivot might be said to trace
                the signature arc of complicity: the moment when spectators become participants, or
                when mere proximity shades into oblique involvement.</p>
            <p>What we might call Caleb’s feeling for circumstance in this passage culminates in the
                last sentence, the sequence of substitutions in which Caleb briefly imagines that
                his “own life,” or Falkland’s, or a “whole nation[’s]” are “at stake.” This climax
                strikingly embeds Godwin’s necessitarian philosophy—which likewise moves from “one
                or two percipient beings” to “a nation” to “the whole family of mankind”—in a
                hypothetical grammar intended most explicitly to attest to Caleb’s inability to act
                upon it. Against the feeling of weightless independence we saw above, this scene
                counterposes a fleeting sense of responsibility to a larger collective, albeit one
                oddly provoked by his own inadequate response to it.</p></div>

            <head>Apostrophe and the Novel</head>
            <p>In these scenes, we might recognize some of the same features that distinguished <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> as an aesthetic experience for its early
                readers: the atmospheric awareness that made a perception of the whole consistent
                with a feeling of being inside and the state of unwilling paralysis that marked
                Lockhart’s “dismal dream.” What seems to link all of these experiences is a
                condition of problematic or unwilled immersion—a state of absorption no less
                powerful for the resistance it provokes. What might we glean from these examples,
                then, about how <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> produces the impression that
                it does?</p>
            <p>We saw that during the peasant’s trial, Caleb’s feeling of complicity coincides with
                a shift of address that causes him to think of himself as at once a spectator and a
                potential agent in the unfolding scene, an ambivalent condition that he experiences
                most concretely as a state of frustrated action. I want to suggest that the novel
                achieves a similar effect through its most significant—and most
                overlooked—structuring device, the framing or the wrongful accusation. After
                Falkland confesses his crime to Caleb, he falsely charges Caleb with theft, planting
                some of his own things in Caleb’s luggage to corroborate the allegation. This ruse
                not only effectively shifts the focus of suspicion from Falkland to Caleb, but also,
                more subtly, extends a version of Caleb’s predicament to the novel’s readers. For
                the rest of the novel, Caleb’s knowledge of Falkland’s guilt (against the widespread
                belief in his innocence) is shadowed by our conviction in Caleb’s innocence (against
                the circumstantial evidence of his guilt). Both situations deploy a form of
                knowledge that exceeds or outpaces the capacity for action. This makes for a
                uniquely exasperating reading experience: in one scene after another, we watch Caleb
                struggle, and fail, to convince former comrades of what we already “know” to be
                true. Here, then, is a situation that uniquely disables some of our familiar scripts
                for reading narrative: this is not a reading for the plot, or a suspicious reading
                for the symptom. Instead, the frustration derives from the fact that all is plain,
                that we know too much.</p>
            <p>Although this predicament broadly characterizes the experience of reading the novel
                in the wake of Falkland’s confession, its effects tend to be concentrated in
                particular scenes, and even more narrowly, in specific moments of dialogue. The
                example I want to consider in some detail here is the improvised hearing that
                Falkland’s half-brother Forester convenes after Falkland accuses Caleb of theft.
                Closely following and conspicuously restaging the peasant’s trial, the scene is
                charged with a sense of déjà vu: we find some of the same characters assembled in a
                similar configuration, as though we’re experiencing the earlier trial again from a
                slightly different vantage point. Where the first scene of judgment came to focus
                oddly on Caleb, the “deeply engaged” bystander (123), this one palpably shifts
                attention to the novel’s readers, who are likewise implicated in and barred from
                participating in the proceedings.</p>
            <p>This scene is constructed to pivot around Caleb’s lack of evidence—a problem that
                takes the wealth of circumstantial detail we’ve encountered as readers and converts
                it into a damaging absence. Faced with the stolen items Falkland has planted with
                his belongings, Caleb’s only recourse is to insist on his innocence. Without
                evidence or witnesses to support his case, he calls on Falkland to testify on his
                behalf: <quote>Mr Falkland is not deceived: he perfectly knows that I am innocent. [. . .] I make
                this averment not merely because it is solemnly true, but because it is inseparably
                connected with my vindication. I am the party accused, and I shall be told that I am
                not to be believed in my own defence. I can produce no other witnesses of my
                innocence; I therefore call upon Mr Falkland to be my evidence. (163)</quote>
            Caleb represents his predicament as a double bind: the only witnesses to the alleged
                crime are the accused and the accuser. One is unreliable and the other is lying. But
                the very terms in which he lays out this problem—his concession that “I can produce
                no other witnesses of my innocence”—may remind readers of their own status as
                vicarious witnesses in this hearing, in possession of the supporting testimony that
                Caleb lacks.</p>
            <p>The reader’s muteness thus joins Caleb’s unreliability and Falkland’s mendacity in
                Caleb’s predicament here: in this intimate circle of shared knowledge, each witness
                is equally incapable of vindicating the accused. It’s hard not to read the questions
                that Caleb poses—“Did you never boast to me in private of your power to ruin me? [ .
                . . ] Did you not tell me that, though I should prepare in that case a tale ever so
                plausible or ever so true, you would take care that the whole world should execrate
                me as an imposter? Were not those your very words?” (164)—as sidelong appeals to his
                readers, who, like Falkland, know enough to return a clear affirmative to each.</p>
            <p>This impression is strengthened by the fact that Caleb invokes specifically verbal
                evidence in his defense—not only transcribing exact bits of dialog we’ve read, but
                pointing out that he is doing so, effectively referring us back to the relevant
                passages in the text. His repetitions prompt and reward leafing back through the
                pages to locate their originals, thereby compelling a rereading, and leveraging that
                rereading as a form of proof.<note place="foot" resp="author"> To appreciate how exact these auto-quotations are, compare Caleb’s question, “Did you not tell me that, though I should prepare in that case a tale ever so plausible or ever so true, you would take care that the whole world should execrate me as an impostor” (164) to Falkland’s earlier warning, “prepare a tale ever so plausible, or ever so true, the whole world shall execrate you as an impostor” (150), and Caleb’s “Did you not add that my innocence should be of no service to me, and that you laughed at so feeble a defence?” (164) to Falkland’s “Your innocence shall be of no service to you; I laugh at so feeble a defence” (150).</note>
                As if to reinforce the point, Caleb’s final appeal in his cross-examination is
                explicitly to a text: <quote>Did you not receive a letter from me the morning of the day on which I had departed,
                requesting your consent to my departure? [. . .] Should I have begun with stating that
                I had conceived a desire to quit your service, if my desire and the reasons for it
                had been of the nature that is now alleged? Should I have dared to ask for what
                reason I was thus subjected to an eternal penance? Saying this, I took out a copy of
                my letter and laid it open upon the table. (164)</quote> Caleb’s directive to read his letter again concentrates the act of rereading elicited
                by the passage in general upon a specific text within the diegesis. Turning Falkland
                quite literally into a re-reader of Caleb’s text, this move registers the degree to
                which this passage has already worked to fuse the position of Caleb’s accuser and
                the position of the novel’s readers. The strongly interpellated second person in
                Caleb’s speech—“you” or “your” appears eleven times in this short passage—is, in
                fact, a strangely mixed character. In the actions imputed to it (“Did you never
                boast to me in private of your power to ruin me?”), “you” is clearly Falkland; but
                in the kind of textually specific knowledge demanded of it, “you” is asked to behave
                more like a reader. We might say more precisely that this passage’s ideal addressee
                is a Falkland who could somehow have read a transcript of his own conversations with
                Caleb: a kind of Falkland-reader hybrid. The fleeting materialization of the past as
                a text (in the form of Caleb’s letter) both reflects this fantasy and marks its
                impossibility.</p>
            <p>When Caleb turns from Falkland to Forester and then to Falkland’s servants, his
                entreaties confuse characters and readers in similar ways: “I will never believe
                that a man conscious of innocence, cannot make other men perceive that he has that
                thought. Do not you feel that my whole heart tells me, I am not guilty of what is
                imputed to me?” (165). A fit of magical thinking in its immediate context, the
                condition of mental transparency Caleb presumes here is also familiar as the signal
                effect of reading a psychological novel—the form that Godwin would later call a
                “metaphysical dissecting knife” for “tracing and laying bare” “the private and
                internal operations of the mind” (“Preface” 350). Here, in other words, Caleb makes
                the same category error, treating his actual listeners like the readers of his
                narrative and making his readers feel like a more proximate audience. Like his
                demand that Falkland come to his aid and “be [his] evidence,” his plea to the
                servants makes an oblique exhortation to those who have been reading his mind all
                along: “If you believe, if you see, if you know that I am innocent, speak for me”
                (167). These repeated appeals, then, implicitly cast the reader in the uncomfortable
                role of a mute witness, bearing the exact testimony that Caleb requires to prove his
                innocence.</p>
            <p>Rather than emerging from a deep insight into a character’s motivations or a sense of
                elective affinity with a character’s interests, complicity arises here as a
                contingent effect of the felt coincidence between a character’s position and a
                reader’s. In this case, the passage is strongly focalized on Caleb and our loyalties
                are unmistakably on his side. At the same time, the hearing brings about a
                structural alignment between Falkland and the reader by confounding Falkland’s
                memory with the reader’s familiarity with the narrative past. More an effect of
                circumstance than fellow-feeling, complicity may therefore draw us into
                uncomfortable relations with those we might prefer to disavow. Blending intimacy and
                recoil, it diverges from the forms of characterological engagement placed under the
                more familiar rubric of identification. If we instinctively identify with Caleb’s
                sense of injury in this scene, our inevitable silence in the face of his challenges
                draws us close to Falkland’s lie. We are made to feel this proximity in the space of
                the dramatic pause that follows Caleb’s questions, when Falkland’s refusal to
                respond blends momentarily into our own agitated silence: “Mr Falkland returned no
                immediate answer to my interrogations. Mr Forester turned to him, and said, Well,
                sir, what is your reply to this challenge of your servant?” (164).</p>
            <p>In their explicit juridical setting and the repeated staging of such “turns,” these
                scenes in fact literalize the trope of apostrophe, defined by Quintilian as “turning
                the discourse [away] from the judge” (2:238). Quintilian generally advises against
                such deflections, “it being natural to speak to those chiefly, whom we wish to have
                our cause at heart” (2:207). When Caleb turns away from Forester to address
                Falkland, or from Falkland to the servants, he makes an “unnatural” appeal to those
                without the power to decide. Caleb’s oblique addresses to the reader are more
                unnatural still since they violate the circuit of narrative communication itself. If
                narrative form, like the juridical scene, erects a rigorous separation between
                participants and bystanders, characters and readers, apostrophe refuses to recognize
                that distinction.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Culler defines apostrophe as a quintessentially lyric form: “[O]ne might be
                justified in taking apostrophe as the figure of all that is most radical,
                embarrassing, pretentious, and mystificatory in the lyric, even seeking to identify
                apostrophe with lyric itself” (60). But apostrophe turns out to be everywhere in
                this novel, not only in exchanges like the ones we’ve just examined, but in the
                syntax of its regular narration. Caleb’s explicit invocations rarely address the
                actual reader; instead, they call upon absent characters: Thomas, Collins, and,
                especially toward the end, Falkland. In one striking case, the apostrophe—the single
                imperative “Tremble!”—is even centered and set off from the rest of the paragraph like a poetic quotation (291). The device is so pervasive in the closing pages of
                the novel that Falkland briefly becomes the novel’s implied audience. The last three
                paragraphs all address Falkland directly, culminating in the novel’s final lines: “I
                will finish [these memoirs] that thy story may be fully understood; and that, if
                those errors of thy life be known which thou so ardently desiredst to conceal, the
                world may at least not hear and repeat a half-told and mangled tale” (303). Folding
                together the local and the general second person, these sentences inscribe the
                uncomfortable intimacies of the trial into the novel’s rhetorical scene.</p></div>
                <div type="section">
            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>Culler opposes apostrophe and narrative on the grounds that apostrophe substitutes
                the present of discourse—“the special temporality which is the set of all moments at
                which writing can say ‘now’”—for the temporal sequence of narrative (66). Where
                narrative is the representation of an event, apostrophe aspires to become one. What
                to make of Godwin’s deployment of this paradigmatic lyric form and my own recourse
                to lyric theory to explain what it feels like to read this novel of ideas?
                Complicity seems to arise precisely from a condition of generic incoherence, a kind
                of interference between the standard scripts of narrative and lyric utterance. For,
                even as Godwin evokes this lyric temporality, he also doubles down on the pressure
                of narrative sequence, the strong form of emplotment he would later mythologize in
                claiming to have written the novel backwards. The intimate present that these scenes
                construct is thereby always yoked, through plot’s inexorable logic of cause and
                effect, to a cascade of potentially devastating consequences. If, as another
                canonical account would have it, poetry is overheard, complicity names the
                conditions under which the experience of lyric overhearing becomes difficult to
                bear.</p>
            <p>Like any narrative, Godwin’s novel marks the difference between now and then, this
                world and that one, story and discourse. It also seeks to collapse that distance:
                with an oppressive atmosphere that softens the boundary between a text’s inside and
                outside and with slant apostrophes that strive to make a demand of you, here and
                now. Complicity turns the process of reception into an experience of responsibility
                that can neither be refused nor fully discharged. If that demand must always issue
                in a kind of failure, frustration also becomes the condition of its persistence—a
                persistence that readers like Hazlitt and Lockhart register when they describe the
                novel’s way of sticking around as a ringing in the ears or a bad dream that doesn’t
                let you go. The novel finally inverts the moral error that Godwin suggests we commit
                in conceiving of ourselves as righteous and rights-bearing subjects. If, in life, we
                all too often feel autonomous when we are vehicles of harm, as readers, we sometimes
                feel strangely responsible precisely when or because we can do nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Taking shape in the subtle shifts of address between possible audiences and in the
                oscillation between compelled identification and reactive disidentification that
                such appeals produce, the effects I am describing exploit the very ambiguity and
                imprecision that has long exercised theorists of reading about their object of
                study. For several decades now, the projects of narrative theory, reader response
                theory, the history of the book, and the history of reading have multiplied
                reader-avatars at various degrees of regress and inference from the text, usually in
                order to single out one in particular as worthy of critical attention: narratees,
                implied readers, ideal readers, “the reader,” bad readers, empirical readers, the
                reading public. Godwin’s text is just as relentless in proliferating potential
                readers, from the radical openness of the appeal to futurity at the beginning
                (Caleb’s “faint idea” of a “posterity” that might believe him [3]) to the overdetermined
                address to Falkland at the end. And it is especially attentive to the strange
                pressure that these readers may exert on one another. Just as Caleb leaves a letter
                for Falkland such that “the way in which it offered itself to his attention, should
                suggest to him the idea that it had possibly passed through my hands” (113),
                Godwin’s later retrospective on the novel presents the anecdote of a friend who read
                it “in a few hours” before bed, a figure who ambiguously serves as both model and
                negative example for other readers (“Preface” 352). Reading, thus construed, opens
                up a social relation—not only in the forms of sociality embodied by empirical
                reading publics, but in the felt connections between these never-quite-identical
                recipients. Complicity, of course, is not the only form that that relation might
                take; we can think of straightforwardly attractive and aversive relations like
                emulation and rejection as strong alternatives. But as a particularly intense and
                ambivalent one, it helps open the full range of these possibilities to view. It
                reminds us of the ways we always read as, against, and through one another.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in a moment when reading seems to present itself as a series of
                dilemmas—surface or depth? paranoid or reparative? critical or
                uncritical?—complicity presents a structure of aesthetic response strikingly defined
                by its refusal to choose between those alternatives. It combines, as we have seen,
                absorption with discomfort, surrender with recoil, identification with
                disidentification. Between these theoretical poles lies a realm of experience that
                points toward something like what Godwin calls “politics”—the work, that is, of
                putting a principle of morality into practice. That is the threshold where Godwin’s
                fiction means to leave us.</p>
