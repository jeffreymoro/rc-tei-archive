               convergence of helplessness and guilt, injury and incrimination. This afterword tracks
               the mood of complicity through the collection, with the aim of elucidating how the

                  <p>Let me begin by suggesting that the phrase “public feeling” might involve redundancy
                     in the same way that “public language,” and “private feeling” might be as much an
                     impossibility as “private language.”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Indeed, the question of private language in Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations
                              (especially par. 243–315) is inseparable from questions about the privacy of sensation
                              and the communicability of feeling.</span></div>
                     </div> I do not mean that we do not often, for good reason, wonder about “what is going on
                     in his head,” or worry that “she’s keeping it all bottled up inside,” or mutter about
                     “never understanding what they want.” Such utterances are themselves articulations
                     of feeling—frustration, apprehension, bewilderment—issued in response to words and
                     deeds that may well include unmistakably apparent suppressions of feeling such as
                     the concealments Stanley Cavell describes in my epigraph. To assume an existential
                     rift or metaphysical divide between what is hidden (“private feeling”) and what is
                     expressed (“public feeling”) is to deny (perhaps inadvertently) how well we ordinarily
                     read one another. Even resolute withholding, cold indifference, and blank impassivity
                     are recognizably expressive. The depth and extent of our feeling together entails
                     no singular or important “feat of cognition,” as Cavell reminds us, but is an incumbent
                     “call upon us,” an ongoing task that is shared even if rarely mutual (435).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The editors of this volume ask how poetry “interferes in, perpetuates, or rearticulates
                  feelings circulated in zones of sociality loosely denoted as public,” and in so doing
                  they begin with the kind of acknowledgment Cavell urges. To recognize that emotions
                  pass between us as expressions and outcries (and also as the felt silencing of expressions
                  and outcries) is also to acknowledge that there is no other “zone” in which they circulate:
                  the “publicness” of feeling is coeval with its forms of expression.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The contributions gathered here expand the region of the public in a way that invites
                     us to consider that even the precincts of privacy are shaped by sociality. The first
                     essay stakes itself on the grounds of just such a paradox. Anastasia Eccles begins
                     with the juxtaposition of two apparently contradictory assertions from Godwin’s <em>Political Justice</em>: the first stating as a given the necessary interdependence of all persons (“no man…
                     can stand alone”); the second asserting the prospect of independence: “We ought to
                     be able to do without one another.”
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Eccles, “Feeling Complicit in William Godwin’s Caleb Williams.” The quotations
                              from the Enquiry Concerning Political Justice come from the Appendix 
                              “Of Cooperation, Cohabitation, and Marriage”
                              in the revised third edition (London: G.G. and J. Robinson, 1798), Volume II, 499
                              and 505.</span></div>
                     </div> The phrasing of the latter formulation is curious. Prescriptive and wistful at once,
                     it draws attention to the interrelation between the tone or mood of an utterance and
                     the conceptual possibilities it allows and forecloses. “We ought to be able to do
                     without one another” sounds rather more like “we ought to be in Rome” (the reverie
                     of a busy afternoon when the prospect of such an escape is impracticable) than “we
                     ought to pay down this debt” (an imperative that might or might not be possible).
                     If the “ought” commands the impossible, and thereby intimates a wish, then the sentiment
                     itself seems in disagreement with the grammatical subject of the sentence: the inclusive
                     second person plural. Godwin’s “we” joins us together in conceding the fleeting, occasional
                     desire for an independence that is impossible precisely because we know that “no man
                     stands alone.” I am suggesting that “We ought to be able” in this phrase is akin to
                     “I (sometimes) wish I could,” but that Godwin’s syntax lays stress on the collective
                     and shared fantasy of doing “without one another.” Let’s say that Godwin counts on,
                     and elicits, our complicity in this “ought” that is really a wish.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>“No man stands alone” is best understood as a “sociological” fact and a “third person”
                     epistemic claim rather than a “first person” testimony. We are all, each one of us,
                     existentially interdependent, shaped by and vulnerable to political and economic conditions,
                     historical encumbrances, material constraints, and so forth. Kant would classify such
                     considerations as matters for “practical anthropology.” By contrast, an assertion
                     (or is it rather an exclamation?) such as “We ought to be able to do without one another”
                     expresses a determination, a discovery (or is it a longing?) freed from all empirical
                     considerations. Godwin’s oddly phrased counterfactual wish corresponds to the imaginable,
                     unreal, and unrealizable autonomy that is the stubbornly held aspiration of Kant's
                     metaphysics of morals——the “precarious position” philosophy must somehow hold “firm”
                     though there is “nothing on heaven or on earth” on which it is based (Kant 35).

                     </div> The distinction between the subject matter of “practical anthropology” and the concerns
                     of what Kant calls “morals” is meant to clear the way for theorization of a “pure
                     will,” the activity of which can never be proven or verified by our experience but
                     is nevertheless not fantasy either. We are not being asked to choose between anthropology
                     and morals, between “sociological fact” and speculative fiction or theory, but to
                     recognize how the form of an inquiry itself shapes the object of the inquiry. This
                     methodological insight is especially germane to the claims made in this collection
                     about the epistemic contributions of poetic form. Maintaining a strict “division of
                     labor” between empirical and non-empirical modes of inquiry is crucial, Kant thinks,
                     in order to meaningfully account for, and to take seriously, intuitions involving
                     freedom, obligation, respect, and dignity that seem to have no foundation in “things
                     as they are.” But if those intuitions are without empirical basis, why take them seriously
                     at all? It is fair to say that all the essays in this collection argue that it is
                     the work of literature to bring us to know something—about power, about guilt, about
                     aversion, fear, and resolution—which can only be recognized as such if we grant the
                     possibility of what the editors term a “poetics of knowledge."</p>
               </div>
               <p>As the editors note in their introduction, the essays collected here vary widely in
                  method, subject matter, and historical sweep, but they all address the imbrication
                  of aesthetic form and emotions, and each finds, in that imbrication, points of ethical
                  inflection. The opening proposition of the collection—that “feeling is part of a structured
                  world”—itself suggests a movement away from approaches to affect influenced by evolutionary
                  psychology and neuroscience. There is no effort made in these essays to seek consilience
                  with, or corroboration from, research in other disciplines. And if no single theoretical
                  framework guides this movement away from a scientistically-inclined interdisciplinarity,
                  there is nevertheless a tacit methodological commitment to the practice of close reading
                  that is (as Jonathan Kramnick has recently argued) the most specific competency of
                  literary studies as a discipline (4). It is from the renewed commitment to close reading
                  in these essays that emotional and ethical response emerge as mutually determining.
                  The question is how to understand that co-implication without losing the specificity
                  of its articulation in literary form.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The emphasis on complicity that is present in all the essays emerges from careful
                     attention to subtle shadings of emotion, to spectrums of affective intensity, and
                     to judgments that combine feeling, cognition, and bodily sensation. Even that most
                     visceral of reactions—disgust—is shown to have such a composite structure. What the
                     collection as a whole can be taken to argue is that certain forms of moral experience
                     and reflection given to us in literature become available to us as readers only insofar
                     as we resist the temptation to translate—and thereby subordinate—their logic and their
                     poetry to explanatory frameworks (sociological, physiological, historicist).

                              intellectual currents: the “deflation” of ideals of considered deliberation and ethical
                              reasoning found in the cognitive and neurosciences on the one hand, and, on the other
                              hand, the decentering of agency, the emphasis on “forces that take place behind the
                              backs of individual subjects,” that is paradigmatic of post-structuralist and post-humanist
                              approaches in the humanities (24). For a useful account of how the “zeal of theory
                              construction” hardens distinctions between the always “mutually implicated categori…</span></div>
                     </div> Moreover, and as the emphasis upon complicity suggests, the co-implication of emotions
                     and ethics that all the essays in this collection attend to seems also to require
                     new ways of speaking about agency—even while reckoning with individual and collective
                     powerlessness. To return briefly to Kant, the “precarious position” the philosopher
                     holds, ungrounded by anything “on heaven or on earth,” is the fragile “standpoint”
                     upon which each thinks of herself as (if) “under the idea of freedom.” Something other
                     than, or more than, mystification or delusion might be at work in imagining ourselves
                     as capable of recognizing and resisting powers the determining force of which we also
                     recognize. In much the same way, the feeling of complicity, even though it accompanies
                     a sense of powerlessness, seems to depend on some “idea of freedom,” even as (only)
                     a kind of negative capability.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To take the first-person perspective seriously is to acknowledge that an adequate
                     and complete explanatory account of our conditions (of “things as they are” for us
                     and between us) is incommensurate with the bases upon which we expect and demand an
                     accounting from one another. Christine Korsgaard (among the most important revisionist
                     readers of Kant in the past half century) situates this first-person perspective in
                     the “intersubjective” realm within which we hold one another responsible—for what
                     we do together and apart, for how we fail one another, and even, yes, for how we feel.

                     </div> Crucially, to say that the first-person perspective is non-empirical is <em>not</em> to say that it is a kind of mistaken evasion of the material determinants that the
                     third-person perspective discloses. The first-person perspective is not an illusion
                     to be demystified. “We ought to be able to do without one another” does not aspire
                     to be a counter-factual denial of “no man stands alone.” It is an utterance in a different
                     register, so to speak. The complicity the phrase assumes and elicits—and elicits precisely <em>by assuming it</em>—depends on my assent in a way that “no man stands alone” does not. I must acknowledge,
                     at the very least, that I know what it might mean to wish to do without another, that
                     I get the gist of that sentiment even if (I say to myself) that I do not share it.
                     (We may understand Godwin’s phrase as a speech act of the kind that Eric Lindstrom
                     attends to in his reading of the poetic powers conjured by Audre Lorde and Percy Shelley.)</p>
               </div>
               <p>Taking complicity in the narrowly negative sense of “unwilled and dysphoric” participation,
                  Eccles suggests that the familiarity of the indictment in ideologically inflected
                  critique has had the paradoxical effect of desensitizing and numbing. We readily identify
                  complicity as we read, but do not ourselves feel complicit. This numbing or desensitization
                  to aesthetic experience in ideological critique is analogous to the trajectory Samalin
                  traces whereby unrepressed expressions of disgust at “things as they are” are transformatively
                  sanitized in the ostensibly affectively neutral observations of early sociology.</p>
               <p>But of course, complicity is more capacious than its narrowly negative definition
                  of feeling responsible for atrocities and injustice beyond our immediate control,
                  just as ethics involves more of our speech and behavior than any isolated moment of
                  choice. The conceptual and ethical valences of complicity are expansive—encompassing
                  the vast extent of our co-implication with one another. In <em>Caleb Williams</em>, Eccles understands the interdependence of the two central characters as a “collective
                  agency” that operates formally and structurally as an expression of our existential
                  entanglement with one another. A similar insight is at work in Amelia Worsley’s essay
                  on Coleridge and Southey, which reminds us that the abolitionist ballad, "The Sailor,
                  Who Had Served in the Slave Trade," (1799) makes explicit the political and ethical
                  commitments allegorized in the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (1798). Worsley understands
                  that the feeling of complicity arises from a disruption of safe distance (be it spatial,
                  temporal, or conceptual) between witness and perpetrator, and thus locates the complicity
                  of the reader rather than the guilt and penance of the protagonist at the heart of
                  both poems. Crowded with bystander figures, Southey's poem insistently draws the reader
                  into the ambit of the sailor’s psyche, forcing a “collective, identificatory feeling
                  of guilt” and a recognition of the urgency and immediacy of atrocities only allusively
                  present in Coleridge’s abstract narrative of incrimination.</p>
               <p>Ultimately the sense of responsibility entailed in the very idea of complicity appears
                  to be diffused into what Eccles describes as an “aesthetics of atmosphere” that encloses
                  characters and readers together in a miasma of culpability within which participant
                  and bystander are indistinguishable. Is this, as Eccles argues, a phenomenology of
                  collective politics, or is the (aesthetic) “experience of responsibility that can
                  neither be refused nor fully discharged” a despair-inflected version of the censorious
                  insights of ideological critique? This may be the most challenging question posed
                  by the arguments in this collection. After all, the <em>feeling</em> of complicity, understood as an anxious sensitivity to the unresolvable and the unforgiveable,
                  is surely salutary in its persistence—unlike the attenuation of unrestrained disgust
                  that Zachary Samalin gives us good reason to lament in his essay, 
                  “The Vomiting Mill.”
                  For Samalin, what late nineteenth century urban sociologists diagnosed as a deficiency
                  of feeling (the pathologically “indifferent,” “emotionless” and benumbed forms of
                  interaction in the modern metropolis) is etiologically linked to powerful feelings
                  of “aversion” and “repulsion.” Samalin's primal scene of modern disgust is Wordsworth’s
                  
                  “Residence in London”
                  from <em>The Prelude</em> (1805), a text that anticipates the strange condensation of “repulsion with alienation,
                  of excess feeling with pathological unfeeling” that he finds determining the character
                  of sociology as a discipline. Barely disguised or irrepressible disgust seems in Wordsworth's
                  recollections of London and in Friedrich Engels’s later descriptions of the “offensive
                  and repellent” conditions of industrial Manchester to be just the opposite of complicity—revulsion
                  being also a kind of revolt at things as they are. If “social theory” in Samalin’s
                  provocative formulation, is born from “the spirit of disgust," then the expurgation
                  of “feeling from method” called for by Emile Durkheim, Georg Simmel and other originators
                  of the social sciences necessarily entails a pacification of affective intensity as
                  a mode of description and also as resource for critique. Neutrality of tone portends
                  conceptual constraint, sets a limit on what a social scientific description aims to
                  achieve. And in that way, neutrality itself can be construed as another form of complicity.</p>
               <p>It is perhaps symptomatic of our moment that this inquiry into “public feeling” limns
                  the co-implication of aesthetic form, ethics and feeling by mapping bleak regions
                  of sensibility to injustice, suffering, the unforgivable, and the irremediable. Turned
                  inward, revulsion at things as they are risks turning into a sour mood of acquiescence,
                  every passing moment of passive non-resistance being felt, in a stomach-churning sort
                  of way, to be, in effect, a capitulation. For Eric Lindstrom this collective “mood
                  of helplessness,” the “paradox of passive agency,” is precisely what the late Romantic
                  Shelley contends with in the 
                  “Defense of Poetry”
                  (1821). Lindstrom offers a willfully forward-looking alignment of poetics and the
                  re-imagining of forms of community via a reading of Shelley’s “Defense” as a radical
                  theorization of the distinction between value and fact. In Samalin’s genealogy, the
                  aspiration to separate (social) fact from (subjective) value in sociology is traced
                  back to a moment when they were conjoined in inescapably pressing emotional response
                  to the “mean” and “vulgar shapes” of urban despair “forced upon my sight” (1805 <em>Prelude</em> Book 8: 804). That feeling—unwanted, unwilled, as undeniable and visceral as physical
                  pain—was itself a powerful index of value, of what <em>matters</em>. On Samalin’s account, alienated numbness is at once a diagnostic posture and the
                  lingering symptom of a revulsion that is at once involuntary and humane. On Eccles’s
                  and Worsley’s accounts, complicity evinces a helpless paralysis that would not be
                  felt at all were it not for the acutely present tension of stifled dissent. In this
                  context, as Lindstrom argues in his essay, a utopian document such as Shelley's 
                  “Defense of Poetry,”
                  with its bold avowal of the power of the counterfactual, can only conjure the possibility
                  of its "love-politics" by repressing and disowning "ugly" feelings of fear and anger.</p>
               <p>Shelley's idealism seems an extraordinarily unabashed effort to inhabit the Kantian
                  standpoint that is (in fact) “nowhere in heaven or earth" but in which we dwell "under
                  the idea of freedom." The lightning speed of the poet's conceptual movements from
                  aesthetics to ethics to politics betray a kind of desperate flight from the very feelings
                  of terror, disgust, rage, aversion and helplessness that are the needful indices of
                  the deplorable state of "things as they are." If Romanticists see something familiar
                  in Audre Lorde's insistence that "thought is inextricable from feeling and its expressive
                  formalization," Lindstrom asks us to understand that the "critical-creative" force
                  of this "philosophical poetics" cannot be assimilated to the poetry of those Lorde
                  identified as the “the white fathers [who write] . . . in order to cover their desperate
                  wish for imagination without insight” (
                  “Poetry is not a Luxury”
                  ). In Lorde, Lindstrom finds a near-contemporary articulation of the "love-politics"
                  that Romanticists recognize as Shelleyean, but in his essay’s accounting for the crucial
                  differences and discontinuities between the two poets, the "denied metaphysical reality"
                  of anger and fear emerges as necessarily constitutive of aesthetics as a utopian resource
                  rather than as a collection of dark affective intensities to be overcome or transcended.</p>
               <p>To recall my epigraph from Cavell, if "the concealment of what it is up to me to express
                  is a perfect expression of" what I wish to conceal, then there is no hiding of our
                  shames—but perhaps something will come from imagining how to be shame-faced with one
                  another, to avow complicities that clamor for articulation in words we cannot choose
                  but share.</p>
