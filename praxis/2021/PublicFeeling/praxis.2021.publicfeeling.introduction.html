            <p class="noCount">This “Introduction” offers a brief historical and theoretical background for the essay
               contributions that follow. It gives an editorial rationale for why we and these essays'
               authors aim to seek different ways of reading that merge or overlap questions of aesthetic
               form, social life, and affective disposition. We begin with the reminder that the
               imaginative precincts within which such questions might be raised were always and
               already inseparable for Romantic writers: in the Romantic poetics outlined here, feeling
               is not strictly private. We then provide summaries of the four essays and afterword,
               placing emphasis on the authors' various attention to sociable affects, including
               disgust, complicity, guilt, and hope.</p>

               <p>The quotations above from Wordsworth, Blake, and Barbauld offer three different takes
                  on the sharedness of feeling: the surprise of joy and of the disappointment that there
                  is no one with whom to share it; the presumed inevitability of sharing someone else’s
                  sorrow just from the sight of their tears; and the warning that belonging to a nation
                  means partaking of its guilt and pain. As distinct as these passages are, Wordsworth’s
                  question “Oh! with whom” could be asked in all three poems. The fellow-feeling that
                  Blake may seem to be describing as natural was neither inevitable nor guaranteed to
                  all persons, and as Steven Goldsmith has suggested, we might read the rhetorical questions
                  in 
                  “On Anothers Sorrow”
                  literally to reveal Blake’s despair about a hypocritical or calculated kind of sympathy
                  and sentimentalism (191). What is more, James Chandler’s account of the economic language
                  at work in Blake’s poetics of feeling suggests that “share” as a noun here recalls
                  an affective economy in which emotion is not only calculable but also complicit: “Pity
                  would be no more, / If we did not make somebody poor” (27). Barbauld’s lines too might,
                  at first glance, seem certain about who is sharing feeling, but in addressing the
                  British public, she imagines a dispersed, communal guilt and woe that belongs to everyone
                  and no one at once.</p>
               <p>In this special issue, we have assembled a collection of essays that take a closer
                  look at how collective feeling—or “feeling together,” as Nancy Yousef puts it in her
                  “Afterword”—takes poetic form in Romantic writing. How is a particular collective,
                  a “public,” congealed or construed through the stances and textures of imaginative
                  writing? And why should we specify that feeling is “public” at all, if (as we believe)
                  all feeling is relational? The individualization or privatization of feeling, like
                  the desire for its calculability, is a kind of open question for Romantic-era writers.
                  “Publics are queer creatures,” writes Michael Warner: “You cannot point to them, count
                  them, or look them in the eye. You also cannot easily avoid them. They have become
                  an almost natural feature of the social landscape, like pavement” (7). The apparently
                  simple fact of sharing feeling, then—with another person or with an entire nation—subjects
                  both the feeling and the feeler to a shaky dispersion; where does feeling end if it
                  is public? Turning to share feeling’s transport and finding the question “Oh! with
                  whom,” might capture, in one way, the questions of public feeling that the essays
                  in this collection seek to address. With whom is feeling shared, as it becomes evident
                  that it exceeds the individual? Perhaps we should ask, then, not how feelings become
                  public, but how feelings create publics, or how publics already vibrate with feeling.
                  What does it feel like to be (or not to be) attached to a country or community, to
                  have (or not to have) membership or citizenship, in ways that one can neither contain
                  nor control?</p>
               <p>This volume turns to Romanticism, as a historical and a literary formation, to consider
                  how public feelings operate and circulate through the language of poetry. How does
                  poetry mediate the politics and sociality of feeling? How can poetry register not
                  just the solitary, recollected overflow of powerful feeling, but also a communal,
                  complicit, or contagious one? Along with our contributors, we would like to pose the
                  question here: how are feelings implicated in and around poetry—and how does poetry
                  interfere in, perpetuate, or rearticulate feelings circulated in zones of sociality
                  loosely denoted as public? Intervening variously in poetics, affect theory, and critical
                  social theory, the contributors to this volume examine literary scenes in order to
                  assert that feeling is part of a structured world—in other words, that public feeling
                  is what builds and unravels the conflicted experience of collective life.</p>
               <p>We have gathered this selection of essays in order to bring together in new configurations
                  the study of poetics, affect, and politics for the field of Romanticism. In response
                  to Lauren Berlant’s suggestion that “public spheres are affect worlds at least as
                  much as they are effects of rationality and rationalization” (450), the contributors
                  collectively pursue the question of how poetry and poetic form might provide a different
                  kind of understanding of the formation of publics and counter-publics that compete
                  for historical visibility. In a critical tradition that has already—as Mary Favret
                  has shown—increasingly revealed “the intractably social and material bases for romantic
                  esthetics and the poets’ deep awareness of this dependency” (
                  “Study of Affect and Romanticism,”
                  1163), we aim here to pursue more explicitly questions of social and political urgency
                  that emerge in an unfolding historical present. Just like any other domain of culture,
                  Romantic poetry is rife or riven with feeling. But how might we recognize its feelings
                  as tuned in to the political or the communal, or as public?</p>
               <p>In focusing on “public feeling,” we take a cue from the recent work in affect theory
                  by Ann Cvetkovitch and Lauren Berlant (members of the Public Feelings project from
                  the early 2000s on), as well as that of Jennifer Nash, Sara Ahmed, Sianne Ngai, and
                  Eve Sedgwick. These scholars draw on feminist and queer studies to articulate the
                  intricacies and histories of social and political feeling and the ways in which feeling
                  might produce new forms of sociality. Indeed, as Nash has written, pointing to, among
                  others, the work of poets June Jordan and Audre Lorde (the latter of whom Eric Lindstrom’s
                  essay in this volume takes up), “the labor of constructing political communities around
                  ‘public feelings’ and ‘communal affect’ has been a black feminist investment for decades”
                  (20). But “public feeling” could describe sensibilities plainly active in the Romantic
                  era, as well. In investigating what she describes as the “unfinished business of sentimentality,”
                  Berlant reminds us that the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were crucial moments
                  for understanding the origins of the modern interlacing of politics and feeling. Writing
                  about contemporary political feeling, Cvetkovich links her account of depression as
                  a public feeling to Romantic-era debates about slavery and abolition, reminding us
                  that we must understand sentimental, abolitionist modes of representation, in order
                  to understand “contemporary human rights discourses that still traffic in the generation
                  of affect through representations that aim to touch their audiences” (9). In his recent
                  discussion of affect, “mood,” and the Black romantic subject, Bakary Diaby argues
                  that historicity itself is “a Romantic mood that still sets the terms by which we
                  discuss racial subjection in the present” (121). Romanticism, it seems, describes
                  the beginning of an affective political moment in which we are still immersed.</p>
               <p>The phrase “public feeling” also recalls the preoccupation in eighteenth-century British
                  moral philosophy with describing and prescribing the fellow-ness of feeling. The vast
                  and excellent scholarship in the last thirty or so years on the history of sympathy
                  and sensibility by—among others—James Chandler, Julie Ellison, Lynn Festa, Steven
                  Goldsmith, Thomas Pfau, Adela Pinch, Amit Rai, and Nancy Yousef, has demonstrated
                  how deep the interest in, and anxiety about, fellow-feeling ran. What bothered David
                  Hume and Adam Smith, Pfau explains, was that “something as ostensibly private and
                  inward as a feeling should be imbued with so much social energy” (4). In other words,
                  sympathy acts, as Pinch puts it, as a reminder that “one’s feelings may really be
                  someone else’s” (7). In Ellison’s view, the literature of sensibility “exposes a complicated
                  awareness of the human costs of national and imperial economies, as well as the knowledge
                  that sensibility itself is a privilege. Sensibility is the <em>admitted</em> connection between speculation, mood, and power” (7). Festa also situates discussions
                  of sympathy and sentimentality in the context of empire, arguing that “by governing
                  the circulation of feeling among subjects and objects, sentimentality helps to define
                  who will be acknowledged as human” (3). More recently, Yousef has taught us to “soften
                  the hard opposing edges of solitary inwardness and interpersonal exposure” and suspend
                  the ethical and epistemic questions that so often arise about sympathy by shifting
                  terms to “intimacy” (4). In her afterword to this collection, Yousef also suggests
                  a rearrangement of terms, replacing “public feeling” with an expansive sense of “complicity”
                  that exceeds its more typical connotations of guilt and responsibility.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>If historians have argued that a new kind of national identity and sympathy took hold
                     during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England, what feelings did
                     that newly imagined community elicit, rely upon, and silence?

                     </div> What were the feelings that surrounded, propelled, and resisted the development of
                     industrialization, colonialism, war, and slavery? These are questions that were asked
                     directly and urgently at the time. Barbauld, for example, in her anonymous anti-war
                     pamphlet from 1793, <em>Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation,</em> asks “how far as individuals are we really answerable for the guilt of national sins?”
                     (<em>Selected Poetry and Prose</em>, 315). As the essays in this volume by Anastasia Eccles and Amelia Worsley both emphasize,
                     the thinking in the 1790s and early years of the nineteenth century about government,
                     power, violence, and citizenship led to a growing awareness and self-consciousness
                     about widespread complicity. The literatures of sentiment, Ellison writes, serve “as
                     indices of the pain caused by political arrangements from which artists and intellectuals
                     knowingly benefited but at the same time could not control” (7). The idea of communal
                     feeling was perhaps described most commonly at the time through the word “general”;
                     it is Barbauld again who wrote that “the whole time of war ought to be a time of <em>general mourning</em>, a mourning in the heart, a mourning much more sincere than on the death of one of
                     those princes whose cursed ambition is often the sole cause of war” (<em>Civic Sermons</em> 19). Anticipating Percy Shelley’s diagnoses of the politics of mourning, Barbauld’s
                     demand for general mourning and Shelley’s calls for “universal grief” at “national
                     calamity” (379) both work reactively, pushing back against the emotional demands of
                     the state, demands that are often “curiously announced from outside and on high” (Favret, <em>The General Fast</em> 130).</p>
               </div>
               <p>We are certainly accustomed to thinking of poetry as both representing and producing
                  powerful feeling, but we have perhaps given less attention to how a poetics might
                  produce or reveal important political feelings in the reader. This is familiar territory
                  in the study of abolitionist literature, carefully calculated to elicit the reader’s
                  delicate sympathies. But as Worsley’s essay reminds us, the gap between Romanticism
                  and abolitionist literature has in some ways been wider than it needs to be, part
                  of a broader aesthetic vilification of “public poetry.” We think there is still more
                  work to be done on how poetic figure and form alter our conception of the feelings
                  that both compose and decompose the individual in its historical forms. How does imaginative
                  literature study the feelings that mark both our alienation from others and our attachments?
                  How does poetry register not individual emotion but emergent political formations
                  of indifference or care, such as the urban repulsion tracked here by Samalin between
                  Wordsworth’s poetry and the sociology that emerged across the nineteenth century?
                  How might narratives of this kind prompt a different engagement between Romantic poetics
                  and contemporary expressions of social inextricability, such as that described by
                  Nash in her recent account of “black feminist love-politics” (14)?</p>

                  <p>Although it is not a term of art used by the contributors themselves, the rubric of
                     “reading practices” offers a ground for thinking together the affective, epistemological,
                     and sociological valences that animate these essays. For instance, the idea of a feeling
                     of readerly “complicity” that both Eccles and Worsley develop becomes, in their respective
                     essays, an occasion for theorizing the relation between the narrative theme of guilt
                     and the affective experience of standing idly by, both modeled for, and produced in,
                     the reader. Eccles identifies the trope of apostrophe in Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794) as a stylistic means for focusing on the power of highly localized, emotionally-fraught
                     linguistic events in forming a public. Worsley examines how Southey’s use of the ballad
                     form subtly confronts the reader with the interaction among personae that spring into
                     life through the iterative structure of the ballad, forcing readers to feel their
                     desire to be an observer to suffering.

                     recast as ethically-charged stances. Poetry is considered not simply as a collection
                     of historically shifting genre forms, but more emphatically—in the poetics of knowledge
                     that emerge across genres—as a set of imaginative protocols for understanding how
                     publics take shape through intimate social and psychic relations.

               <p>One crucial requisite for our interest in “public feeling,” then, following Berlant’s
                  observation about public spheres as affect worlds, is that we take the term poetry
                  to mean something quite expansive, something like the aesthetic flexibility of form
                  in a given corner of communicative or emotional life. Zachary Samalin’s essay adopts
                  a genealogical method, assembling poetic and sociological scenes from Wordsworth to
                  Weber, that allows him to trace the affective disposition of disgust or revulsion
                  in city life across new formalizations of social theory in the nineteenth century.
                  Representations of the urban crowd, argues Samalin, increasingly teach analysts of
                  nineteenth-century social form to understand the fact of bodily proximity and the
                  welter of unwelcome sensory stimuli through the “unwanted feeling” of disgust. This
                  disgust is then quietly converted, in mid-century texts by Engels and Mayhew, into
                  the more abstracted feeling of alienation. By the end of the nineteenth century, when
                  Durkheim set out to fix the outlines of the study of society on scientific principles,
                  it is utterly forgotten that a sublimated feeling of disgust is the basis for neutral
                  observation of other humans, now fully alienated from the analyst: hence Durkheim’s
                  disavowal of the relevance of feeling anything at all while analyzing society. In
                  Samalin’s vivid account, we can see how Wordsworth’s visceral response to the sights,
                  sounds, and smells of the city in Book 7 of the <em>Prelude</em> (1850)—the “funhouse mayhem” of Bartholomew Fair—prefigures an entire way of thinking
                  about urban disaffection, in preparation for its eventual codification as the prerequisite
                  for a science of society. But it is not until we know that observational neutrality
                  is fashioned from intense repulsion that we can recognize this as a kind of paradox.
                  By reading the “poetics” of sociology, Samalin demonstrates that affective norms take
                  shape historically, and more specifically, that social imaginaries have what he calls
                  an “emotional grammar.”</p>
               <p>Following Samalin’s genealogical sweep, we turn to the pair of essays already described,
                  each of which pursues closer-textured literary readings with broad implications for
                  the study of reading practices and Romantic genres. While Anastasia Eccles tackles
                  a narrative politics embedded in the novel’s care for how the reader might read herself
                  into (and out of) the novelistic scene, Amelia Worsley addresses a similarly choreographed
                  situation in narrative poetry that guides the identificatory options available through
                  its mediated form and structure of address. Interestingly, as noted above, both essays
                  hinge on the invitation to a readerly sense of complicity. Eccles’s 
                  “Feeling Complicit in William Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em>”
                  does this while carrying out a striking re-evaluation of this canonical work, using
                  an affectively attuned formalism. Keeping in mind Godwin’s philosophical accounts
                  of agency and causation, Eccles finds in the novel’s plot an attention to “complicity,”
                  or an unwilled, precarious state of “interdependence” that, Eccles argues alongside
                  Godwin, should constitute mutual responsibility in any given social formation. Building
                  her readings of Godwin’s fiction (and its reception) through perceptive recourse to
                  his political theory, Eccles makes the compelling suggestion that fiction—even while
                  offering, in this case, a page-turning Gothic detective novel—can serve as an almost
                  didactic technology for inducing an awareness of shared damage everywhere enacted,
                  but rarely acknowledged, in the ordinary practices of everyday life. Eccles brings
                  to light several specific devices the novel uses to angle in on the many ways of relating
                  to one’s own practice of reading (e.g., the novelistic use of apostrophe). Like Samalin’s
                  “unwanted feeling,” the felt complicity both dramatized in, and passed along by, <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794) is partly defined as social in the sense of “atmospheric,” or unwilled. Yet
                  its inevitability can equally be, as Eccles points out in closing, a necessary, perhaps
                  even invigorating reminder of “the ways we always read as, against, and through one
                  another.”</p>
               <p>As in Samalin’s account of a network of affective relations submerged in a poetics
                  of sociology, Eccles makes her case by suggesting that it is the poetics latent in
                  Godwin’s prose—those “forms of lyric address that confuse guilty characters and eavesdropping
                  readers”—that gives the novel’s expressions both their local ambiguity and their potential
                  durability in the public feeling of complicity. From sociology and narrative, we proceed
                  in Worsley’s and Lindstrom’s essays to several modes more familiar to scholars of
                  Romantic poetry: the ballad, the abolitionist poem, and the “defense” of poetry. In
                  
                  “Abolitionist Publics,”
                  Worsley looks at readerly complicity in the context of the preeminently public genre
                  of the abolitionist poem, which she suggests has been too often derogated in aesthetic
                  terms, precisely on the basis of its aspirations to sway the public on a live question
                  in political debate. Using one example of abolitionist poetry’s “shadow canon” as
                  a case study, Robert Southey’s 1799 ballad 
                  “The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade,”
                  Worsley shows how—in ugly tension with the poem’s “abhorrent” thematic transferal
                  of suffering from Black bodies to white consciences—the poem’s form seeks to create
                  an abolitionist public. Long read as a minor work—a failed attempt to translate the
                  archaic mariner of Coleridge’s 1798 
                  “Rime,”
                  as a notoriously nebulous allegory of guilt, into a present-day sailor and explicit
                  participant in Britain’s slavery economy—Southey’s ballad becomes, for Worsley, a
                  place to examine the formation and perception of ethical norms regarding the politics
                  of enslaved labor. Reading a precise choreography of voices in the poem—both as it
                  repurposes the ballad as “medium,” and as it diagrams guilt between confessor, captain,
                  minister, and reader—Worsley reveals an unexpected complexity in the structures of
                  liberal sympathy, disidentification, and misrecognition experienced by the reader
                  in traversing the poem’s staged “space of collective consciousness.” Refusing merely
                  to dramatize the remorse of a sailor coerced into murder and confirm the sentimental
                  reader’s innocence, the poem instead rewrites sympathy and individual guilt as a pervasive
                  and banalized chain of complicity: the reader can neither “sympathize with” nor “condemn”
                  the poem’s actors without mimicking the sailor’s desire for self-exculpation. Thus,
                  even as it explicitly aims to broadcast abolitionism with a pious call to prayer,
                  Worsley unearths how the poem also indicates that the slave trade is a “communal violence”
                  that belongs as well to the counterpublic it calls into being.</p>
               <p>Shifting theoretical gears, Lindstrom’s essay builds around the climactic claims of
                  two very different and yet, in this account, profoundly cognate essays: Audre Lorde’s
                  
                  “Poetry is Not a Luxury”
                  (1984) and Percy Shelley’s 
                  “A Defence of Poetry”
                  (1821). In both, poetry becomes the stuff of everyday life and initiates the possibility
                  of (a new) society, turning a claim for the ordinariness of aesthetic experience into
                  “a fundamental argument about the necessity of poetry.” This “necessity” is expressed
                  famously by Shelley as a kind of “unacknowledged” legislation, and arrestingly by
                  Lorde as “the skeleton architecture of our lives.” Lindstrom teases out the contrast
                  between Lorde and Shelley in a series of readings that draws directly on the affect
                  theories of Lauren Berlant, Kathleen Stewart, and others. In pursuing unforeseen convergences
                  between Lorde and Shelley, arguably one of the “white fathers” alluded to in her essay
                  
                  “Poetry is Not a Luxury,”
                  his essay creatively locates a “lateral agency” in Shelley’s thought, which highlights
                  not the negative effects of Shelley’s “dispersive poetics” but rather a “collective
                  experiential promise.” This allows us to glimpse how, read with Lorde, something quite
                  different emerges from Shelley’s thought. Lindstrom contrasts Shelley’s lightning-like
                  visions with what Lorde calls that “quality of light” that characterizes the collective
                  she has in mind, now emphatically situated and embodied: “<em>For women</em>, then, poetry is not a luxury” (37); indeed, Lorde’s poet is aligned with “the black
                  mothers in each of us,” an “us” meant to disable the universalization of experience.
                  Lindstrom’s essay thus proposes that there is much to learn when Lorde is read “into
                  and with” Shelley: for Lorde’s conception of poetry as “the distillation of experience”
                  (39) builds its shared, ordinary feelings from something like Shelley’s inchoate futurity,
                  only now in a manner attuned to the practical, embodied necessities of emotional life,
                  where affective relations like anger, fear, or love are imagined through a “felt and
                  embedded, not mirroring, relationship.”</p>
               <p>Lastly, Nancy Yousef’s “Afterword” concludes the series by offering a new lens for
                  looking at the issue’s themes, while situating these themes and their treatment as
                  pregnantly “symptomatic of our moment.” Articulating an unstated premise of what the
                  contributors hold in common, Yousef opens by suggesting a “redundancy” in the phrase
                  “public feeling,” insofar as feeling takes place in expression as an ongoing “call
                  upon us” (in the words of Stanley Cavell). The notion of private feeling is then revealed
                  as a subset of the social: that is, what we think of as private feeling is a learned
                  etiquette of tacit legibility, or of open concealment, that we have chances to notice
                  or let be. Taking up several lines from Godwin, which Eccles examines in her essay
                  on readerly complicity, Yousef pursues and expands the idea of shared feeling across
                  all four essays, now as a “more capacious” complicity, one that will “require new
                  ways of speaking about agency” if it wants to redefine “public” so as to span “the
                  vast extent of our co-implication with one another.” As Yousef has it, the essays
                  together seek out the gradations of reception and response in the formation of expressive
                  publics—fine lines to which romantic writing regularly returns us, in the many and
                  various versions of what Anne-Lise François has memorably called “recessive action”
                  (1). In pointing to the contributors’ collective understanding of close reading as
                  a practice of shared life, Yousef argues that it is through the essays’ “renewed commitment”
                  to reading that complicity earns the expansive redefinition it receives here.</p>
               <p>Such complicity would take many forms, not all negative. In being “<em>Surprised</em> by joy,” Wordsworth’s narrator has in a sense already “shared” the feeling which
                  comes over him. In her powerful overview of the issue, Yousef reminds us that the
                  essays in this collection “all address the imbrication of aesthetic form and emotions,”
                  in order to find “points of ethical inflection.” While differing significantly in
                  their methods, each contributor addresses the formal dimension of feeling that structures
                  aesthetic production, at least implicitly imagining the intimate circumstances required
                  for social identification and recognition. Their shared point of departure might be
                  said to match what Judith Butler calls our impressionability, a way of imagining subject
                  formation taking place through unwilled publics, through ethical call and expressive
                  response: more than a kind of conduct, the ethical becomes “a way of understanding
                  the relational framework within which sense, action, and speech become possible” (12).
                  To return to Cavell, and to Yousef’s insightful joining of the notion of “public feeling”
                  with the supposed problem of private language, we might say that the work we gather
                  here seeks not merely to insist on revealing that what seems private is really public,
                  as though that were the point, but also to redefine “public” as the collective task
                  of putting something together, of composition: “It is little help in this work . .
                  . to take reassurance from the supposed fact…that language <em>is</em> public, that it is shared. This prompts us to avoid seeking sociably to provide help
                  and example sufficient to <em>make</em> it public, to see it shared” (185). Perhaps it is poetry, in the ordinary sense—Lorde’s
                  “quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives” (36)—that makes feeling together
                  possible.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">We would like to thank the terrific collective of participants in a double-seminar
               panel on “Poetry and Public Feelings” held at the 2018 American Comparative Literature
               Association conference at UCLA: the wide-ranging and experimental thoughts shared
               there, on poetry, politics, and the passions, inspired us to put this special issue
               together. We are particularly grateful to this issue’s essay contributors (each of
               whom presented papers at that seminar), whose patience and generosity of thought helped
               to shape the issue and our rationale for it. We thank Nancy Yousef for joining us,
               and for her guidance and humor throughout the editing process. Our special thanks
               too to the general editors of Romantic Circles Praxis Series. Tristram would like
               to recognize Samantha Botz (PhD, Northwestern) as a valued interlocutor on ideas about
               collective feeling in the Romantic century. Finally, we want to recognize here the
               recent loss of Lauren Berlant: without their work this project would be unimaginable.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
