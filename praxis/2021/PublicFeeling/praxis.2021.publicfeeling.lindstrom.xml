<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">In prose both similar to and crucially different from the Romantic celebration of
                    human wholeness, throughout the
                    collection <title level="m">Sister
                        Outsider</title> (1984) the
                    Black lesbian feminist poet Audre Lorde pursues an “impulse toward wholeness” to
                    repair the divide between feeling and knowledge.
                    For Lorde’s poetry is an
                    urgent resource and practice of imaginative experience rescued from oppression, not
                    defined by its formal features, which she calls “sterile word play.” This conviction
                    aligns Lorde’s poetics with Percy
                    Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of
                        Poetry</title> (1821). This
                    essay considers Shelley not only "juxtapolitically" with Lorde, but in a common
                    imaginary space of networks of feeling and imagery with contemporary theorists of
                    public feeling including Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart, to establish a
                    critical idiom for the world of public feeling and world-making. I show how
                    the “harsh light of
                    scrutiny” valued by Lorde resonates with Shelley’s critical reassessment of the
                    poetic imagination set in opposition to calculative enlightenment reason. Yet I also
                    argue that Lorde’s “quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives” helps us to
                    make the difficult, necessary intervention into Shelley’s unresolved problematic —
                    both theoretical and lived — concerning the relation of love to fear.</p>

<p>Throughout her essay and speech collection, <title level="m">Sister Outsider</title>
                (1984), Audre Lorde, Black lesbian feminist poet, pursues–both by style and
                argument–an “impulse toward wholeness” to repair the divide between feeling and
                knowledge (8).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Unless noted, all page references to Lorde’s writing are from <title level="m">Sister Outsider</title>.</note> In doing so,
                Lorde’s poetic theory seeks new forms of understanding that “begin [ . . . ] to make
                knowledge available for use” (109). Lorde’s “use” in essays, such as <title level="a">Uses of the
                Erotic,</title> is deeply experiential (53–9): at once intimately personal, as well as
                communal and collective. Lorde’s measures of usefulness are “human need” and “the
                psychic and emotional components of that need” (55). Her sense of the necessary is
                not reducible to utilitarian calculus, as the turn toward erotic life as a resource
                might already suggest. In its fundamental orientation to value, her theoretical work
                scrutinizes and promotes human flourishing in all its possible forms, starting from
                her own situated being: opposing a Black queer woman’s life, in particular, to
                surplus and its logic of extraction. Kevin Quashie can thus write in <title level="m">Black Aliveness</title> of Lorde’s “belief that a queer black
                mother’s body can thus be enough to conceptualize what it is to know” (11). Lorde
                thereby articulates a profoundly anti-capitalist mode of being, production, and
                critical self-examination.</p>
<p>As she made clear in a 1979 interview with Adrienne Rich, Lorde self-identified as a
                writer who thinks in poems (83). This means that in her poems thought is
                inextricable from feeling and its expressive formalization. Sensuous and intuitive
                experience matter to her powers of ideation. We can begin to map Lorde’s
                philosophical poetics using this critical creative habitus. But Lorde also means
                more simply, if opaquely, that in her youth she thought only in poems. In the long
                period of her creative life before she began teaching and writing prose in the
                1970s, she felt poetry was her sole means of effective communication. Not just her
                poetry, but also her remarkably rich and direct prose, read as if they were
                recurrently composed in the first moment of breaking free of a silence.</p>
<p>In what follows I want to suggest a surprising convergence between Lorde and Percy
                Bysshe Shelley. Lorde’s conviction that poetry is an urgent resource and practice of
                imaginative experience rescued from the oppressions of silence—and a shared
                philosophy that defines poetry not by its formal features, which she calls “sterile
                word play”—resembles the argument Shelley makes in <title level="m">A Defence of
                    Poetry</title> (1821). In particular, there is a resonance between Lorde’s poetics
                and Shelley’s view of the relation of knowledge to poetic imagination. Both Shelley
                and Lorde associate a rejection of the capitalist division of labor with a critique
                of the operations of managerial reason, from a vantage that celebrates affect,
                creation, and feeling.</p>
<p>Shelley writes: “We want the creative faculty to imagine that which we know; we want
                the generous impulse to act that which imagine; we want the poetry of life: our
                calculations have outrun conception; we have eaten more than we can digest”
                    (530).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Quotations from Percy Shelley are taken from Reiman and Fraistat’s
                            Norton (second edition) of <title level="m">Shelley’s Selected Poetry
                                and Prose</title>. I cite this volume as <emph>SPP</emph>
                            only where context may not be evident.</note> We can see the
                affinity between Lorde and Shelley in this passage, which announces an
                anti-utilitarian call for poetry’s vital use in making knowledge imaginable and
                drawing it into the realm of available action. If Shelley speaks from a place of
                authority and privilege, marked also by his exile, Lorde responds to the Romantic
                poet’s identification of real “want” with creative capacities and writerly impulses
                that share in focused abundance the resources of sensibility. Yet if I find in
                Lorde’s arguments and language something that reminds me of Shelley, shutting my
                eyes to hear something like their recombinant voice, I also know it is impossible to
                over emphasize how much Lorde situates her knowledge within the living practice of
                her own specific identities. These “Shelleyan” sentences lose their meaning and
                power if we isolate them from Lorde’s self-definitions as a feminist, Black, queer,
                and mothering author and her assertions of how much these identities have been deep
                resources for her poetic work.</p>
<p>Lorde’s affinity with Shelley also constitutes an act of transformative change upon
                the Romantic tradition of “high level” theorizing performed especially by male poets
                and philosophers. Difference, in the essays of <title level="m">Sister
                    Outsider</title>, is construed as “a dynamic human force” and “a creative force
                toward change” (45, 70). Indeed, difference provides the ground of the
                unacknowledged power that echoes back perhaps most undeniably from Lorde to Shelley
                (53). This is not a structural paradox, nor just an irony that follows from the
                exclusionary whiteness of “radical” authors in the Romantic canon, but a major event
                at the living border of the invaginated growth and unfolding of the non-linear,
                achronological history that most Romanticists would associate with a Shelleyan
                notion of poetry. No chapter in the linear history of ideas, this history is written
                and made legible in the flashes where Lorde and Shelley make anti-separatist allies;
                and in which Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> depends upon the meanings of
                <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury,</title> as much as the other way around. My largest and
                longest-unfolding aim in this essay will therefore not only be to show how both
                poets understand expressive necessity in their championing of poetry; but more
                crucially, I want to voice a shift from poetic continuity to poetic difference (and
                ultimately gesture at the possibility of a commons-in-difference), arguing that
                Lorde’s corrective to Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> is a necessary
                imaginative act. Despite its constitutional commitment to openness, Shelley’s role
                of the legislator poet risks being either exclusionary or falsely universal in its
                assumed, not situated, identity. An encounter with Lorde’s writing makes possible
                what speech-act theorists call “felicity conditions,” in which the essential
                contribution of Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title>, its poetics of radical
                futurity for which a context does not yet exist outside the capacity of creative
                acts, can be more fully examined and actually lived in the emergent present.</p>
<p>Why isn’t Lorde’s poetic theory more often and energetically taken up in critical
                interchange with Shelley—at least by Romanticists interested in contemporary poetry
                and poetics? It might be tempting, for example, to read Lorde’s 1977 essay, <title level="a">Poetry
                is Not a Luxury,</title> as a vital expansion of Shelley’s voice and position in <title level="m">A Defence</title> into feminist and non-European lived
                    experiences.<note place="foot" resp="author">Benjamin Mangrum points back to the fact that the
                            essay’s original title was “Poems are Not Luxuries,” and that it was
                            written in Lorde’s first year of editorship of the feminist quarterly
                            journal <title level="j">Chrysalis</title> (337). Mangrum’s work is one
                            source of my emphasis on administered culture.</note> “For
                women,” Lorde writes, “poetry is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity of our
                existence” (37). Lorde’s gendered conditions of creative experience simultaneously
                offer a frame around the moment that inspires my urge to make a connection but also
                a strong critique of that urge, attesting to the ultimate arbiters of specificity
                and difference. Race, sexuality, and gender mark the terms of that difference,
                though gendered codes also have been invoked to code Shelley’s own reception as a
                poet who refuses divisions of thought and feeling, content and manner. Shaped by the
                dismissals of modern writers like Eliot and Auden, do we still view Shelley as a
                male narcissist and, despite his ideals, as anti-Womanist and a danger to women?
                Shelley himself was often charged by mid-century male critics with a blurring of
                feeling and thought that is recognizably gendered. He was judged, for instance,
                “incapable of effective reasoning and the intellectual control of his emotional
                outpourings” (Harding 210). Lorde, I’ll concede from the start, would have viewed
                all the male English Romantic poets as numbering among the “white fathers” who wish
                “to cover a desperate wish for imagination without insight,” to suppress rather than
                liberate the deep resources of discredited feeling, as her poem <title level="a">Coal</title> imagines the
                embodied diamonds of earth, not the diamonds of translucent white light.</p>
<p>Lorde’s writings compel a long-delayed confrontation with the normative subject’s own
                “desperate wish” to exercise the imagination (and know its prestige) without risking
                any real illumination in poetry. If Lorde crucially reaffirms Shelley’s case for the
                vital necessity of poetry beyond the frameworks of economic calculus and rhetorical
                or aesthetic ornament, that fundamental alliance, and the challenge of an
                anti-separatist praxis it requires and promotes, can offer Romantic Studies a tool
                to engage more critically and creatively with Shelley’s damaging failures of
                imagination. We do not need to decide which of Lorde’s Black, feminist, and queer
                positionalities are most needed as critical expansions of Shelley’s writing. Lorde’s
                emphases on defining her own terms for vital work, and in searching for modes of
                survival that constitute both a philosophy and a praxis, impart a necessary
                corrective to even the most fruitful of Shelley’s contingent or constitutive
                failures.</p>
<p>Having introduced Lorde here and provided the core rationale for my purpose to read
                her writings with Shelley’s, the first section of this essay returns to <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> in the context of the recent
                collaborative theorizing of public feelings by Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart,
                to establish a critical idiom for the world of public feeling and the world-making
                practices of Romantic poetics. The essay then argues that Lorde’s critique of the
                poetic tradition offers an insight Shelley shared but tried desperately to cover.
                Lorde’s examination of the very light by which we think, write, and love
                participates in the critical reassessment of poetic imagination set in opposition to
                calculative managerial reason. By the essay’s close I show how Lorde’s “quality of
                light by which we scrutinize our lives” helps us to intervene in Shelley’s
                unresolved problematic—both theoretical and lived—concerning the relation of love to
                the ugly major feelings of anger and fear. Shelley feared (his own) anger and
                treated it as a force to disavow not work through. Lorde shows us how to properly
                situate Shelley’s repressed negative feelings and how to make such unaddressed
                negative feelings a poetic and political resource. Lorde’s writing actualizes the
                more livable conditions of a just, transformative community of poetic creation and
                exchange, that is only inchoate in Shelley’s defense of poetry.</p>

<head>PBS and Public Feelings</head>
<p>Lorde begins <title level="a">The Uses of the Erotic</title> with an urgently compelling sentence that makes
                no display of its allusion to Shelley’s most famous pronouncement at the end of the
                    <title level="m">Defence</title>: “There are many kinds of power, used and unused,
                acknowledged or otherwise” (53). The personal tone of acknowledgement here is
                reflective, not declarative and constitution-making. But Lorde’s mixing of these
                spheres of experience and voice, wrought by a feminist poet and thinker in the
                decades that gave the truth that the personal is the political, makes the point that
                many kinds of insight can be publicly transformative. Lorde’s scrutiny of what
                poetry means illuminates and shapes a heretofore “private” experience that is the
                basis of potential collective action: a poetry of life that is not an adjunct to
                living but of vital necessity. Brought forward into a future it welcomes but cannot
                anticipate or enclose, Shelley’s outsized conclusion in <title level="m">A Defence
                    of Poetry</title> that “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the World”
                enjoins difficult thinking about feeling and examining public feeling (535). Raymond
                Williams, originator of the influential concept of “structures of feeling,” locates
                in Shelley’s statement “the felt helplessness of a generation” at “the very moment
                when [poets] were being forced into practical exile” by the literary print culture
                of the novel and the economic structures of industrial capitalism (<title level="m">Culture</title>, 47).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Williams’s concept of “structures of feeling,”
                            see <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, 48–71.</note>
                Williams’s decisive page on Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> contains the judgment that “in the
                continuous pressure of living, the free play of genius found it increasingly
                difficult to consort with the free play of the market, and the difficulty was not
                solved, but cushioned, by idealization” (ibid.). Typically treated as aspirational
                hyperbole, Shelley’s famous sentence carries a counterfactual rhetoric by way of
                declarative grammar.<note place="foot" resp="author"> McLane writes on Shelley’s “counterfactual
                            imagination” in <title level="m">My Poets</title>, 226.</note>
                For Williams, this means “a description…, which, on the theory, ought only to be a
                fact to be accepted” but instead carries a collectively subjective and subjunctive
                mood of helplessness (ibid.).</p>
<p>As the rhetorical figure for a Romantic-era structure of feeling that with global
                capitalism and neoliberalism has only become more entrenched, Shelley’s exaggerated
                statement of poetic agency conveys and performs the mood of a collective
                helplessness, enacting the paradox of passive agency, and further implying that such
                an illegible mode of agency can be ubiquitously world-informing.<note place="foot" resp="author">For passive
                            agency, see Ngai, 1.</note> Its poetic legislative powers are
                claimed to motivate the history of human consciousness found beneath or encountered
                laterally beside the mainstream account of historical action. In this regard,
                Shelley’s poetic deconstruction of the idea of liberal individual “consent” and his
                unfolding of a project of plural being anticipates and opens up to Fred Moten’s
                project in <title level="m">Black and Blur</title>, the first volume in the <title level="s">consent not to be a single being</title> trilogy. Moten’s work
                musically churns in the collective yet fragmented poetics of all that comes by way
                of <emph>con-sent</emph>—a move which fractures and glides, marks
                crossings with violence (the middle passage), but also is stationed in the mood of
                receptive passivity (“The truth for poets wants them to be available” [Glissant,
                45]).</p>
<p>Yet those legislative powers are eloquently expressive, most of all, of what Sianne
                Ngai positions as states of inaction (22). Where exactly should we locate the pivot
                of the effectuating/ helpless turn of counterfactual mood? Are poets a) everywhere
                the unacknowledged but effective agents behind larger values and institutions? Or do
                poets b) legislate, but not for the nation-state, rather, for the individual or for
                world spirit? The truth predicated is based not on a logical or arguably even
                historical analysis of linguistic agency, but upon an attitude the sentence models
                as an unacknowledged public feeling, or what Ngai calls an aesthetic emotion (5).
                This attitude shapes response to another difficult implied question: c) If poets are
                not the acknowledged legislators of public policy and governance, how can poetry
                effect change in a world at all that deserves the name in the cosmopolitan sense
                Shelley elsewhere endorses, a world held in common, one that is intelligible and
                    public?<note place="foot" resp="author">As
                            Wolfson notes, the corresponding passage in <title level="m">A
                                Philosophical View of Reform</title> (1819–20) states that “Poets and
                            philosophers are the unacknowledged legislators of the world” (341). In
                            this sense <title level="m">A Philosophical View of Reform</title> does
                            not merely anticipate and “repeat” in advance the more famous conclusion
                            of <title level="m">A Defence</title> but may seek to stabilize concepts
                            beyond the flux of aesthetic emotion.</note> Disentangling the
                meaning of Shelley’s deceptively simple statement requires that we at once
                critically suspend, and poetically amplify, the universal import of each of the
                sentence’s key words: poet, legislator, and world.</p>
<p>Recent scholarship in affect theory and the writings of the loose collective of
                thinkers participating in the “Public feelings project” may help us to engage
                further with this critical dilemma of how a world may be held in common, without
                reverting to an enlightenment universalism that over-clarifies these issues of
                agency, intelligibility, and publicity (Berlant, viii). “Writing throws the world
                together,” Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart maintain in their recent work of
                “noetic collaboration,” <title level="m">The Hundreds</title> (11, 8). The
                “thrown-together” world of Berlant and Stewart’s writing both fails to add up and
                exceeds the alternately grandiose and annihilative worldview of the individual
                Romantic author if we continue to view the latter as a figure who must either
                creatively legislate his imaginative world, or struggle in a wake of fragments to
                compose a catastrophe. Mingling the legacy of Shelleyan Romanticism with twentieth-
                and twenty-first century inflections of public feeling(s), this essay asks how it
                might be that the unpredictably collaborative, suspensive “world” of such a “Public
                feelings project” is answerable to and answered by Shelley’s conception of the
                world-making activity of poets. Can the minimally conditioned notion of unforeclosed
                experience, found in the writings of the “Public feelings” group, sustain the
                imaginative horizon of a dynamic and common world envisioned by Romantic poetry?
                Never quite organized or formalized, there is at least one kind of answer in terms
                of shared mental imagery: the prose poetry of contemporary “life in suspension”
                links in its circuitry, its charged and sagging zones, and in its varieties of the
                genre Berlant calls the impasse, to Shelley’s own charged dispersive poetics
                (Berlant and Stewart, 8).</p>
<p>The tradition of thinkers who radically apply David Hume’s critique of induction
                provides a background for my proposed reading. In <title level="m">A Defence of
                    Poetry</title> and elsewhere, Shelley follows the Humean skeptical critique of
                those unilateral constructions of agency and causality that are temporally as well
                as logically linear. This Romantic skeptical mobilization of Hume’s empirical
                argument holds that one cannot reason back up the line from an effect to its cause
                to posit the seat of some prior metaphysical origin. Causational force in itself has
                no ontological priority to the relational event in which it manifests. The
                creatively skeptical move Shelley develops from Hume thereby dissolves the hard idea
                of causality into what one might call the associative field poetics of constant
                conjunction and by analogy the domain of the socially “juxtapolitical” (Berlant
                    20).<note place="foot" resp="author">

                happiness and perfection of man” (518).<note place="foot" resp="author">For more passages that reflect Shelley’s

                            manner, beyond and above consciousness; and it is reserved for future
                            generations to contemplate and measure the mighty cause and effect in
                            all the strength and splendour of their union”; page 534 (“Poetry, as
                            has been said, in this respect differs from logic, that it is not
                            subject to the control of the active powers of the mind, and that its
                            birth and recurrence has no necessary connexion with consciousness or
                            will. It is presumptuous to determine that these are the necessary
                            conditions of mental causation, when mental effects are experienced
                            insusceptible of being referred to them.” But rather than simply
                            annulling causation, Shelley also delineates effects that are mutual
                            determinations, particularly upon poets and poetry: “Poets, not
                            otherwise than philosophers, painters, sculptors, and musicians, are in
                            one sense the creators and in one sense the creations of their age. From
                            this subjection the loftiest do not escape” (208).</note> It
                is hard to tell where theory of knowledge ends and where aesthetic theory and moral
                philosophy begin in such a passage, which includes the “civil habits of action” that
                prepare the ground for the final sentence’s reach toward “legislation”: “Language,
                colour, form, and religious and civil habits of action are all the instruments and
                materials of poetry; they may be called poetry by that figure of speech which
                considers the effect as a synonym of the cause” (513). Shelley deploys Humean
                skepticism toward causation but realizes that its mitigated tenor in Hume is little
                more than a sociable choice. He freely diverts skepticism into the metaleptic
                commingling of “effects” and “instruments.”</p>
<p>With this critique of cause in mind, no wonder if Shelley, more than other poets, is
                judged ineffectual. In its role as a poetics treatise, <title level="m">A Defence
                    of Poetry</title> defines a poem as “the very image of life” in opposition to
                story, precisely by way of the dependence of the latter on cause and effect (515).
                Shelley reads the definitional reliance of storytelling on causation itself as a
                form of narrative poetics. He does so, however, not to establish a grounding
                philosophical relationship, but as evidence that “a story is a catalogue of detached
                facts, which have no other bond of connexion than time, place, circumstance, cause
                and effect” (515). It is a wonderfully dissatisfied mood that can find
                disappointment in the small worldview wherein there is “no other” form of
                relationship than the Kantian categories: time, space, and cause! Shelley boldly
                rejects a normatively fixed version of cause and effect in order to create openings
                that promote other “bond[s] of connexion.” As Shelley says of “the promotors of
                utility,” actually rather attractively (as an author might to acknowledge a good
                partner or dean), “[t]hey make space, and give time” (529). His metaleptic critique
                of cause-and-effect thereby expands Hume’s tastefully mitigated skepticism,
                extending its reach beyond epistemology to other areas including ethics, love, and
                historical poetics.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Kuiken for a fuller account of metalepsis as a

                            metaleptic deconstruction of causality and temporality thus is
                            inherently open to queer affiliations he did not anticipate. For a

<p>But in doing so, Shelley persists in his own version of what Lorde will call “the
                passing dreams of choice,” the privilege to harness this appropriately creative
                skepticism only to curative love, denying the reality (for himself and for others)
                of fearful confrontations. Humean skepticism thus requires modes of livable, poetic
                rewriting for the human subject whose own survival cannot be taken for granted.
                (Though as Kara Keeling writes in reply to Lorde’s concept of survival as “enduring
                    <emph>as such</emph>”: “None of us survive as such; indeed, perhaps,
                freedom requires we give way to other things” [ix].) I draw Lorde’s powerful
                critical and poetic insight into a jagged arc with what is already a creatively
                critical swerve in Shelley’s Romantic revision of the Enlightenment. Lorde’s poem <title level="a">A
                Litany for Survival</title> unforgettably marks this relay, beginning with Hume’s classic
                locus of the problem of skepticism, in terms of the historical experience of that
                problem for Black bodies: “And when the sun rises we are afraid / it might not
                remain / when the sun sets we are afraid / it might not rise in the morning.”</p>
<p>In light of the issue of causality in particular, the distinction between poetry and
                story closely resembles and shares elemental components with the distinction between
                affect and emotion. It is precisely on narrative and causal grounds that the protean
                realm of affect differs from the more fixed, organized, and symbolically
                pre-interpreted domain of emotion (Ngai 24–7).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Ngai, drawing from Brian Massumi,
                            affect is feeling or intensity disconnected from meaningful sequencing —
                            from narration.</note> The tradeoff comes in intellectual
                capital: as opposed to Ngai’s “ugly” affectively-laden feelings of irritation and
                envy, the classical emotional terms of anger, jealousy, the sublime, and even
                anxiety enjoy greater and more clearly activated and analyzed levels of intellectual
                prestige (9, 35). Shelley’s presentation of <emph>poets</emph> as the
                unacknowledged legislators implicitly worries the issue of the availability of this
                prestige to lyric as opposed to narrative modes. Though the strong analogy I’ve just
                presented holds between Shelley’s contrast (on the grounds of causality, as its
                foremost aspect) of lyric and narrative poetics and the contrast between affect and
                emotion, Shelley nonetheless departs in advance from recent cultural theory of
                affect in terms of the range of feelings his work privileges, or even allows.
                Shelley in his moral and political thought is particularly insistent on affirming
                the heroic and major emotions over ugly minor feelings. The preface to <title level="m">The Revolt of Islam</title> outright rejects the politics of ugly
                feelings: “There is no quarter given to Revenge, or Envy, or prejudice. Love is
                celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world” (qtd. by
                McLane, 217–8). Similarly, the preface to <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                rejects Milton’s Satan as a result of this heroic character’s motivation by
                ambition, envy, and revenge (207).</p>
<p>In the “stretched present” of a constellated social poetics, Shelleyan creation and
                public feelings theory share an important mobilizing insight about the imaginative
                sensing of contemporaneity (Berlant, 5). The <title level="m">Defence</title>’s
                prophetic mantle must not obscure its value as a tool to help make emergent life
                livable. Despite its idealistic pitch, the <title level="m">Defence</title> affords
                many responsive forms of historical and social attunement. Berlant lays hold of this
                Shelleyan sympathetic insight in saying “the present is perceived, first,
                affectively” (4). She drops the vatic idiom. But is not Berlant claiming, like
                Shelley, that poets are hierophants of futurity? (And again, not even just narrowly
                poets: Berlant cites Marx that “the senses have become theoreticians” [31].)
                Presentness is first perceived poetically, that is to say; so long as we follow in
                the Shelleyan tradition of defining poetry as socially sympathetic formative
                making—not in rigid terms of traditional form and genre. In Shelley’s well-known
                binary of “mental action” between the faculties of reason and imagination, the first
                insight of the imagination is the perception of value (510).</p>
<p>Both Berlant and Stewart recurrently deploy Shelleyan imagery of electric charge,
                circuitry, and (especially in Berlant’s case) electrical infrastructure in their
                work on routes and energies of public feelings. Rather than using it as an
                idealistic symbol, electricity for these thinkers figures intersubjective and
                (occasionally) collective modes of thought that are invisible conceptually as low
                affects and wide infrastructures. Electrical (dis)charge is of course an
                unmistakable Romantic and Shelleyan image. The preface to Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> contrasts the “spirit” to the “forms” of
                the age by calling the spirit an “uncommunicated lightning” (207). In the same
                preface, he credits the influence of Milton to his republican age and sees that age
                of English revolution as a source of stocked energy for the ideals of outflowing
                energy in Romanticism. Shelley heralds: “The cloud of mind is discharging its
                collected lightning” (208). Writers in the public feelings group often use
                electrical grid imagery, crackling with potential energies but unyoked from
                sovereign—or any clear—agency as many of our public structures crumble. “The
                ordinary lives only in the moment of its surge” (Stewart 56). The Shelleyan “Spirit
                of the Age” in <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> anticipates and shares
                this field of charged, subjective but not individual, potentialities in its
                well-known image of the collective genius of the age as a gathering discharge of
                lightning. The uncontainable, unlocalized character of this figure and its agency
                offers indeed one handy symbolic means to distinguish the worldview of Romantic
                artists from the philosophes of European Enlightenment. Rejecting the “gross vice or
                weakness” in which tenuous historical values of heroic conduct, as he finds in
                Addison’s <title level="m">Cato</title>, robe poetic forms, Shelley writes: “To such
                purposes Poetry cannot be made subservient. Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever
                unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would contain it” (520).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    “For the sword outwears its sheath,” laments Lord Byron in his 1817 lyric “So, we’ll go no more a roving.” Phallic as it is, the atmosphere of potentiality and latency in Shelley’s image of lightning should be contrasted to the much more grandiose anti-heroic image in Byron 
                    of lightning as a figure of potency and mortal fatigue. This image fixated Shelley and needed a counter.</note>
</p>
<p>New modes of imagination are required to make this feudal and phallic image resonate.
                The invisible and dispersively charged associative circuit of an electrical
                atmosphere culminates in the figure of the lightning flash that may do work, but at
                the same time empties and neutralizes the more expansive site of the common field
                (the latter being perhaps a more interesting and potentially generative locus,
                present for example in the figure of Asia in <title level="m">Prometheus
                    Unbound</title>). Public feelings thinkers align with Lorde’s conception of “the
                erotic’s electrical charge” when they refuse the consolidating patriarchal image
                (59). On one hand, Berlant’s work can be understood as a series of projects that
                reflect upon and construct the social-material infrastructures for this moving,
                charged atmosphere and its forms of lateral agency in contemporary “unraveled life”
                (Berlant 21).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            For Berlant’s most explicit consideration of infrastructure to date, see
                            “The Commons: Infrastructures for Troubling Times.” I am especially
                            drawn to this essay’s project of “managing being in proximity in the
                            awkward and violent ordinary” (395).</note> On the other hand,
                Stewart and Berlant alike explore the latent, sagging, volatile, and live, yet
                not-insistently-actualized media, of electrical conduct. Theirs is a world without
                enlightening (and insistently phallic) flashes, in which the realization of public
                feeling “might feel like anything, including nothing” (Berlant 2). A world in which
                not privileged subjects but “rogue intensities roam the streets of the ordinary”
                (Stewart, 44). Unhoused and ungrounded, affective intensities haunt even the most
                domestic interlunations of ordinary life.</p>
<p>Romantic criticism has noted and celebrated Shelley’s dispersive poetics as part of a
                radically negative aesthetic, one not recoverable by instrumental politics.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Forceful
                            examples of this radically negative reading of Shelley, post-Paul de
                            Man, include Pyle (esp. 29–65) and Faflak.</note> Here I see
                Shelley’s annihilation of traditional agency not as an erasure of the voice that
                might speak toward public feeling, but in line with Berlant’s and Stewart’s
                suspended, unraveled, yet charged potential to foster something happening (or not)
                in the realm of the intimate collective. As opposed to the complex but
                philosophically clear grammar of the first two questions I have discussed—the
                question of the efficacy of action and the question of the scale of its duration,
                management, and governance—the last question asked poses a challenge to the very
                ideas of a nucleated individual agency and a publicity that might fix in place a
                world in common.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ross calls this the “cellular regime of
                            nationality” (11–38).</note> On this third question I turn back
                and forward to Lorde.</p>
<p>There is yet further room and provocation to think of Lorde’s essays on poetry,
                public life, erotics, and teaching as major contributors to the living thought of
                Romanticism and post-Romanticism. Lorde writes in <title level="a">Coal</title> that “There are many kinds
                of open.” The rest of this essay is devoted to exploring a mode of openness
                unwelcome to Shelley, though not to a collective and intimate Romantic project
                moving from and beyond him. For the main instance of a textual provocation that arcs
                beyond chronological Romanticism, I take Shelley’s valuable insight in the
                <title level="m">Defence</title> and in his short essay <title level="a">On Love</title>
                that the outgoing structure of love and hope “beyond ourselves” also comprehends
                fear. I see this double insight and its necessary edge of vulnerability as an
                understanding that by himself Shelley is unable to effectively use. This aversion
                exposes him rightly to the harsh light of critique by Lorde: “But giving in to the
                fear of feeling and working to capacity is a luxury only the unintentional can
                afford” (Lorde 54). It takes subsequent trajectories of poetic experience and
                expression, which I find in the thought of Lorde, to address this need for courage
                of insight and bring it to bear on “the image of life” and its creative and critical
                practice (<title level="m">SPP</title> 515).<note place="foot" resp="author"> In Shelley’s <title level="m">The Witch
                                of Atlas</title>, another seriocomic poem of 1820, the mischievous and
                            undesiring Witch kneads together a “sexless” hermaphrodite from “liquid
                            love,” in order to help power her journeys in the boat refitted from the
                            unwanted car of Venus, “too feeble to be fraught” with all of Venus’ sex
                            in the back seat (376–7). This “living Image” of the career of Love
                            indicates playfully just the extent to which Shelley in all seriousness
                            needed to bring ordinary, lived, sexuality into his mythopoetic vision.</note> Understanding “luxury” not as hedonism nor as a fetishistic
                object-oriented surplus enjoyment, but as the inhibiting burden of carrying
                defensive illusions that do not supply any actual protection or substance for life—a
                privilege enjoyed only by those able to “afford” habitual inattention to need—Lorde
                thereby makes essential the forms of joyous creation, but also modes of fearful
                scrutiny. This effort represents a necessary new direction for the thought of poetry
                as the criticism of life, but not under the fixed conditions the nineteenth century
                so often imagined without insight. Something is yet worth recovering from the wreck
                of this patriarchal Arnoldian conception because it attests beyond its false
                universalism to the sensibility of human needs.</p>

<head>Poetry is Not a Luxury</head>
<p>Lorde’s and Shelley’s writings are particularly generative to think with and teach
                together because they share a fundamental argument about the necessity of poetry.
                Lorde and Shelley develop two of the strongest, fiercest, and most flexible
                articulations of the purpose and life of poetry without even a minimum of technical
                scaffolding—that is, without supportive reference to the traditional techniques of
                verse. Both resolutely refuse to take their bearings from the technical aspects of
                poetry as language enclosed in pattern. Their defenses of poetry are instead
                grounded in human capacities. And despite the individual notes of apology and
                negation in their titles, as makers of global arguments, Lorde and Shelley both also
                assume boldly non-defensive attitudes. Thinking primarily through the body, <title level="a">Poetry
                Is Not a Luxury,</title> redefines the essential transformative thesis of Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> concerning ideation, that poetry is not a
                recombinative exercise, or an adjunct to sense, but a necessity at the center and
                circumference of life at peril of social death. Thus, in Kara Keeling’s richly
                generative response to Lorde’s essay (an account which also references capitalism’s
                reproduction of fear in the body), for Lorde “poetry is a way of thinking the
                space/time of politics for those deemed disposable or socially dead” (xi). Though
                she never refers to Shelley and does not need his example—or seemingly the creative
                precedent of any other male canonical poets, alien if not hostile to her own
                situated body—nonetheless in my view, Lorde both supports and critically supplements
                Shelley’s resistance to the definition of poetry as a formal object. She does so in
                the name of lived specificity, as the means to envision human flourishing under a
                larger horizon of solidarity. Lorde rejects the reduction of poetry to verse as what
                she calls a “distillation of experience . . . to . . . sterile word play” (37). She
                feared that poetry and poets themselves had become the “promotors of utility” that
                Shelley despises. Equally, she despised the view of poetry as a civilized game, as
                in even the most flexible rendition we might give to R.P. Blackmur’s definition of
                poetry as “a game we play with reality” (1).<note place="foot" resp="author"> “[T]he game by history and training, the
                            play by instinct and need,” continues Blackmur’s achieved formulation
                            (1).</note>
</p>
<p>Yet in the articulation of her own situated and specific dimension of a vitally
                Shelleyan poetics in the broadest sense, Lorde also formulates what is perhaps the
                deepest problem in this tradition and relates it in sharp terms, by assigning the
                institution of poetry to “the white fathers [who write] . . . in order to cover
                their desperate wish for imagination without insight” (37). Beyond even the
                irrefutable “white fathers” aspect of her critique, how much poetic production—how
                much literary theory and criticism—is rightly subject to this second accusation of
                whitewashing; that is, of the writer’s wish to court imagination without the work
                and the pain of delivering insight? “Insight,” in this reading, is not a quantum of
                new knowledge, or a projective vision, but a harsh and rich encounter with an
                ancient-emergent knowledge one must unearth and face. Romantic writings must remain
                uncomfortably open to Lorde’s statement in order to grapple with the kind of
                revelatory experience that comes only from painful self-examination. One of the
                aspects of Shelley’s privilege is his ability not to recognize the fundamental
                realities of suffering and pain—alike as a personal and as a political
                experience.</p>
<p>Maureen McLane expresses this differently when she preserves and reverses, in and
                with Shelley, the slogan of 1970s activist feminism: “For with Shelley <emph>the political is personal</emph>” (215). Rather than the courageous
                breakthrough of a feminist praxis, this inversion of the feminist motto for Shelley
                sounds brittle to me and suggests the potential elision of self-knowledge. As the
                title of her essay-address bears out, Lorde’s way of saying that language is vitally
                metaphorical, that the creation of poetry is the conduct and “very image of life,”
                and, furthermore, that life-making is a world-making practice, is to say that
                <title level="a">Poetry is not a Luxury.</title> If poetry is now typically thought to be a luxury good or
                a productively “useless” activity, in her essay Lorde mobilizes a compelling and
                atypical concept of luxury. In typical definitions “luxury” comprises an object that
                is desirable but inessential, marked by a differential symbolic prestige as well as
                being expensive and difficult to obtain. Lord deploys an alternative sense of
                “luxury” based on a lived concept of economies of spirit. It is important to note
                that the essay was written at a time when Lorde was awaiting a potentially terminal
                medical diagnosis for her first appearance of cancer. This personal reference bears
                on her characterization of waiting upon a time of fearlessness as the “final luxury”
                she could not afford. Lorde did not have the luxury of a conception of empty,
                extended time to expend on delays due to fear.</p>
<p>Lorde also presents a fundamental critique of the metaphysical idea of a separate
                time of enjoyment, the idea that luxury must come after and be thereby distinguished
                from necessity or even use value in temporal terms. I read this aspect of her work
                through Kristen Ross’s recent study,
                    <title level="m">Communal Luxury </title>[<title level="m">
<foreign xml:lang="fr">L’Imaginaire de la Commune</foreign>
</title>], which makes available and recharges for
                public use the idea of a far-flung tradition of luxurious working in common. The
                argument of <hi rend="italic">Communal Luxury</hi> builds from the eponymous French
                communard manifesto regarding “transforming aesthetic coordinates” in the reliance
                of political and social transformation upon public art: “We will work cooperatively
                toward our regeneration, the birth of communal luxury, future splendors and the
                Universal Republic. –Federation of Artists Manifesto, April 1871” (Ross 39, 58). For
                Ross, appending the word “communal” to “luxury” changes the meaning of the latter
                term. After the model of the 1871 Communards, Ross breaks down the duality between
                necessity and luxury. Both Lorde and Ross insist that what is needed is to uncover
                previously submerged forms of living, in Ross’s words to maintain a vital
                prolongation, a “life beyond life” (6). Lorde and Ross both, too, are making an
                argument against the further misapplication of assigning inverted values from this
                binary: the wrongful designation of necessary things as luxury goods.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “Senseless
                            luxury, which [William] Morris knew cannot exist without slavery of some
                            kind, would be replaced by communal luxury, or equality in abundance”
                            (Ross, 63.)</note>
</p>
<p>Within her “project of making art lived—not superfluous or trivial, but vital and
                indispensable to the community,” Ross promotes the term luxury (59). Indeed, <title level="m">Communal Luxury</title> maintains that it is the Malthusian calculus
                of modern capitalism itself that generates the model of economic scarcity through
                which the system is perpetuated (72, 127). In the urgency of Lorde’s project,
                necessity comes to the front. For her all luxury is what Ross calls “senseless
                luxury,” the privilege to suffer the illusion to be careless of need (63). Shelley,
                Lorde, and Ross align in their individual conceptualizations of the roles of value
                and imagination in relation to productive reason—to material and even to mental
                production. We don’t need more knowledge. For Lorde specifically, “there are no new
                ideas still waiting in the wings to save us as women” (38). All three writers are
                committed to a different form of the analysis: “We want the creative capacity to
                imagine that which we know; we want the generous impulse to act that which imagine;
                we want the poetry of life: our calculations have outrun conception; we have eaten
                more than we can digest” (530). Lorde, indeed, often construes the important new
                information to be gained by poetic creation and scrutiny as outside the domain of
                thought altogether. Rather, poetic practice makes deep and even pre-verbal
                knowledges available for living.</p>
<p>In “The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action,” Lorde shares an
                idiosyncratic tactical definition of fear and fearlessness as the “final luxury.”
                She writes: “For we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own needs for
                language and definition, and while we wait in silence for that final luxury of
                fearlessness, the weight of the silence will choke us” (44). Or again, in <title level="a">Uses of
                the Erotic</title>: “But giving in to the fear of feeling and working to capacity is a
                luxury only the unintentional can afford, and the unintentional are those who do not
                wish to guide their own destinies” (54). In a passage from <title level="a">The Transformation of
                Silence,</title> Lorde says that “[w]e can learn to work and speak when we are afraid in
                the same way we have learned to work and speak when we are tired” (44). The
                necessity of poetry and the sense of communal luxury that one finds so strikingly in
                Lorde and Ross and the livable habit of working and speaking “when we are
                afraid,”—seeking “our own needs for language and definition” by moving through, not
                halting in, fear—contrast to the final luxuries of fear and scarcity (of biological
                life, time, and socially necessary goods) that are senseless. These cannot be
                afforded.</p>
<p>The introduction to <title level="m">Sister Outsider</title> presents Lorde’s writing
                as a contribution to “an impulse toward wholeness.” (Bereano 8). Such a presentation
                anticipates Lorde’s sentence from “The Transformation of Silence”: “Tell them about
                how you’re never really a whole person if you remain silent” (42). This deep impulse
                to realize wholeness comes from the expression of resistance to an experience of
                alternately fragmented, managed, and administered life known so well by earlier
                Romantic writers. Lorde transmutes the two fundamental enlightenment figures of
                light and critical examination in <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury</title> and other essays. Like
                Shelley’s atmospheres of light in the <title level="m">Defence</title>, in the opening
                paragraph on the fundamentally poetic act of valuation, she writes of “[t]he quality
                of light by which we scrutinize our lives”; this light we create and bring with us
                “has direct bearing upon the product which we live, and upon the changes which we
                hope to bring about through those lives” (36). “And there is, for me, no difference
                between writing a good poem and moving into sunlight against the body of a woman I
                love” (58). Giving a rich form of self-evidence to a haptic and erotic body of
                anti-enlightenment knowledge and helping to develop what Ferguson calls an eros of
                the critical imagination (297), Lorde’s writings perform an unanticipated but
                necessary inner transformation of Shelley’s critique of Enlightenment stockpiling of
                knowledge in the <title level="m">Defence</title>, in which Lorde pursues “the felt
                above the ideational, affect above theory” (Mangrum 338). </p>
<p>This poetics develops fully in what remains the merely potentially human space of the
                contrasts Shelley implies in the <title level="m">Defence</title>, between “practice,”
                “distribution,” and “poetry” on the one hand, and “wisdom,” “knowledge,” and
                “systems of thought” on the other:
            <quote>We have more moral, political, and historical wisdom than we know how to reduce into
                practice; we have more scientific and economical knowledge than can be accommodated
                to the just distribution of the produce which it multiplies. The poetry in these
                systems of thought, is concealed by the accumulation of facts and calculating
                processes. There is no want of knowledge respecting what is wisest and best in
                morals, government, and political oeconomy, or at least, what is wiser and better
                than what men now practice and endure. (530)</quote>
            Of a piece with the felt conviction and persuasiveness with which she writes, Lorde
                views the activity of thinking itself suspiciously. She even fears it.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Prompted by her own past remarks, Lorde said the following in response to Adrienne Rich’s question about how thinking was for Lorde “a mysterious process that other people did and that you had to sort of practice? That it wasn’t something you just did”: <quote>“‘It was a very mysterious process for me.
                                And it was one I had come to suspect because I had seen so many
                                errors committed in its name, and I had come not to respect it. On
                                the other hand, I was also afraid of it because there we inescapable
                                conclusions or convictions I had come to about my own life, my own
                                feelings, that defied thought. And I wasn’t going to let them go.’”
                                (87)</quote>
</note> Is fear an activist impulse? Or anger? In
                the passages I’ve cited above, drawing from multiple essays, Lorde does not allow
                her relation to fear to metastasize or describe regions of experience she will not
                open. Her language around fear is proportionate to the discussion of loving and
                nearly as rich. She analyzes the experience of living actively with fear as a part
                of a non-utilitarian practice of “feeling and working to capacity” in practical,
                ethical, and poetic forms of life. </p>
<p>Against the differentials of a “quality of light” which Lorde brings to scrutiny,
                stands the Enlightenment of Shelley’s account, with its concealed, congealed
                accumulations of knowledge burying poetry within systems. The gradual buildup of
                anger that differently embodied subjects may feel in being forced to enlighten those
                in privilege suggests the need for a politics of solidarity in fatigue, as much as a
                relational affirmation of love-politics.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Nash.</note> In order to
                step into the erotics of light, the handling of anger in Lorde’s writings offers a
                profoundly necessary continuation and corrective for the disabling fear of anger, a
                relation to fear and anger shown throughout the career of Percy Shelley. Lorde’s
                range of affective and political investments in poetry point the way to a more
                productive relation to the emotions, thoughts, and insights we fear, using the very
                condition of the body as a means to go forward, asking courageously “Does it feel
                right to me?” As Lorde says caringly of her son in <title level="a">Man Child</title>: “I do not exist to
                do his feeling for him” (74). However, in Shelley’s distribution of
                feeling-in-thought, fear and anger are both philosophically and personally deprived
                working through. Denied metaphysical reality in Shelley’s utopian politics, anger
                and fear are thereby relegated to status of the demonic. Barbara Johnson captures
                this with cutting briskness as a primary fact of Shelley’s existence: “He was a
                vegetarian, but was trained as a skilled huntsman and harbored murderous feelings”
                (83). Similarly, James Chandler remarks that Shelley’s aristocratic identity by
                birth was the basis for a lifelong attitude of “self-renunciation” (344).</p>
<p>Disavowal is among Shelley’s deepest-rooted impulses. Politically this makes sense,
                while it seems to me at the same time to limit and distort Shelley’s relationship to
                the self-querying of the rightness of some of his uglier feelings. Shelley claims in
                the fragmentary essay <title level="a">On Love,</title> an essay only published at Mary Shelley’s
                discretion in <title level="m">The Keepsake</title> of 1829, that:
            <quote> “[Love] is that powerful attraction towards all that we conceive of fear or hope
                beyond ourselves when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient
                void and seek to awaken in all things that are community with what we experience
                within ourselves. If we reason we would be understood; if we imagine we would that
                the airy children of our brain were born anew within another’s, if we feel, we would
                that another’s nerves should vibrate to our own, that the beams of their eyes should
                kindle at once and mix and melt into our own, that lips of motionless ice should not
                reply to lips quivering and burning with the heart’s best blood. This is Love. This
                is the bond and sanction which connects not only man with man, but with every thing
                which exists.” (504–5)</quote>
            In <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>, there is no fear in the parallel
                version of the statement: “The great secret of morals is Love; or a going out of our
                own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in
                thought, action, or person, not our own” (517). The “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty”
                ends by enjoining the “SPIRIT fair” to “fear himself, and love all human kind” (96).
                These lines are often given the unwarranted, restrictive parsing of fear as
                self-respect. But they are based on a want of self-trust and inward examination in
                traversing “the chasm of an insufficient void.”</p>
<p>Colin Jager has written discerningly on Shelley’s philosophical poetics and the
                “adventures of human flourishing,” in a reading that elaborates the stakes and risks
                to the meaning of the poet’s atheism as an occupation (240). As part of this
                commentary, Jager observes, Act IV of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                operates “on the far side of fear” (243). But this boundary marking of a
                dispensation after fear only makes the discontinuous handling—an Ariel-like vaulting
                over to the farther shore, not a culture of working through—that much clearer to
                view. The elisions of fear practiced by Shelley, and at times by his commentators,
                leave the dark and legitimate sources of their emotional power and need unaddressed.
                If Shelley at such moments is disabled by his own aversion to the processing of
                anger and fear, the repression is directed toward a fear, foremost, of his own
                responsive capacity for anger, and therefore instances a repression of
                susceptibilities and responsibilities that are inseparable from language and feeling
                as such. </p>
<p>Here Lorde can offer a strong and necessary comparative contrast in which we do not
                require sympathetically outgoing desires to be valued alone by the false innocence
                bought with disavowal, and thus we can risk the achievement of both integrity and
                experience. In her poem, <title level="a">Between Ourselves,</title> Lorde models the ossified psychic form
                of hatred so as to give opportunity to life outside the containment of the
                interlocking structure of a nested, negative conformity of self and other:
            <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>if we do not stop killing</l>
<l>the other</l>
<l>in ourselves</l>
<l>the self that we hate</l>
<l>in others</l>
<l>soon we shall all lie</l>
<l>in the same direction (qtd. in Nitus 87)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
            This poetics of a public feeling communicated “between ourselves” bears with great
                insight on Shelley’s desire, in <title level="a">On Love,</title> go decisively “beyond ourselves” by
                awakening a sort of community-in-harmonics with experience “within ourselves.” But
                Lorde’s love-politics does not seek the mirroring symmetry of that “same direction.”
                Rendered anew in the analogy with <title level="a">Between Ourselves,</title> Shelley’s geometry of a
                responsive sympathy looks instead like the orientation of bodies in the hold of a
                ship, or a cemetery full of headstones all levelled one way after a storm. To read
                Lorde’s <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury</title> back into and with Shelley, is to return to a felt
                and embedded, not mirroring, relationship of the public feeling of love, “going out”
                of the self, and to the working through of experiences of fear that cannot be
                expelled from “our own needs for language and definition,” an examination of the
                full value carried by imagination. It is also, as in the brief reading of <title level="a">Coal</title> at
                the start of this essay, to examine and develop capacities that seem too occluded to
                bring to light; to go deeper into the densities of relation, in an inversion of the
                way Keats urged Shelley to mine concertedly for the sake of the extraction of beauty
                for poetry.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I
                            allude to Keats’s letter to Shelley of August 16, 1820.</note>
                This would be a more luminous, but also a more textured and even opaque, light: a
                necessary energy force sought and expended for the sake of enlarging our scrutiny of
                a poetry of life that might not only be shared at the level of ideas but felt,
                tested, and trusted in bodies.</p>
