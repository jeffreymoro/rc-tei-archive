                    The varied explorations of "public feeling" in this volume all attend to the
                    affective convergence of helplessness and guilt, injury and incrimination. This
                    afterword tracks the mood of complicity through the collection, with the aim of
                    elucidating how the co-implication of emotions and ethics brought to the fore in
                    each of the essays seems also to require new ways of speaking about agency—even
                    while reckoning with individual and collective powerlessness.

               <epigraph>
                  <quote>It is true of a great deal of what goes on in me that normally if it is to be known I must tell it, or give expression to it. But for nothing in me is this absolutely true. Whatever in me I have to conceal I may betray exactly by the way in which I conceal it. Just that is what is concealed; the concealment of what it is up to me to express is a perfect expression of it—the slight edge to my denials, the
                    over-casualness of my manner . . . There are those who know how to read such
                    concealments. —Stanley Cavell, <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>
                  </quote>
               </epigraph>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>Let me begin by suggesting that the phrase “public
                    feeling” might involve redundancy in the same way that “public language,” and
                    “private feeling” might be as much an impossibility as “private language.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Indeed, the
                            question of private language in Wittgenstein’s <title level="m">Philosophical Investigations</title> (especially par. 243–315) is
                            inseparable from questions about the privacy of sensation and the
                            communicability of feeling.</note>
                I do not mean that we do not often, for good reason,
                    wonder about “what is going on in his head,” or worry that “she’s keeping it all
                    bottled up inside,” or mutter about “never understanding what they want.” Such
                    utterances are themselves articulations of feeling—frustration, apprehension,
                    bewilderment—issued in response to words and deeds that may well include
                    unmistakably apparent suppressions of feeling such as the concealments Stanley
                    Cavell describes in my epigraph. To assume an existential rift or metaphysical
                    divide between what is hidden (“private feeling”) and what is expressed (“public
                    feeling”) is to deny (perhaps inadvertently) how well we ordinarily read one
                    another. Even resolute withholding, cold indifference, and blank impassivity are
                    recognizably expressive. The depth and extent of our feeling together entails no
                    singular or important “feat of cognition,” as Cavell reminds us, but is an
                    incumbent “call upon us,” an ongoing task that is shared even if rarely mutual
                    (435).
            </p>
                  <p>The editors of this volume ask how poetry “interferes in,
                    perpetuates, or rearticulates feelings circulated in zones of sociality loosely
                    denoted as public,” and in so doing they begin with the kind of acknowledgment
                    Cavell urges. To recognize that emotions pass between us as expressions and
                    outcries (and also as the felt silencing of expressions and outcries) is also to
                    acknowledge that there is no other “zone” in which they circulate: the
                    “publicness” of feeling is coeval with its forms of expression.</p>
                  <p>The contributions gathered here expand the region of the public in a way that invites us to consider that even the precincts of privacy are shaped by sociality. The first essay stakes itself on the grounds of just such a paradox. Anastasia Eccles begins with the juxtaposition of two apparently contradictory assertions from Godwin’s <title level="m">Political Justice</title>: the first stating as a given the necessary
                    interdependence of all persons (“no man… can stand alone”); the second asserting
                    the prospect of independence: “We ought to be able to do without one
                    another.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Eccles, “Feeling Complicit in William Godwin’s
                                <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>.” The quotations from the
                            <title level="m">Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</title> come
                            from the Appendix <title level="a">Of Cooperation, Cohabitation, and Marriage</title> in the
                            revised third edition (London: G.G. and J. Robinson, 1798), Volume II,
                            499 and 505.</note>
                The phrasing of the latter formulation is curious.
                    Prescriptive and wistful at once, it draws attention to the interrelation
                    between the tone or mood of an utterance and the conceptual possibilities it
                    allows and forecloses. “We ought to be able to do without one another” sounds
                    rather more like “we ought to be in Rome” (the reverie of a busy afternoon when
                    the prospect of such an escape is impracticable) than “we ought to pay down this
                    debt” (an imperative that might or might not be possible). If the “ought”
                    commands the impossible, and thereby intimates a wish, then the sentiment itself
                    seems in disagreement with the grammatical subject of the sentence: the
                    inclusive second person plural. Godwin’s “we” joins us together in conceding the
                    fleeting, occasional desire for an independence that is impossible precisely
                    because we know that “no man stands alone.” I am suggesting that “We ought to be
                    able” in this phrase is akin to “I (sometimes) wish I could,” but that Godwin’s
                    syntax lays stress on the collective and shared fantasy of doing “without one
                    another.” Let’s say that Godwin counts on, and elicits, our complicity in this
                    “ought” that is really a wish.
            </p>
                  <p> “No man stands alone” is best understood as a “sociological” fact and a “third
                person” epistemic claim rather than a “first person” testimony. We are all, each one
                of us, existentially interdependent, shaped by and vulnerable to political and
                economic conditions, historical encumbrances, material constraints, and so forth.
                Kant would classify such considerations as matters for “practical anthropology.” By
                contrast, an assertion (or is it rather an exclamation?) such as “We ought to be
                able to do without one another” expresses a determination, a discovery (or is it a
                longing?) freed from all empirical considerations. Godwin’s oddly phrased
                counterfactual wish corresponds to the imaginable, unreal, and unrealizable autonomy
                that is the stubbornly held aspiration of Kant's metaphysics of morals——the
                “precarious position” philosophy must somehow hold “firm” though there is “nothing
                on heaven or on earth” on which it is based (Kant 35).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For the
                            distinction between “practical anthropology” and “morals,” see pp.
                            2–3.</note> The distinction between the subject matter of
                “practical anthropology” and the concerns of what Kant calls “morals” is meant to
                clear the way for theorization of a “pure will,” the activity of which can never be
                proven or verified by our experience but is nevertheless not fantasy either. We are
                not being asked to choose between anthropology and morals, between “sociological
                fact” and speculative fiction or theory, but to recognize how the form of an inquiry
                itself shapes the object of the inquiry. This methodological insight is especially
                germane to the claims made in this collection about the epistemic contributions of
                poetic form. Maintaining a strict “division of labor” between empirical and
                non-empirical modes of inquiry is crucial, Kant thinks, in order to meaningfully
                account for, and to take seriously, intuitions involving freedom, obligation,
                respect, and dignity that seem to have no foundation in “things as they are.” But if
                those intuitions are without empirical basis, why take them seriously at all? It is
                fair to say that all the essays in this collection argue that it is the work of
                literature to bring us to know something—about power, about guilt, about aversion,
                 fear, and resolution—which can only be recognized as such if we grant the
                possibility of what the editors term a “poetics of knowledge."</p>
                  <p>As the editors note in their introduction, the essays collected here vary widely in
                method, subject matter, and historical sweep, but they all address the imbrication
                of aesthetic form and emotions, and each finds, in that imbrication, points of
                ethical inflection. The opening proposition of the collection—that “feeling is part
                of a structured world”—itself suggests a movement away from approaches to affect
                influenced by evolutionary psychology and neuroscience. There is no effort made in
                these essays to seek consilience with, or corroboration from, research in other
                disciplines. And if no single theoretical framework guides this movement away from a
                scientistically-inclined interdisciplinarity, there is nevertheless a tacit
                methodological commitment to the practice of close reading that is (as Jonathan
                Kramnick has recently argued) the most specific competency of literary studies as a
                discipline (4). It is from the renewed commitment to close reading in these essays
                that emotional and ethical response emerge as mutually determining. The question is
                how to understand that co-implication without losing the specificity of its
                articulation in literary form.</p>
                  <p>The emphasis on complicity that is present in all the essays emerges from careful
                attention to subtle shadings of emotion, to spectrums of affective intensity, and to
                judgments that combine feeling, cognition, and bodily sensation. Even that most
                visceral of reactions—disgust—is shown to have such a composite structure. What the
                collection as a whole can be taken to argue is that certain forms of moral
                experience and reflection given to us in literature become available to us as
                readers only insofar as we resist the temptation to translate—and thereby
                subordinate—their logic and their poetry to explanatory frameworks (sociological,

                            Amanda Anderson has recently urged us to be wary of the convergence of
                            two dominant intellectual currents: the “deflation” of ideals of
                            considered deliberation and ethical reasoning found in the cognitive and
                            neurosciences on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the decentering
                            of agency, the emphasis on “forces that take place behind the backs of
                            individual subjects,” that is paradigmatic of post-structuralist and
                            post-humanist approaches in the humanities (24). For a useful account of
                            how the “zeal of theory construction” hardens distinctions between the
                            always “mutually implicated categories” of emotion, cognition, belief,
                            desire and judgments, see Amélie Oksensberg Rorty, <title level="a">Enough Already with
                            ‘Theories of the Emotions'</title> (270, 273).</note> Moreover, and as
                the emphasis upon complicity suggests, the co-implication of emotions and ethics
                that all the essays in this collection attend to seems also to require new ways of
                speaking about agency—even while reckoning with individual and collective
                powerlessness. To return briefly to Kant, the “precarious position” the philosopher
                holds, ungrounded by anything “on heaven or on earth,” is the fragile “standpoint”
                upon which each thinks of herself as (if) “under the idea of freedom.” Something
                other than, or more than, mystification or delusion might be at work in imagining
                ourselves as capable of recognizing and resisting powers the determining force of
                which we also recognize. In much the same way, the feeling of complicity, even
                though it accompanies a sense of powerlessness, seems to depend on some “idea of
                freedom,” even as (only) a kind of negative capability.</p>
                  <p>To take the first-person perspective seriously is to acknowledge that an adequate and
                complete explanatory account of our conditions (of “things as they are” for us and
                between us) is incommensurate with the bases upon which we expect and demand an
                accounting from one another. Christine Korsgaard (among the most important
                revisionist readers of Kant in the past half century) situates this first-person
                perspective in the “intersubjective” realm within which we hold one another
                responsible—for what we do together and apart, for how we fail one another, and
                even, yes, for how we feel.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See the influential titular essay in <title level="m">Creating the Kingdom of Ends</title> (188–221, especially
                            204–5 and 210–12).</note> Crucially, to say that the
                first-person perspective is non-empirical is <emph>not</emph> to say that
                it is a kind of mistaken evasion of the material determinants that the third-person
                perspective discloses. The first-person perspective is not an illusion to be
                demystified. “We ought to be able to do without one another” does not aspire to be a
                counter-factual denial of “no man stands alone.” It is an utterance in a different
                register, so to speak. The complicity the phrase assumes and elicits—and elicits
                precisely <emph>by assuming it</emph>—depends on my assent in a way that
                “no man stands alone” does not. I must acknowledge, at the very least, that I know
                what it might mean to wish to do without another, that I get the gist of that
                sentiment even if (I say to myself) that I do not share it. (We may understand
                Godwin’s phrase as a speech act of the kind that Eric Lindstrom attends to in his
                reading of the poetic powers conjured by Audre Lorde and Percy Shelley.)</p>
                  <p>Taking complicity in the narrowly negative sense of “unwilled and dysphoric”
                participation, Eccles suggests that the familiarity of the indictment in
                ideologically inflected critique has had the paradoxical effect of desensitizing and
                numbing. We readily identify complicity as we read, but do not ourselves feel
                complicit. This numbing or desensitization to aesthetic experience in ideological
                critique is analogous to the trajectory Samalin traces whereby unrepressed
                expressions of disgust at “things as they are” are transformatively sanitized in the
                ostensibly affectively neutral observations of early sociology.</p>
                  <p>But of course, complicity is more capacious than its narrowly negative definition of
                feeling responsible for atrocities and injustice beyond our immediate control, just
                as ethics involves more of our speech and behavior than any isolated moment of
                choice. The conceptual and ethical valences of complicity are expansive—encompassing
                the vast extent of our co-implication with one another. In <title level="m">Caleb
                    Williams</title>, Eccles understands the interdependence of the two central
                characters as a “collective agency” that operates formally and structurally as an
                expression of our existential entanglement with one another. A similar insight is at work in Amelia Worsley’s essay on Coleridge and Southey, which reminds us that the abolitionist ballad, "The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade," (1799) makes explicit the political and ethical commitments allegorized in the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (1798).  Worsley understands that the feeling of complicity arises from a disruption of safe distance (be it spatial, temporal, or conceptual) between witness and perpetrator, and thus locates the complicity of the reader rather than the guilt and penance of the protagonist at the heart of both poems. Crowded with bystander figures, Southey's poem insistently draws the reader
                into the ambit of the sailor’s psyche, forcing a “collective, identificatory feeling
                of guilt” and a recognition of the urgency and immediacy of atrocities only
                allusively present in Coleridge’s abstract narrative of incrimination.</p>
                  <p>Ultimately the sense of responsibility entailed in the very idea of complicity
                appears to be diffused into what Eccles describes as an “aesthetics of atmosphere”
                that encloses characters and readers together in a miasma of culpability within
                which participant and bystander are indistinguishable. Is this, as Eccles argues, a
                phenomenology of collective politics, or is the (aesthetic) “experience of
                responsibility that can neither be refused nor fully discharged” a despair-inflected
                version of the censorious insights of ideological critique? This may be the most
                challenging question posed by the arguments in this collection. After all, the
                <emph>feeling</emph> of complicity, understood as an
                anxious sensitivity to the unresolvable and the unforgiveable, is surely salutary in
                its persistence—unlike the attenuation of unrestrained disgust that Zachary Samalin
                gives us good reason to lament in his essay, <title level="a">The Vomiting Mill.</title> For Samalin, what
                late nineteenth century urban sociologists diagnosed as a deficiency of feeling (the
                pathologically “indifferent,” “emotionless” and benumbed forms of interaction in the
                modern metropolis) is etiologically linked to powerful feelings of “aversion” and
                “repulsion.” Samalin's primal scene of modern disgust is Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Residence in
                London</title> from <title level="m">The Prelude</title> (1805), a text that anticipates the
                strange condensation of “repulsion with alienation, of excess feeling with
                pathological unfeeling” that he finds determining the character of sociology as a
                discipline. Barely disguised or irrepressible disgust seems in Wordsworth's
                recollections of London and in Friedrich Engels’s later descriptions of the
                “offensive and repellent” conditions of industrial Manchester to be just the
                opposite of complicity—revulsion being also a kind of revolt at things as they are.
                If “social theory” in Samalin’s provocative formulation, is born from “the spirit of
                disgust," then the expurgation of “feeling from method” called for by Emile
                Durkheim, Georg Simmel and other originators of the social sciences necessarily
                entails a pacification of affective intensity as a mode of description and also as
                resource for critique. Neutrality of tone portends conceptual constraint, sets a
                limit on what a social scientific description aims to achieve. And in that way,
                neutrality itself can be construed as another form of complicity.</p>
                  <p>It is perhaps symptomatic of our moment that this inquiry into “public feeling” limns
                the co-implication of aesthetic form, ethics and feeling by mapping bleak regions of
                sensibility to injustice, suffering, the unforgivable, and the irremediable. Turned
                inward, revulsion at things as they are risks turning into a sour mood of
                acquiescence, every passing moment of passive non-resistance being felt, in a
                stomach-churning sort of way, to be, in effect, a capitulation. For Eric Lindstrom
                this collective “mood of helplessness,” the “paradox of passive agency,” is
                precisely what the late Romantic Shelley contends with in the <title level="a">Defense of Poetry</title>
                (1821). Lindstrom offers a willfully forward-looking alignment of poetics and the
                re-imagining of forms of community via a reading of Shelley’s “Defense” as a radical
                theorization of the distinction between value and fact. In Samalin’s genealogy, the
                aspiration to separate (social) fact from (subjective) value in sociology is traced
                back to a moment when they were conjoined in inescapably pressing emotional response
                to the “mean” and “vulgar shapes” of urban despair “forced upon my sight” (1805 <title level="m">Prelude</title> Book 8: 804). That feeling—unwanted, unwilled, as
                undeniable and visceral as physical pain—was itself a powerful index of value, of
                what <emph>matters</emph>. On Samalin’s account, alienated numbness is at
                once a diagnostic posture and the lingering symptom of a revulsion that is at once
                involuntary and humane. On Eccles’s and Worsley’s accounts, complicity evinces a
                helpless paralysis that would not be felt at all were it not for the acutely present
                tension of stifled dissent. In this context, as Lindstrom argues in his essay, a
                utopian document such as Shelley's <title level="a">Defense of Poetry,</title> with its bold avowal of the
                power of the counterfactual, can only conjure the possibility of its "love-politics"
                by repressing and disowning "ugly" feelings of fear and anger.</p>
                  <p>Shelley's idealism seems an extraordinarily unabashed effort to inhabit the Kantian
                standpoint that is (in fact) “nowhere in heaven or earth" but in which we dwell
                "under the idea of freedom." The lightning speed of the poet's conceptual movements
                from aesthetics to ethics to politics betray a kind of desperate flight from the
                very feelings of terror, disgust, rage, aversion and helplessness that are the
                needful indices of the deplorable state of "things as they are." If Romanticists see
                something familiar in Audre Lorde's insistence that "thought is inextricable from
                feeling and its expressive formalization," Lindstrom asks us to understand that the
                "critical-creative" force of this "philosophical poetics" cannot be assimilated to
                the poetry of those Lorde identified as the “the white fathers [who write] . . . in
                order to cover their desperate wish for imagination without insight” (<title level="a">Poetry is not
                a Luxury</title>). In Lorde, Lindstrom finds a near-contemporary articulation of the
                "love-politics" that Romanticists recognize as Shelleyean, but in his essay’s
                accounting for the crucial differences and discontinuities between the two poets,
                the "denied metaphysical reality" of anger and fear emerges as necessarily
                constitutive of aesthetics as a utopian resource rather than as a collection of dark
                affective intensities to be overcome or transcended.</p>
                  <p>To recall my epigraph from Cavell, if "the concealment of what it is up to me to
                express is a perfect expression of" what I wish to conceal, then there is no hiding
                of our shames—but perhaps something will come from imagining how to be shame-faced
                with one another, to avow complicities that clamor for articulation in words we
                cannot choose but share.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">For all of its ubiquity in present discourse, complicity is also uniquely susceptible
                    to repression and disavowal: pervasive and totalizing, yet always somewhere else.
                    Working against the reflex to mystify complicity or to externalize it, this essay
                    recovers an aesthetics of complicity in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, a
                    novel that readers have long experienced as difficult to get beyond or to set at a
                    distance. As a mode of reading, complicity is defined by a mixture of intense
                    involvement and aversion, identification and disidentification. A story about
                    radiating damage that also implicates its readers in its harms, Godwin’s novel
                    ensures that any recognition of shared guilt will also amount to a claim in it. In
                    the process, it elaborates a politics grounded not in negative rights but in mutual
                    responsibility.</p>

                  <p>The years of #metoo and the Trump presidency have seemed to install complicity as the
                universal diagnosis of our political present. They have also codified a now-familiar
                ritual of public disavowal: the deluge of personal and institutional statements in
                which denouncement doubles as self-exculpation. In other words: everyone is
                complicit; no one is complicit. I am less interested in the epistemological
                contradiction here than I am in the predictability of this phobic reflex: the
                assumption that complicity is, above all else, something to be shed or disclaimed.
                What forms of subjectivity, we might ask, does this circuit of response assume or
                nurture? What sort of politics do such disavowals enable, and what alternatives do
                they foreclose? What does it mean that the main form of collective agency we are
                capable of envisioning right now—the most recognizable instance of our condition of
                being-together—is also one that we cannot tolerate or own?</p>
                  <p>In literary studies as in current political discourse, this peculiar state of
                mystified agency has proved remarkably easy to externalize: a condition we are in
                the business of recognizing, exposing, and implicitly disclaiming. This is one of
                the motivating projects of critique, as anatomized by recent challenges to depth
                    hermeneutics.<note place="foot" resp="author">For the now-standard accounts of structure of critique, see: Eve Sedgwick, <title level="a">Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading</title>; Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus, <title level="a">Surface Reading: An Introduction</title>; Bruno Latour, <title level="a">Why Has Critique Run out of Steam?</title>; and Rita Felski, <title level="m">The Limits of
                            Critique</title>.</note>
                On the other hand, the very pervasiveness of this condition—its diffuse structure
                and banal omnipresence—can easily conduce to desensitization and false
                consciousness. This is the script of ideology itself, of the open secret that is so
                familiar it is barely registered at all.<note place="foot" resp="author">On ideology and the open secret, see Slavoj Žižek, <title level="a">The
                            Spectre of Ideology</title> and D. A. Miller, <title level="a">Secret Subjects, Open
                            Secrets.</title>
                     </note> Complicity thus sits at the intersection of a
                pair of powerful cultural scripts, at once the target of critique and the work of
                ideology. In both of these scenarios—whether it is exposed in others or repressed in
                ourselves—complicity would seem to be precisely <emph>what cannot be
                    felt</emph>. This is not to collapse the distance between critique and its object,
                but simply to draw out this initial inference: we seem to be good at identifying
                complicity, and bad at acknowledging it. Another way to put this is to say that it
                is hard to find a way of thinking complicity that is an adequate response to its
                basic shape (its banality, its scope) and that does not in some way reproduce its
                pitfalls (its tendency to replace responsibility with a mystified state of
                exception).</p>
                  <p>This essay attempts to see a way beyond this impasse by theorizing complicity as a
                distinctive aesthetic response.<note place="foot" resp="author">For a concept that underpins the project of critique and that is casually invoked with some regularity as a reader response, complicity has attracted little sustained attention as a distinct aesthetic experience. Two important exceptions are Geoffrey Hartman’s brief but suggestive essay on the nouveau roman, <title level="a"> The Aesthetics of Complicity</title>, and Namwali Serpell’s chapter on “enfolding” in <title level="m">Seven Modes of Uncertainty</title>, which puts forward complicity as one of its related effects (see 112–3).</note> To do so, I turn to a text that helped shape
                both of these cultural scripts, William Godwin’s 1794 political novel <title level="m">Things As They Are, or The Adventures of Caleb Williams</title>.
                Frequently cited as the first detective story, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                has also been claimed as a founding parable of “ideology’s internalization” (Lynch
                464). On one level, then, the novel pivots around the very predicament I’ve just
                described. Casting its protagonist as both a paranoid reader-detective <emph>and</emph> a victim of ideological mystification, the novel levels a
                searing critique of “things as they are,” even as it seems to diagnose its
                inadequacy to the task of what Godwin calls “political justice.” In what follows I
                will for the most part be setting these familiar versions of the novel to one side
                in order to concentrate on a range of effects that operate at a different scale, at
                once above and below the privileged formal sites of plot and character. For all of
                its forward propulsion, the novel is often figured in its reception as a spreading,
                lingering atmosphere that enmeshes its readers and sticks with them long after
                reading. And in brief snatches of dialogue and narration, it experiments with forms
                of lyric address that confuse guilty characters and eavesdropping readers. Both
                techniques have the striking effect of making complicity available as a first-person
                experience, at once an object of feeling and a mode of reading. To identify
                complicity, in this context, is also already to take part in it. The
                counterintuitive wager at the heart of this paper is that we might need more, not
                less, complicity to carry ourselves from the injustice of “things as they are” to a
                more equitable world.</p>

                  <p>It is hard to imagine a more succinct articulation of the aesthetic ideology—of the
                utopian belief in the power of fiction to remake subjects and worlds—than the
                ambition Godwin claimed for <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> in his later
                preface to <title level="m">Fleetwood</title> (1832): “I will write a tale, that shall
                constitute an epoch in the mind of the reader, that no one, after he has read it,
                shall ever be exactly the same man that he was before” (350).<note place="foot" resp="author">Although written for a new edition of
                            <title level="m">Fleetwood</title>
                            for Bentley’s Standard Novels series,
                                Godwin’s 1832 preface is in fact entirely dedicated to an account of
                                the writing of <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams</title>. As I will argue, this impulse to return to <title level="m">Caleb
                            Williams</title> in seemingly unrelated contexts is a continuing trope of its reception.</note>
                Formulated as a prediction but offered up only in retrospect, Godwin’s immodest
                aspiration can be read in part as a summary of the novel’s actual reception in the
                years between its publication and this preface. Around the same time, William
                Hazlitt offered a similar assessment of the novel’s cultural impact: “Few books have
                made a greater impression than <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> on its first
                appearance” (144). To paraphrase Godwin, I want to propose that the early critical
                discourse surrounding <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> is specific and
                consistent enough to constitute an event in the history of reading, although one
                that, for reasons that will become clear, has proved difficult to fully
                recognize.</p>
                  <p>Some of the most revealing commentaries on the novel appear not in the first wave of
                reviews, but in a series of retrospectives tucked into reviews of other novels. Like
                Godwin in his later preface, these essays turn back to <title level="m">Caleb
                    Williams</title>, and specifically to the experience of reading
                    <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, as though still in its thrall. Many of them describe the
                experience in spatial terms, as an oppressive environment that is difficult to get
                outside of or to set at a distance. Here is John Gibson Lockhart, recalling his
                reading of <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> in an 1817 review of Godwin’s <title level="m">Mandeville</title> (1817):
                <quote>The impression which his story makes upon us is like that of a dismal dream, which we
                feel to be a fiction, and from which we are anxious to escape, but which sits, with
                a gloomy pertinacity, inflexible upon our breast, and compels us, in spite of reason
                and volition, to keep our eyes fixed and steadfast on its gliding phantoms and
                unearthly horrors. (270)</quote>
            In a twist on Coleridge’s formula for poetic illusion, Lockhart describes a
                phenomenon we might call the unwilling suspension of disbelief: a state of immersion
                that endures “in spite of reason and volition.” The quality of persistence finds
                various names in this passage—“inflexibility,” “fixity,” “steadfastness,”
                “pertinacity”—which together conflate the formal continuity of the work with the
                condition of rapt paralysis it engenders in the reader.</p>
                  <p>For other readers, this persistence extends even beyond the reading experience. “We
                remember the first time of reading [<title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>] well,
                though now long ago,” recalls Hazlitt, in a review of Godwin’s <title level="m">Cloudesley</title> (1830); “There is no laying down the book till we come to the
                end; and even then the words still ring in our ears, nor do the mental apparitions
                ever pass away from the eye of memory” (144). The novel seems to diffuse here across
                its own borders, sustaining itself as an echo or an afterimage. The experience
                Hazlitt and Lockhart describe is both a spatial and a temporal condition, defined by
                its extension in space and its duration in time. If the reception of this novel is,
                as I am suggesting, an event in the history of reading, it is one defined precisely
                by its refusal to constitute itself as a self-contained episode or object. This is
                implicit in the double gesture of Hazlitt’s description—a “first time” reading that,
                it turns out, hasn’t really come to an end—as well as the recursive structure of all
                of these accounts, the compulsion to return to <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                in apparently distant contexts.</p>
                  <p>In their tendency to describe the novel as an oppressive environment or an ongoing
                experience, Hazlitt and Lockhart point to a set of effects that gather under the
                aesthetic category of <emph>atmosphere</emph>, a term that acquired its
                wider figurative range of reference—including the particular sense of a text’s
                enveloping mood—during the Romantic period (“atmosphere”). In her study of the
                history of this now-dead metaphor, Jayne Elizabeth Lewis identifies the 1790’s, in
                particular, as a turning point in this process. If, in the eighteenth century,
                literary atmosphere maintained a vital connection to the investigation of air in
                natural philosophy, the very success of atmosphere as an aesthetic program in Gothic
                fiction led it to shed its original material associations. Published the same year
                as Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title>, <title level="m">Caleb
                    Williams</title> is significant precisely because it helped usher in this shift.
                Unlike Radcliffe’s novels, which are awash in descriptions of clouded landscapes and
                gloomy interiors, Godwin’s novel generates atmospheric effects that lack an obvious
                mimetic source or counterpart in the text. Notably spare in its physical and
                environmental descriptions, the novel instead offers a study in what we might call
                atmosphere’s metaphorization, recruiting the distinctive phenomenology of weather
                and air to new ends.</p>
                  <p>These responses to <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> therefore offer a distinct
                perspective on literary atmosphere just when it was coming into its own as an
                autonomous category. For one thing, they provocatively recombine a set of aesthetic
                phenomena we conventionally oppose. On the one hand, the Gothic images that dominate
                these descriptions (“mental apparitions,” “gliding phantoms,” “unearthly horrors”)
                are the signal tropes of the experience Rita Felski calls enchantment, a “sense of
                intense involvement” in which the instincts of the ego and the demands of the world
                outside the text seem to fall away (<title level="m">Uses of Literature</title> 54).
                But as Lockhart’s “dismal dream” makes clear, this kind of reverie is unwilled and
                dysphoric, charged with a negativity we associate with the stance of critique. Moreover, in these accounts the state of reverie
                is strangely bound up with the apprehension of the work as a coherent form, what
                critics have consistently identified as its “oppressive” “unity of structure and
                atmosphere” (Tompkins 311) or “unity of design” (Kelly).<note place="foot" resp="author">David Perkins contrasts the discourse of Romantic reverie with “spatial metaphors such as ‘structure’ and ‘whole,’” which “name perceptions no reader has actually experienced” (189). What seems distinctive about the response to
                                <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams</title>, and the aesthetic category of atmosphere more generally, is its focus on the 
                            experiential correlates of uniformity and totality.</note>
                Godwin’s claustrophobic atmosphere blends the immersive effects of enchantment or
                reverie with the totalizing intuition of <emph>tone</emph>, another term
                for a work’s global disposition (though one we more readily ascribe to poems than to
                novels). Tone and atmosphere both produce strong “worlding” effects but register
                different kinds of relations between texts and readers. While tone is, as Sianne
                Ngai argues, a powerful resource for ideology critique precisely because of its
                status as an “unfelt” or alienable feeling (43–9), atmosphere,
                Lewis reminds us, is something that “cannot be stood outside of, so it can never be
                completely objectified, fixed, or, as a result, intellectually possessed” (6). If
                the question lurking behind a description of tone is whether a feeling belongs to a
                work or its reader, the question raised by an aesthetics of atmosphere is whether
                the reader might in some sense belong to the work. The sense of totality is
                perceived insofar as the reader also feels herself to be a part of that whole: this
                is a view of a world not from above or outside, but from within.</p>
                  <p>In <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, then, atmosphere corresponds to a specific
                kind of readerly experience, in which a heightened impression of proximity and
                involvement is yoked to a sense of discomfort or dysphoria. This ambivalent relation
                diverges sharply from the forms of aesthetic subjectivity Romanticism has most often
                been understood to sponsor. From Coleridge’s willing suspension of disbelief to
                Schiller’s imaginative free play, the dominant strains of Romantic aesthetic theory
                tend to construe aesthetic experience as a pedagogy of negative freedom through
                which the individual subject achieves her most fully realized and self-conscious
                state. In their emphasis on consent, volition, and cognitive freedom, these ideas
                have often been understood either implicitly or explicitly to ground a liberal
                politics. But in these early responses to <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, we
                can discern the contours of another form of aesthetic and political subjectivity,
                which corresponds not to an achieved distance or independence but instead to a sense
                of unfulfilled involvement and obligation. The name I am giving to this alternative
                is complicity.</p>

                  <head>Caleb and Falkland</head>
                  <p>Two stark claims appear in the revised 1798 edition of Godwin’s <title level="m">Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</title> (first published in 1793), the
                galvanizing text of 1790s British radicalism and founding document of philosophical
                anarchism. “We ought to be able to do without one another,” Godwin pronounces at one
                point (<title level="m">PJ Variants</title> 337). But elsewhere he cautions: “No man
                stands alone, and can pursue his private conceptions of pleasure without affecting
                […] the persons immediately connected with him, and through them, the rest of the
                world” (<title level="m">PJ Variants</title> 210). Leaning with equal and opposite
                force on the preposition “without,” these statements crystallize a seeming paradox.
                On the one hand, Godwin champions the sovereignty of individual reason. He objects
                to any social structures (predictably, governments, schools, and marriage contracts;
                less predictably, theatrical productions, promises, and dinner parties) that
                constrain a person’s ability to think for herself at all times. On the other hand,
                Godwin’s metaphysics insists on the fundamental interdependence of all things in the
                universe. Where his “system of individuality” (PJ 455) seems to enshrine the autonomous
                subject, this “doctrine of necessity” calls the very notion of autonomy into
                question. A person, on this account, is simply the product of her relations, the
                result of forces extending outward in space and backward in time: “[m]an is in no
                case strictly speaking the beginning of any event or series of events that takes
                place in the universe, but only the vehicle through which certain causes operate”
                    (<title level="m">PJ</title> 168). Seen from this perspective, the private reason
                that Godwin wants to shelter from social control would seem never to have been
                private in the first place; as Frances Ferguson puts it, “Godwin conceives of the
                individual as requiring external impressions to be an individual at all” (100). He
                therefore sits uneasily at the junction of differing intellectual traditions,
                alternately assimilable to a lineage of liberal individualism and to a genealogy of
                social determinism.</p>
                  <p>These two currents of Godwin’s political theory can be seen to intersect, or perhaps
                collide, in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, a novel that introduces two
                paradigmatic liberal subjects—an ingénue and an outcast—who become inextricably
                bound to one another through the discovery of a hidden crime.<note place="foot" resp="author">The major account of how these competing perspectives—the individualist and the deterministic—play out in <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams</title> is Ferguson’s chapter on the Gothic in <title level="m">Solitude and the
                                Sublime</title>. Much of the novel’s critical reception has itself been shaped by these alternative frameworks. For many years, Godwin’s rationalist individualism prevailed as a hermeneutic: Harvey Gross, Alex Gold, Gary Handwerk, and John Bender all read Caleb’s narrative as a quest for autonomy, however failed or compromised. More recently, Brian Michael Norton and Anna Maria Jones have drawn attention to Godwin’s necessitarianism, with Norton describing Godwin’s shift from a Stoic concept of personal happiness to an Epicurean concept of public welfare, and Jones reading
                                <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams</title> as a critique of the Gothic’s conflictual model of personal rights. In a compelling reading that seeks to
                                reconcile these views, Daniel Stout suggests that the novel calls
                                for a legal theory of “easement” that would maneuver between the
                                absolutist claims of private property and communal ownership. Taken
                                together, these last three arguments suggest the remarkable degree
                                to which the novel reclaims the quintessential Enlightenment
                                bequests of happiness (Norton), rights (Jones), and property (Stout)
                                as fundamentally social and transpersonal.</note>
                Caleb is an orphan who is hired as secretary to the reclusive landowner Ferdinand
                Falkland. As he digs into his employer’s past, he becomes increasingly obsessed with
                the mysterious death of Falkland’s neighbor. When Caleb extracts a confession from
                Falkland—that he killed his neighbor and allowed two innocent men to be executed in
                his place—their fortunes become permanently entwined. Caleb possesses the secret
                that could ruin Falkland, and Falkland has the full weight of a corrupt justice
                system to bring down on Caleb. Driven to desperation by Falkland’s persecution,
                Caleb finally resolves to expose him in public, ruining both of their lives in the
                process.</p>
                  <p>As this synopsis makes clear, although <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> seems to
                promise a conventional novelistic account of an individual, it actually gives us the
                inseparable stories of two protagonists. This structure provocatively installs not a
                character but an enigmatic relation at the heart of the novel. The relationship
                between Caleb and Falkland has long been a crux of the novel’s criticism. Some
                critics have questioned whether they are separate characters at all, preferring to
                see their relationship as an internal drama of the psyche (Uphaus and Storch) or an
                allegory of the conflict between individual and society (Gross and Ferguson). Others
                have disagreed about the pathology that binds them together—whether this is a story
                about excessive love and self-loss on the one hand (Gold) or about animosity and
                self-regard on the other (Jones). The sheer variety of these accounts testifies to
                the difficulty of assimilating Caleb and Falkland to a normative sense of
                individuated personhood. If Caleb and Falkland aren’t exactly their own persons,
                they might instead be seen as each other’s accomplices.</p>
                  <p>Such a characterization would seem overly specific if their relationship weren’t so
                emphatically determined by the novel’s overarching juridical framework of innocence
                and guilt. Thus, in the first half of the novel, Caleb’s growing attachment to
                Falkland is propelled by his intuition of Falkland’s guilt, just as, after Falkland
                frames Caleb for theft, Caleb’s quest for personal liberty depends on the
                demonstration of his own innocence. In this way, both halves of the novel—the
                mystery and the chase, or what Godwin called its “offensive” and “defensive”
                parts—bind a socio-formal question of relation to a moral determination of innocence
                or guilt. The force of Caleb’s famous closing lines—“I began these memoirs with the
                idea of vindicating my own character. I have now no character that I wish to
                vindicate” (303)—should be felt on both of these levels, as at once a surrender of
                proprietary selfhood (the kind of character he would call his “own”) and of his
                claims to innocence. In a narrative centered on the practice of framing—as Falkland
                first allows the Hawkinses to hang for the murder he committed, and then pins a
                robbery on Caleb—the scandal of the conclusion is essentially to assent to the
                framing. Just as it hesitates to claim Caleb or Falkland as its protagonist, the
                novel finally refuses to choose between innocence and guilt. They are guilty because
                they are together and together insofar as they are both guilty.<note place="foot" resp="author">This reading of the conclusion
                            dovetails with Stout’s resonant comments about the scene: “guilt is
                            shared and therefore comes to be something that is not quite, not <emph>properly</emph>, guilt. Quasi guilty or quasi innocent
                            is how things are left, is things as they are” (168).</note>
                Godwin suggests that innocence is only really achievable in the absence of other
                persons and that any form of sociality will involve, perhaps even originate in, a
                sharing of blame.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, what is true of Caleb and Falkland holds for the novel’s minor characters
                too: the baffling proliferation of surrogates and bystanders who motivate, execute,
                or enable the actions of others (the henchmen Grimes and Jones, the informant
                Spurrel, Falkland’s half-brother Forester). The overwhelming impression is of
                overpopulation, of more characters than are needed to carry out the basic movements
                of the plot. Even the persecution of Caleb turns out to be the joint handiwork of
                Falkland and Forester. Perhaps most tellingly of all, the novel is entirely
                noncommittal in apportioning blame between them: we’re quite not sure, in the end,
                of who did what exactly, and it doesn’t seem to matter. Against the forensic clarity
                of the whodunit, against Caleb’s cherished conviction that guilt is what
                individuates (“I always declared…that I was the perpetrator of no guilt, but that
                the guilt wholly belonged to my accuser” [264]), the novel instead repeatedly
                implies that guilt is something we hold in common.</p>
                  <p>If, in contemporary usage, complicity is a pejorative term—a condition to be shed or
                disavowed—in <title level="m">Political Justice</title> as in <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, it emerges as the unexpected ground for Godwin’s ethics. The
                notion of a universe “connected and cemented in all of its parts” is in fact the
                premise behind Godwin’s concept of justice, the only absolute value in his system of
                morality (<title level="m">PJ</title> 68). Justice—“a rule of conduct originating in
                the connection of one percipient being with another” (<title level="m">PJ</title>
                49)—is precisely this principle of relation recast as an ethical injunction, a
                person’s obligation to contribute in every way possible to the welfare of humanity
                at large. Godwin’s absolutist notion of justice led him to an idiosyncratic
                rejection of individual rights, a position that set him well outside the mainstream
                of English liberal thought in the 1790s. If we take a “right” to be “a full and
                complete power of either doing a thing or omitting it, without the person’s becoming
                liable to animadversion or censure from another,” Godwin explains, “man has no
                rights, no discretionary power whatever” (<title level="m">PJ</title> 67).</p>
                  <p>In its propensity to generalize blame, Godwin’s philosophy has clear affinities with
                the stringent logic of “tragic responsibility” that Sandra Macpherson has unearthed
                in eighteenth-century fiction and liability law. Like the realist novels Macpherson
                discusses, Godwin’s political theory insists on the responsibility we bear for the
                unintended effects of our actions. But alongside his attention to such
                externalities, Godwin retains a place for what Macpherson calls the “adventure of
                interiority” (23). At once more and less radical than this tradition of tragic
                realism, Godwin’s utopian anarchism cannot surrender the project of justice to a
                state empowered to mete out punishments and rewards. The “justice” in <title level="m">Political Justice</title> is not, therefore, the one contemplated by
                the law of torts, or by the law in general. It is an ongoing principle of action
                rather than a system of accountability for past actions. “If justice have any
                meaning,” Godwin explains, “it is just that I should contribute everything in my
                power to the benefit of the whole” (<title level="m">PJ</title>49). Godwin’s unusual
                recourse to the first-person pronoun in this definition makes it clear that even as
                the object of justice expands to humanity in general its execution remains a
                subjective problem. The peculiarity of Godwin’s political theory is this strenuous
                insistence on the welfare of “the whole” and the comportment of the individual. The
                problem of justice is to bring these incommensurable quantities into some kind of
                meaningful relationship, to turn the universal into a matter of intimate concern.
                The achievement of <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> is to explore what
                complicity might feel like, and how that kind of feeling might become a prompt for
                action—in Godwin’s terms, a way of making justice political.</p>

                  <head>Feeling Complicit</head>
                  <p>Even though he spends most of the novel under some form of restraint, Caleb often
                dwells on the sensuous, embodied experience of his own freedom. When he escapes from
                prison, he marvels: “The night was gloomy, and it drizzled with rain. But these were
                circumstances I had scarcely the power to perceive; all was sunshine and joy within
                me. I hardly felt the ground; I repeated to myself a thousand times, I am free. What
                concern have I with danger and alarm! I feel that I am free; I feel that I will
                continue so” (151). Caleb seems to have an intuitive sense of personal liberty,
                perceptible here as a feeling of movement and weightlessness, an acute
                self-awareness that is notably indexed to an attenuation of his physical
                surround.</p>
                  <p>It is less obvious how the state of complicity might become an object of embodied,
                phenomenal knowledge. Indeed, more than anything, the consciousness of self in
                relation to a wider collective that <emph>Political Justice</emph>
                prescribes—the insight that “[w]e are not connected with one or two percipient
                beings, but with a society, a nation, and in some sense with the whole family of
                mankind” (<title level="m">PJ</title> 50)—poses a basic problem of apprehension. The
                expansive object of care that Godwin identifies as “the species,” “the whole and not
                a part,” or “the general weal” would seem to be by definition unavailable to
                anyone’s immediate sensory perception. But Caleb does intermittently experience a
                sense of involvement in an enveloping totality. Consider, for instance, the novel’s
                turning point, where Caleb impulsively decides to break into the chest he believes
                to be holding Falkland’s secret. The scene takes place during a fire, and Caleb
                specifically describes his “monstrous” deed as an effect of his surroundings: “This
                was the first instance in which I had witnessed a danger by fire. All was confusion
                around me, and all changed into hurricane within. The general situation to my
                unpracticed apprehension partook of the desperate, and I by contagion became alike
                desperate” (130). This scene describes an “involuntary sympathy” between self and
                circumstances, part and whole—a principle of “contagion” that is embodied in the
                spread of the fire itself.</p>
                  <p>Something similar happens when Falkland is called to preside over the trial of a
                local peasant who has been accused of murder. Watching the proceedings, Caleb
                experiences a pressing sense of intimacy with Falkland, a strange compound of
                suspicion and sympathy: <quote>His countenance was embarrassed and anxious; he scarcely saw any body. The
                examination had not proceeded far, before he chanced to turn his eye to the part of
                the room where I was. […] [W]e exchanged a silent look, by which we told volumes to
                each other. Mr Falkland's complexion turned from red to pale, and from pale to red.
                I perfectly understood his feelings, and would willingly have withdrawn myself. But
                it was impossible; my passions were too deeply engaged; I was rooted to the spot;
                though my own life, that of my master, or almost of a whole nation had been at
                stake, I had no power to change my position. (123)</quote>
           These scenes of affective intensity pay a peculiar attention to scenery itself—in the
                first case, through Caleb’s heightened receptiveness to his material surroundings
                and, in this one, through a hyperawareness of bodies in space, of positions and
                sightlines. Here, in a notable inversion of foreground and background, we get a
                conspicuous focus on Caleb’s position and role as a bystander, a focus that is
                pointedly dramatized when Falkland turns his gaze upon Caleb, as though to draw him
                into the scene he thinks he is simply watching. That pivot might be said to trace
                the signature arc of complicity: the moment when spectators become participants, or
                when mere proximity shades into oblique involvement.</p>
                  <p>What we might call Caleb’s feeling for circumstance in this passage culminates in the
                last sentence, the sequence of substitutions in which Caleb briefly imagines that
                his “own life,” or Falkland’s, or a “whole nation[’s]” are “at stake.” This climax
                strikingly embeds Godwin’s necessitarian philosophy—which likewise moves from “one
                or two percipient beings” to “a nation” to “the whole family of mankind”—in a
                hypothetical grammar intended most explicitly to attest to Caleb’s inability to act
                upon it. Against the feeling of weightless independence we saw above, this scene
                counterposes a fleeting sense of responsibility to a larger collective, albeit one
                oddly provoked by his own inadequate response to it.</p>

                  <head>Apostrophe and the Novel</head>
                  <p>In these scenes, we might recognize some of the same features that distinguished <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> as an aesthetic experience for its early
                readers: the atmospheric awareness that made a perception of the whole consistent
                with a feeling of being inside and the state of unwilling paralysis that marked
                Lockhart’s “dismal dream.” What seems to link all of these experiences is a
                condition of problematic or unwilled immersion—a state of absorption no less
                powerful for the resistance it provokes. What might we glean from these examples,
                then, about how <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> produces the impression that
                it does?</p>
                  <p>We saw that during the peasant’s trial, Caleb’s feeling of complicity coincides with
                a shift of address that causes him to think of himself as at once a spectator and a
                potential agent in the unfolding scene, an ambivalent condition that he experiences
                most concretely as a state of frustrated action. I want to suggest that the novel
                achieves a similar effect through its most significant—and most
                overlooked—structuring device, the framing or the wrongful accusation. After
                Falkland confesses his crime to Caleb, he falsely charges Caleb with theft, planting
                some of his own things in Caleb’s luggage to corroborate the allegation. This ruse
                not only effectively shifts the focus of suspicion from Falkland to Caleb, but also,
                more subtly, extends a version of Caleb’s predicament to the novel’s readers. For
                the rest of the novel, Caleb’s knowledge of Falkland’s guilt (against the widespread
                belief in his innocence) is shadowed by our conviction in Caleb’s innocence (against
                the circumstantial evidence of his guilt). Both situations deploy a form of
                knowledge that exceeds or outpaces the capacity for action. This makes for a
                uniquely exasperating reading experience: in one scene after another, we watch Caleb
                struggle, and fail, to convince former comrades of what we already “know” to be
                true. Here, then, is a situation that uniquely disables some of our familiar scripts
                for reading narrative: this is not a reading for the plot, or a suspicious reading
                for the symptom. Instead, the frustration derives from the fact that all is plain,
                that we know too much.</p>
                  <p>Although this predicament broadly characterizes the experience of reading the novel
                in the wake of Falkland’s confession, its effects tend to be concentrated in
                particular scenes, and even more narrowly, in specific moments of dialogue. The
                example I want to consider in some detail here is the improvised hearing that
                Falkland’s half-brother Forester convenes after Falkland accuses Caleb of theft.
                Closely following and conspicuously restaging the peasant’s trial, the scene is
                charged with a sense of déjà vu: we find some of the same characters assembled in a
                similar configuration, as though we’re experiencing the earlier trial again from a
                slightly different vantage point. Where the first scene of judgment came to focus
                oddly on Caleb, the “deeply engaged” bystander (123), this one palpably shifts
                attention to the novel’s readers, who are likewise implicated in and barred from
                participating in the proceedings.</p>
                  <p>This scene is constructed to pivot around Caleb’s lack of evidence—a problem that
                takes the wealth of circumstantial detail we’ve encountered as readers and converts
                it into a damaging absence. Faced with the stolen items Falkland has planted with
                his belongings, Caleb’s only recourse is to insist on his innocence. Without
                evidence or witnesses to support his case, he calls on Falkland to testify on his
                behalf: <quote>Mr Falkland is not deceived: he perfectly knows that I am innocent. [. . .] I make
                this averment not merely because it is solemnly true, but because it is inseparably
                connected with my vindication. I am the party accused, and I shall be told that I am
                not to be believed in my own defence. I can produce no other witnesses of my
                innocence; I therefore call upon Mr Falkland to be my evidence. (163)</quote>
            Caleb represents his predicament as a double bind: the only witnesses to the alleged
                crime are the accused and the accuser. One is unreliable and the other is lying. But
                the very terms in which he lays out this problem—his concession that “I can produce
                no other witnesses of my innocence”—may remind readers of their own status as
                vicarious witnesses in this hearing, in possession of the supporting testimony that
                Caleb lacks.</p>
                  <p>The reader’s muteness thus joins Caleb’s unreliability and Falkland’s mendacity in
                Caleb’s predicament here: in this intimate circle of shared knowledge, each witness
                is equally incapable of vindicating the accused. It’s hard not to read the questions
                that Caleb poses—“Did you never boast to me in private of your power to ruin me? [ .
                . . ] Did you not tell me that, though I should prepare in that case a tale ever so
                plausible or ever so true, you would take care that the whole world should execrate
                me as an imposter? Were not those your very words?” (164)—as sidelong appeals to his
                readers, who, like Falkland, know enough to return a clear affirmative to each.</p>
                  <p>This impression is strengthened by the fact that Caleb invokes specifically verbal
                evidence in his defense—not only transcribing exact bits of dialog we’ve read, but
                pointing out that he is doing so, effectively referring us back to the relevant
                passages in the text. His repetitions prompt and reward leafing back through the
                pages to locate their originals, thereby compelling a rereading, and leveraging that
                rereading as a form of proof.<note place="foot" resp="author"> To appreciate how exact these auto-quotations are, compare Caleb’s question, “Did you not tell me that, though I should prepare in that case a tale ever so plausible or ever so true, you would take care that the whole world should execrate me as an impostor” (164) to Falkland’s earlier warning, “prepare a tale ever so plausible, or ever so true, the whole world shall execrate you as an impostor” (150), and Caleb’s “Did you not add that my innocence should be of no service to me, and that you laughed at so feeble a defence?” (164) to Falkland’s “Your innocence shall be of no service to you; I laugh at so feeble a defence” (150).</note>
                As if to reinforce the point, Caleb’s final appeal in his cross-examination is
                explicitly to a text: <quote>Did you not receive a letter from me the morning of the day on which I had departed,
                requesting your consent to my departure? [. . .] Should I have begun with stating that
                I had conceived a desire to quit your service, if my desire and the reasons for it
                had been of the nature that is now alleged? Should I have dared to ask for what
                reason I was thus subjected to an eternal penance? Saying this, I took out a copy of
                my letter and laid it open upon the table. (164)</quote> Caleb’s directive to read his letter again concentrates the act of rereading elicited
                by the passage in general upon a specific text within the diegesis. Turning Falkland
                quite literally into a re-reader of Caleb’s text, this move registers the degree to
                which this passage has already worked to fuse the position of Caleb’s accuser and
                the position of the novel’s readers. The strongly interpellated second person in
                Caleb’s speech—“you” or “your” appears eleven times in this short passage—is, in
                fact, a strangely mixed character. In the actions imputed to it (“Did you never
                boast to me in private of your power to ruin me?”), “you” is clearly Falkland; but
                in the kind of textually specific knowledge demanded of it, “you” is asked to behave
                more like a reader. We might say more precisely that this passage’s ideal addressee
                is a Falkland who could somehow have read a transcript of his own conversations with
                Caleb: a kind of Falkland-reader hybrid. The fleeting materialization of the past as
                a text (in the form of Caleb’s letter) both reflects this fantasy and marks its
                impossibility.</p>
                  <p>When Caleb turns from Falkland to Forester and then to Falkland’s servants, his
                entreaties confuse characters and readers in similar ways: “I will never believe
                that a man conscious of innocence, cannot make other men perceive that he has that
                thought. Do not you feel that my whole heart tells me, I am not guilty of what is
                imputed to me?” (165). A fit of magical thinking in its immediate context, the
                condition of mental transparency Caleb presumes here is also familiar as the signal
                effect of reading a psychological novel—the form that Godwin would later call a
                “metaphysical dissecting knife” for “tracing and laying bare” “the private and
                internal operations of the mind” (“Preface” 350). Here, in other words, Caleb makes
                the same category error, treating his actual listeners like the readers of his
                narrative and making his readers feel like a more proximate audience. Like his
                demand that Falkland come to his aid and “be [his] evidence,” his plea to the
                servants makes an oblique exhortation to those who have been reading his mind all
                along: “If you believe, if you see, if you know that I am innocent, speak for me”
                (167). These repeated appeals, then, implicitly cast the reader in the uncomfortable
                role of a mute witness, bearing the exact testimony that Caleb requires to prove his
                innocence.</p>
                  <p>Rather than emerging from a deep insight into a character’s motivations or a sense of
                elective affinity with a character’s interests, complicity arises here as a
                contingent effect of the felt coincidence between a character’s position and a
                reader’s. In this case, the passage is strongly focalized on Caleb and our loyalties
                are unmistakably on his side. At the same time, the hearing brings about a
                structural alignment between Falkland and the reader by confounding Falkland’s
                memory with the reader’s familiarity with the narrative past. More an effect of
                circumstance than fellow-feeling, complicity may therefore draw us into
                uncomfortable relations with those we might prefer to disavow. Blending intimacy and
                recoil, it diverges from the forms of characterological engagement placed under the
                more familiar rubric of identification. If we instinctively identify with Caleb’s
                sense of injury in this scene, our inevitable silence in the face of his challenges
                draws us close to Falkland’s lie. We are made to feel this proximity in the space of
                the dramatic pause that follows Caleb’s questions, when Falkland’s refusal to
                respond blends momentarily into our own agitated silence: “Mr Falkland returned no
                immediate answer to my interrogations. Mr Forester turned to him, and said, Well,
                sir, what is your reply to this challenge of your servant?” (164).</p>
                  <p>In their explicit juridical setting and the repeated staging of such “turns,” these
                scenes in fact literalize the trope of apostrophe, defined by Quintilian as “turning
                the discourse [away] from the judge” (2:238). Quintilian generally advises against
                such deflections, “it being natural to speak to those chiefly, whom we wish to have
                our cause at heart” (2:207). When Caleb turns away from Forester to address
                Falkland, or from Falkland to the servants, he makes an “unnatural” appeal to those
                without the power to decide. Caleb’s oblique addresses to the reader are more
                unnatural still since they violate the circuit of narrative communication itself. If
                narrative form, like the juridical scene, erects a rigorous separation between
                participants and bystanders, characters and readers, apostrophe refuses to recognize
                that distinction.</p>
                  <p>Jonathan Culler defines apostrophe as a quintessentially lyric form: “[O]ne might be
                justified in taking apostrophe as the figure of all that is most radical,
                embarrassing, pretentious, and mystificatory in the lyric, even seeking to identify
                apostrophe with lyric itself” (60). But apostrophe turns out to be everywhere in
                this novel, not only in exchanges like the ones we’ve just examined, but in the
                syntax of its regular narration. Caleb’s explicit invocations rarely address the
                actual reader; instead, they call upon absent characters: Thomas, Collins, and,
                especially toward the end, Falkland. In one striking case, the apostrophe—the single
                imperative “Tremble!”—is even centered and set off from the rest of the paragraph like a poetic quotation (291). The device is so pervasive in the closing pages of
                the novel that Falkland briefly becomes the novel’s implied audience. The last three
                paragraphs all address Falkland directly, culminating in the novel’s final lines: “I
                will finish [these memoirs] that thy story may be fully understood; and that, if
                those errors of thy life be known which thou so ardently desiredst to conceal, the
                world may at least not hear and repeat a half-told and mangled tale” (303). Folding
                together the local and the general second person, these sentences inscribe the
                uncomfortable intimacies of the trial into the novel’s rhetorical scene.</p>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>Culler opposes apostrophe and narrative on the grounds that apostrophe substitutes
                the present of discourse—“the special temporality which is the set of all moments at
                which writing can say ‘now’”—for the temporal sequence of narrative (66). Where
                narrative is the representation of an event, apostrophe aspires to become one. What
                to make of Godwin’s deployment of this paradigmatic lyric form and my own recourse
                to lyric theory to explain what it feels like to read this novel of ideas?
                Complicity seems to arise precisely from a condition of generic incoherence, a kind
                of interference between the standard scripts of narrative and lyric utterance. For,
                even as Godwin evokes this lyric temporality, he also doubles down on the pressure
                of narrative sequence, the strong form of emplotment he would later mythologize in
                claiming to have written the novel backwards. The intimate present that these scenes
                construct is thereby always yoked, through plot’s inexorable logic of cause and
                effect, to a cascade of potentially devastating consequences. If, as another
                canonical account would have it, poetry is overheard, complicity names the
                conditions under which the experience of lyric overhearing becomes difficult to
                bear.</p>
                  <p>Like any narrative, Godwin’s novel marks the difference between now and then, this
                world and that one, story and discourse. It also seeks to collapse that distance:
                with an oppressive atmosphere that softens the boundary between a text’s inside and
                outside and with slant apostrophes that strive to make a demand of you, here and
                now. Complicity turns the process of reception into an experience of responsibility
                that can neither be refused nor fully discharged. If that demand must always issue
                in a kind of failure, frustration also becomes the condition of its persistence—a
                persistence that readers like Hazlitt and Lockhart register when they describe the
                novel’s way of sticking around as a ringing in the ears or a bad dream that doesn’t
                let you go. The novel finally inverts the moral error that Godwin suggests we commit
                in conceiving of ourselves as righteous and rights-bearing subjects. If, in life, we
                all too often feel autonomous when we are vehicles of harm, as readers, we sometimes
                feel strangely responsible precisely when or because we can do nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>Taking shape in the subtle shifts of address between possible audiences and in the
                oscillation between compelled identification and reactive disidentification that
                such appeals produce, the effects I am describing exploit the very ambiguity and
                imprecision that has long exercised theorists of reading about their object of
                study. For several decades now, the projects of narrative theory, reader response
                theory, the history of the book, and the history of reading have multiplied
                reader-avatars at various degrees of regress and inference from the text, usually in
                order to single out one in particular as worthy of critical attention: narratees,
                implied readers, ideal readers, “the reader,” bad readers, empirical readers, the
                reading public. Godwin’s text is just as relentless in proliferating potential
                readers, from the radical openness of the appeal to futurity at the beginning
                (Caleb’s “faint idea” of a “posterity” that might believe him [3]) to the overdetermined
                address to Falkland at the end. And it is especially attentive to the strange
                pressure that these readers may exert on one another. Just as Caleb leaves a letter
                for Falkland such that “the way in which it offered itself to his attention, should
                suggest to him the idea that it had possibly passed through my hands” (113),
                Godwin’s later retrospective on the novel presents the anecdote of a friend who read
                it “in a few hours” before bed, a figure who ambiguously serves as both model and
                negative example for other readers (“Preface” 352). Reading, thus construed, opens
                up a social relation—not only in the forms of sociality embodied by empirical
                reading publics, but in the felt connections between these never-quite-identical
                recipients. Complicity, of course, is not the only form that that relation might
                take; we can think of straightforwardly attractive and aversive relations like
                emulation and rejection as strong alternatives. But as a particularly intense and
                ambivalent one, it helps open the full range of these possibilities to view. It
                reminds us of the ways we always read as, against, and through one another.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in a moment when reading seems to present itself as a series of
                dilemmas—surface or depth? paranoid or reparative? critical or
                uncritical?—complicity presents a structure of aesthetic response strikingly defined
                by its refusal to choose between those alternatives. It combines, as we have seen,
                absorption with discomfort, surrender with recoil, identification with
                disidentification. Between these theoretical poles lies a realm of experience that
                points toward something like what Godwin calls “politics”—the work, that is, of
                putting a principle of morality into practice. That is the threshold where Godwin’s
                fiction means to leave us.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This “Introduction” offers a brief historical and
                theoretical background for the essay contributions that follow. It gives an
                editorial rationale for why we and these essays' authors aim to seek different ways
                of reading that merge or overlap questions of aesthetic form, social life, and
                affective disposition. We begin with the reminder that the imaginative precincts
                within which such questions might be raised were always and already inseparable for
                Romantic writers: in the Romantic poetics outlined here, feeling is not strictly
                private. We then provide summaries of the four essays and afterword, placing
                emphasis on the authors' various attention to sociable affects, including disgust,
                complicity, guilt, and hope.</p>

               <note place="foot" resp="author"> We would like to thank the terrific collective of participants in a double-seminar panel on “Poetry and Public Feelings” held at the 2018 American Comparative Literature Association conference at UCLA: the wide-ranging and experimental thoughts shared there, on poetry, politics, and the passions, inspired us to put this special issue together. We are particularly grateful to this issue’s essay contributors (each of whom presented papers at that seminar), whose patience and generosity of thought helped to shape the issue and our rationale for it. We thank Nancy Yousef for joining us, and for her guidance and humor throughout the editing process. Our special thanks too to the general editors of Romantic Circles Praxis Series. Tristram would like to recognize Samantha Botz (PhD, Northwestern) as a valued interlocutor on ideas about collective feeling in the Romantic century. Finally, we want to recognize here the recent loss of Lauren Berlant: without their work this project would be unimaginable.</note>

                  <p>The quotations above from Wordsworth, Blake, and Barbauld offer three different takes
                on the sharedness of feeling: the surprise of joy and of the disappointment that
                there is no one with whom to share it; the presumed inevitability of sharing someone
                else’s sorrow just from the sight of their tears; and the warning that belonging to
                a nation means partaking of its guilt and pain. As distinct as these passages are,
                Wordsworth’s question “Oh! with whom” could be asked in all three poems. The
                fellow-feeling that Blake may seem to be describing as natural was neither
                inevitable nor guaranteed to all persons, and as Steven Goldsmith has suggested, we
                might read the rhetorical questions in <title level="a">On Anothers Sorrow</title> literally to reveal
                Blake’s despair about a hypocritical or calculated kind of sympathy and
                sentimentalism (191). What is more, James Chandler’s account of the economic
                language at work in Blake’s poetics of feeling suggests that “share” as a noun here
                recalls an affective economy in which emotion is not only calculable but also
                complicit: “Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody poor” (27).
                Barbauld’s lines too might, at first glance, seem certain about who is sharing
                feeling, but in addressing the British public, she imagines a dispersed, communal
                guilt and woe that belongs to everyone and no one at once.</p>
                  <p>In this special issue, we have assembled a collection of essays that take a closer
                look at how collective feeling—or “feeling together,” as Nancy Yousef puts it in her
                “Afterword”—takes poetic form in Romantic writing. How is a particular collective, a
                “public,” congealed or construed through the stances and textures of imaginative
                writing? And why should we specify that feeling is “public” at all, if (as we
                believe) all feeling is relational? The individualization or privatization of
                feeling, like the desire for its calculability, is a kind of open question for
                Romantic-era writers. “Publics are queer creatures,” writes Michael Warner: “You
                cannot point to them, count them, or look them in the eye. You also cannot easily
                avoid them. They have become an almost natural feature of the social landscape, like
                pavement” (7). The apparently simple fact of sharing feeling, then—with another
                person or with an entire nation—subjects both the feeling and the feeler to a shaky
                dispersion; where does feeling end if it is public? Turning to share feeling’s
                transport and finding the question “Oh! with whom,” might capture, in one way, the
                questions of public feeling that the essays in this collection seek to address. With
                whom is feeling shared, as it becomes evident that it exceeds the individual?
                Perhaps we should ask, then, not how feelings become public, but how feelings create
                publics, or how publics already vibrate with feeling. What does it feel like to be
                (or not to be) attached to a country or community, to have (or not to have)
                membership or citizenship, in ways that one can neither contain nor control?</p>
                  <p>This volume turns to Romanticism, as a historical and a literary formation, to
                consider how public feelings operate and circulate through the language of poetry.
                How does poetry mediate the politics and sociality of feeling? How can poetry
                register not just the solitary, recollected overflow of powerful feeling, but also a
                communal, complicit, or contagious one? Along with our contributors, we would like
                to pose the question here: how are feelings implicated in and around poetry—and how
                does poetry interfere in, perpetuate, or rearticulate feelings circulated in zones
                of sociality loosely denoted as public? Intervening variously in poetics, affect
                theory, and critical social theory, the contributors to this volume examine literary
                scenes in order to assert that feeling is part of a structured world—in other words,
                that public feeling is what builds and unravels the conflicted experience of
                collective life.</p>
                  <p>We have gathered this selection of essays in order to bring together in new
                configurations the study of poetics, affect, and politics for the field of
                Romanticism. In response to Lauren Berlant’s suggestion that “public spheres are
                affect worlds at least as much as they are effects of rationality and
                rationalization” (450), the contributors collectively pursue the question of how
                poetry and poetic form might provide a different kind of understanding of the
                formation of publics and counter-publics that compete for historical visibility. In
                a critical tradition that has already—as Mary Favret has shown—increasingly revealed
                “the intractably social and material bases for romantic esthetics and the poets’ deep awareness of this dependency” (<title level="a">Study
                of Affect and Romanticism,</title> 1163), we aim here to pursue more explicitly questions
                of social and political urgency that emerge in an unfolding historical present. Just
                like any other domain of culture, Romantic poetry is rife or riven with feeling. But how might we recognize its feelings as tuned
                in to the political or the communal, or as public?</p>
                  <p>In focusing on “public feeling,” we take a cue from the recent work in affect theory
                by Ann Cvetkovitch and Lauren Berlant (members of the Public Feelings project from
                the early 2000s on), as well as that of Jennifer Nash, Sara Ahmed, Sianne Ngai, and
                Eve Sedgwick. These scholars draw on feminist and queer studies to articulate the
                intricacies and histories of social and political feeling and the ways in which
                feeling might produce new forms of sociality. Indeed, as Nash has written, pointing
                to, among others, the work of poets June Jordan and Audre Lorde (the latter of whom
                Eric Lindstrom’s essay in this volume takes up), “the labor of constructing
                political communities around ‘public feelings’ and ‘communal affect’ has been a
                black feminist investment for decades” (20). But “public feeling” could describe
                sensibilities plainly active in the Romantic era, as well. In investigating what she
                describes as the “unfinished business of sentimentality,” Berlant reminds us that
                the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were crucial moments for understanding the
                origins of the modern interlacing of politics and feeling. Writing about
                contemporary political feeling, Cvetkovich links her account of depression as a
                public feeling to Romantic-era debates about slavery and abolition, reminding us
                that we must understand sentimental, abolitionist modes of representation, in order
                to understand “contemporary human rights discourses that still traffic in the
                generation of affect through representations that aim to touch their audiences” (9).
                In his recent discussion of affect, “mood,” and the Black romantic subject, Bakary
                Diaby argues that historicity itself is “a Romantic mood that still sets the terms
                by which we discuss racial subjection in the present” (121). Romanticism, it seems,
                describes the beginning of an affective political moment in which we are still
                immersed.</p>
                  <p>The phrase “public feeling” also recalls the preoccupation in eighteenth-century
                British moral philosophy with describing and prescribing the fellow-ness of feeling.
                The vast and excellent scholarship in the last thirty or so years on the history of
                sympathy and sensibility by—among others—James Chandler, Julie Ellison, Lynn Festa,
                Steven Goldsmith, Thomas Pfau, Adela Pinch, Amit Rai, and Nancy Yousef, has
                demonstrated how deep the interest in, and anxiety about, fellow-feeling ran. What
                bothered David Hume and Adam Smith, Pfau explains, was that “something as ostensibly
                private and inward as a feeling should be imbued with so much social energy” (4). In
                other words, sympathy acts, as Pinch puts it, as a reminder that “one’s feelings may
                really be someone else’s” (7). In Ellison’s view, the literature of sensibility
                “exposes a complicated awareness of the human costs of national and imperial
                economies, as well as the knowledge that sensibility itself is a privilege.
                Sensibility is the <emph>admitted</emph> connection
                between speculation, mood, and power” (7). Festa also situates discussions of
                sympathy and sentimentality in the context of empire, arguing that “by governing the
                circulation of feeling among subjects and objects, sentimentality helps to define
                who will be acknowledged as human” (3). More recently, Yousef has taught us to
                “soften the hard opposing edges of solitary inwardness and interpersonal exposure”
                and suspend the ethical and epistemic questions that so often arise about sympathy
                by shifting terms to “intimacy” (4). In her afterword to this collection, Yousef
                also suggests a rearrangement of terms, replacing “public feeling” with an expansive
                sense of “complicity” that exceeds its more typical connotations of guilt and
                responsibility.</p>
                  <p>If historians have argued that a new kind of national identity and sympathy took hold
                during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England, what feelings did
                that newly imagined community elicit, rely upon, and silence?<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Linda Colley’s <title level="m">Britons: Forging the Nation
                                1707–1837.</title>
                     </note> What were the feelings that
                surrounded, propelled, and resisted the development of industrialization,
                colonialism, war, and slavery? These are questions that were asked directly and
                urgently at the time. Barbauld, for example, in her anonymous anti-war pamphlet from
                1793, <title level="m">Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation,</title> asks “how far
                as individuals are we really answerable for the guilt of national sins?”
                (<title level="m">Selected Poetry and Prose</title>, 315). As the
                essays in this volume by Anastasia Eccles and Amelia Worsley both emphasize, the
                thinking in the 1790s and early years of the nineteenth century about government,
                power, violence, and citizenship led to a growing awareness and self-consciousness
                about widespread complicity. The literatures of sentiment, Ellison writes, serve “as
                indices of the pain caused by political arrangements from which artists and
                intellectuals knowingly benefited but at the same time could not control” (7). The
                idea of communal feeling was perhaps described most commonly at the time through the
                word “general”; it is Barbauld again who wrote that “the whole time of war ought to
                be a time of <emph>general mourning</emph>, a mourning in the heart, a
                mourning much more sincere than on the death of one of those princes whose cursed
                ambition is often the sole cause of war” (<title level="m">Civic Sermons</title> 19).
                Anticipating Percy Shelley’s diagnoses of the politics of mourning, Barbauld’s
                demand for general mourning and Shelley’s calls for “universal grief” at “national
                calamity” (379) both work reactively, pushing back against the emotional demands of
                the state, demands that are often “curiously announced from outside and on high”
                (Favret, <title level="m">The General Fast</title> 130).</p>
                  <p>We are certainly accustomed to thinking of poetry as both representing and producing
                powerful feeling, but we have perhaps given less attention to how a poetics might
                produce or reveal important political feelings in the reader. This is familiar
                territory in the study of abolitionist literature, carefully calculated to elicit
                the reader’s delicate sympathies. But as Worsley’s essay reminds us, the gap between
                Romanticism and abolitionist literature has in some ways been wider than it needs to
                be, part of a broader aesthetic vilification of “public poetry.” We think there is
                still more work to be done on how poetic figure and form alter our conception of the
                feelings that both compose and decompose the individual in its historical forms. How
                does imaginative literature study the feelings that mark both our alienation from
                others and our attachments? How does poetry register not individual emotion but
                emergent political formations of indifference or care, such as the urban repulsion
                tracked here by Samalin between Wordsworth’s poetry and the sociology that emerged
                across the nineteenth century? How might narratives of this kind prompt a different
                engagement between Romantic poetics and contemporary expressions of social
                inextricability, such as that described by Nash in her recent account of “black
                feminist love-politics” (14)?</p>
                  <p>Although it is not a term of art used by the contributors themselves, the rubric of
                “reading practices” offers a ground for thinking together the affective,
                epistemological, and sociological valences that animate these essays. For instance,
                the idea of a feeling of readerly “complicity” that both Eccles and Worsley develop
                becomes, in their respective essays, an occasion for theorizing the relation between
                the narrative theme of guilt and the affective experience of standing idly by, both
                modeled for, and produced in, the reader. Eccles identifies the trope of apostrophe
                in Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794) as a stylistic means for
                focusing on the power of highly localized, emotionally-fraught linguistic events in
                forming a public. Worsley examines how Southey’s use of the ballad form subtly
                confronts the reader with the interaction among personae that spring into life
                through the iterative structure of the ballad, forcing readers to feel their desire
                to be an observer to suffering.<note place="foot" resp="author"> This observation draws on especially generative scholarship on the “medium” of the ballad, by Maureen McLane and Celeste Langan.</note>
                In both these essays, formal features derived from poetic and narrative theory are
                recast as ethically-charged stances. Poetry is considered not simply as a collection
                of historically shifting genre forms, but more emphatically—in the poetics of knowledge that emerge across genres—as
                a set of imaginative protocols for understanding how publics take shape through
                intimate social and psychic relations.<note place="foot" resp="author"> We borrow the term “poetics of knowledge” from Jacques Rancière.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>One crucial requisite for our interest in “public feeling,” then, following Berlant’s
                observation about public spheres as affect worlds, is that we take the term poetry
                to mean something quite expansive, something like the aesthetic flexibility of form
                in a given corner of communicative or emotional life. Zachary Samalin’s essay adopts
                a genealogical method, assembling poetic and sociological scenes from Wordsworth to
                Weber, that allows him to trace the affective disposition of disgust or revulsion in
                city life across new formalizations of social theory in the nineteenth century.
                Representations of the urban crowd, argues Samalin, increasingly teach analysts of
                nineteenth-century social form to understand the fact of bodily proximity and the
                welter of unwelcome sensory stimuli through the “unwanted feeling” of disgust. This
                disgust is then quietly converted, in mid-century texts by Engels and Mayhew, into
                the more abstracted feeling of alienation. By the end of the nineteenth century,
                when Durkheim set out to fix the outlines of the study of society on scientific
                principles, it is utterly forgotten that a sublimated feeling of disgust is the
                basis for neutral observation of other humans, now fully alienated from the analyst:
                hence Durkheim’s disavowal of the relevance of feeling anything at all while
                analyzing society. In Samalin’s vivid account, we can see how Wordsworth’s visceral
                response to the sights, sounds, and smells of the city in Book 7 of the <title level="m">Prelude</title> (1850)—the “funhouse mayhem” of Bartholomew
                Fair—prefigures an entire way of thinking about urban disaffection, in preparation
                for its eventual codification as the prerequisite for a science of society. But it
                is not until we know that observational neutrality is fashioned from intense
                repulsion that we can recognize this as a kind of paradox. By reading the “poetics”
                of sociology, Samalin demonstrates that affective norms take shape historically, and
                more specifically, that social imaginaries have what he calls an “emotional
                grammar.”</p>
                  <p>Following Samalin’s genealogical sweep, we turn to the pair of essays already
                described, each of which pursues closer-textured literary readings with broad
                implications for the study of reading practices and Romantic genres. While Anastasia
                Eccles tackles a narrative politics embedded in the novel’s care for how the reader
                might read herself into (and out of) the novelistic scene, Amelia Worsley addresses
                a similarly choreographed situation in narrative poetry that guides the
                identificatory options available through its mediated form and structure of address.
                Interestingly, as noted above, both essays hinge on the invitation to a readerly
                sense of complicity. Eccles’s <title level="a">Feeling Complicit in William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                     </title> does this while carrying out a striking
                re-evaluation of this canonical work, using an affectively attuned formalism.
                Keeping in mind Godwin’s philosophical accounts of agency and causation, Eccles
                finds in the novel’s plot an attention to “complicity,” or an unwilled, precarious
                state of “interdependence” that, Eccles argues alongside Godwin, should constitute
                mutual responsibility in any given social formation. Building her readings of
                Godwin’s fiction (and its reception) through perceptive recourse to his political
                theory, Eccles makes the compelling suggestion that fiction—even while offering, in
                this case, a page-turning Gothic detective novel—can serve as an almost didactic
                technology for inducing an awareness of shared damage everywhere enacted, but rarely
                acknowledged, in the ordinary practices of everyday life. Eccles brings to light
                several specific devices the novel uses to angle in on the many ways of relating to
                one’s own practice of reading (e.g., the novelistic use of apostrophe). Like
                Samalin’s “unwanted feeling,” the felt complicity both dramatized in, and passed
                along by, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794) is partly defined as social
                in the sense of “atmospheric,” or unwilled. Yet its inevitability can equally be, as
                Eccles points out in closing, a necessary, perhaps even invigorating reminder of
                “the ways we always read as, against, and through one another.”</p>
                  <p>As in Samalin’s account of a network of affective relations submerged in a poetics of
                sociology, Eccles makes her case by suggesting that it is the poetics latent in
                Godwin’s prose—those “forms of lyric address that confuse guilty characters and
                eavesdropping readers”—that gives the novel’s expressions both their local ambiguity
                and their potential durability in the public feeling of complicity. From sociology
                and narrative, we proceed in Worsley’s and Lindstrom’s essays to several modes more
                familiar to scholars of Romantic poetry: the ballad, the abolitionist poem, and the
                “defense” of poetry. In <title level="a">Abolitionist Publics,</title> Worsley looks at readerly complicity
                in the context of the preeminently public genre of the abolitionist poem, which she
                suggests has been too often derogated in aesthetic terms, precisely on the basis of
                its aspirations to sway the public on a live question in political debate. Using one
                example of abolitionist poetry’s “shadow canon” as a case study, Robert Southey’s
                1799 ballad <title level="a">The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade,</title> Worsley shows how—in
                ugly tension with the poem’s “abhorrent” thematic transferal of suffering from Black
                bodies to white consciences—the poem’s form seeks to create an abolitionist public.
                Long read as a minor work—a failed attempt to translate the archaic mariner of
                Coleridge’s 1798 <title level="a">Rime,</title> as a notoriously nebulous allegory of guilt, into a
                present-day sailor and explicit participant in Britain’s slavery economy—Southey’s
                ballad becomes, for Worsley, a place to examine the formation and perception of
                ethical norms regarding the politics of enslaved labor. Reading a precise
                choreography of voices in the poem—both as it repurposes the ballad as “medium,” and
                as it diagrams guilt between confessor, captain, minister, and reader—Worsley reveals
                an unexpected complexity in the structures of liberal sympathy, disidentification,
                and misrecognition experienced by the reader in traversing the poem’s staged “space
                of collective consciousness.” Refusing merely to dramatize the remorse of a sailor
                coerced into murder and confirm the sentimental reader’s innocence, the poem instead
                rewrites sympathy and individual guilt as a pervasive and banalized chain of
                complicity: the reader can neither “sympathize with” nor “condemn” the poem’s actors
                without mimicking the sailor’s desire for self-exculpation. Thus, even as it
                explicitly aims to broadcast abolitionism with a pious call to prayer, Worsley
                unearths how the poem also indicates that the slave trade is a “communal violence”
                that belongs as well to the counterpublic it calls into being.</p>
                  <p>Shifting theoretical gears, Lindstrom’s essay builds around the climactic claims of
                two very different and yet, in this account, profoundly cognate essays: Audre
                Lorde’s <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury</title> (1984) and Percy Shelley’s <title level="a">A Defence of Poetry</title>
                (1821). In both, poetry becomes the stuff of everyday life and initiates the
                possibility of (a new) society, turning a claim for the ordinariness of aesthetic
                experience into “a fundamental argument about the necessity of poetry.” This
                “necessity” is expressed famously by Shelley as a kind of “unacknowledged”
                legislation, and arrestingly by Lorde as “the skeleton architecture of our lives.”
                Lindstrom teases out the contrast between Lorde and Shelley in a series of readings
                that draws directly on the affect theories of Lauren Berlant, Kathleen Stewart, and
                others. In pursuing unforeseen convergences between Lorde and Shelley, arguably one
                of the “white fathers” alluded to in her essay <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury,</title> his essay
                creatively locates a “lateral agency” in Shelley’s thought, which highlights not the
                negative effects of Shelley’s “dispersive poetics” but rather a “collective
                experiential promise.” This allows us to glimpse how, read with Lorde, something
                quite different emerges from Shelley’s thought. Lindstrom contrasts Shelley’s
                lightning-like visions with what Lorde calls that “quality of light” that
                characterizes the collective she has in mind, now emphatically situated and
                embodied: “<emph>For women</emph>, then, poetry is not a luxury” (37);
                indeed, Lorde’s poet is aligned with “the black mothers in each of us,” an “us”
                meant to disable the universalization of experience. Lindstrom’s essay thus proposes
                that there is much to learn when Lorde is read “into and with” Shelley: for Lorde’s
                conception of poetry as “the distillation of experience” (39) builds its shared,
                ordinary feelings from something like Shelley’s inchoate futurity, only now in a
                manner attuned to the practical, embodied necessities of emotional life, where
                affective relations like anger, fear, or love are imagined through a “felt and
                embedded, not mirroring, relationship.”</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Nancy Yousef’s “Afterword” concludes the series by offering a new lens for
                looking at the issue’s themes, while situating these themes and their treatment as
                pregnantly “symptomatic of our moment.” Articulating an unstated premise of what the
                contributors hold in common, Yousef opens by suggesting a “redundancy” in the phrase
                “public feeling,” insofar as feeling takes place in expression as an ongoing “call
                upon us” (in the words of Stanley Cavell). The notion of private feeling is then
                revealed as a subset of the social: that is, what we think of as private feeling is
                a learned etiquette of tacit legibility, or of open concealment, that we have
                chances to notice or let be. Taking up several lines from Godwin, which Eccles
                examines in her essay on readerly complicity, Yousef pursues and expands the idea of
                shared feeling across all four essays, now as a “more capacious” complicity, one
                that will “require new ways of speaking about agency” if it wants to redefine
                “public” so as to span “the vast extent of our co-implication with one another.” As
                Yousef has it, the essays together seek out the gradations of reception and response
                in the formation of expressive publics—fine lines to which romantic writing
                regularly returns us, in the many and various versions of what Anne-Lise François
                has memorably called “recessive action” (1). In pointing to the contributors’
                collective understanding of close reading as a practice of shared life, Yousef
                argues that it is through the essays’ “renewed commitment” to reading that
                complicity earns the expansive redefinition it receives here.</p>
                  <p>Such complicity would take many forms, not all negative. In being “<emph>Surprised</emph> by joy,” Wordsworth’s narrator has in a sense already “shared” the feeling which comes over him. In her powerful overview of the issue, Yousef
                reminds us that the essays in this collection “all address the imbrication of
                aesthetic form and emotions,” in order to find “points of ethical inflection.” While
                differing significantly in their methods, each contributor addresses the formal
                dimension of feeling that structures aesthetic production, at least implicitly
                imagining the intimate circumstances required for social identification and
                recognition. Their shared point of departure might be said to match what Judith
                Butler calls our impressionability, a way of imagining subject formation taking
                place through unwilled publics, through ethical call and expressive response: more
                than a kind of conduct, the ethical becomes “a way of understanding the relational
                framework within which sense, action, and speech become possible” (12). To return to
                Cavell, and to Yousef’s insightful joining of the notion of “public feeling” with
                the supposed problem of private language, we might say that the work we gather here
                seeks not merely to insist on revealing that what seems private is really public, as
                though that were the point, but also to redefine “public” as the collective task of
                putting something together, of composition: “It is little help in this work . . . to
                take reassurance from the supposed fact…that language <emph>is</emph>
                public, that it is shared. This prompts us to avoid seeking sociably to provide help
                and example sufficient to <emph>make</emph> it public, to see it shared”
                (185). Perhaps it is poetry, in the ordinary sense—Lorde’s “quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives” (36)—that makes
                feeling together possible.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">In prose both similar to and crucially different from the Romantic celebration of
                    human wholeness, throughout the
                    collection <title level="m">Sister
                        Outsider</title> (1984) the
                    Black lesbian feminist poet Audre Lorde pursues an “impulse toward wholeness” to
                    repair the divide between feeling and knowledge.
                    For Lorde’s poetry is an
                    urgent resource and practice of imaginative experience rescued from oppression, not
                    defined by its formal features, which she calls “sterile word play.” This conviction
                    aligns Lorde’s poetics with Percy
                    Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of
                        Poetry</title> (1821). This
                    essay considers Shelley not only "juxtapolitically" with Lorde, but in a common
                    imaginary space of networks of feeling and imagery with contemporary theorists of
                    public feeling including Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart, to establish a
                    critical idiom for the world of public feeling and world-making. I show how
                    the “harsh light of
                    scrutiny” valued by Lorde resonates with Shelley’s critical reassessment of the
                    poetic imagination set in opposition to calculative enlightenment reason. Yet I also
                    argue that Lorde’s “quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives” helps us to
                    make the difficult, necessary intervention into Shelley’s unresolved problematic —
                    both theoretical and lived — concerning the relation of love to fear.</p>

                  <p>Throughout her essay and speech collection, <title level="m">Sister Outsider</title>
                (1984), Audre Lorde, Black lesbian feminist poet, pursues–both by style and
                argument–an “impulse toward wholeness” to repair the divide between feeling and
                knowledge (8).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Unless noted, all page references to Lorde’s writing are from <title level="m">Sister Outsider</title>.</note> In doing so,
                Lorde’s poetic theory seeks new forms of understanding that “begin [ . . . ] to make
                knowledge available for use” (109). Lorde’s “use” in essays, such as <title level="a">Uses of the
                Erotic,</title> is deeply experiential (53–9): at once intimately personal, as well as
                communal and collective. Lorde’s measures of usefulness are “human need” and “the
                psychic and emotional components of that need” (55). Her sense of the necessary is
                not reducible to utilitarian calculus, as the turn toward erotic life as a resource
                might already suggest. In its fundamental orientation to value, her theoretical work
                scrutinizes and promotes human flourishing in all its possible forms, starting from
                her own situated being: opposing a Black queer woman’s life, in particular, to
                surplus and its logic of extraction. Kevin Quashie can thus write in <title level="m">Black Aliveness</title> of Lorde’s “belief that a queer black
                mother’s body can thus be enough to conceptualize what it is to know” (11). Lorde
                thereby articulates a profoundly anti-capitalist mode of being, production, and
                critical self-examination.</p>
                  <p>As she made clear in a 1979 interview with Adrienne Rich, Lorde self-identified as a
                writer who thinks in poems (83). This means that in her poems thought is
                inextricable from feeling and its expressive formalization. Sensuous and intuitive
                experience matter to her powers of ideation. We can begin to map Lorde’s
                philosophical poetics using this critical creative habitus. But Lorde also means
                more simply, if opaquely, that in her youth she thought only in poems. In the long
                period of her creative life before she began teaching and writing prose in the
                1970s, she felt poetry was her sole means of effective communication. Not just her
                poetry, but also her remarkably rich and direct prose, read as if they were
                recurrently composed in the first moment of breaking free of a silence.</p>
                  <p>In what follows I want to suggest a surprising convergence between Lorde and Percy
                Bysshe Shelley. Lorde’s conviction that poetry is an urgent resource and practice of
                imaginative experience rescued from the oppressions of silence—and a shared
                philosophy that defines poetry not by its formal features, which she calls “sterile
                word play”—resembles the argument Shelley makes in <title level="m">A Defence of
                    Poetry</title> (1821). In particular, there is a resonance between Lorde’s poetics
                and Shelley’s view of the relation of knowledge to poetic imagination. Both Shelley
                and Lorde associate a rejection of the capitalist division of labor with a critique
                of the operations of managerial reason, from a vantage that celebrates affect,
                creation, and feeling.</p>
                  <p>Shelley writes: “We want the creative faculty to imagine that which we know; we want
                the generous impulse to act that which imagine; we want the poetry of life: our
                calculations have outrun conception; we have eaten more than we can digest”
                    (530).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Quotations from Percy Shelley are taken from Reiman and Fraistat’s
                            Norton (second edition) of <title level="m">Shelley’s Selected Poetry
                                and Prose</title>. I cite this volume as <emph>SPP</emph>
                            only where context may not be evident.</note> We can see the
                affinity between Lorde and Shelley in this passage, which announces an
                anti-utilitarian call for poetry’s vital use in making knowledge imaginable and
                drawing it into the realm of available action. If Shelley speaks from a place of
                authority and privilege, marked also by his exile, Lorde responds to the Romantic
                poet’s identification of real “want” with creative capacities and writerly impulses
                that share in focused abundance the resources of sensibility. Yet if I find in
                Lorde’s arguments and language something that reminds me of Shelley, shutting my
                eyes to hear something like their recombinant voice, I also know it is impossible to
                over emphasize how much Lorde situates her knowledge within the living practice of
                her own specific identities. These “Shelleyan” sentences lose their meaning and
                power if we isolate them from Lorde’s self-definitions as a feminist, Black, queer,
                and mothering author and her assertions of how much these identities have been deep
                resources for her poetic work.</p>
                  <p>Lorde’s affinity with Shelley also constitutes an act of transformative change upon
                the Romantic tradition of “high level” theorizing performed especially by male poets
                and philosophers. Difference, in the essays of <title level="m">Sister
                    Outsider</title>, is construed as “a dynamic human force” and “a creative force
                toward change” (45, 70). Indeed, difference provides the ground of the
                unacknowledged power that echoes back perhaps most undeniably from Lorde to Shelley
                (53). This is not a structural paradox, nor just an irony that follows from the
                exclusionary whiteness of “radical” authors in the Romantic canon, but a major event
                at the living border of the invaginated growth and unfolding of the non-linear,
                achronological history that most Romanticists would associate with a Shelleyan
                notion of poetry. No chapter in the linear history of ideas, this history is written
                and made legible in the flashes where Lorde and Shelley make anti-separatist allies;
                and in which Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> depends upon the meanings of
                <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury,</title> as much as the other way around. My largest and
                longest-unfolding aim in this essay will therefore not only be to show how both
                poets understand expressive necessity in their championing of poetry; but more
                crucially, I want to voice a shift from poetic continuity to poetic difference (and
                ultimately gesture at the possibility of a commons-in-difference), arguing that
                Lorde’s corrective to Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> is a necessary
                imaginative act. Despite its constitutional commitment to openness, Shelley’s role
                of the legislator poet risks being either exclusionary or falsely universal in its
                assumed, not situated, identity. An encounter with Lorde’s writing makes possible
                what speech-act theorists call “felicity conditions,” in which the essential
                contribution of Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title>, its poetics of radical
                futurity for which a context does not yet exist outside the capacity of creative
                acts, can be more fully examined and actually lived in the emergent present.</p>
                  <p>Why isn’t Lorde’s poetic theory more often and energetically taken up in critical
                interchange with Shelley—at least by Romanticists interested in contemporary poetry
                and poetics? It might be tempting, for example, to read Lorde’s 1977 essay, <title level="a">Poetry
                is Not a Luxury,</title> as a vital expansion of Shelley’s voice and position in <title level="m">A Defence</title> into feminist and non-European lived
                    experiences.<note place="foot" resp="author">Benjamin Mangrum points back to the fact that the
                            essay’s original title was “Poems are Not Luxuries,” and that it was
                            written in Lorde’s first year of editorship of the feminist quarterly
                            journal <title level="j">Chrysalis</title> (337). Mangrum’s work is one
                            source of my emphasis on administered culture.</note> “For
                women,” Lorde writes, “poetry is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity of our
                existence” (37). Lorde’s gendered conditions of creative experience simultaneously
                offer a frame around the moment that inspires my urge to make a connection but also
                a strong critique of that urge, attesting to the ultimate arbiters of specificity
                and difference. Race, sexuality, and gender mark the terms of that difference,
                though gendered codes also have been invoked to code Shelley’s own reception as a
                poet who refuses divisions of thought and feeling, content and manner. Shaped by the
                dismissals of modern writers like Eliot and Auden, do we still view Shelley as a
                male narcissist and, despite his ideals, as anti-Womanist and a danger to women?
                Shelley himself was often charged by mid-century male critics with a blurring of
                feeling and thought that is recognizably gendered. He was judged, for instance,
                “incapable of effective reasoning and the intellectual control of his emotional
                outpourings” (Harding 210). Lorde, I’ll concede from the start, would have viewed
                all the male English Romantic poets as numbering among the “white fathers” who wish
                “to cover a desperate wish for imagination without insight,” to suppress rather than
                liberate the deep resources of discredited feeling, as her poem <title level="a">Coal</title> imagines the
                embodied diamonds of earth, not the diamonds of translucent white light.</p>
                  <p>Lorde’s writings compel a long-delayed confrontation with the normative subject’s own
                “desperate wish” to exercise the imagination (and know its prestige) without risking
                any real illumination in poetry. If Lorde crucially reaffirms Shelley’s case for the
                vital necessity of poetry beyond the frameworks of economic calculus and rhetorical
                or aesthetic ornament, that fundamental alliance, and the challenge of an
                anti-separatist praxis it requires and promotes, can offer Romantic Studies a tool
                to engage more critically and creatively with Shelley’s damaging failures of
                imagination. We do not need to decide which of Lorde’s Black, feminist, and queer
                positionalities are most needed as critical expansions of Shelley’s writing. Lorde’s
                emphases on defining her own terms for vital work, and in searching for modes of
                survival that constitute both a philosophy and a praxis, impart a necessary
                corrective to even the most fruitful of Shelley’s contingent or constitutive
                failures.</p>
                  <p>Having introduced Lorde here and provided the core rationale for my purpose to read
                her writings with Shelley’s, the first section of this essay returns to <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> in the context of the recent
                collaborative theorizing of public feelings by Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart,
                to establish a critical idiom for the world of public feeling and the world-making
                practices of Romantic poetics. The essay then argues that Lorde’s critique of the
                poetic tradition offers an insight Shelley shared but tried desperately to cover.
                Lorde’s examination of the very light by which we think, write, and love
                participates in the critical reassessment of poetic imagination set in opposition to
                calculative managerial reason. By the essay’s close I show how Lorde’s “quality of
                light by which we scrutinize our lives” helps us to intervene in Shelley’s
                unresolved problematic—both theoretical and lived—concerning the relation of love to
                the ugly major feelings of anger and fear. Shelley feared (his own) anger and
                treated it as a force to disavow not work through. Lorde shows us how to properly
                situate Shelley’s repressed negative feelings and how to make such unaddressed
                negative feelings a poetic and political resource. Lorde’s writing actualizes the
                more livable conditions of a just, transformative community of poetic creation and
                exchange, that is only inchoate in Shelley’s defense of poetry.</p>

                  <p>Lorde begins <title level="a">The Uses of the Erotic</title> with an urgently compelling sentence that makes
                no display of its allusion to Shelley’s most famous pronouncement at the end of the
                    <title level="m">Defence</title>: “There are many kinds of power, used and unused,
                acknowledged or otherwise” (53). The personal tone of acknowledgement here is
                reflective, not declarative and constitution-making. But Lorde’s mixing of these
                spheres of experience and voice, wrought by a feminist poet and thinker in the
                decades that gave the truth that the personal is the political, makes the point that
                many kinds of insight can be publicly transformative. Lorde’s scrutiny of what
                poetry means illuminates and shapes a heretofore “private” experience that is the
                basis of potential collective action: a poetry of life that is not an adjunct to
                living but of vital necessity. Brought forward into a future it welcomes but cannot
                anticipate or enclose, Shelley’s outsized conclusion in <title level="m">A Defence
                    of Poetry</title> that “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the World”
                enjoins difficult thinking about feeling and examining public feeling (535). Raymond
                Williams, originator of the influential concept of “structures of feeling,” locates
                in Shelley’s statement “the felt helplessness of a generation” at “the very moment
                when [poets] were being forced into practical exile” by the literary print culture
                of the novel and the economic structures of industrial capitalism (<title level="m">Culture</title>, 47).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Williams’s concept of “structures of feeling,”
                            see <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, 48–71.</note>
                Williams’s decisive page on Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> contains the judgment that “in the
                continuous pressure of living, the free play of genius found it increasingly
                difficult to consort with the free play of the market, and the difficulty was not
                solved, but cushioned, by idealization” (ibid.). Typically treated as aspirational
                hyperbole, Shelley’s famous sentence carries a counterfactual rhetoric by way of
                declarative grammar.<note place="foot" resp="author"> McLane writes on Shelley’s “counterfactual
                            imagination” in <title level="m">My Poets</title>, 226.</note>
                For Williams, this means “a description…, which, on the theory, ought only to be a
                fact to be accepted” but instead carries a collectively subjective and subjunctive
                mood of helplessness (ibid.).</p>
                  <p>As the rhetorical figure for a Romantic-era structure of feeling that with global
                capitalism and neoliberalism has only become more entrenched, Shelley’s exaggerated
                statement of poetic agency conveys and performs the mood of a collective
                helplessness, enacting the paradox of passive agency, and further implying that such

                            agency, see Ngai, 1.</note> Its poetic legislative powers are
                claimed to motivate the history of human consciousness found beneath or encountered
                laterally beside the mainstream account of historical action. In this regard,
                Shelley’s poetic deconstruction of the idea of liberal individual “consent” and his
                unfolding of a project of plural being anticipates and opens up to Fred Moten’s
                project in <title level="m">Black and Blur</title>, the first volume in the <title level="s">consent not to be a single being</title> trilogy. Moten’s work
                musically churns in the collective yet fragmented poetics of all that comes by way
                of <emph>con-sent</emph>—a move which fractures and glides, marks
                crossings with violence (the middle passage), but also is stationed in the mood of
                receptive passivity (“The truth for poets wants them to be available” [Glissant,
                45]).</p>
                  <p>Yet those legislative powers are eloquently expressive, most of all, of what Sianne
                Ngai positions as states of inaction (22). Where exactly should we locate the pivot
                of the effectuating/ helpless turn of counterfactual mood? Are poets a) everywhere
                the unacknowledged but effective agents behind larger values and institutions? Or do
                poets b) legislate, but not for the nation-state, rather, for the individual or for
                world spirit? The truth predicated is based not on a logical or arguably even
                historical analysis of linguistic agency, but upon an attitude the sentence models
                as an unacknowledged public feeling, or what Ngai calls an aesthetic emotion (5).
                This attitude shapes response to another difficult implied question: c) If poets are
                not the acknowledged legislators of public policy and governance, how can poetry
                effect change in a world at all that deserves the name in the cosmopolitan sense
                Shelley elsewhere endorses, a world held in common, one that is intelligible and
                    public?<note place="foot" resp="author">As
                            Wolfson notes, the corresponding passage in <title level="m">A

                            philosophers are the unacknowledged legislators of the world” (341). In
                            this sense <title level="m">A Philosophical View of Reform</title> does
                            not merely anticipate and “repeat” in advance the more famous conclusion

                            beyond the flux of aesthetic emotion.</note> Disentangling the

                  <p>Recent scholarship in affect theory and the writings of the loose collective of
                thinkers participating in the “Public feelings project” may help us to engage
                further with this critical dilemma of how a world may be held in common, without
                reverting to an enlightenment universalism that over-clarifies these issues of
                agency, intelligibility, and publicity (Berlant, viii). “Writing throws the world
                together,” Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart maintain in their recent work of
                “noetic collaboration,” <title level="m">The Hundreds</title> (11, 8). The
                “thrown-together” world of Berlant and Stewart’s writing both fails to add up and
                exceeds the alternately grandiose and annihilative worldview of the individual
                Romantic author if we continue to view the latter as a figure who must either
                creatively legislate his imaginative world, or struggle in a wake of fragments to
                compose a catastrophe. Mingling the legacy of Shelleyan Romanticism with twentieth-
                and twenty-first century inflections of public feeling(s), this essay asks how it
                might be that the unpredictably collaborative, suspensive “world” of such a “Public
                feelings project” is answerable to and answered by Shelley’s conception of the
                world-making activity of poets. Can the minimally conditioned notion of unforeclosed
                experience, found in the writings of the “Public feelings” group, sustain the
                imaginative horizon of a dynamic and common world envisioned by Romantic poetry?
                Never quite organized or formalized, there is at least one kind of answer in terms
                of shared mental imagery: the prose poetry of contemporary “life in suspension”
                links in its circuitry, its charged and sagging zones, and in its varieties of the
                genre Berlant calls the impasse, to Shelley’s own charged dispersive poetics
                (Berlant and Stewart, 8).</p>
                  <p>The tradition of thinkers who radically apply David Hume’s critique of induction
                provides a background for my proposed reading. In <title level="m">A Defence of
                    Poetry</title> and elsewhere, Shelley follows the Humean skeptical critique of
                those unilateral constructions of agency and causality that are temporally as well
                as logically linear. This Romantic skeptical mobilization of Hume’s empirical
                argument holds that one cannot reason back up the line from an effect to its cause
                to posit the seat of some prior metaphysical origin. Causational force in itself has
                no ontological priority to the relational event in which it manifests. The
                creatively skeptical move Shelley develops from Hume thereby dissolves the hard idea
                of causality into what one might call the associative field poetics of constant
                conjunction and by analogy the domain of the socially “juxtapolitical” (Berlant
                    20).<note place="foot" resp="author">

                events: Poetry is ever found to coexist with whatever other arts contribute to the
                happiness and perfection of man” (518).<note place="foot" resp="author">For more passages that reflect Shelley’s

                            manner, beyond and above consciousness; and it is reserved for future
                            generations to contemplate and measure the mighty cause and effect in
                            all the strength and splendour of their union”; page 534 (“Poetry, as
                            has been said, in this respect differs from logic, that it is not
                            subject to the control of the active powers of the mind, and that its
                            birth and recurrence has no necessary connexion with consciousness or
                            will. It is presumptuous to determine that these are the necessary
                            conditions of mental causation, when mental effects are experienced
                            insusceptible of being referred to them.” But rather than simply
                            annulling causation, Shelley also delineates effects that are mutual
                            determinations, particularly upon poets and poetry: “Poets, not
                            otherwise than philosophers, painters, sculptors, and musicians, are in
                            one sense the creators and in one sense the creations of their age. From
                            this subjection the loftiest do not escape” (208).</note> It
                is hard to tell where theory of knowledge ends and where aesthetic theory and moral
                philosophy begin in such a passage, which includes the “civil habits of action” that
                prepare the ground for the final sentence’s reach toward “legislation”: “Language,
                colour, form, and religious and civil habits of action are all the instruments and
                materials of poetry; they may be called poetry by that figure of speech which
                considers the effect as a synonym of the cause” (513). Shelley deploys Humean
                skepticism toward causation but realizes that its mitigated tenor in Hume is little
                more than a sociable choice. He freely diverts skepticism into the metaleptic
                commingling of “effects” and “instruments.”</p>
                  <p>With this critique of cause in mind, no wonder if Shelley, more than other poets, is
                judged ineffectual. In its role as a poetics treatise, <title level="m">A Defence
                    of Poetry</title> defines a poem as “the very image of life” in opposition to
                story, precisely by way of the dependence of the latter on cause and effect (515).
                Shelley reads the definitional reliance of storytelling on causation itself as a
                form of narrative poetics. He does so, however, not to establish a grounding
                philosophical relationship, but as evidence that “a story is a catalogue of detached
                facts, which have no other bond of connexion than time, place, circumstance, cause
                and effect” (515). It is a wonderfully dissatisfied mood that can find
                disappointment in the small worldview wherein there is “no other” form of
                relationship than the Kantian categories: time, space, and cause! Shelley boldly
                rejects a normatively fixed version of cause and effect in order to create openings
                that promote other “bond[s] of connexion.” As Shelley says of “the promotors of
                utility,” actually rather attractively (as an author might to acknowledge a good
                partner or dean), “[t]hey make space, and give time” (529). His metaleptic critique
                of cause-and-effect thereby expands Hume’s tastefully mitigated skepticism,
                extending its reach beyond epistemology to other areas including ethics, love, and
                historical poetics.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Kuiken for a fuller account of metalepsis as a

                            inherently open to queer affiliations he did not anticipate. For a

                  </p>
                  <p>But in doing so, Shelley persists in his own version of what Lorde will call “the
                passing dreams of choice,” the privilege to harness this appropriately creative
                skepticism only to curative love, denying the reality (for himself and for others)
                of fearful confrontations. Humean skepticism thus requires modes of livable, poetic
                rewriting for the human subject whose own survival cannot be taken for granted.
                (Though as Kara Keeling writes in reply to Lorde’s concept of survival as “enduring
                    <emph>as such</emph>”: “None of us survive as such; indeed, perhaps,
                freedom requires we give way to other things” [ix].) I draw Lorde’s powerful
                critical and poetic insight into a jagged arc with what is already a creatively
                critical swerve in Shelley’s Romantic revision of the Enlightenment. Lorde’s poem <title level="a">A
                Litany for Survival</title> unforgettably marks this relay, beginning with Hume’s classic
                locus of the problem of skepticism, in terms of the historical experience of that
                problem for Black bodies: “And when the sun rises we are afraid / it might not
                remain / when the sun sets we are afraid / it might not rise in the morning.”</p>
                  <p>In light of the issue of causality in particular, the distinction between poetry and
                story closely resembles and shares elemental components with the distinction between
                affect and emotion. It is precisely on narrative and causal grounds that the protean
                realm of affect differs from the more fixed, organized, and symbolically
                pre-interpreted domain of emotion (Ngai 24–7).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Ngai, drawing from Brian Massumi,
                            affect is feeling or intensity disconnected from meaningful sequencing —
                            from narration.</note> The tradeoff comes in intellectual
                capital: as opposed to Ngai’s “ugly” affectively-laden feelings of irritation and
                envy, the classical emotional terms of anger, jealousy, the sublime, and even
                anxiety enjoy greater and more clearly activated and analyzed levels of intellectual
                prestige (9, 35). Shelley’s presentation of <emph>poets</emph> as the
                unacknowledged legislators implicitly worries the issue of the availability of this
                prestige to lyric as opposed to narrative modes. Though the strong analogy I’ve just
                presented holds between Shelley’s contrast (on the grounds of causality, as its
                foremost aspect) of lyric and narrative poetics and the contrast between affect and
                emotion, Shelley nonetheless departs in advance from recent cultural theory of
                affect in terms of the range of feelings his work privileges, or even allows.
                Shelley in his moral and political thought is particularly insistent on affirming
                the heroic and major emotions over ugly minor feelings. The preface to <title level="m">The Revolt of Islam</title> outright rejects the politics of ugly
                feelings: “There is no quarter given to Revenge, or Envy, or prejudice. Love is
                celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world” (qtd. by
                McLane, 217–8). Similarly, the preface to <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                rejects Milton’s Satan as a result of this heroic character’s motivation by
                ambition, envy, and revenge (207).</p>
                  <p>In the “stretched present” of a constellated social poetics, Shelleyan creation and
                public feelings theory share an important mobilizing insight about the imaginative
                sensing of contemporaneity (Berlant, 5). The <title level="m">Defence</title>’s
                prophetic mantle must not obscure its value as a tool to help make emergent life
                livable. Despite its idealistic pitch, the <title level="m">Defence</title> affords
                many responsive forms of historical and social attunement. Berlant lays hold of this
                Shelleyan sympathetic insight in saying “the present is perceived, first,
                affectively” (4). She drops the vatic idiom. But is not Berlant claiming, like
                Shelley, that poets are hierophants of futurity? (And again, not even just narrowly
                poets: Berlant cites Marx that “the senses have become theoreticians” [31].)
                Presentness is first perceived poetically, that is to say; so long as we follow in
                the Shelleyan tradition of defining poetry as socially sympathetic formative
                making—not in rigid terms of traditional form and genre. In Shelley’s well-known
                binary of “mental action” between the faculties of reason and imagination, the first
                insight of the imagination is the perception of value (510).</p>
                  <p>Both Berlant and Stewart recurrently deploy Shelleyan imagery of electric charge,
                circuitry, and (especially in Berlant’s case) electrical infrastructure in their
                work on routes and energies of public feelings. Rather than using it as an
                idealistic symbol, electricity for these thinkers figures intersubjective and
                (occasionally) collective modes of thought that are invisible conceptually as low
                affects and wide infrastructures. Electrical (dis)charge is of course an
                unmistakable Romantic and Shelleyan image. The preface to Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> contrasts the “spirit” to the “forms” of
                the age by calling the spirit an “uncommunicated lightning” (207). In the same
                preface, he credits the influence of Milton to his republican age and sees that age
                of English revolution as a source of stocked energy for the ideals of outflowing
                energy in Romanticism. Shelley heralds: “The cloud of mind is discharging its
                collected lightning” (208). Writers in the public feelings group often use
                electrical grid imagery, crackling with potential energies but unyoked from
                sovereign—or any clear—agency as many of our public structures crumble. “The
                ordinary lives only in the moment of its surge” (Stewart 56). The Shelleyan “Spirit
                of the Age” in <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> anticipates and shares
                this field of charged, subjective but not individual, potentialities in its
                well-known image of the collective genius of the age as a gathering discharge of
                lightning. The uncontainable, unlocalized character of this figure and its agency
                offers indeed one handy symbolic means to distinguish the worldview of Romantic
                artists from the philosophes of European Enlightenment. Rejecting the “gross vice or
                weakness” in which tenuous historical values of heroic conduct, as he finds in
                Addison’s <title level="m">Cato</title>, robe poetic forms, Shelley writes: “To such
                purposes Poetry cannot be made subservient. Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever
                unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would contain it” (520).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    “For the sword outwears its sheath,” laments Lord Byron in his 1817 lyric “So, we’ll go no more a roving.” Phallic as it is, the atmosphere of potentiality and latency in Shelley’s image of lightning should be contrasted to the much more grandiose anti-heroic image in Byron

                The invisible and dispersively charged associative circuit of an electrical
                atmosphere culminates in the figure of the lightning flash that may do work, but at
                the same time empties and neutralizes the more expansive site of the common field
                (the latter being perhaps a more interesting and potentially generative locus,
                present for example in the figure of Asia in <title level="m">Prometheus
                    Unbound</title>). Public feelings thinkers align with Lorde’s conception of “the
                erotic’s electrical charge” when they refuse the consolidating patriarchal image
                (59). On one hand, Berlant’s work can be understood as a series of projects that
                reflect upon and construct the social-material infrastructures for this moving,
                charged atmosphere and its forms of lateral agency in contemporary “unraveled life”
                (Berlant 21).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            For Berlant’s most explicit consideration of infrastructure to date, see
                            “The Commons: Infrastructures for Troubling Times.” I am especially
                            drawn to this essay’s project of “managing being in proximity in the
                            awkward and violent ordinary” (395).</note> On the other hand,
                Stewart and Berlant alike explore the latent, sagging, volatile, and live, yet
                not-insistently-actualized media, of electrical conduct. Theirs is a world without
                enlightening (and insistently phallic) flashes, in which the realization of public
                feeling “might feel like anything, including nothing” (Berlant 2). A world in which
                not privileged subjects but “rogue intensities roam the streets of the ordinary”
                (Stewart, 44). Unhoused and ungrounded, affective intensities haunt even the most
                domestic interlunations of ordinary life.</p>
                  <p>Romantic criticism has noted and celebrated Shelley’s dispersive poetics as part of a
                radically negative aesthetic, one not recoverable by instrumental politics.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Forceful
                            examples of this radically negative reading of Shelley, post-Paul de
                            Man, include Pyle (esp. 29–65) and Faflak.</note> Here I see
                Shelley’s annihilation of traditional agency not as an erasure of the voice that
                might speak toward public feeling, but in line with Berlant’s and Stewart’s
                suspended, unraveled, yet charged potential to foster something happening (or not)
                in the realm of the intimate collective. As opposed to the complex but
                philosophically clear grammar of the first two questions I have discussed—the
                question of the efficacy of action and the question of the scale of its duration,
                management, and governance—the last question asked poses a challenge to the very
                ideas of a nucleated individual agency and a publicity that might fix in place a
                world in common.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ross calls this the “cellular regime of
                            nationality” (11–38).</note> On this third question I turn back
                and forward to Lorde.</p>
                  <p>There is yet further room and provocation to think of Lorde’s essays on poetry,
                public life, erotics, and teaching as major contributors to the living thought of
                Romanticism and post-Romanticism. Lorde writes in <title level="a">Coal</title> that “There are many kinds
                of open.” The rest of this essay is devoted to exploring a mode of openness
                unwelcome to Shelley, though not to a collective and intimate Romantic project
                moving from and beyond him. For the main instance of a textual provocation that arcs
                beyond chronological Romanticism, I take Shelley’s valuable insight in the
                <title level="m">Defence</title> and in his short essay <title level="a">On Love</title>
                that the outgoing structure of love and hope “beyond ourselves” also comprehends
                fear. I see this double insight and its necessary edge of vulnerability as an
                understanding that by himself Shelley is unable to effectively use. This aversion
                exposes him rightly to the harsh light of critique by Lorde: “But giving in to the
                fear of feeling and working to capacity is a luxury only the unintentional can
                afford” (Lorde 54). It takes subsequent trajectories of poetic experience and
                expression, which I find in the thought of Lorde, to address this need for courage
                of insight and bring it to bear on “the image of life” and its creative and critical
                practice (<title level="m">SPP</title> 515).<note place="foot" resp="author"> In Shelley’s <title level="m">The Witch
                                of Atlas</title>, another seriocomic poem of 1820, the mischievous and
                            undesiring Witch kneads together a “sexless” hermaphrodite from “liquid
                            love,” in order to help power her journeys in the boat refitted from the
                            unwanted car of Venus, “too feeble to be fraught” with all of Venus’ sex
                            in the back seat (376–7). This “living Image” of the career of Love
                            indicates playfully just the extent to which Shelley in all seriousness
                            needed to bring ordinary, lived, sexuality into his mythopoetic vision.</note> Understanding “luxury” not as hedonism nor as a fetishistic
                object-oriented surplus enjoyment, but as the inhibiting burden of carrying
                defensive illusions that do not supply any actual protection or substance for life—a
                privilege enjoyed only by those able to “afford” habitual inattention to need—Lorde
                thereby makes essential the forms of joyous creation, but also modes of fearful
                scrutiny. This effort represents a necessary new direction for the thought of poetry
                as the criticism of life, but not under the fixed conditions the nineteenth century
                so often imagined without insight. Something is yet worth recovering from the wreck
                of this patriarchal Arnoldian conception because it attests beyond its false
                universalism to the sensibility of human needs.</p>

                  <head>Poetry is Not a Luxury</head>
                  <p>Lorde’s and Shelley’s writings are particularly generative to think with and teach
                together because they share a fundamental argument about the necessity of poetry.
                Lorde and Shelley develop two of the strongest, fiercest, and most flexible
                articulations of the purpose and life of poetry without even a minimum of technical
                scaffolding—that is, without supportive reference to the traditional techniques of
                verse. Both resolutely refuse to take their bearings from the technical aspects of
                poetry as language enclosed in pattern. Their defenses of poetry are instead
                grounded in human capacities. And despite the individual notes of apology and
                negation in their titles, as makers of global arguments, Lorde and Shelley both also
                assume boldly non-defensive attitudes. Thinking primarily through the body, <title level="a">Poetry
                Is Not a Luxury,</title> redefines the essential transformative thesis of Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> concerning ideation, that poetry is not a
                recombinative exercise, or an adjunct to sense, but a necessity at the center and
                circumference of life at peril of social death. Thus, in Kara Keeling’s richly
                generative response to Lorde’s essay (an account which also references capitalism’s
                reproduction of fear in the body), for Lorde “poetry is a way of thinking the
                space/time of politics for those deemed disposable or socially dead” (xi). Though
                she never refers to Shelley and does not need his example—or seemingly the creative
                precedent of any other male canonical poets, alien if not hostile to her own
                situated body—nonetheless in my view, Lorde both supports and critically supplements
                Shelley’s resistance to the definition of poetry as a formal object. She does so in
                the name of lived specificity, as the means to envision human flourishing under a
                larger horizon of solidarity. Lorde rejects the reduction of poetry to verse as what
                she calls a “distillation of experience . . . to . . . sterile word play” (37). She
                feared that poetry and poets themselves had become the “promotors of utility” that
                Shelley despises. Equally, she despised the view of poetry as a civilized game, as
                in even the most flexible rendition we might give to R.P. Blackmur’s definition of
                poetry as “a game we play with reality” (1).<note place="foot" resp="author"> “[T]he game by history and training, the
                            play by instinct and need,” continues Blackmur’s achieved formulation
                            (1).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet in the articulation of her own situated and specific dimension of a vitally
                Shelleyan poetics in the broadest sense, Lorde also formulates what is perhaps the
                deepest problem in this tradition and relates it in sharp terms, by assigning the
                institution of poetry to “the white fathers [who write] . . . in order to cover
                their desperate wish for imagination without insight” (37). Beyond even the
                irrefutable “white fathers” aspect of her critique, how much poetic production—how
                much literary theory and criticism—is rightly subject to this second accusation of
                whitewashing; that is, of the writer’s wish to court imagination without the work
                and the pain of delivering insight? “Insight,” in this reading, is not a quantum of
                new knowledge, or a projective vision, but a harsh and rich encounter with an
                ancient-emergent knowledge one must unearth and face. Romantic writings must remain
                uncomfortably open to Lorde’s statement in order to grapple with the kind of
                revelatory experience that comes only from painful self-examination. One of the
                aspects of Shelley’s privilege is his ability not to recognize the fundamental
                realities of suffering and pain—alike as a personal and as a political
                experience.</p>
                  <p>Maureen McLane expresses this differently when she preserves and reverses, in and
                with Shelley, the slogan of 1970s activist feminism: “For with Shelley <emph>the political is personal</emph>” (215). Rather than the courageous
                breakthrough of a feminist praxis, this inversion of the feminist motto for Shelley
                sounds brittle to me and suggests the potential elision of self-knowledge. As the
                title of her essay-address bears out, Lorde’s way of saying that language is vitally
                metaphorical, that the creation of poetry is the conduct and “very image of life,”
                and, furthermore, that life-making is a world-making practice, is to say that
                <title level="a">Poetry is not a Luxury.</title> If poetry is now typically thought to be a luxury good or
                a productively “useless” activity, in her essay Lorde mobilizes a compelling and
                atypical concept of luxury. In typical definitions “luxury” comprises an object that
                is desirable but inessential, marked by a differential symbolic prestige as well as
                being expensive and difficult to obtain. Lord deploys an alternative sense of
                “luxury” based on a lived concept of economies of spirit. It is important to note
                that the essay was written at a time when Lorde was awaiting a potentially terminal
                medical diagnosis for her first appearance of cancer. This personal reference bears
                on her characterization of waiting upon a time of fearlessness as the “final luxury”
                she could not afford. Lorde did not have the luxury of a conception of empty,
                extended time to expend on delays due to fear.</p>
                  <p>Lorde also presents a fundamental critique of the metaphysical idea of a separate
                time of enjoyment, the idea that luxury must come after and be thereby distinguished
                from necessity or even use value in temporal terms. I read this aspect of her work
                through Kristen Ross’s recent study,
                    <title level="m">Communal Luxury </title>[<title level="m">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">L’Imaginaire de la Commune</foreign>
                     </title>], which makes available and recharges for
                public use the idea of a far-flung tradition of luxurious working in common. The
                argument of <hi rend="italic">Communal Luxury</hi> builds from the eponymous French
                communard manifesto regarding “transforming aesthetic coordinates” in the reliance
                of political and social transformation upon public art: “We will work cooperatively
                toward our regeneration, the birth of communal luxury, future splendors and the
                Universal Republic. –Federation of Artists Manifesto, April 1871” (Ross 39, 58). For
                Ross, appending the word “communal” to “luxury” changes the meaning of the latter
                term. After the model of the 1871 Communards, Ross breaks down the duality between
                necessity and luxury. Both Lorde and Ross insist that what is needed is to uncover
                previously submerged forms of living, in Ross’s words to maintain a vital
                prolongation, a “life beyond life” (6). Lorde and Ross both, too, are making an
                argument against the further misapplication of assigning inverted values from this
                binary: the wrongful designation of necessary things as luxury goods.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “Senseless
                            luxury, which [William] Morris knew cannot exist without slavery of some
                            kind, would be replaced by communal luxury, or equality in abundance”
                            (Ross, 63.)</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within her “project of making art lived—not superfluous or trivial, but vital and
                indispensable to the community,” Ross promotes the term luxury (59). Indeed, <title level="m">Communal Luxury</title> maintains that it is the Malthusian calculus
                of modern capitalism itself that generates the model of economic scarcity through
                which the system is perpetuated (72, 127). In the urgency of Lorde’s project,
                necessity comes to the front. For her all luxury is what Ross calls “senseless
                luxury,” the privilege to suffer the illusion to be careless of need (63). Shelley,
                Lorde, and Ross align in their individual conceptualizations of the roles of value
                and imagination in relation to productive reason—to material and even to mental
                production. We don’t need more knowledge. For Lorde specifically, “there are no new
                ideas still waiting in the wings to save us as women” (38). All three writers are
                committed to a different form of the analysis: “We want the creative capacity to
                imagine that which we know; we want the generous impulse to act that which imagine;
                we want the poetry of life: our calculations have outrun conception; we have eaten
                more than we can digest” (530). Lorde, indeed, often construes the important new
                information to be gained by poetic creation and scrutiny as outside the domain of
                thought altogether. Rather, poetic practice makes deep and even pre-verbal
                knowledges available for living.</p>
                  <p>In “The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action,” Lorde shares an
                idiosyncratic tactical definition of fear and fearlessness as the “final luxury.”
                She writes: “For we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own needs for
                language and definition, and while we wait in silence for that final luxury of
                fearlessness, the weight of the silence will choke us” (44). Or again, in <title level="a">Uses of
                the Erotic</title>: “But giving in to the fear of feeling and working to capacity is a
                luxury only the unintentional can afford, and the unintentional are those who do not
                wish to guide their own destinies” (54). In a passage from <title level="a">The Transformation of
                Silence,</title> Lorde says that “[w]e can learn to work and speak when we are afraid in
                the same way we have learned to work and speak when we are tired” (44). The
                necessity of poetry and the sense of communal luxury that one finds so strikingly in
                Lorde and Ross and the livable habit of working and speaking “when we are
                afraid,”—seeking “our own needs for language and definition” by moving through, not
                halting in, fear—contrast to the final luxuries of fear and scarcity (of biological
                life, time, and socially necessary goods) that are senseless. These cannot be
                afforded.</p>
                  <p>The introduction to <title level="m">Sister Outsider</title> presents Lorde’s writing
                as a contribution to “an impulse toward wholeness.” (Bereano 8). Such a presentation
                anticipates Lorde’s sentence from “The Transformation of Silence”: “Tell them about
                how you’re never really a whole person if you remain silent” (42). This deep impulse
                to realize wholeness comes from the expression of resistance to an experience of
                alternately fragmented, managed, and administered life known so well by earlier
                Romantic writers. Lorde transmutes the two fundamental enlightenment figures of
                light and critical examination in <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury</title> and other essays. Like
                Shelley’s atmospheres of light in the <title level="m">Defence</title>, in the opening
                paragraph on the fundamentally poetic act of valuation, she writes of “[t]he quality
                of light by which we scrutinize our lives”; this light we create and bring with us
                “has direct bearing upon the product which we live, and upon the changes which we
                hope to bring about through those lives” (36). “And there is, for me, no difference
                between writing a good poem and moving into sunlight against the body of a woman I
                love” (58). Giving a rich form of self-evidence to a haptic and erotic body of
                anti-enlightenment knowledge and helping to develop what Ferguson calls an eros of
                the critical imagination (297), Lorde’s writings perform an unanticipated but
                necessary inner transformation of Shelley’s critique of Enlightenment stockpiling of
                knowledge in the <title level="m">Defence</title>, in which Lorde pursues “the felt
                above the ideational, affect above theory” (Mangrum 338). </p>
                  <p>This poetics develops fully in what remains the merely potentially human space of the
                contrasts Shelley implies in the <title level="m">Defence</title>, between “practice,”
                “distribution,” and “poetry” on the one hand, and “wisdom,” “knowledge,” and
                “systems of thought” on the other:
            <quote>We have more moral, political, and historical wisdom than we know how to reduce into
                practice; we have more scientific and economical knowledge than can be accommodated
                to the just distribution of the produce which it multiplies. The poetry in these
                systems of thought, is concealed by the accumulation of facts and calculating
                processes. There is no want of knowledge respecting what is wisest and best in
                morals, government, and political oeconomy, or at least, what is wiser and better
                than what men now practice and endure. (530)</quote>
            Of a piece with the felt conviction and persuasiveness with which she writes, Lorde
                views the activity of thinking itself suspiciously. She even fears it.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Prompted by her own past remarks, Lorde said the following in response to Adrienne Rich’s question about how thinking was for Lorde “a mysterious process that other people did and that you had to sort of practice?

                                errors committed in its name, and I had come not to respect it. On
                                the other hand, I was also afraid of it because there we inescapable
                                conclusions or convictions I had come to about my own life, my own
                                feelings, that defied thought. And I wasn’t going to let them go.’”

                     </note> Is fear an activist impulse? Or anger? In
                the passages I’ve cited above, drawing from multiple essays, Lorde does not allow
                her relation to fear to metastasize or describe regions of experience she will not
                open. Her language around fear is proportionate to the discussion of loving and
                nearly as rich. She analyzes the experience of living actively with fear as a part
                of a non-utilitarian practice of “feeling and working to capacity” in practical,
                ethical, and poetic forms of life. </p>
                  <p>Against the differentials of a “quality of light” which Lorde brings to scrutiny,
                stands the Enlightenment of Shelley’s account, with its concealed, congealed
                accumulations of knowledge burying poetry within systems. The gradual buildup of
                anger that differently embodied subjects may feel in being forced to enlighten those
                in privilege suggests the need for a politics of solidarity in fatigue, as much as a
                relational affirmation of love-politics.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Nash.</note> In order to
                step into the erotics of light, the handling of anger in Lorde’s writings offers a
                profoundly necessary continuation and corrective for the disabling fear of anger, a
                relation to fear and anger shown throughout the career of Percy Shelley. Lorde’s
                range of affective and political investments in poetry point the way to a more
                productive relation to the emotions, thoughts, and insights we fear, using the very
                condition of the body as a means to go forward, asking courageously “Does it feel
                right to me?” As Lorde says caringly of her son in <title level="a">Man Child</title>: “I do not exist to
                do his feeling for him” (74). However, in Shelley’s distribution of
                feeling-in-thought, fear and anger are both philosophically and personally deprived
                working through. Denied metaphysical reality in Shelley’s utopian politics, anger
                and fear are thereby relegated to status of the demonic. Barbara Johnson captures
                this with cutting briskness as a primary fact of Shelley’s existence: “He was a
                vegetarian, but was trained as a skilled huntsman and harbored murderous feelings”
                (83). Similarly, James Chandler remarks that Shelley’s aristocratic identity by
                birth was the basis for a lifelong attitude of “self-renunciation” (344).</p>
                  <p>Disavowal is among Shelley’s deepest-rooted impulses. Politically this makes sense,
                while it seems to me at the same time to limit and distort Shelley’s relationship to
                the self-querying of the rightness of some of his uglier feelings. Shelley claims in
                the fragmentary essay <title level="a">On Love,</title> an essay only published at Mary Shelley’s
                discretion in <title level="m">The Keepsake</title> of 1829, that:
            <quote> “[Love] is that powerful attraction towards all that we conceive of fear or hope
                beyond ourselves when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient
                void and seek to awaken in all things that are community with what we experience
                within ourselves. If we reason we would be understood; if we imagine we would that
                the airy children of our brain were born anew within another’s, if we feel, we would
                that another’s nerves should vibrate to our own, that the beams of their eyes should
                kindle at once and mix and melt into our own, that lips of motionless ice should not
                reply to lips quivering and burning with the heart’s best blood. This is Love. This
                is the bond and sanction which connects not only man with man, but with every thing
                which exists.” (504–5)</quote>
            In <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>, there is no fear in the parallel
                version of the statement: “The great secret of morals is Love; or a going out of our
                own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in
                thought, action, or person, not our own” (517). The “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty”
                ends by enjoining the “SPIRIT fair” to “fear himself, and love all human kind” (96).
                These lines are often given the unwarranted, restrictive parsing of fear as
                self-respect. But they are based on a want of self-trust and inward examination in
                traversing “the chasm of an insufficient void.”</p>
                  <p>Colin Jager has written discerningly on Shelley’s philosophical poetics and the
                “adventures of human flourishing,” in a reading that elaborates the stakes and risks
                to the meaning of the poet’s atheism as an occupation (240). As part of this
                commentary, Jager observes, Act IV of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                operates “on the far side of fear” (243). But this boundary marking of a
                dispensation after fear only makes the discontinuous handling—an Ariel-like vaulting
                over to the farther shore, not a culture of working through—that much clearer to
                view. The elisions of fear practiced by Shelley, and at times by his commentators,
                leave the dark and legitimate sources of their emotional power and need unaddressed.
                If Shelley at such moments is disabled by his own aversion to the processing of
                anger and fear, the repression is directed toward a fear, foremost, of his own
                responsive capacity for anger, and therefore instances a repression of
                susceptibilities and responsibilities that are inseparable from language and feeling
                as such. </p>
                  <p>Here Lorde can offer a strong and necessary comparative contrast in which we do not
                require sympathetically outgoing desires to be valued alone by the false innocence
                bought with disavowal, and thus we can risk the achievement of both integrity and
                experience. In her poem, <title level="a">Between Ourselves,</title> Lorde models the ossified psychic form
                of hatred so as to give opportunity to life outside the containment of the
                interlocking structure of a nested, negative conformity of self and other:
            <quote>

                     </quote>
            This poetics of a public feeling communicated “between ourselves” bears with great
                insight on Shelley’s desire, in <title level="a">On Love,</title> go decisively “beyond ourselves” by
                awakening a sort of community-in-harmonics with experience “within ourselves.” But
                Lorde’s love-politics does not seek the mirroring symmetry of that “same direction.”
                Rendered anew in the analogy with <title level="a">Between Ourselves,</title> Shelley’s geometry of a
                responsive sympathy looks instead like the orientation of bodies in the hold of a
                ship, or a cemetery full of headstones all levelled one way after a storm. To read
                Lorde’s <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury</title> back into and with Shelley, is to return to a felt
                and embedded, not mirroring, relationship of the public feeling of love, “going out”
                of the self, and to the working through of experiences of fear that cannot be
                expelled from “our own needs for language and definition,” an examination of the
                full value carried by imagination. It is also, as in the brief reading of <title level="a">Coal</title> at
                the start of this essay, to examine and develop capacities that seem too occluded to
                bring to light; to go deeper into the densities of relation, in an inversion of the
                way Keats urged Shelley to mine concertedly for the sake of the extraction of beauty
                for poetry.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I
                            allude to Keats’s letter to Shelley of August 16, 1820.</note>
                This would be a more luminous, but also a more textured and even opaque, light: a
                necessary energy force sought and expended for the sake of enlarging our scrutiny of
                a poetry of life that might not only be shared at the level of ideas but felt,
                tested, and trusted in bodies.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay considers the role of disgust in the emergence of sociological theory over
                    the course of the nineteenth century. It argues that what began as the bourgeois
                    social analyst’s disgust towards the modern city gradually transformed, over the
                    course of the century, into the modern sociological theorization of alienation as a
                    form of low-level repulsion. To track these changes in the function of disgust
                    within social analysis, the essay begins with a reading of William Wordsworth’s
                    description in <title level="m">The Prelude</title> of London as a "vast mill, /
                    …vomiting, receiving on all sides, / Men, women, three-years’ children, babes in
                    arms,” before turning to Friedrich Engels’s claim that “the very turmoil of
                    [London’s] streets has something repulsive, something against which human nature
                    rebels.”</p>

               <p>“Feeling is an object for scientific study,” Émile
                Durkheim declares in <title level="m">The Rules of Sociological Method</title> (1895),
                “not the criterion of scientific truth” (39–40). Emotional bias and sentimental
                attachment needed to be “rooted out” from the sociologist’s method, he insists, in
                order for the discipline to establish itself as a legitimate branch of scientific
                knowledge distinct, crucially, from the socially critical ambitions of realist or
                naturalist literature in the same period. However, social phenomena posed a special
                problem to this process of excluding emotions, precisely because they were so
                deeply, constitutively value laden. “We enthuse over our political and religious
                beliefs and moral practices very differently from the way we do over the objects of
                the physical world,” Durkheim goes on. Indeed, the uncritical, reflexive emotional
                bonds formed with the social are so potent, he writes, “they will not tolerate
                scientific examination. The mere fact of subjecting them . . . to cold, dry analysis
                is repugnant to certain minds.” Feeling therefore not only clouds judgment, in
                Durkheim’s view, but defends the social from critical investigation in the first
                place, deflecting inquiry. This twofold methodological problem had dogged
                disciplinary sociology from the start. Herbert Spencer, for instance, devoted an
                entire chapter of his 1873 methodological treatise <title level="m">The Study of
                    Sociology</title> to “Subjective Difficulties—Emotional”: “How, then,” he asks,
                “with such perverting emotions, is it possible to take a rational view of
                sociological facts?” (144).</p>
               <p>Durkheim asserted that it was imperative for the
                sociologist to overcome the protective feelings of repugnance shielding social
                phenomena from scientific analysis. The failure to disentangle fact from feeling, to
                root out emotion, he warns, would mean “the negation of all science" (40). Compared
                to some of his contemporaries, this wholesale repudiation of emotion represented a
                polemical position. Max Weber, by contrast, remained unconvinced throughout his
                career that the objects of the social world could be entirely isolated from the
                evaluative presuppositions and subjective attachments which constituted them to
                begin with. Nevertheless, Durkheim’s strong, unambivalent stance captures something
                of the fin-de-siècle mood of residual Enlightenment enthusiasm over the possibility
                of producing a modern scientific knowledge of the social domain freed from
                superstition and emotional prejudice. This enthusiasm was shared across all the
                emerging social scientific disciplines, each of which took a pronounced interest in
                bringing a methodological objectivity modeled on the natural sciences to bear on the
                study of the affective life of the subject. The neoclassical economists of the late
                nineteenth century epitomized this tendency, at once intensifying their focus on the
                pleasures and desires of the utilitarian subject while deriving their increasingly
                impersonal methodological premises from mathematics and the physical sciences.
                Alfred Marshall, for example, understood the ebb and surge of human appetites to be
                the principal engine of social and economic life—but he modeled his conception of
                appetite on the law-bound, measurable oscillation of a pendulum.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For an extensive account of economic discourse’s aspirational relationship to the physical sciences, see Mirowski, <title level="m">More Heat than
                                Light</title>; for Marshall’s strained, catachrestic metaphor of the pendulum see his <title level="m">Principles</title>, 405.</note> Affective life
                was at the heart of the social, but in order to study it, feeling needed to be
                overcome.</p>
               <p> In the following pages, I offer a condensed
                genealogical account of how this particular social scientific coordination of
                feeling and unfeeling came to take on its commonsense character, such that, having
                emotions would come to seem like an impediment to understanding emotions, rather
                than a prerequisite or an aid. I focus in particular on the prominent role that the
                negative emotion of disgust played in this historical process. I examine two scenes
                of proto-sociological repulsion from the nineteenth century: Friedrich Engels’s
                disgust at Londoners’ alienation, and William Wordsworth’s description, in the
                seventh book of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, of London’s Bartholomew Fair “as
                if the whole were one vast mill, / Are vomiting, receiving on all sides, / Men,
                women, three-years’ children, babes in arms” (7.692–4). By comparing Engels and
                Wordsworth, and the work of later social analysts, like Georg Simmel, I build on and
                extend canonical readings by Raymond Williams and Steven Marcus, among others. These
                works sought to excavate and analyze a tradition of city writing that cut across
                genres and disciplines and reflected a new awareness of the material conditions of
                social life under nineteenth-century capitalism. My aim is different. While Williams
                was interested in analyzing the changes in what he influentially called the
                structure of feeling of modern urban life, I focus more specifically on the role of
                feeling within the development of the increasingly scientific techniques of social
                analysis in the period. In so doing, I hope to unsettle the presumed continuity that
                Williams and others have ascribed to what feeling meant in the nineteenth century. I
                also hope to shed light on the contradictory parts it played in the description of
                modern social life.</p>
               <p>This difference in focus has important methodological
                consequences for the way that I view the relationship between the literary and
                non-literary texts I read in this article. Although I do regard Wordsworth’s
                “Residence in London” as an important starting point for a genre-crossing tradition
                of modern city writing, my analysis also takes into account the role of feeling and
                affect in the entanglement of literary and sociological writing over the course of
                the nineteenth century, as well as in their ultimate disaggregation as separate
                disciplines. When I turn at length to Wordsworth’s description of London as a
                vomiting mill, or to his diagnosis of the metropolis as the place “where the human
                heart is sick,” I do so partly because they anticipate later analyses of urban
                alienation as an affective sickness, but more crucially because they reflect an
                early nineteenth-century moment when such analysis had yet to be subjected to the
                methodological interdiction of feeling that Durkheim so forcefully articulated at
                the close of the century. Thus, while each of the “scenes” of modern sociological
                repulsion I examine—Wordsworth, followed by Engels, then back to 1900—dramatizes an
                encounter with the malady of feeling first diagnosed by Wordsworth, what changes is
                the underlying normative sense of what feelings are, what they are meant to do, and
                what constitutes their deformation.</p>
               <p>Disgust played a special part in the slow emergence of
                nineteenth-century sociology. One can already begin to trace the outline of
                disgust’s sociological function in Durkheim’s ascription of a special function to
                repugnance. Repugnance here exemplifies the benighted irrationality of emotion in
                general, a distortion of rational judgment that demands the practiced restraint of
                the social scientist in order to be overcome. Yet even this rather boilerplate
                dualism turns out not to be so simple, since Durkheim also implies that repugnance
                is a medium of restraint in its own right. It is an emotion, he suggests, whose
                articulation fends off the claims of reason. Hence feeling was to be resisted, but
                some feelings also exerted their own forms of resistance. How then could one
                distinguish between the disciplinary restraint of the sociologist and the affective
                resistances that were to be overcome?</p>
               <p>This complexity in the sociological conception of
                disgust is best approached through a related problematization of feeling that arose
                specifically out of the study of urban life over the course of the nineteenth
                century, and which came to inform social theory in the opening decades of the
                twentieth. Approached from the perspective of urban sociology, the salient problem
                of modern social relations was not human emotionality per se, but alienation. That
                is, it was not the overabundance or primacy of feeling that was central to social
                theoretical analysis, but rather its deficiency, absence, overregulation, or
                deformation through life in the modern capitalist city. Indeed, the characterization
                of urban sociality as indifferent or emotionless was typical of turn of the century
                social thought. In Simmel’s influential formulation, for example, life in the
                capitalist metropolis is characterized by its emotional “reserve”: the “blasé
                attitude” whose “essence is an indifference towards the distinctions between
                things,” which stemmed from the preeminence of economic exchange (<title level="m">Metropolis</title> 331). Weber, too, writes of the “impersonality” of city life
                    (<title level="m">City</title> 77), while Durkheim develops his conception of
                anomie—a "hatred or disgust for the prevailing order”—out of
                what he saw as the specific mismatch between the normative strictures of industrial
                society and the “bottomless abyss” of the human “capacity for feeling” (<title level="m">Suicide</title> 337, 208).</p>
               <p>The widespread diagnosis of alienation as a state devoid
                of feeling or of deformed feeling was bound up with an equally prevalent set of
                ideas about the centrality of disgust to human sociality. This focus on disgust as a
                social affect was shared by social theorists working with a variety of different
                conceptual idioms. Most notably, in Simmel’s conception of the blasé attitude,
                indifference and the absence of feeling shade into what he describes as “a slight
                aversion, a mutual strangeness and repulsion [<emph>
                     <foreign xml:lang="de">Abstoßung</foreign>
                  </emph>]”
                    (<title level="m">Metropolis</title> 331). For Simmel, repulsion was a primary
                negative force operating beneath the veneer of interpersonal neutrality. Without
                such “feelings of mutual strangeness and repulsion,” he writes in his long essay of
                1908, <title level="a">Conflict,</title> “we could not imagine what form modern urban life…might possibly
                take” (<title level="m">Conflict</title> 21).<note place="foot" resp="author"> On this point, see Harvey’s discussion of Simmel, <title level="a">Revulsion and Revolt,</title> in <title level="m">The Urban Experience</title> (180–5).</note>
                Norbert Elias, too, memorably describes the slow formation of what he called the
                civilized habitus, over the course of the medieval and early modern periods, as the
                outcome of “advances in the threshold of repugnance” (102). Elias argues that the
                emotional restraint that characterized modern social life was, counterintuitively,
                produced by <emph>heightened</emph> disgust. In a more bombastic idiom,
                Georges Bataille would proclaim, in the first of a pair of 1938 lectures on
                “Attraction and Repulsion,” that “everything leads us to believe that early human
                beings were brought together by disgust and common terror.” “The social nucleus is,
                in fact…untouchable and unspeakable,” Bataille declared, “[it is] the object of a
                fundamental repulsion” (106). Cool indifference and alienation might be the
                affective states that best diagnosed modern life, but stronger feelings of disgust,
                antipathy and repulsion were never too far off. As Simmel puts it, repulsion is “the
                inner side” of indifference.</p>
               <p> The identification of repulsion with alienation posed
                an implicit conceptual problem for early social theory, one that I am arguing ought
                to be understood as having arisen out of particular historical circumstances and
                transformations. On the one hand, the conflation of the two affective states and
                their installation at the heart of modern social life would seem to exemplify
                Durkheim’s call for sociology to treat feeling as an object of scientific analysis
                rather than a criterion of scientific judgment. The wager was that affective life
                could be studied objectively, impersonally, without feeling creeping into the
                sociological method. Yet on the other hand, the counterintuitive discovery that
                strong, binding feelings of disgust lurk beneath the veneer of affective neutrality
                introduced a complication. For now, it began to seem as though negative affects such
                as antipathy and repugnance might in some sense be preconditions for the practiced
                restraint and distanced impassivity of the modern social scientific habitus itself.
                Were the social scientific enthusiasm for objectivity, and the call to root out
                feeling from method, modern disciplinary innovations that would illuminate
                heretofore concealed dimensions of social life? Or were they themselves part of the
                processes of emotional discipline and deformation that seemed increasingly evident
                to those social theorists who followed the entangled threads of feeling, unfeeling,
                and unwanted feeling through the modern city?</p>
               <p>Addressing these questions requires pushing back into
                the nineteenth century and examining the role of disgust not only in the
                proto-sociology of the 1840s and 1850s, but also in the literary archive of the
                period. As has often been observed, the emergence of disciplinary sociology—and
                urban sociology in particular—over the second half of the nineteenth century
                depended not only on the appropriation of natural scientific and statistical methods
                for the study of social life, but on sharpening the distinction between the literary
                and the sociological to the point where they would eventually appear as
                self-evidently separate and even mutually exclusive domains.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For an important account foregrounding the centrality of feeling to this process of differentiation and disaggregation see Lepenies, <title level="m">Between Literature and

                  </note> However, the process of their differentiation
                was gradual and uneven. Throughout the century, one is as likely to encounter
                proto-sociological texts that draw on literary conventions—Henry Mayhew’s reliance
                on characterization and anecdote, for instance, or Harriet Martineau’s direct
                appeals to readerly sympathy—as one is to encounter novelists articulating their
                social scientific ambitions. Indeed, prominent late nineteenth-century authors
                sought to frame the literary text itself as a scientific laboratory in which the
                passions and pathologies of social life could be examined and controlled, as with
                Émile Zola’s notion of the “experimental novel” and Thomas Hardy’s elaboration of a
                “science of fiction.” Even though the emergence of disciplinary sociology depended
                on progressively sharpening its distinction from literature, literary realism in
                this very period shared a horizon of sociological ambition.</p>
               <p> Questions of feeling and, in particular, of unwanted
                feeling, were central to this process of disciplinary entanglement and
                disaggregation. At the close of the century, such questions revolved largely around
                the status of disgust as an emotion to be surmounted or set aside. Indeed, one does
                not need to dig deep to find literary preemptions of Durkheim’s call to overcome the
                repugnance that protects social reality from analysis. An 1884 preface to the
                English translation of Zola’s <title level="m">
                     <foreign xml:lang="fr">L’Assommoir</foreign>
                  </title>, to name one
                example, argues that in order to read Zola properly “you must conquer the first
                feeling of repugnance; then, whatever may be the final judgment pronounced upon the
                writer, you are glad to have read his works, and you arrive at the conclusion that
                you ought to have read them…even if it bring with it an odour not altogether
                agreeable” (De Amicis 1). By the same token, criticism of the realist or naturalist
                novel often took issue precisely with its failure to transcend its merely
                sociological ambitions, which were framed as a kind of quasi-scientific prurience.
                Historically speaking, these allegations of realism’s insensitivity to the
                grotesque, and of its morbid obsession with the deformed, have appealed to a broad
                ideological spectrum of literary critics. It is in this vein, for instance, that
                John Ruskin accuses realists, including Zola and Dickens, of reducing literary art
                simply to a “science of fiction, concerned mainly with the description of…[the]
                forms of disease” of industrial society and of being motivated only by the
                “curiosity of science in morbid phenomena” (269). In a very different idiom, György
                Lukács repeats the claim that Zola’s “descriptive method” had degraded the novel
                form by “attempt[ing] to make literature scientific, to
                transform it…into sociology,” thus “intensifying the decay” of modern culture under
                bourgeois capitalism (127).<note place="foot" resp="author">Eric Auerbach made a similar case, but he saw
                                innovation where Lukács perceived the debasement of literature. “It
                                is surprising but undeniable,” Auerbach writes, “that the inclusion
                                of the fourth estate [i.e. the proletariat] in serious realism was
                                decisively advanced by those, who in their quest for new aesthetic
                                impressions, discovered the attraction of the ugly and pathological”

               <p>Before delving deeper into the nineteenth century and
                turning to Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Residence in London,</title> I want to flesh out more fully the
                emotional grammar of the process of disciplinary knowledge formation I am
                describing. At the turn of the century, we have seen, novelists and sociologists
                alike shared a sense that the production of the form of objectivity specific to
                analysis of the social domain required the management of the observer’s disgust.
                From this perspective, the sociological impulse appears to depend on an idea of
                emotion as a reflexive impulse that can be restrained or “conquered”; the diagnosis
                of modern society’s complex problems is only possible if one’s disgust is expelled,
                kept in, or otherwise overcome.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Here and throughout my thinking is informed by and indebted to Joshua Wilner’s work on internalization in Romantic poetry and psychoanalytic thought, <title level="m">Feeding on Infinity: Readings
                                in the Romantic Rhetoric of
                                Internalization</title>. Wilner observes that, in both of these paradigms, to internalize can mean either to bring something into the self from without or to keep something internal that seeks to get out. I am suggesting here a similar (or perhaps inverted) confusion in the phenomenology of the sociological conception of disgust: it is an emotion whose paradigmatic expressions can be seen either as an expulsive form of externalization (vomiting) or a corking up of the self (holding one’s nose). The conceptualization of disgust might therefore be said to alternate between a characterization of the emotion as opening the body up and a characterization of it as a form of enacted closure. The question of what it means to overcome or conquer one’s disgust looks different, I would argue, depending on which characterization one has in mind.</note>
                By contrast, from the perspective of critics who saw the rise of the sociological
                ambition as part of a more general cultural malady, the absence of feeling was
                itself the pathology to be diagnosed. Yet it is important to note that this position
                also staked its claim in a conception about the overcoming of disgust; the
                disagreement concerned whether or not overcoming feeling was the poison or the cure.
                In both cases, then, what is needed in order to understand the emergence of the
                sociological impulse is a clearer sense of what it meant to conquer one’s disgust or
                overcome it.</p>
               <p>Turning to an earlier text such as Wordsworth’s
                <title level="a">Residence in London</title> can help to disentangle these interweaving questions of
                feeling and unfeeling in the sociological method. Indeed, the seventh book of
                <title level="m">The Prelude</title> has often struck readers as
                a kind of proximal origin for a tradition of urban sociological writing that
                includes figures like Engels and Simmel, though it of course shares neither the
                disciplinary nor the scientific ambitions of these later accounts of modern city
                life. Raymond Williams, for one, saw <title level="a">Residence in London</title> as “one of the major
                early records of new ways of seeing the city,” describing Wordsworth’s account of
                urban alienation as “the first expression of what has since become a dominant
                experience of the city” (150). In a whole range of later poets, novelists and
                sociologists, Williams identifies and describes a “way of seeing London that has a
                clear continuity from Wordsworth,” which stems from “the sense of paradox: that in
                the great city itself, the very place and agency—or so it would seem—of collective
                consciousness, it is an absence of common feeling, an excessive subjectivity, that
                seems to be characteristic” (215). Less attuned to the historical development of
                this structure of feeling, Steven Marcus likewise finds “similar if not identical
                tendencies” in Engels’s, Simmel’s, and Wordsworth’s accounts of urban life (148).
                This critical consensus continues to characterize more recent criticism, as well.
                For instance, James Chandler and Kevin Gilmartin have persuasively detailed the
                affinities between <title level="a">Residence in London</title> and later social theoretical accounts of
                the modern metropolis, most notably Walter Benjamin’s writings on Baudelaire’s Paris
                and Simmel’s on Berlin; while Eugene Stelzig argues that “the negative presentation
                of the city of London in Book 7 of
                <title level="m">The Prelude </title> is part of a larger and
                well-known literary typecasting, Romantic <emph>and</emph> Modern, that scripts the city as a
                site of extreme alienation and even a kind of necropolis” (184).</p>
               <p>More specifically, readers of <title level="m">The
                    Prelude</title> have long noted the precision with which Wordsworth details the
                aspects of the experience of alienation that would come to seem characteristic in
                the century after his writing. Foremost among these are the sense that one is
                surrounded by and yet cut off from others—that Londoners live “even next-door
                neighbours (as we say) yet still / Strangers, and not knowing each other’s names”
                (1805, 7.119–20); and the sense that all sociality has been reduced to economic
                exchange—and that consumption and production have been fundamentally confused “amid
                that concourse of mankind / Where Pleasure whirls about incessantly, / And life and
                labour seem but one” (1850, 7.69–81). As in later accounts of alienation, Wordsworth
                also describes the emotional deformation and inauthenticity of city life, “where the
                human heart is sick” and one lives “among the wretched and the falsely gay” (1805,
                13.202, 7.396). The general movement is outward, from the recognition of the city as
                a space of overwhelming sensory confusion—“the quick dance / Of colours, lights, and
                forms; the Babel din; The endless stream of men, and moving things”—to the analysis
                of that sensory experience as part of a broader social phenomenon that transcends
                mere loneliness and perceptual overstimulation (1805, 7.162–4). This complex account
                of urban alienation finds its figure most famously in the poet’s confrontation with
                a blind beggar, whose explanatory placard seems to Wordsworth “a type / Or emblem of
                the utmost that we know / Both of ourselves and of the universe,” and whose
                disfiguration and isolation have long been taken by critics to represent
                Wordsworth’s most focused mediation on the social as well as the existential
                conditions of an incipient modernity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See for instance Hertz, <title level="a">The Notion of Blockage in the Literature of the Sublime,</title> and Friedman, <title level="a">History in the Background of Wordsworth’s ‘Blind Beggar.’</title>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The language of disgust supplies Wordsworth with a
                negative moral-sensory rhetoric that allows him to articulate the unwantedness of
                his experiences of the city. For instance, in the passage mentioned earlier, the
                poet describes the funhouse mayhem of London’s Bartholomew Fair “as if the whole
                were one vast mill, / …vomiting, receiving on all sides, / Men, women, three-years’
                children, babes in arms” (7.692–4). This figure of the city as a churning mill
                consuming and then spewing forth a stream of people is in keeping with Wordsworth’s
                numerous other epithets for London’s fallen world, most notably “parliament of
                monsters” (1805, 7.691) and, in the 1850 revision, “huge fermenting mass of
                human-kind” (1850, 7.621) and “monstrous ant-hill on the plain / Of a too busy
                world” (1850, 7.149–50). These grotesque epithets register the poet’s sensory
                revulsion as well as his moral disapprobation towards the crowded city and the
                undifferentiated “swarm of its inhabitants” (7.698). In the view of the poem, the
                metropolis is overeating and vomiting; it is yeasted, at once outgrowing itself and
                rotting; it is a teeming swarm of bugs. The negative affective charge of these
                epithets extends to the whole narrative of <title level="a">Residence in London</title>: Wordsworth gives
                readers a vivid image of London, but it is an image filtered through a condemnatory
                rhetoric of revulsion and sensory outrage; we see the city, but as an unwanted
                sight.</p>
               <p>It is possible to see in Wordsworth’s rhetoric of
                disgust a crystallization of precisely the kind of emotional prejudice that
                sociologists later in the century would describe as an impediment to the accurate
                knowledge of social life. The normative quality of the emotion influences the
                description of social perception to such an extent that it becomes difficult to
                separate the one from the other in the text. At the same time, the grotesque
                characterization of the city comes to seem, from this angle, like something
                projected onto the city, rather than something revealed by the poet’s insight. And
                indeed, even in his own day—and even to those who knew him—Wordsworth’s overwhelming
                antipathy for the city could seem inordinate and out of place. Charles Lamb, for
                instance, observes that “the very deformities of London, which give distaste to
                others, do not displease me. The endless succession of shops…excite in me no
                puritanical aversion. I gladly behold every appetite supplied with its proper food.
                The obliging customer, and the obliged tradesman…do not affect me with disgust…I
                love the very smoke of London.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a discussion of Lamb’s letter, see James A.W. Heffernan, <title level="a">Wordsworth’s London: The Imperial Monster.</title>
                  </note> Published in the
                <title level="j">Morning Post</title> in 1802 but adapted from a
                letter he had written to Wordsworth the year before, Lamb’s column anticipates
                <title level="a">Residence in London</title> almost point by point. The column takes aim at precisely the
                kind of strong aversive reaction to London that Wordsworth’s poem would reenact in
                1805, and it does so principally by attributing disgust to the unaccustomed
                spectator or outsider, for whom the mere sight of excessive consumption is
                repulsive. Disgust, distaste and aversion, Lamb suggests, cloud one’s perception of
                city life, deforming the way that social relations appear. More significantly, one’s
                disgust offers up powerful judgments, rooted in habituation, that nonetheless
                masquerade as neutral perceptions. “From habit I perceive nothing but urbanity,” he
                writes, “where other men, more refined, discover meanness.”</p>
               <p>I want to pause here to take stock of our discussion so
                far. In this section, I have outlined three components of what we might call the
                structure of unwanted feeling in Wordsworth’s poem of London. First, there is what
                has generally been understood by literary critics as Wordsworth’s anticipation of
                later influential accounts of urban alienation. Second, there is Wordsworth’s
                rhetorical presentation of his account of London through a condemnatory language of
                disgust, which draws on the conventions of the grotesque. And finally, there is
                Lamb’s allegation that disgust might be an unreliable guide to the city, insofar as
                it projects characterizations onto the social that are based solely on the
                habituated emotional reactions, or habitus, of the spectator. In what remains of
                this section, I want to contrast this structure of feeling with the genealogical
                problem I outlined at the opening of this essay. To recall, there were two contrary
                sides to that problem. The first was that feeling came to seem, by the close of the
                nineteenth century, like something that needed to be rooted out from the
                sociological method, whereas the second was that the strong, excessive feeling of
                disgust had come over the course of the same historical period to be identified with
                the deformation or absence of feeling constitutive of modern alienation.</p>
               <p>Contrasting the structure of feeling with the
                genealogical problem can help to illuminate several historical shifts and
                transformations that have otherwise remained indistinct in the critical consensus
                concerning the influence of <title level="a">Residence in London</title> on later city writing. For if
                Wordsworth’s account of alienation is understood to have anticipated and even
                structured later accounts, then what are we to make of the allegedly distorting
                quality of his disgust? Conversely, the fact of Wordsworth’s disgust towards the
                fallen world of London can hardly account for the later identification of repulsion
                with alienation. Instead, the rhetorical function of disgust in <title level="a">Residence of
                London</title> would seem to be Wordsworth’s insistence on maintaining a distance from what
                he disapprovingly sees. Whereas a century later Simmel would yoke together “feelings
                of strangeness and mutual repulsion,” in Wordsworth there is hardly even a minimal
                identification of his own feelings of moral and sensory disapproval with the
                sickness of the human heart those feelings serve to identify and diagnose. Reading
                Wordsworth’s poem in the context of later sociological accounts of city life is
                useful, then, not so much because it anticipates the latter as because it shows us
                how much would have to change over the course of the nineteenth century, even to the
                point of inversion, in order to arrive at the conceptually conflicted state of
                affairs out of which modern social theory emerged. On the one hand, the opposition
                between two seemingly opposed affective states would have to collapse, while on the
                other hand, the dependence of an entire habitus or observational mood on the
                evidence of strong and unwanted feelings would have to be overcome or disavowed.</p>
               <p>Much of what I am describing will come into sharp focus
                only by staging different scenes of sociological repulsion diachronically and
                analyzing its diverse rhetorical functions throughout the long nineteenth century.
                As we will see in the next section on Engels, my emphasis falls on change over time,
                rather than anticipation and continuity, though it is important to stress the
                continuities as well. Before moving on, however, I want to spend a bit more time
                with Wordsworth’s figure of London as a “vast mill” devouring and then vomiting out
                its inhabitants, and to suggest that this ambiguous figure does in fact illuminate
                something about the eventual conflation of repulsion with estrangement within
                sociological discourse. To recall, Wordsworth’s image is fundamentally one of
                confusion. After enumerating all of Bartholomew Fair’s “freaks of nature… / All
                jumbled up together to make up / This parliament of monsters,” the figure of the
                mill “vomiting, receiving, on all sides” suggests an inability to distinguish
                between comers and goers to the freak show, between lurid spectacle and grotesque
                spectator (1805, 7.688–91). This “blank confusion,” Wordsworth goes on, exemplifies
                “what the mighty city is itself”: a place in which distinctions between consumption,
                production, and excretion have been effaced, just as earlier in the poem a panorama
                painter is described as “with his greedy pencil taking in / A whole horizon on all
                sides,” as though the very implements of creativity and production were themselves
                the means of consumption.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For an extensive analysis of the panoramas in <title level="a">Residence in London</title> as well as in Walter Benjamin’s <title level="m">Arcades Project</title>, see Chandler and Gilmartin’s contextualizing discussion of Thomas Girton’s 1801 <title level="m">Eidometropolis</title> and P.J.

                                a more granular narrative of the particular processes by which the
                                panoramic cityscape came to supplant the panoramic landscape, as the
                                relationship between country and city
                    transformed.</note> In the vomiting mill, we are led to believe,
                making devolves into making waste, eating into excreting, using into destroying, and
                pleasure into repulsion—it is a place where opposing processes have become
                identical, and even the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the organic (vomiting)
                and the industrial (mill) no longer seems so absolute.</p>
               <p>Another principal confusion embedded in Wordsworth’s
                figure is between the expression and the object of disgust, or between disgust and
                the disgusting. Indeed, it is one of the singular features of the emotion of disgust
                that vomiting—its paradigmatic form of expression—is often deemed in its own
                right to be an object of disgust. This is in part because of the emotion’s
                association with the lowly parts of the body, with the belly and its wastes, which
                perhaps stems from the primary confusion of boundaries and of organic functions that
                is inherent to the physiological experience of the emotion; few other emotions,
                after all, can throw the basic directionality of the digestive system fully into
                    reverse.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a good introduction to the
                                psycho-physiology of disgust, see Rozin and Fallon, <title level="a">A Perspective
                                on Disgust.</title>
                  </note> In this vein, Denise Gigante
                observes of the figure of the vomiting mill that “Wordsworth seems to have learned .
                . . that a powerful way to demonize someone is to portray him or her not in the act
                of logocentric expression but in a parodic version of unsignifying emission” (97).
                Yet beyond this denigrative function, I believe we can see in Wordsworth’s figure
                the rudimentary elements of the sociological association of repulsion with
                alienation, of excess feeling with pathological unfeeling. The confusion here
                requires a more complex understanding of the projection of disgust than that which
                Lamb described. Now it is not simply that the poet’s unwanted feelings color his way
                of seeing social phenomena, but that this reflux of unwanted emotion itself is
                poured out into “the vast receptacle” of London, coming to serve as a derogatory
                emblem of the city conceived as a whole. And even this does not quite fully capture
                the slippery, recursive character of this dynamic, in which what is projected is in
                its own right an image of projection or misplaced expulsion, as the metropolis
                extrudes itself.<note place="foot" resp="author"> It is important to note as well that Wordsworth’s strange, concatenated figure is a personification, and a more sustained analysis of this specific rhetorical structure would lead us down two distinct but mutually-reinforcing paths. First, historically speaking, after Wordsworth, variations of this grotesque figure of the city as a vomiting body would reemerge in certain strains of nineteenth-century social theory that stressed precisely the organic character of the so-called “social organism.” Marx, for instance, compares the processes of capital (production, circulation, etc.) to the “change of form and matter…in the organic body,” going on to detail the different rates of change at which a body sheds or repulses [the German word is once again <foreign xml:lang="de">Abstoßen</foreign>] and replenishes its “flesh, blood” and even its “skeleton.” See: Marx, <foreign xml:lang="de">
                        <title level="m">Grundrisse</title>
                     </foreign>, 661. Second, there is also an important psychological and psychoanalytic tradition of theorizing disgust as an uncannily “animistic” emotion. “The meaning of the disgusting object often includes some animistic notions,” an influential study of the 1940s observes, “It is not regarded as belonging to the class of inorganic matter but as something related to life, as something ‘almost living’ which has the tendency or is endowed with the capacity to sneak up on, and to penetrate, the body in some unnatural way.” See: Angyal, <title level="a">Disgust and Related Aversions,</title> 397. Were there time to do so, this animistic psychological theory of disgust could be traced back to the British and German aesthetic theory of the second half of the eighteenth century and hence brought into even closer contact with Wordsworth’s rhetoric of grotesque personification. See, for instance, Menninghaus, <title level="m"> Disgust</title>, 25–101.</note>
                In this early nineteenth-century image, then, we see an association just barely
                forged between disgust and alienation, as well as a repudiation of feeling that is
                also in some manner an excess feeling.</p>
               <p>We can understand these shifts in the relationship
                between feeling and unfeeling over the course of the whole nineteenth century more
                precisely if we now turn to the analysis of city life at midcentury. Indeed, the
                five decades between Wordsworth’s first stabs at
                <title level="m">The Prelude</title> and its publication in 1850
                saw major upheavals in the writing and practice of social observation and analysis.
                In the first place, the bug-eyed sensory outrage of the figure in the city, which
                had been a source of innovation in Wordsworth’s poem, had by midcentury become a
                generalized feature of social investigation literature. Even in the most systematic
                and theoretically sophisticated proto-sociological texts of the mid-nineteenth
                century, disgust now appeared as the characteristic affective response of the
                bourgeois social investigator to unwanted social realities of the city. Moreover,
                what had been a relatively undefined aesthetic field of moral and sensory revulsion
                in Wordsworth now appeared unequivocally under the aegis of disgust. From Edwin
                Chadwick’s sanitary report to Friedrich Engels’s survey of Britain’s industrial
                towns, the explicit appeal to disgust at midcentury had developed into a dependable
                rhetorical technique. Most significantly, the appeal to disgust carried with it an
                implicit yet powerful expectation that collectively shared sense experience could
                serve as a basis for social agreement. In public discourse across a variety of
                genres and media, the appeal to disgust served to galvanize a public around a social
                or even civilizational wrong. In this regard the revolted spectator resembled what
                Lauren Berlant describes as “the subject of true feeling”: a wounded subject whose
                affective experiences lay claim to a “hard-wired truth, a core of common sense [that
                places it] beyond ideology, beyond mediation, beyond contestation” (<title level="m">True Feeling</title> 47).<note place="foot" resp="author">For a closely related discussion, also see
                                Berlant, <title level="a">The Epistemology of State

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>In contrast, midcentury also saw decisive developments
                in the social sciences that tugged the still-coalescing sociological method away
                from its rhetorical dependency on the “true feeling” of disgust, and indeed away
                from the articulation of feeling in general. The most salient among these changes
                were advances in statistical analysis by Adolphe Quetelet in France, and Robert
                Jones, Charles Babbage, and T.R. Malthus and others in the Statistical Society of
                London; this burgeoning field was itself developing out of an increasing awareness
                that the subjectivity of individual perspectives rendered them incapable of
                accounting for changes in the social whole.<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Susan Faye Cannon has put it, statistics developed out of “an intricate dovetailing of inherited, ideological, moral, socioeconomic, intellectual and personal factors,” including” a heritage from the Enlightenment….a realization that great social changes were taking place that no one understood as a whole…a conclusion that social reform was needed but could not be justified without evidence…a desire to refute Ricardo and a general dissatisfaction with the deductive school of social theorists” (<title level="m">Science in Culture</title>, (240–4). Goldman quotes Cannon and expands on her discussion in <title level="a">The Origins of British ‘Social Science.’</title> Also see Porter, <title level="m">The Rise of Statistical
                            Thinking</title>.</note> This sense of
                the partiality of the individual perspective also underwrote the various critiques
                of political economy that emerged in the 1840s, most notably in Marx’s and Engels’s
                writings. Marxist social theorists often note a decades-long shift in Marx and
                Engel’s thought away from their early humanistic focus on the worker’s alienation
                and deformed subjectivity in the 1840s towards the objective analysis of his or her
                exploitation and the extraction of surplus value in <title level="m">Capital</title>
                (1867). However, even in Marx’s early writings on alienation, one sees for the first
                time the analysis of feeling [<emph>
                     <foreign xml:lang="de">fühlen</foreign>
                  </emph>] as a mutable social
                phenomenon subject to historical variation as well as change under political and
                economic pressure. This transformation of emotion and subjectivity into an object of
                analysis was, to recall Durkheim’s observation, representative of the overall
                development of the social sciences throughout the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>Engels’s 1845 social survey of Britain’s industrial
                towns epitomizes this double movement in sociology, at once towards and away from
                the appeal to feeling as an epistemological basis for knowledge of the social. “The
                very turmoil of the streets has something repulsive [<emph>
                     <foreign xml:lang="de">etwas
                    Widerliches</foreign>
                  </emph>],” he writes in <title level="m">The Condition of the Working
                    Class in England</title>, “something against which human nature rebels”
                (36–7). What follows this
                articulation of disgust is one of the century’s most influential descriptions of
                urban alienation, culminating in Engels’s indictment of “the social war, the war of
                each against all,” and of capital, “the weapon with which this social warfare is
                carried on”:<quote>
            The very turmoil of the streets has something repulsive,
                something against which human nature rebels. The hundreds of thousands of all
                classes and ranks crowding past each other, are they not all human beings with the
                same qualities and powers, and with the same interest in being happy? And have they
                not, in the end, to seek happiness in the same way, by the same means? And still
                they crowd by one another as though they had nothing in common, nothing to do with
                one another, and their only agreement is the tacit one, that each keep to his own
                side of the pavement . . . while it occurs to no man to honour another with so much
                as a glance. The brutal indifference, the unfeeling isolation of each in his private
                interest becomes the more repellent and offensive, the more these individuals are
                crowded together, within a limited space. And, however much one may be aware that
                this isolation of the individual, this narrow self-seeking is this fundamental
                principle of our society everywhere, it is nowhere so shamelessly barefaced, so
                self-conscious as just here in the crowding of the great city. The dissolution of
                man into monads, of which each one has a separate principle and a separate purpose,
                the world of atoms, is here carried out to its utmost extreme.</quote>
            Much has been written about the vision of London and of
                capitalism that Engels offers in this passage, but I wish specifically to
                characterize the disgust that Engels articulates towards the alienation of the
                crowded streets of the city. Disgust, according to Engels, is the rebellion of human
                nature against the inhumanity of this historical state of “crude solitariness” that
                masks the violence of social warfare. The emotion rejects the inhuman social
                organization under capitalist political economy, the “discord of identical
                interests” that permits people to “regard each other only as useful objects,” by
                opposing it to a collective morality grounded in a shared human nature. What stands
                out foremost in this passage is the implicit expectation of disgust’s unique
                persuasiveness as a mode of response. Held up as the token of an underlying “human
                nature” in revolt against industrial capitalism, the emotion lays claim to a
                quasi-instinctual authenticity and force. Who could argue, Engels seems to ask, with
                the commonsense of disgust? The invocation of repulsion is in this sense meant to
                place Engels’s analysis beyond contestation in precisely the way Berlant attributes
                to the appeal to “true feeling.” Moreover, Engels means for his repulsion to
                evidence the ideological character of social life in the capitalist metropolis.
                Disgust is how we come to know that there is something wrong, something lurking
                behind the indifference of the metropolis. It is through the rhetorical presentation
                of his repulsion that Engels lays bare the emotional fragmentation that follows from
                the saturation of social relations by capital. We are in this sense far off from
                Durkheim’s notion of a repugnance that precludes social analysis. To the contrary,
                disgust here appears to play a necessary role in revealing society’s true
                nature.</p>
               <p>Engels’s account of the “offensive and repellant” nature
                of economic alienation establishes an antithesis between the two affective states.
                On the one hand there is “brutally indifferent” life in the metropolis—emotionless,
                artificial, monadic, and gray; on the other hand, there is the disgust of the
                bourgeois observer—unwanted but alive, human nature itself in revolt. Whereas life
                in the alienated city shuttles between the neutral and the negative, Engels here
                tacitly refers us to a full-throated wholeness or human essence that has not been
                drained of its vitality. However, I want to stress the new proximity that Engels
                establishes here between disgust and alienation, rather than their overt and
                conventional opposition. What is unique to Engels’s formulation is the implicit
                analogical relationship he establishes between his own repulsion and the alienation
                it diagnoses. Disgust is not only the proper, the natural, and the automatic
                response to the ravages of industrial capitalism, but it is also in a sense a
                reflection, however distorted, of the affective state of alienated life under this
                new mode of social organization.</p>
               <p>If we fast forward fifty years to Simmel’s analysis of
                metropolitan repulsion, or a full century to Sartre’s existentialist nausea, we see
                that this analogy progressively takes on the status of a commonplace. Alienation,
                    <emph>anomie</emph>, <emph>
                     <foreign xml:lang="it">la noia</foreign>
                  </emph>, <emph>angst</emph>, gradually
                become entangled, if not fully interchangeable, with <emph>
                     <foreign xml:lang="fr">la

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">taedium vitae</foreign>
                  </emph>, attraction-repulsion,
                primary repression, and other states of low-grade negativity that explicitly take
                disgust as their basis. This is not so in Engels, for whom the diagnosis of
                alienation depends on disgust without yet being fully identified with it. But
                repulsion is now specifically named as the unwanted affective response through which
                the alienation of the individual under the modern social system becomes
                recognizable; the points of contact between the two states are already becoming
                clear. I am suggesting that, historically speaking, part of the work Engels
                accomplishes in this passage is to establish a discursive link between his own
                excessive feeling and the pathological unfeeling he diagnoses. If social theory
                wound up conceptualizing repulsion as a fundamental truth of human relationships, it
                was precisely because disgust had already been so closely associated with the
                analysis of social life. Indeed, the sociologist’s disgust already claimed an
                affective and epistemological authority over the experience of the observed, such
                that Engels’s repulsion comes to seem like the missing truth of Londoners’
                alienation, a complement to their emotional deformation. The disgust of the
                bourgeois observer was the frame within which the experience of the observed could
                appear. </p>
               <p>In order to satisfy the increasingly scientific
                aspirations of disciplinary sociology, this disgust had to migrate from the observer
                to the observed, from the method of inquiry to the object of study, without
                abandoning the posture of observational authority. From one angle, this process
                clearly resembles the rooting out of feeling from method that the fin de siècle
                sociologists called for: affect’s shift from criterion of truth to scholarly object.
                Social science cannot depend on the feelings of the observer—this much was already
                apparent to Engels, though he had not fully processed it. One can feel the method of
                analysis pulling Engels in two opposing directions, at once towards the burning
                evidence of unwanted feeling, and the cold truths of inhumane political economic
                structures, which themselves find a strange reflection in the demand for an
                anaesthetized social science.</p>
               <p>But I also want to insist that there is something
                surreptitious about this transfer of affect, according to which the characteristic
                moral-visceral outrage of the bourgeois sociologist comes to be generalized as the
                innermost nature of the social itself. When Simmel writes that without “feelings of
                mutual strangeness and repulsion…we could not imagine what form modern urban
                life…might possibly take,” it would not be mistaken to say that he attributes what
                had been Engels’s vexed identification with the sight of industrial alienation to
                his own generalized definition of modern social relationships in the metropolis.
                From this perspective, feeling is not so much extracted from sociology as it is
                buried within it or projected onto the social domain—more concretely and directly
                here than in Wordsworth’s figure of the vomiting mill. Only a decade after Engels’s
                stated opposition between disgust and alienation, for example, Marx would turn to
                the language of repulsion [<emph>
                     <foreign xml:lang="de">Abstoßung</foreign>
                  </emph>] in order to theorize
                the social antagonism that binds people to their class.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The language recurs throughout Marx’s discussion of antagonism in the <title level="m">

                                Marx’s dissertation had in fact delved deeply into the topic of
                                physical repulsion—at the level of the atom—in the philosophical
                                theories of Democritus and Epicurus. Unlike Epicurus, Marx accused
                                Democritus of having seen “in repulsion only the material side, the
                                fragmentation, the change, and not the ideal side, according to
                                which all relation to something else is negated and motion is
                                established as self-determination.” Quoted in Stedman Jones,<title level="m">Karl Marx: Greatness and
                                Illusion</title>, 81.</note> What could hardly have been meant as much more than a
                rhetorical convention rooted in uninterrogated beliefs about the grammar of
                sensation in Engels came to be inscribed as a core tenet of sociological and social
                theoretical discourse, as disgust
                <emph>towards</emph> alienation was slowly
                reconstituted as disgust
                <emph>as</emph> alienation.</p>
               <p>“[T]here is no science,” Durkheim writes, in the passage
                with which I opened this essay: "Which at its beginnings has not encountered similar
                resistances. There was a time when those feelings relating to the things of the
                physical world, since they also possessed a religious or moral character, opposed no
                less violently the establishment of the physical sciences. Thus, one can believe
                that, rooted out from one science after another, this prejudice will finally
                disappear from sociology as well, its last refuge, and leave the field clear for the
                scientist" (<title level="m">Rules</title> 40). Contra Durkheim, I have been arguing
                that the role disgust played in this process of rooting out emotional bias and
                superstition from the social scientific method cannot be explained straightforwardly
                in the terms of a progressive narrative—although it may at first blush seem to do
                just that. As our examination of Wordsworth and Engels has suggested, the genealogy
                of sociological attraction-repulsion can be made to hew closely to Durkheim’s
                proposed trajectory, according to which an emotion that had been erroneously taken
                as a “criterion of scientific truth” by the innovative but prescientific fumblers of
                the mid-nineteenth century was gradually transformed into an “object for scientific
                study” that could be shown to “have been shaped through history” at the century’s
                close.</p>
               <p>But as I hope to have shown, this story of the hard-won
                isolation of social fact from subjective value raises more questions than it
                settles. Perhaps most crucially, we have seen precisely how difficult it is to
                disentangle fact from value within the structures of unwanted feeling that gave rise
                to modern sociology. To the contrary, the rhetoric of disgust would seem to suggest
                instead that certain features of social life can only become legible in the first
                place through the filter of the repulsion they inspire—that is, can only become
                legible as unwanted facts. And in this regard, the problem of disgust begins to look
                like a condensation of the basic problem of determining the composition of social
                scientific knowledge, as it related to what Weber referred to as the “hair-thin
                line” separating objective fact and subjective value. Weber thought it was the
                proximity of fact and value in the sociological domain that gave the field its
                unique character because he believed that all social phenomena depended on the prior
                positing of an underlying value that allowed them to become sensible and
                recognizable as phenomena in the first place. “The
                <emph>objective</emph> validity of all empirical
                knowledge,” he writes, “rests, and rests exclusively, upon the fact that the given
                reality is ordered according to categories that are in a specific sense <emph>subjective</emph>, in that they form the
                <emph>precondition</emph> of our knowledge, and that
                are based upon the presupposition of the <emph>value</emph> of that truth
                which empirical knowledge alone is able to give us” (<title level="m">Objectivity</title> 137). The task that Weber sees falling to the social sciences
                is to explore these meeting points where the acts of valuation, which are the
                precondition for knowledge of the social world, allow for the production of
                knowledge itself.</p>
               <p>What I have been arguing throughout this essay is that
                the function of disgust in the gradual and uneven distinction of the sociological
                from the literary domain represents precisely one of these hinges between value and
                fact, but one which in certain contexts has also been invested in the surreptitious
                disavowal of its own rootedness in subjective feeling. For with the unwanted fact of
                repulsion, the fact is constituted by the very strength of its empirical, sensory
                appeal; the fact that it is unwanted houses the fact that it is real. While from a
                certain perspective, disgust’s disturbance of the Enlightenment distinction between
                fact and value might be dismissed as irredeemably irrational, I suggest instead that
                precisely this disruptive power had an intensely generative effect on the entangled
                trajectories of literature and social science over the course of the nineteenth
                century. A literary history of disgust in the period (which would include but exceed
                the literary history of the city) that started out from Wordsworth’s vomiting mill
                would, however, look very different from the outline of the emergence of sociology
                and its disavowal of feeling that I have traced in this essay. Even the most
                insistently realist of literary texts depends on an implicit avowal of something
                like Weber’s point that the reality or truth of its world derives from the affective
                value with which it has been invested. Disgust held out to a great variety of
                nineteenth-century novelists and poets, as well as literary and aesthetic theorists,
                the promise of a medium for exploring the instability of the relationship between
                unwanted fact and negative value: a recurrent motif for Baudelaire, a plot device
                for Gissing—Walter Pater went so far as to assert that “the way to perfection lies
                through a series of disgusts” (103). For sociology, by contrast, disgust served as
                the uncredited source of a series of fundamental concepts and premises. Foremost
                among them was the very idea of the social life of the modern city itself: the
                rotten and fermenting city, the distended mill vomiting out its Malthusian hordes of
                alienated citizens. The need to be rid of the unwanted fact of the social was not
                merely a starting point for social analysis, but the affective logic according to
                which the basic objects of sociological discourse were initially rendered legible
                and distinct as objects rather than as experiences—the affective logic that, over
                the long term, gave rise to the birth of social theory from the spirit of
                disgust.</p>

                    In his abolitionist poem <title level="a">The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave 
                        Trade</title> (1799), Robert Southey ventriloquizes the story of a sailor who has 
                    murdered an enslaved woman onboard a “Guineaman.” Southey explains in a note to the poem 
                    that the sailor’s confession is a true story, which he wishes to make “as public as possible.” 
                    At the same time, however, Southey leaves many subtle clues that he is also imitating Samuel 
                    Taylor Coleridge’s ballad, “The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere” (1798). As he draws out the 
                    possibility that Coleridge’s mariner’s guilt is an allegory for the guilt involved in the 
                    Atlantic trade, Southey presses on the “public” uses the ballad form can be put to. A 
                    comparison between these poems therefore offers a case study for broader questions about 
                    the ethics of representation in abolitionist ballads designed to capture public feeling.</p>

               <p>In <title level="a">The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade</title>
                (1799), Robert Southey tells the story of a dissenting minister in Bristol who hears
                the confession of a sailor who has murdered an unnamed enslaved woman aboard a ship.
                The sequence of events that the poem narrates begins when the enslaved woman
                protests her subjugation by refusing her food. The captain of the ship orders the
                sailor to whip the woman in order to make her eat, but she continues to refuse food.
                The woman subsequently suffers torture so horrific that she dies from her wounds the
                following day. As the poem begins, the minister finds the sailor praying alone in a
                hovel. Although the sailor insists that the murder was unintentional, he registers his guilt
                in his descriptions of the way that the image of the dying woman follows him
                everywhere he goes. Finally, he begs the dissenting minister for
                help: “O give me comfort if you can— / Oh tell me where to fly / And bid me hope, if
                there be hope, / For one so lost as I” (lines 113–6).<note place="foot" resp="author"> All references to <title level="a">The Sailor</title>
                            are from the 1799 version of Southey’s poem, reprinted in <title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works, 1793–1810</title>, unless otherwise stated. As this edition
                            notes, <title level="a">The Sailor</title> was first published in <title level="m">Poems</title>
                            (1799), extensively revised for
                            <title level="m">Minor Poems</title> (1815, 1823),
                            and also included in
                            <title level="m">Poetical Works</title> (1837)
                            (288).</note> In the earliest version of the poem, the minister
                responds by encouraging the sailor to flee the hovel and instead go to find a church
                in which to pray for his sins. In the later versions, Southey has the minister join
                the sailor in prayer in the hovel and enjoins others to do the same.</p>
               <p>Implicit in this abolitionist narrative is a theory of
                how one individual's guilt might be converted into a public feeling, and how this, in turn, might inspire political action—alongside a series of ethical
                questions about what it means to use representations of the suffering of enslaved
                people in order to incite such feeling. Presumably, Southey believes that
                confronting people with this murder scene and its aftermath might convince them to
                adopt the abolitionist cause. Yet the ethics of Southey’s decision to use this story
                for abolitionist ends are deeply riven, since Southey himself, like the sailor,
                lacks empathy for the enslaved woman he represents. Not only does Southey refuse to grant
                her the dignity of a name; he also dehumanizes her when he instrumentalizes her pain for the benefit of his abolitionist audience. The abolitionist moral relies on the idea that
                forgiveness is still possible, not only for the sailor, but for British society as a
                whole—but this happens at the expense of the enslaved woman, who is not allowed any
                space to tell her own story. Marcus Wood has argued that <title level="a">The Sailor</title> is a “truly
                woeful ballad in every sense of the word . . . in which the slave inevitably emerges
                not as a suffering human but as a catalyst for the sailor ’s suffering” (201–2). By
                choosing to speak from the perspective of the sailor, rather than from the point of
                view of his victim, Southey capitulates to the biases of his majority-white
                audience.</p>
               <p>The complications surrounding Southey’s positionality in
                relation to this story multiply, however, when one realizes that this poem has been
                written in dialogue with Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s ballad, <title level="a">The Rime of the Ancyent
                Marinere, in Seven Parts</title> (1798).<note place="foot" resp="author"> All references to <title level="a">The Rime</title>
                            are from the 1798 edition of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>
                            in <title level="m">Coleridge’s Poetry and Prose</title>.</note>
                At first glance, Southey’s graphic narration of the murder of an enslaved woman
                appears to have very little in common with Coleridge’s poem: a supernatural tale
                that depicts a series of strange events leading on from the moment the mariner
                shoots an albatross. Yet the <title level="a">Rime,</title> at its root, is another
                ballad about a lonely sailor who has committed sins at sea and thus becomes obsessed
                with his own guilt, even if his crime differs vastly in scale from that of Southey’s sailor.
                Both the sailor and the mariner ask for sympathy, even as they refuse to reflect on
                their responsibility for their actions. Focused on the past and unable to engage
                with the present, they each inhabit a different temporality from the people they
                encounter and are isolated by their compulsive storytelling. Just as the ancient
                mariner sees spirits aboard his Spectre-Bark, Southey’s sailor is haunted by “the
                wicked one” (line 106) everywhere he goes. Finally, while Southey’s sailor asks the
                dissenting minister for help, Coleridge depicts the mariner asking the hermit to
                shrieve him (“Oh shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!” (line 607)); both the sailor and
                the mariner, (at least in the 1799 version of Southey’s poem), end up at church.</p>
               <p>Southey directly echoes Coleridge’s diction several
                times, suggesting he was inviting his audience to hear echoes of the <title level="a">Rime</title> in his
                poem. The mariner’s reflection on the moment he shoots the albatross, “And I had
                done a hellish thing” (line 89), clearly resounds in two of Southey’s sailor’s
                outbursts; “Oh I have done a wicked thing! / It haunts me night and day” (line 25),
                and “Oh I have done a cursed deed!” (line 53). The sailor stresses that the hovel he
                inhabits is “lonely” (line 26), just as the mariner stresses that he is “all alone”
                on the ship (line 224). Southey advertised his imitation of Coleridge much more
                boldly in 1815 than in 1799, when he changed his poem’s first line to read “It was a
                Christian Minister” (in order to directly echo the first line of Coleridge’s poem,
                “It was an Ancient Mariner”). Although these echoes are easy to catalogue, however, the
                question of what Southey might have meant to communicate in these echoes of the <title level="a">Rime</title> is
                more difficult to answer. In what follows, I argue that the changes Southey makes to Coleridge’s poem in his imitation reveal a fundamental difference in his methodological stance toward the cultivation of public feeling. Although the ballad might intuitively be called a “public” form, each poet imagines the way that this form mediates the relationship between the characters in the ballad and their audiences very differently.</p>
               <p>The question of whether Southey understood himself to be
                translating the subject matter of Coleridge’s poem to an entirely new context, or
                whether he aimed to bring its underlying abolitionist message to the fore is
                debatable, though by now, it is commonly (though not universally) accepted that
                Coleridge’s poem can already be read as an abolitionist allegory in itself.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Malcolm Ware referenced Southey’s poem when he first made this claim.
                            William Empson, Barbara T. Paul-Emile, Patrick Keane, Peter Kitson, and
                            Debbie Lee have also explored the status of Coleridge’s poem as
                            antislavery allegory. Marcus Wood objects to the argument that Coleridge
                            thought of his poem as an abolitionist text, however, calling that
                            argument a failed experiment. Emphasizing Coleridge’s superior sense of
                            tact in avoiding the subject of slavery, Wood argues that Coleridge
                            understood “the essential selfishness of the cult of sensibility, and of
                            its inappropriateness as an imaginative resource for interpreting
                            slavery” in a way that Southey did not (219).</note>
                Coleridge’s mariner’s overwhelming sense of guilt, as several critics have noted,
                seems disproportionate to his crime of shooting the albatross and so might be best
                explained by his repressed confession of involvement in the triangular trade.<note place="foot" resp="author"> John
                            Livingston Lowes argues that the ancient mariner’s “punishment, measured
                            by the standards of a world of balanced penalties, palpably does not fit
                            the crime” (274–5), yet, through the lens of Ware’s argument, the
                            ancient mariner’s fascination with his guilt becomes more appropriate.</note> Southey’s imitation means that he was in effect the first
                critic to note this. His ability to see the allegory at work in the <title level="a">Rime</title> was
                likely informed by his friendship with Coleridge during the time they had both spent
                living in Bristol in the mid-1790s. In 1795, Southey had witnessed Coleridge give
                his <title level="a">On the Slave Trade</title> lecture in Bristol and was also making plans with him to
                emigrate to America to build a new Pantisocratic community. Their plans for their
                utopian society unraveled over time, partly because Southey wanted to take servants
                to the banks of the Susquehanna. This paved the way for further poetic
                disagreements. By October 1798, Southey’s review of the <title level="a">Rime</title> in the <title level="j">Critical Review</title> publicly accused Coleridge of being too
                obscure (“We do not sufficiently understand the story to analyze it . . . ”). This
                negative review is one of the things that Southey became best known for in the
                twentieth century, as Lynda Pratt has observed, and has therefore had a
                disproportionate influence on how his own poem has been read<note place="foot" resp="author">Lynda Pratt, “Introduction: Robert Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism,” Robert Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism. Routledge 2016, xviii.</note>.</p>
               <p>Because Coleridge’s poem is much longer and more complex
                than Southey’s—with its supernatural themes, mythic elements, and confusing
                symbolism—discussions of Southey’s imitation of Coleridge have tended to argue that
                he simplified his source text. Southey has often been characterized as a more
                “public” poet than Coleridge.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Simon Bainbridge emphasizes Southey’s role as “public” poet when he
                            argues that, “Marilyn Butler has presented the political, public Southey
                            as an alternative exemplary Romantic figure to the Wordsworth that she
                            sees constructed by the quietest, intellectual agendas of the academy”
                            (Butler, <title level="a">Repossessing</title> 64–84).” Bainbridge himself argues that Southey
                            offers “a manifesto for a different poetic mode to the one normally
                            defined as Romantic, one that is politically committed and speaks with
                            what Southey terms in another poem of 1798 ‘the calm, collected public
                            voice’” (Bainbridge par. 2).</note> As Mary Jacobus puts it, in
                an influential 1971 article on <title level="a">Southey’s Debt to the <title level="m">Lyrical
                    Ballads</title>
                  </title>: <quote>What is idiosyncratic or disturbing in the poetry of
                Wordsworth and Coleridge is replaced by a topical or humanitarian interest of a
                quite straightforward kind: the poems become not simply shallower, but more public…
                A generalized, symbolic study of guilt and alienation [in <title level="a">The Rime</title>] becomes an
                anti-slave-trade poem, its theme given immediate topical resonance and its
                underlying moral emphasis made explicit. Gothic accretions and psychological depth
                are stripped away to leave horror of an entirely straightforward kind. (30) </quote>
            Jacobus also stresses that Southey’s style is defined by his magazine audience—“In
                some cases, poems from <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> are returned firmly to
                the level of the magazine poetry from which they had been raised, stripped of their
                new thematic depth and sophistication” (24)—and notes that Southey might also have
                been offering his poem as a corrective to the complexity of the <title level="a">Rime.</title> “One has to concede that his… borrowings represent a
                deliberate attempt to put right what he had criticized in his review” (24), Jacobus
                concludes. This argument has been very influential in readings of the poem. For
                instance, Patrick Keane concurs that his ballad is a “straightforward” version of
                Coleridge’s poem (158). Christopher Smith sees the poem as “an answer to Coleridge”
                (par. 3), arguing that “Southey converts the disturbing open-endedness of Wordsworth
                and Coleridge’s work to sententious, clear-cut, rapidly-moving stories, or emblems
                of suffering” (par. 8). Chris Rubenstein argues that “Either Southey in his poem
                tells us . . . what Coleridge ought to have written in the ‘Rime;’ or he writes—and
                I prefer this alternative—what he is reasonably certain Coleridge had in mind” (24).
                More recently, David Chandler has aimed to correct this consensus by offering
                Southey’s poem <title level="a">The Old Woman of Berkeley</title> as a more persuasive “answer” to
                Coleridge’s poem, arguing <quote> There is no reason to question Southey’s assertion that his ballad was inspired by a
                real story (<title level="m">Poems</title> 105), however, and if that story was, in
                the telling, fertilized with ideas from <title level="a">The Ancient Mariner,</title> it does not mean that
                Southey conceived of it as an “answer” to the problems he found in Coleridge’s poem.
                As he fully accepted and happily contributed to the genre of the supernatural
                ballad, he must have realized that a political, “natural” ballad like <title level="a">The Sailor</title>
                was generically too distinct from <title level="a">The Ancient Mariner</title> to challenge plausibly
                Coleridge’s experiment. (par. 5)</quote>
               </p>
               <p>A tendency to criticize the simplistic nature of
                Southey’s didactic poem is balanced with a generalized sense of admiration for
                Coleridge’s psychologically subtle approach to the representation of guilt in the
                critical conversation about the possibility of an abolitionist allegory in the
                “Rime.” Coleridge has been lauded for his success at cultivating a disturbing
                feeling of identification with the mariner’s guilt in his audience, precisely
                because he avoids describing why the mariner shoots the albatross, or what this
                action might signify.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See, for instance, Tim Fulford: “distancing himself
                            from contemporary events allowed Coleridge to find terms which would let
                            readers share the mental state that, he argued, was produced by, and in
                            turn reproduced, those events” (50). See also Joan Baum, who argues in a
                            reading of Wordsworth’s poem on Toussaint L’Ouverture that “the genius
                            of Romantic poetry is to avoid palpable or overt moral purpose, and
                            explore the imaginative consciousness of both the poet and humanity”
                            (146).</note> This argument has a different logic when read in
                conversation with criticism of Southey’s poem, however, than when read in relation
                to Coleridge’s poem alone. The juxtaposition reveals a strange paradox, whereby <title level="a">The
                Rime</title> has not only been called a more successful poem than <title level="a">The Sailor,</title> but has
                also subtly been framed as a more successful abolitionist poem—despite never
                directly mentioning the topic of slavery. Considering how many people have read and
                discussed the <title level="a">Rime</title> without referencing the context of Atlantic slavery, however,
                questions remain about how useful the generalized sense of guilt that Coleridge
                summons was to the project of abolition.</p>
               <p>The critical consensus that Southey’s poem is simplistic
                also requires reconsideration, since Southey complicates the status of Coleridge’s
                poem as abolitionist allegory while simplifying its underlying plot. For instance,
                he often seems to read Coleridge’s poem psychoanalytically, suggesting that Coleridge’s use of supernatural imagery might be read as a sign of the way
                that mention of the Atlantic trade has been repressed in the poem. In <title level="a">The Rime,</title> a “million
                million slimy things” haunt the ancient mariner’s field of vision after the mass
                death of the ship’s crew (lines 227–35); this image resurfaces in Southey’s
                description of the way that the enslaved woman’s dead body seems to refuse to sink
                after she has been thrown overboard. This perhaps implies that Coleridge was himself
                repressing a reference to the murdered bodies of enslaved people in his description
                of the “rotting sea” (line 232). Southey further excavates the unconscious of
                Coleridge’s poem by drawing a connection between the way the sailor describes his
                torture of the enslaved woman and the vision of his crime that later haunts him.
                Southey uses the verb “twist” twice; first to describe the enslaved woman’s pain—
                “She twisted from the blows” (line 81), and then later to describe how the sailor
                sees his victim’s dead body “twisting everywhere” in the water, long after the sea
                has closed “over her” (line 101). He thereby suggests there is a connection between
                the symbolic vehicle the sailor’s guilt takes on and the reason for the guilt itself
                and invites readers to think about whether this might also be true in the case of
                Coleridge’s poem. When he examines the unplumbed abolitionist depths of some of
                Coleridge’s supernatural symbolism, Southey draws attention to the way in which
                Coleridge allows some readers to disregard the context of slavery, in a way he will
                not himself allow.</p>
               <p>Beyond Southey’s decision to make his poem obviously abolitionist, and to translate supernatural
                references into descriptions of how the unconscious works, his decision to preface his version of the poem with a headnote that addresses the poem's "public" audience also offers a subtle commentary of Coleridge's methodology. He makes several further
                 alterations to the setting and plot of Coleridge’s poem, when he decides to set the poem in a hovel, to convert
                the character of the wedding guest into the character of the dissenting minister, to
                add the character of a captain, and to introduce the question of whether the poem
                should end in prayer. None of these changes are merely incidental; each of them
                subject the mechanisms of Coleridge’s allegory to scrutiny, and many of them
                complicate, rather than simplify, Coleridge’s text. In what follows, I examine the
                effects of each of these revisions to Coleridge’s poem in detail, putting special
                emphasis on how they work to cultivate public, as well as private, feeling. In doing
                so, I do not mean to recuperate Southey’s poem, so much as offer a case study of the
                way in which abolitionist poetry's overt public purpose has changed the way it has
                been read.</p>

               <head>The Headnote</head>
               <p>Southey never directly spoke of his poem as an imitation; instead, he repeatedly claimed
                that the motivation for the poem came from a real-life encounter. In a letter to his
                friend John May (26 September 1798), in which he first shares the poem, he describes
                how he first heard the narrative from the Bristol publisher, Joseph Cottle:<quote>
            A dissenting minister here, a man of unquestioned
                veracity, discovered the sailor as you will find related: only last week &amp; Cottles mother
                took down the account from his mouth. I have verified it as the best means of a
                story that ought to be widely known. You will not I think object to the frequent
                ejaculations when you recollect the effect which the whole is intended to produce.
                (<title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works</title> 288) </quote>
            Southey recounts the same details in a note to his
                brother Tom in October 1798 (although this time he states that it was Cottle’s
                “friend,” rather than his “mother,” who first heard the account): “This my dear Tom
                which Edith has copied for you is a true story. It is about six weeks since a friend
                of Cottle found a sailor thus praying in a cowhouse and held conversation with him
                of which the exact substance is in the ballad” (qtd. in Rubinstein, 24).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Rubenstein notes that the
                            postmark to this letter is obscured; however, comparing the references
                            in the letters to Tom and May (“one week” and “six weeks”) makes it
                            likely that the letter was sent in October 1798.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If the sailor’s story does indeed have a basis in truth,
                notwithstanding Southey’s confusion about whether Cottle heard the story from his
                mother or his friend, it was mediated several times before Southey came across it.
                An ungenerous reading of Southey’s claim that the dissenting minister was the only
                source for his poem is that he was surreptitiously diverting attention away from his
                borrowings from Coleridge. Chris Rubenstein argues that “Southey must have
                fictionalized the origin of ‘The Sailor…’” (24). It is certainly possible that
                Southey could have invented the story of the sailor wholesale, as a kind of cover
                for his influence. However, the fact of the imitation does not discount the
                possibility that Southey had heard a story like the sailor’s and was therefore moved
                to think differently about Coleridge’s poem, or that he adapted a story he had heard
                in service of an imitation of the “Rime.” Since Southey leaves so many clues for
                observant readers that his poem is in conversation with the
                <title level="a">Rime,</title> however, I will set aside this
                unsolvable question, in order to instead focus on the effects of reading <title level="a">The
                Sailor</title> as an imitation.</p>
               <p>The headnote itself can also be read as a self-conscious
                experiment with—and revision to—the <title level="a">Advertisement</title> of the
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798). With the status
                of the poem as imitation in view, echoes of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s
                <title level="a">Advertisement</title> abound in Southey’s headnote:<quote>
            In September, 1798, a Dissenting Minister of Bristol,
                discovered a Sailor in the neighbourhood of that City, groaning and praying in a
                hovel. The circumstance that occasioned his agony of mind is detailed in the annexed
                Ballad, without the slightest addition or alteration. By presenting it as a Poem,
                the story is made more public; and such stories ought to be made as public as
                possible. (<title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works</title> 289)</quote>
            Southey’s reference to the date, 1798, and his emphasis
                on the authenticity of the ballad indicates that his interaction with the
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> is hiding in plain
                    sight.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The
                            phrase Southey uses to describe the psychological results of the
                            sailor’s guilt in his headnote, too, “agony of mind,” recalls
                            Coleridge’s mariner’s line, “And Christ would take no pity on / My soul
                            in agony” (lines 226–7).</note> In his emphasis on the veracity
                of his source, Southey, like Wordsworth and Coleridge, builds on tradition that
                Thomas Percy began when he traveled extensively around the British Isles to collect
                and record folk ballads in his
                    <title level="m">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title> (1765).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Southey’s transformation of his source
                            text into a poem also chimes with Percy’s tendency to correct or make
                            changes to the songs he recorded, which was well documented by this
                            period.</note> In keeping with the trend which valued ballads
                directly transcribed from singers’ mouths more highly than those already written
                down, and presenting himself as a kind of ethnographer, Southey privileges the
                orality of his text. His insistence that there has been no “addition or alteration”
                to the sailor’s words obviously contradicts his statement that the story is being
                “presented” as a poem, yet he preserves a sense of verisimilitude by noting that he
                has merely fitted the sailor’s words to verse, rather than asking readers to imagine
                that the sailor originally spoke in ballad meter. By removing the mention of Cottle
                as an intermediary in the headnote (as opposed to the letters), Southey instead
                makes the ballad form itself the vessel for the transmission of the tale. He
                presents the ballad as a medium that takes a story, changes it in a way that makes
                it more likely to be shared, and then relies on its audience for distribution (akin
                to something like a meme today). The story has already passed from one member of the
                public (the sailor) to another (the dissenting minister); the ballad form will allow
                it to spread much further. As song, the ballad will become the agent of its own
                re-creation, even beyond the circulation of the printed text. Southey’s suggestion
                that converting the sailor’s story to ballad meter makes it more transmissible
                anticipates Wordsworth’s statement in the later <title level="a">Preface</title> to the
                    <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1802), that the story of <title level="a">Goody Blake and Harry Gill</title> was
                “communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it, had it
                not been narrated as a Ballad” (112).<note place="foot" resp="author"> William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <title level="a">Preface,</title> to the

               <p>By drawing attention to the way he has “presented” the
                speech as a ballad, Southey coyly aligns his project with Wordsworth and Coleridge’s
                1798 description in the <title level="a">Advertisement</title> to the <title level="m">Lyrical
                    Ballads</title> of their wish to experiment with the question of how far “the
                language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to
                the purposes of poetic pleasure (3).”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            I refer to the <title level="a">Advertisement</title> of 1798 since this is the edition
                            Southey had access to when he wrote the first version poem, though he
                            would also have been aware of the longer <title level="a">Preface</title> and <title level="a">Essay
                            Supplementary to the Preface</title> when he made successive revisions to the
                            poem.</note> From a cynical perspective, when Southey
                acknowledges that he thinks it necessary to “present” the sailor’s story as a poem,
                he hints that he thinks his audience might only be persuaded to listen to truths
                about the Atlantic trade if its horrors are aestheticized or packaged in “a poem.”
                Yet swapping an emphasis on imitation for one on mediated speech is also a
                Coleridgean method. Maureen McLane and Celeste Langan have explored the ways in
                which Wordsworth and Coleridge highlight the status of their ballads as mediated
                texts. In the end, Southey’s experiment in mediation seems truer to the principles
                in the <title level="a">Advertisement</title> than Coleridge’s poem itself: a comparison between Southey’s
                poem and Coleridge’s (especially the first version, with the antiquated spelling
                which Wordsworth so disliked), reveals Southey to be closer to “the language of
                conversation” than Coleridge was.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                his headnote or his letters can, from this perspective, be read as evidence of his
                commitment to his imitation, rather than his desire to cover it up.</p>
               <p>Even the language Southey uses to
                frame the poem’s origins in the private letters echoes the themes of the
                <title level="a">Advertisement.</title> His insistence that the ballad was taken down “from the mouth” of
                the sailor and his apparent misgivings about the style of the sailor’s diction in
                his “frequent ejaculations,” for instance, mimics Wordsworth and Coleridge’s concern
                that readers might think “the author has sometimes descended too low, and that many
                of his expressions are too familiar, and not of sufficient dignity”
                (<title level="a">Advertisement,</title> 3). Cottle was the person responsible for showing Southey the <emph>MS</emph> version of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in May
                1798 (see Jacobus 21), so he was certainly the intermediary who carried the
                inspiration for the poem to Southey, one way or another, and Southey’s reference to
                Cottle’s role as conduit for the story could even be a coy way of gesturing toward
                this. Cottle’s mother (or friend) could also be considered an avatar of the wedding
                guest, who receives a version of the poem from the mariner’s mouth, unmediated by
                text.</p>

               <head>The Public and the People</head>
               <p>Once the similarities between Southey’s headnote and the
                1798 <title level="a">Advertisement</title> are clear, it becomes easier to see how Southey
                also diverges from Coleridge’s example in <title level="a">The Rime</title> when he emphasizes the "public" nature of his ballad. This stands out as a crucial difference between his framing of his poem and Coleridge's. Where Coleridge prefers to locate his ballad in
                a mythical landscape, Southey prompts his audience to recognize the poem’s currency
                by noting the date (September 1798). Southey also encourages his audience to imagine
                themselves as part of the “public” in a way that Coleridge avoids. Rather than
                relying on a pre-established category for defining the public, the headnote calls
                its own public into being. Since such a small percentage of the population of
                Britain could vote in 1799, it seems less likely that Southey straightforwardly
                equates the phrase “the public” with the “voting public,” than that he also
                envisions his public to also include disenfranchised citizens as he incites readers
                to coalesce as a group.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “A survey conducted in 1780 revealed that the
                            electorate in England and Wales consisted of just 214,000 people - less

                read the headnote is to become part of the category of the “public” it is intended

               <p>Whereas Southey openly displays his
                poem’s didactic purpose, Coleridge was more wary of doing so. In <title level="m">Table Talk</title>, he recalls Anna Barbauld’s objection that the <title level="a">Rime</title> had no
                moral, in order to underline that he considered the “obtrusion of moral sentiment” a
                “chief fault” in the poem.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In a

                            “Mrs Barbauld once told me that she admired The Ancient Mariner very
                            much, but that there were two faults in it—it was improbable, and had no
                            moral. As for the probability, I owned that that might admit some
                            question; but as to the want of a moral, I told her that in my own
                            judgement the poem had too much; and that the only, or chief fault, if I
                            might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the
                            reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure
                            imagination” (vol. I, 272).</note> As Malcolm Ware notes,
                Coleridge’s poem does conclude a version of a moral, in the aphoristic line, “He
                prayeth well who loveth well, / Both man and bird and beast,” (lines 645–6) and the
                wedding guest leaves his encounter “a sadder and a wiser man” (line 657). Yet this
                was as much as Coleridge was willing to offer in terms of didacticism: the statement
                “as public as possible” is anathema to his methodology. Since both Wordsworth and
                Coleridge’s criticism of the “public” became increasingly vehement, Southey’s
                emphasis on making the story “as public as possible” has made his poem seem less and
                less Coleridgean as time has gone on. The 1802 “Preface” to the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> speaks briefly of its wish to appeal to “the approbation
                of the Public” (115) but after this, Wordsworth and Coleridge quickly begin to
                vilify this group.</p>
               <p>Although it seems counterintuitive
                that Wordsworth and Coleridge attack the public while also valorizing “the real
                language of men,” the position makes more sense in light of the knowledge that they
                did not use the term “public” to denote the “public sphere.” Instead, they used it
                in a more complex way to describe a group of people whose views were governed by
                tastemakers and trends. Both Wordsworth and Coleridge distinguished between the
                “public” (whom they disliked) and the “people” (whom they admired). The most famous
                explanation of the way they each understood the distinction can be found in
                Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Essay Supplementary to the Preface</title> of his <title level="m">Poems</title> (1815), where he draws on Edmund Burke to argue that the People are
                worthy of much more respect than the made-up category of “the Public”:<quote>
            Still more lamentable is his error who can believe that
                there is any thing of divine infallibility in the clamour of that small though loud
                portion of the community, ever governed by factitious influence, which, under the
                name of the PUBLIC, passes itself, upon the unthinking, for the PEOPLE. Towards the
                Public, the Writer hopes that he feels as much deference as it is entitled to: but
                to the People, philosophically characterized, and to the embodied spirit of their
                knowledge, so far as it exists and moves, at the present, faithfully supported by
                its two wings, the past and the future, his devout respect, his reverence, is due.
                (661–2)</quote>
            As Georgina Green summarizes, Wordsworth is interested
                here in the opposition between a group interested in “transitory” versus
                “transhistorical” ideals (<title level="m">The Majesty</title> 146). Wordsworth summed
                up this argument more laconically when he famously quipped that “The people would
                love the poem of <title level="m">Peter Bell,</title> but the Public (a very different
                being) will never love it” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 329). Like Wordsworth,
                Coleridge also often referred to his dislike of the public. In the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria,</title> for instance, he disparages “the multitudinous
                PUBLIC,” as “shaped into personal unity by the magic of an abstraction” (59); he
                objects to the notion that a multitude might think in the same way.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Coleridge
                            also calls the Public a “misgrowth of our luxuriant activity,” as if the
                            practice of reviewing has not been properly pruned (“To T. G. Street”).

               <p>Wordsworth and Coleridge’s argument about the difference
                between the public and the people has political consequences for their work, though
                it had humbler beginnings, since it seems to have largely resulted from a defensive
                reaction to negative reviews of the
                <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads.</title> Anthony Harding’s
                explanation that Wordsworth and Coleridge’s use of the term “public” might make more
                sense if understood as a reference to a “reading public” is useful here (113). In
                various letters written in the wake of the <title level="a">Rime,</title> Coleridge insists that no one
                person should imagine they can speak for the public’s opinion. He calls the public
                “an imaginary word” which is “of pernicious effect by habituating every Reader to
                consider himself as the Judge &amp; therefore the Superior of the Writer who yet if
                he has any justifiable claim to write ought to be his Superior” (<title level="m">Biographia</title> 57, note 3). At the same time, however, Coleridge argues that
                the way literary reviewers conceive of “the public” will, in turn, impact the way
                politics are conducted, hinting at the way that his own decision to disavow the
                public has political implications. Coleridge foresees in the new tendency for
                critics to describe how the public will receive texts the advent of an era in which
                individual readers cannot be expected to have their own opinion, or individually
                evaluate what they read, which will then affect how “the State” treats them:<quote>
            The Root of the Evil is a Public—and take my word for
                it, this will wax more prolific of inconvenience, that at length it will scarcely be
                possible for the State to suffer any truth to be published, because it will be
                certain to convey a dangerous falsehood to 99 out of a hundred. (“To T.G. Street”
                713)</quote>
            Essentially, Coleridge is suggesting here that once the
                public assent to the idea that they are part of a group whose opinions can be formed
                by publications, the status of “truth” itself will become suspect. Thus Coleridge’s
                disgust for the notion that the public would all respond in a similar way after
                reading a review aligns with his disinterest in allowing a didactic abolitionist
                moral to intrude in “The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere.” The problem with Wordsworth
                and Coleridge’s resistance to imagining their audience as a public, however, is that
                the cause of abolition requires imagining an audience situated in a particular
                historical moment, and also requires people to be persuaded to act by means of the
                “clamour” of a “small though loud portion of the community.” Coleridge likely did
                not expect his ideas about “the public” to affect the way other people’s abolition
                poems were received, yet his decision to dwell on the difference between the public
                and the people has had this unfortunate effect.</p>

                  </quote>
            Coleridge begins by demonstratively portraying the
                mariner separating the wedding guest from a group of people in order to tell him his
                tale. Though this emphasis on “one of three” has sometimes been read as a Biblical
                allusion (since Jesus is unrecognized as one of the three travelers on the road to
                Emmaus [Luke 24:13–35]), the lines also emphasize the one-on-one interaction between
                the mariner and the wedding guest. Coleridge’s 1834 marginal gloss also emphasizes
                the singularity of the wedding guest: “An ancient Mariner meeteth three gallants
                bidden to a wedding feast, and detaineth one” (Norton 61). This creates an
                opportunity for single readers to imagine that they receive an individual hearing of
                the poem. When Coleridge explains that the mariner will melancholically repeat his
                tale over and over again, he further encourages individual readers of “The Rime” to
                imagine themselves being stopped, one by one, in order to hear the next iteration of
                the tale.</p>
               <p>Although Coleridge emphasizes the way he wants his
                readers to form their own opinions, however, he does not give the internal audience
                in his poem a choice about whether to listen to his tale. Instead, the mariner
                compels the wedding guest to submit to his story by separating him from the group
                and performing a supernatural kind of hypnotism on him. By emptying the wedding
                guest of volition, Coleridge makes him a kind of vessel for the mariner’s story to
                fill:<quote>

            Whereas the mariner intrudes into a scene of sociability
                in order to assault the wedding guest with his tale, Southey suggests the minister
                has more of a choice about whether to cross the threshold of the hovel to enter into
                this withdrawn space. Thus, Southey also encourages his poem’s readers to feel that
                they also have a choice about whether to listen to the sailor’s story, alongside the
                minister. In this, he grants his readers a sense of agency about whether to count
                themselves among the number of the “public” he refers to in the headnote.</p>
               <p>Southey’s hovel provides a location where a collective
                abolitionist public can form, allowing his audience to conceptualize a space in

            When the minister enters into the confined space of the
                hovel, he also metaphorically enters into the intimate space of a confessional box;
                a space situated somewhere between the public and the private sphere. Just as the
                confessional is an enclosed space which two people occupy within the larger space of
                the church, the hovel is situated within the city of Bristol and yet also separate
                from its hurry. Southey’s decision to situate the poem here, a significant departure
                from the <title level="a">Rime,</title> also provides a spatial metaphor for how the public’s entrance into
                the space of the sailor’s consciousness might work. One might imagine that the
                sailor would immediately break off his lament on seeing the minister enter, but as
                Southey depicts him, he hardly notices the entrance of the minister into the hovel.
                Instead, he continues to “groan” (line 18) and say his prayers as if no change had
                occurred. The subtle way Southey figures the setting for his sailor’s confession
                means that the minister is not merely a proxy for individual listeners; he is also a
                metonym for the “public” that Southey mentions in the headnote, as they collectively
                enter into the space of the sailor’s mindset.</p>

                not only encourages members of his poem’s public to identify with the sailor’s
                subject position when he asks them to enter the hovel; he also does so sonically, by

                            also emphasizes a sense of community within the hovel since prayer is a

                            Prayer, that the sailor forgot, they might find themselves filling his

            Despite his repeated insistence that his “sin” torments
                him, the sailor remains unreflective about the events that led up to his crime. The
                sailor was not “innocent” at the point that he took “three hundred” people onto a
                ship, yet still insists on continuing to willfully overlook the violence of the act
                he participated in. When Southey slips in the detail that the sailor’s ship, like
                Coleridge’s ship, embarks “merrily” (line 63), he not only indicts the sailor for
                his carelessness, but also the ancient mariner as well. The bouncing merriness of
                Southey’s ballad meter is obviously opposed to the sailor’s subject matter,
                emphasizing the profanity of the idea that anyone could believe that this kind of
                ship could sail “merrily.” Nonetheless, an audience has to viscerally participate in
                the sailor’s use of meter, and so is also forced to confront this tension.</p>
               <p>In his depiction of the sailor’s insouciance, Southey
                subtly reminds his readers that people not directly involved in the violence of the
                Atlantic trade are still guilty of perpetuating the system, even if they consider
                themselves “innocent” (line 60). At a time when consumer habits drove the violence
                forward, William Wilberforce often made the argument that slavery was a moral
                degradation for all members of the British public, not just the people directly
                involved in it. In a speech he made on 12 May 1789, he cast all citizens in the role
                of those who had done “cursed deeds”:<quote>
            We are all guilty. We ought to plead guilty, and not to
                exculpate ourselves by throwing the blame on others… when we reflect it is we
                ourselves that have degraded them to that wretched brutishness and barbarity which
                we now plead as the justification of guilt.” (qtd. in Sonoi 28)</quote>
            Southey encourages individual members of the public to
                realize that they share in the blame for the sailor’s crime, even if they have not
                themselves committed it.</p>
               <p>The ballad form also emphasizes this sense of a shared
                “public” guilt. Anyone who reads Southey’s ballad reads it knowing that many others
                have spoken, and will speak, in chorus with him. Even if the sailor seems to be
                voicing private pain, he does so using a “public” form. Susan Stewart’s theory of
                lyric possession, alongside readings of abolitionist poems that rely on it, such as
                Ivan Ortiz’s work on <title level="a">Lyric Possession in the Abolitionist Ballad,</title> is instructive
                    here.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Ivan Ortiz, <title level="a">Lyric
                            Possession in the Abolition Ballad.</title>
                  </note> The sailor’s
                voice, <emph>qua</emph> ballad, is always already inhabited by other
                voices, joining in a chorus that transcends time and space: speaking singly and
                communally at once. Both the hovel and the ballad form are containers for Southey’s
                public: the ballad, like the hovel, marks out a space for a collective confession,
                spoken through the sailor’s only seemingly individual voice. The way the ballad form
                functions as a middle space between the private and the public can be conceptually
                compared with the way the hovel functions as a middle space between the sailor’s
                private life and the public space of Bristol which surrounds him.</p>
               <p>The ancient mariner also speaks in ballad meter, which
                means that his audience outside the poem can also recognize his narrative as an
                entrance into a form of collective consciousness with other readers outside the
                space of the poem. In Coleridge’s poem, however, even those readers who identify
                with the mariner’s sense of guilt, and acknowledge that other readers are also doing
                so, can still escape a confrontation with their own role in the complicity in the
                violence of slavery, because the allegorical mode allows them security. For a reader
                reciting Southey’s ballad, by contrast, there is no refuge in metaphor. No member of
                Southey’s public can join voices with the sailor without also confronting the brutal
                horror of the “cursed deeds” that the lack of an abolition ruling was causing.</p>

               <head>The Violence of Representation</head>
               <p>The ethical value of asking an audience to put
                themselves in the position of the guilty sailor becomes increasingly strained as the
                poem continues, however. Although Southey’s sailor sounds very like Coleridge’s
                mariner in the opening lines of his speech, his confession suddenly takes on a very
                different tone when he starts to narrate the way he was forced to torture the
                enslaved woman, while also emphasizing his own suffering. No sooner has the sailor
                confessed to the murder than he begins to insist on his own status as a victim,
                harping on the pain his guilt causes. Perhaps Southey may have defended his
                representation of such extreme selfishness by arguing that he was parodying the
                Coleridge’s mariner’s focus on himself. Certainly, the mariner comes to seem more
                culpable through the lens of Southey’s poem: <title level="a">The Sailor</title> offers an implicit
                critique of how problematic Coleridge’s emphasis on the mariner’s obsession with his
                own suffering becomes if the poem is read in an abolitionist context. Yet this
                section of the sailor’s narration of his crime is violent in other ways, too, and
                should come with a content warning:<quote>

            When Southey adds the character of the captain to his
                depiction of this scene of torture, he may be referencing Isaac Cruikshank’s
                well-known image of a notorious scene in which Captain Kimber ordered an enslaved
                woman to be whipped. In this image, which I have chosen not to reprint here, the
                woman who is being whipped by a sailor has been stripped of her clothes, suggesting
                that she has been sexually assaulted, while a lascivious captain in the foreground of
                the frame unabashedly meets the viewer’s gaze. The euphemistic title of the image
                also draws attention to the way she has been assaulted: <title level="a">The abolition of the slave
                trade Or the inhumanity of dealers in human flesh exemplified in Captn. Kimber’s
                treatment of a young Negro girl of 15 for her virjen (sic) modesty.</title> The “public”
                Southey addresses would likely have heard of this case, because Wilberforce
                referenced it in a speech denouncing Kimber in the early 1790s.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See “Curator’s Comments” on
                            Cruikshank’s print: <title level="a">The abolition of the Slave Trade.</title>
                  </note>
                This intertext points to the way that any reference to the torture of an enslaved
                woman can be understood to be sexualized, even if Southey does not make overt
                reference to sexual assault. Yet by asking viewers to meet the captain’s gaze,
                Cruikshank also dramatizes the way in which viewers to some extent participate in a
                scene like this when they observe it. Even if Cruikshank might defend his picture by
                saying that the representation of such a scene is designed to limit violence, he
                also encourages viewers to become complicit onlookers to violence within the scene
                itself.</p>
               <p>Southey’s description of the torture of the enslaved
                woman, like Cruikshank’s drawing, also enacts violence, as well as recording it. His
                representation of the sailor’s confession is a stark example of the violence often
                inherent in the representation of violence done to Black bodies by white
                abolitionists (and primarily for white abolitionists). The very fact of his decision
                to represent this scene is ethically problematic, because of the way that it makes
                the woman’s pain instrumental. Critical reactions to the recordings and
                representations of Black suffering today offer a theoretical lens through which to
                understand the harm that Southey’s abolitionist tactic causes. Reflecting on the
                videos of the beating of Rodney King in 1991, Elizabeth Alexander has noted that the
                video of King’s assault circulated in such a way as to inure viewers to the
                violence, even when those circulating the images did so with the intention of
                bringing justice. Alexander’s argument, which details the ways in which the
                recordings of violence can function as a tool of white supremacy, can also be
                applied to representations of violence. Christina Sharpe also explores the ethics of
                representation when she provides a chronology through which to understand the
                critique of Dana Schutz’s painting of Emmett Till. Sharpe’s logic can be applied to
                a viewing of Southey’s tableau: when he chooses to represent the murder of an
                enslaved Black woman, he also incites associations with previous representations of
                enslaved women, which have taught viewers to exert their gaze in a different way
                than they might confront images of violence done to white bodies. Looking at such
                violence is not simply a passive condition: it is an act that participates in a
                hierarchical structure imbued with its own history of violence.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Bakary Diaby
                            also discusses the Dana Schutz controversy in relation to the protocols
                            of Romanticism: “The Open Casket affair…
                            participates in a long tradition of Black women serving as the occasion
                            for a sustained discourse on race while remaining in the shadows of that
                            discourse…We see a similar dynamic play out, I will suggest, in
                            contemporary scholarship on Romanticism” (249).</note>
               </p>
               <p>The sailor has not learned from his representation of
                his victim’s suffering to understand the woman’s humanity. He twice calls the woman
                he has murdered “sulky” for her decision to refuse food, dismissing her act of
                protest (lines 65, 69). The violence Southey himself does to the enslaved woman
                continues in the way he has the sailor describe her death: “She groan’d and
                groan’d, but her groans grew / Fainter at morning tide (lines 93–4). Thus the
                enslaved woman’s suffering is slowly rendered inaudible as she dies, her subjecthood
                growing “fainter” alongside her groans. By emphasizing the way in which she
                seemingly disappears as her groans diminish, the sailor also diminishes the force of
                her suffering, in order to turn his attention back towards his own groans in the
                hovel—“So I came here alone, / That I might freely kneel and pray, / And call on
                Christ and groan” (lines 29–31). The sailor further heightens the sense that he has
                learned very little when he begins to complain that his suffering is worse than the
                woman’s. Repeatedly trivializing his victim’s pain, the sailor seems incapable of
                understanding it, despite having put himself in the woman’s position for other more
                selfish reasons. His frequent comparisons of himself to her are outrageous: “She
                could not be more glad than I / When she was taken down” (lines 85–6), he says. His
                assertion that he is envious of the “rest” his victim has been granted in death is
                also grotesque:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>They flung her overboard; — poor wretch</l>
                        <l> She rested from her pain, —</l>
                        <l>But when — o Christ! o blessed God!</l>
                        <l> Shall I have rest again! (lines 97–100)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
            Looking back at the beginning of the poem through the
                lens of these lines, the sailor seems increasingly self-obsessed. Early in the poem,
                for instance, the sailor says he wishes he had drowned before he committed the
                murder, only to later describe how the sea did in fact swallow the enslaved woman.
                The status of the poem as an imitation or parody does not absolve Southey of the
                violence of his representation at moments like this.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>“The Captain He Stood By”</head>
               <p>Southey’s addition of the character of the
                captain—another departure from the narrative of the <title level="a">Rime</title>—might also be seen to
                increase the violence of Southey’s representation, as compared with Coleridge’s
                poem. Whereas Coleridge’s mariner stresses that it was his own decision to commit
                his crime (even though he doesn’t understand why he did it), Southey’s sailor argues
                that he was forced to do so. His argument that the captain was “worse” than him
                seems designed to absolve himself of blame, and Southey could be seen to be
                absolving the sailor of his sin when he encourages the public to channel their
                outrage at the captain, rather than the sailor himself. From the sailor’s
                perspective, it is as if the captain refuses to “spare” him, as well as the woman,
                when he orders the whipping.</p>
               <p>From another perspective, however, Southey’s decision to
                exaggerate the sailor’s self-interest could be read as a critique of the sailor’s
                denial of his responsibility. The way that Southey introduces the character of the
                captain just at the moment that the true force of his violence emerges exposes the
                sailor’s inability to accept culpability for his crime, and therefore a lack of true
                contrition. To this extent, his insistence that he was not in control of his own
                “hand” does not absolve him of the crime. This exploration of how a network of
                blame-shifting allows the slave trade to function looks forward to Hannah Arendt’s
                theory of the banality of evil.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                in the <title level="a">Rime,</title> Coleridge had emphasized the plight of sailors at the hands of such
                captains in the lecture. In Bristol, Coleridge looked forward to an argument Thomas
                Clarkson would also make, when he described the brutal psychological and physical
                damage that sailors press-ganged into going to sea suffered and argued that they
                should also be considered victims. The printed version of the lecture, published in
                    <title level="j">The Watchman</title> (1796), offers a crucial intertext for
                Coleridge’s representation of the mariner, and also offers the possibility that
                Southey may have seen himself to be amplifying a message he finds in Coleridge’s
                poem about the sympathy that mariners were due:<quote>
            For the officers, employed as the immediate instrument
                of buying, selling, and torturing human Flesh, must from the moral necessity of
                their circumstances become dead to every feeling of confession. From the brutality
                of their Captain and the unwholesomeness of the Climate through which they pass, it
                has been calculated that every Slave Vessel from the Port of Bristol loses on
                average almost a fourth of the whole Crew—and so far is the Trade from being a
                nursery for Seamen, that the Survivors are rather shadows in their appearance than
                men and frequently perish in Hospitals after the completion of their Voyage . . .
                    (238).</quote>
                  <note place="foot" resp="author"> Coleridge’s image of
                            the spectral “shadows” of sailors, zombified by the trauma of the

                  </note>
            Southey perhaps mimics the argument of the
                <title level="m">Lecture</title> when he foregrounds the
                “brutality” of a “Captain” in his poem. Although Southey’s sailor has not become
                fully dead to confession in the way Coleridge describes, he could be said to live a
                kind of undead life after he murders the woman. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker
                note that sailors often saw themselves on a continuum with the enslaved, since the
                predominance of press-gangs meant that they were not always in control of their
                decision to go to sea.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Linebaugh and Rediker: “For sailors,
                            the press-gang represented slavery and death: three out of four pressed
                            men died within two years, with only one in five of the dead expiring in
                            battle. Those lucky enough to survive could not expect to be paid, as it
                            was not uncommon, writes John Ehrman, the preeminent scholar of the navy
                            of the 1690s, for a seaman to be owed a decade's wages. The figure of
                            the starving, often lame sailor in the seaport town became a permanent
                            feature of European civilization, even as the motley crew became a
                            permanent feature of modern navies” (151).</note> Southey gives
                many clues that the sailor considers himself to be at the mercy of the captain. The
                ambiguity of subject and object in the sailor’s utterance, “We were forced by
                threats and blows to make them eat,” means that it is unclear whether the sailor is
                the only one doing the beating or is also himself being beaten and threatened as he
                is forced to act. The title Southey gives to his poem, <title level="a">The Sailor who had <emph>Served</emph> in the Slave Trade</title> (my emphasis), also invites a
                comparison between servitude and enslavement. Southey perhaps even subtly invokes a
                sonic link between the sailor as “chattel” and “cattle” when he says he “has no
                place to pray onboard” and decides to exile himself in a “cow-house,” as the
                1815 <title level="m">Preface</title> puts it.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I am grateful
                            to Susan Wolfson, who pointed this echo between “cattle” and “chattel”
                            out in a graduate seminar at Princeton University.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whether or not Southey meant to defend the sailor’s
                position, the presence of the captain in his poem draws attention to how the
                structures of slavery work to disperse guilt; a strategy that is not so apparent in
                Coleridge’s poem. When Southey adds the detail that the captain authored the woman’s
                murder by merely <emph>standing by</emph>, he underlines the fact that
                guilty actors are not necessarily the people who commit the violence, they are also those
                who insist their hands are clean while creating the conditions in which violence
                occurs. Speaking on the issue of police brutality today, Angela Davis has argued
                that it is not enough to blame the individual police officers who have committed
                murder, or demand that they be punished. Instead, she argues, the emphasis must be
                on collective consciousness of collective responsibility: “The major challenge of
                this period is to infuse a consciousness of the structural character of state
                violence” (22). Southey’s addition of the character of the captain, when read in
                relation to his phrase, “as public as possible,” might be read as a similar call to
                draw attention to the need for structural change, rather than merely focus attention
                on individual actors.</p>
               <p>By dramatizing the sailor’s indictment of the captain
                alongside evidence of his monstrous self-interest, Southey demonstrates that the
                functioning of Atlantic slavery relies on people trying to absolve themselves of
                guilt by creating a hierarchy of blame, drawing attention to the way in which a
                logic of individualized guilt allows the continuation of violence. Because of the
                way Southey triangulates the agency of the sailor’s crime, readers cannot condemn
                either the sailor or the captain without also implicating themselves in the guilt of
                the system he decries. That is, as soon as a reader condemns either the sailor’s or
                the captain’s violence, that reader becomes someone who justifies their own role in
                the system of the slave trade by also blaming someone else. The moment that readers
                decide that either the captain <emph>or</emph> the sailor is “worse than”
                them, they also suddenly employ the sailor’s logic of shifting the blame. Thus,
                Southey complicates Coleridge’s plot, and once again foregrounds his interest in
                inciting a collective sense of responsibility in the public, as he subtly confronts
                them with the question of whether they might themselves be guilty of tacitly
                “standing by” as others commit violence on their behalf. The addition of the captain
                not only implicates Southey’s “public” in the dispersal of guilt, it also asks them
                to cohere on that basis.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Praying Together in 1815</head>
               <p>Another way that Southey complicates Coleridge’s poem is
                to problematize the question of what it means for the mariner to end up being
                allowed to pray in the church at the end of the <title level="a">Rime.</title> In the 1799 version of his
                poem, Southey merely echoes the end of Coleridge’s poem, when he pictures the
                minister sending the sailor out of the hovel and towards the church, where he can
                “hear the word of God” (line 123). The minister assures the sailor that he can find
                “help” there (line 124); and that “All sins shall be forgiven” (line 120). In the
                <title level="a">Rime,</title> Coleridge had similarly stressed the mariner’s transition from isolation to
                “goodly company,” emphasizing the mariner’s joy at being able to go to church with
                other people after his time alone on the ship. If Coleridge’s poem is read as an
                allegory about a slave-ship, the mariner benefits from the doctrine of “Amazing
                Grace” when he is rescued by the hermit and allowed “To walk together to the Kirk /
                And all together pray” (lines 637–8).</p>
               <p>When Southey revises his poem in 1815, however, he makes
                the sailor’s—and the public’s—passage to absolution seem less easy, since he
                de-emphasizes the idea that the sailor will straightforwardly be granted forgiveness
                for his sins. Rather than allowing the sailor to go to church, he decides to leave
                the sailor in the hovel, frustrating the sense of hope and resolution granted to him
                in 1799. At this very moment, he also demonstratively ushers the poem’s readers into
                the space of the hovel when he suddenly asks a question about whether they will pray
                alongside the sailor and the minister. In this way, the presence of the listening
                “public” Southey appeals to in his headnote suddenly becomes visible in the poem
                itself:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>He bade him pray, and knelt with him,</l>
                        <l>And joined him in his prayers;</l>
                        <l>And some who read the dreadful tale</l>
                        <l>Perhaps will aid with theirs. (1815, lines 124–8)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                  <note place="foot" resp="author"> This ending to the poem does not
                            appear in the editorial apparatus to the poem in <title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works,
                                1793–1810</title>, but I have
                            verified it in the original version.</note>
            This new ending introduces a question about whether
                readers will choose to pray for the sailor or not. “Some” will pray; others may
                decide the sailor is not worthy of such “aid.” Even as Southey notes that the sailor
                may not deserve such attention, however, he may also be indicting those contemporary
                readers who choose not to pray, since the rest of the poem has asked them to
                consider their own complicity in the violence of the Atlantic trade, and their own
                need for contrition. In other words, he may not only be asking readers to pray for
                the sailor, but also for their own sins. Where Coleridge is focused on the mariner’s
                singular crime and singular guilt, Southey is focused on how one prayer might become
                many prayers, as he tries to transform Coleridge’s emphasis on the mariner’s
                individual “soul in agony” into a sense of communal responsibility. At the same
                time, there is still an obvious ethical tension in Southey’s decision to allow the
                minister to pray for the sailor. The 1815 ending to the poem, like the 1799 version,
                centers on white guilt more than Black suffering, meaning that Marcus Wood’s point
                about the poem’s perspective still stands, despite this revision.</p>
               <p>Where there is optimism for what this ballad might
                        achieve in the public sphere and about the public’s power to effect change, however,
                        there is also an implicit indictment of the public for allowing slavery to continue.
                        Southey’s decision to use one term, “public,” to include both those who allowed
                        slavery to continue and those who sought to end it (as well as those who were aware
                        of their complicity and those who weren’t) is more complex than it might seem. In
                        his headnote, Southey presages <foreign xml:lang="de">Jürgen Habermas’</foreign> theory of the relation between the
                        public and the counterpublic, by asking readers to identify themselves as part of a
                        group that has the potential to form its own countervailing discourse against
                        predominant public norms, while also acknowledging their own position within the
                        broader public sphere that is complicit in their production.</p>

               <head>Conclusion</head>
               <p>I have aimed, here, to give an abolitionist poem the
                same quality of attention that other only seemingly simple poems in the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> have received. As responses to Southey’s poem
                show, Wordsworth and Coleridge’s disparagement of “the public” not only defined the
                taste by which Southey’s poems have been read by, but also, much more broadly,
                influenced the conditions in which antislavery poetry has been reproduced and
                received. This is a legacy that persists. It has long been acknowledged that the
                field of Romanticism has been subject to a structural problem that has meant it has
                evaluated abolitionist texts differently than other texts from the same period, yet
                even after that critique, biases remain. <title level="a">The Sailor</title> is one of the few abolitionist
                poems routinely found in anthologies: this is perhaps precisely because it bears a
                relationship to Coleridge’s more well-known poem. In closing, then, I wish to
                acknowledge that the process of tracing responses to Southey’s poem has caused me to
                reflect on my own decision to begin to write about it. As Marlon Ross has argued,
                many Romanticists focus “almost exclusively on how writers of the period approached
                abolition debates concerning the slave trade and colonial slavery” (25),
                perpetuating a system that has privileged white perspectives of slavery above the
                voices of enslaved people themselves. I close, then, with a reminder that the voices
                of the sailor and the mariner are heard against the backdrop of the forced silence
                of enslaved people themselves. The question of how to make this brutal act of
                silencing “as public as possible” still remains.</p>
