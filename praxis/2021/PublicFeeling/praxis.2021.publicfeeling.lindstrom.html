            <p class="noCount">In prose both similar to and crucially different from the Romantic celebration of
               human wholeness, throughout the collection <em>Sister Outsider</em> (1984) the Black lesbian feminist poet Audre Lorde pursues an “impulse toward wholeness”
               to repair the divide between feeling and knowledge. For Lorde’s poetry is an urgent
               resource and practice of imaginative experience rescued from oppression, not defined
               by its formal features, which she calls “sterile word play.” This conviction aligns
               Lorde’s poetics with Percy Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> (1821). This essay considers Shelley not only "juxtapolitically" with Lorde, but
               in a common imaginary space of networks of feeling and imagery with contemporary theorists
               of public feeling including Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart, to establish a critical
               idiom for the world of public feeling and world-making. I show how the “harsh light
               of scrutiny” valued by Lorde resonates with Shelley’s critical reassessment of the
               poetic imagination set in opposition to calculative enlightenment reason. Yet I also
               argue that Lorde’s “quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives” helps us to
               make the difficult, necessary intervention into Shelley’s unresolved problematic —
               both theoretical and lived — concerning the relation of love to fear.</p>

                  <p>Throughout her essay and speech collection, <em>Sister Outsider</em> (1984), Audre Lorde, Black lesbian feminist poet, pursues–both by style and argument–an
                     “impulse toward wholeness” to repair the divide between feeling and knowledge (8).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Unless noted, all page references to Lorde’s writing are from Sister Outsider.</span></div>
                     </div> In doing so, Lorde’s poetic theory seeks new forms of understanding that “begin [
                     . . . ] to make knowledge available for use” (109). Lorde’s “use” in essays, such
                     as 
                     “Uses of the Erotic,”
                      is deeply experiential (53–9): at once intimately personal, as well as communal and
                     collective. Lorde’s measures of usefulness are “human need” and “the psychic and emotional
                     components of that need” (55). Her sense of the necessary is not reducible to utilitarian
                     calculus, as the turn toward erotic life as a resource might already suggest. In its
                     fundamental orientation to value, her theoretical work scrutinizes and promotes human
                     flourishing in all its possible forms, starting from her own situated being: opposing
                     a Black queer woman’s life, in particular, to surplus and its logic of extraction.
                     Kevin Quashie can thus write in <em>Black Aliveness</em> of Lorde’s “belief that a queer black mother’s body can thus be enough to conceptualize
                     what it is to know” (11). Lorde thereby articulates a profoundly anti-capitalist mode
                     of being, production, and critical self-examination.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As she made clear in a 1979 interview with Adrienne Rich, Lorde self-identified as
                  a writer who thinks in poems (83). This means that in her poems thought is inextricable
                  from feeling and its expressive formalization. Sensuous and intuitive experience matter
                  to her powers of ideation. We can begin to map Lorde’s philosophical poetics using
                  this critical creative habitus. But Lorde also means more simply, if opaquely, that
                  in her youth she thought only in poems. In the long period of her creative life before
                  she began teaching and writing prose in the 1970s, she felt poetry was her sole means
                  of effective communication. Not just her poetry, but also her remarkably rich and
                  direct prose, read as if they were recurrently composed in the first moment of breaking
                  free of a silence.</p>
               <p>In what follows I want to suggest a surprising convergence between Lorde and Percy
                  Bysshe Shelley. Lorde’s conviction that poetry is an urgent resource and practice
                  of imaginative experience rescued from the oppressions of silence—and a shared philosophy
                  that defines poetry not by its formal features, which she calls “sterile word play”—resembles
                  the argument Shelley makes in <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> (1821). In particular, there is a resonance between Lorde’s poetics and Shelley’s
                  view of the relation of knowledge to poetic imagination. Both Shelley and Lorde associate
                  a rejection of the capitalist division of labor with a critique of the operations
                  of managerial reason, from a vantage that celebrates affect, creation, and feeling.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Shelley writes: “We want the creative faculty to imagine that which we know; we want
                     the generous impulse to act that which imagine; we want the poetry of life: our calculations
                     have outrun conception; we have eaten more than we can digest” (530).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Quotations from Percy Shelley are taken from Reiman and Fraistat’s Norton (second
                              edition) of Shelley’s Selected Poetry and Prose. I cite this volume as SPP only where
                              context may not be evident.</span></div>
                     </div> We can see the affinity between Lorde and Shelley in this passage, which announces
                     an anti-utilitarian call for poetry’s vital use in making knowledge imaginable and
                     drawing it into the realm of available action. If Shelley speaks from a place of authority
                     and privilege, marked also by his exile, Lorde responds to the Romantic poet’s identification
                     of real “want” with creative capacities and writerly impulses that share in focused
                     abundance the resources of sensibility. Yet if I find in Lorde’s arguments and language
                     something that reminds me of Shelley, shutting my eyes to hear something like their
                     recombinant voice, I also know it is impossible to over emphasize how much Lorde situates
                     her knowledge within the living practice of her own specific identities. These “Shelleyan”
                     sentences lose their meaning and power if we isolate them from Lorde’s self-definitions
                     as a feminist, Black, queer, and mothering author and her assertions of how much these
                     identities have been deep resources for her poetic work.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Lorde’s affinity with Shelley also constitutes an act of transformative change upon
                  the Romantic tradition of “high level” theorizing performed especially by male poets
                  and philosophers. Difference, in the essays of <em>Sister Outsider</em>, is construed as “a dynamic human force” and “a creative force toward change” (45,
                  70). Indeed, difference provides the ground of the unacknowledged power that echoes
                  back perhaps most undeniably from Lorde to Shelley (53). This is not a structural
                  paradox, nor just an irony that follows from the exclusionary whiteness of “radical”
                  authors in the Romantic canon, but a major event at the living border of the invaginated
                  growth and unfolding of the non-linear, achronological history that most Romanticists
                  would associate with a Shelleyan notion of poetry. No chapter in the linear history
                  of ideas, this history is written and made legible in the flashes where Lorde and
                  Shelley make anti-separatist allies; and in which Shelley’s <em>Defence</em> depends upon the meanings of 
                  “Poetry is Not a Luxury,”
                  as much as the other way around. My largest and longest-unfolding aim in this essay
                  will therefore not only be to show how both poets understand expressive necessity
                  in their championing of poetry; but more crucially, I want to voice a shift from poetic
                  continuity to poetic difference (and ultimately gesture at the possibility of a commons-in-difference),
                  arguing that Lorde’s corrective to Shelley’s <em>Defence</em> is a necessary imaginative act. Despite its constitutional commitment to openness,
                  Shelley’s role of the legislator poet risks being either exclusionary or falsely universal
                  in its assumed, not situated, identity. An encounter with Lorde’s writing makes possible
                  what speech-act theorists call “felicity conditions,” in which the essential contribution
                  of Shelley’s <em>Defence</em>, its poetics of radical futurity for which a context does not yet exist outside the
                  capacity of creative acts, can be more fully examined and actually lived in the emergent
                  present.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Why isn’t Lorde’s poetic theory more often and energetically taken up in critical
                     interchange with Shelley—at least by Romanticists interested in contemporary poetry
                     and poetics? It might be tempting, for example, to read Lorde’s 1977 essay, 
                     “Poetry is Not a Luxury,”
                      as a vital expansion of Shelley’s voice and position in <em>A Defence</em> into feminist and non-European lived experiences.

                              are Not Luxuries,” and that it was written in Lorde’s first year of editorship of
                              the feminist quarterly journal Chrysalis (337). Mangrum’s work is one source of my
                              emphasis on administered culture.</span></div>
                     </div> “For women,” Lorde writes, “poetry is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity of our
                     existence” (37). Lorde’s gendered conditions of creative experience simultaneously
                     offer a frame around the moment that inspires my urge to make a connection but also
                     a strong critique of that urge, attesting to the ultimate arbiters of specificity
                     and difference. Race, sexuality, and gender mark the terms of that difference, though
                     gendered codes also have been invoked to code Shelley’s own reception as a poet who
                     refuses divisions of thought and feeling, content and manner. Shaped by the dismissals
                     of modern writers like Eliot and Auden, do we still view Shelley as a male narcissist
                     and, despite his ideals, as anti-Womanist and a danger to women? Shelley himself was
                     often charged by mid-century male critics with a blurring of feeling and thought that
                     is recognizably gendered. He was judged, for instance, “incapable of effective reasoning
                     and the intellectual control of his emotional outpourings” (Harding 210). Lorde, I’ll
                     concede from the start, would have viewed all the male English Romantic poets as numbering
                     among the “white fathers” who wish “to cover a desperate wish for imagination without
                     insight,” to suppress rather than liberate the deep resources of discredited feeling,
                     as her poem 
                     “Coal”
                      imagines the embodied diamonds of earth, not the diamonds of translucent white light.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Lorde’s writings compel a long-delayed confrontation with the normative subject’s
                  own “desperate wish” to exercise the imagination (and know its prestige) without risking
                  any real illumination in poetry. If Lorde crucially reaffirms Shelley’s case for the
                  vital necessity of poetry beyond the frameworks of economic calculus and rhetorical
                  or aesthetic ornament, that fundamental alliance, and the challenge of an anti-separatist
                  praxis it requires and promotes, can offer Romantic Studies a tool to engage more
                  critically and creatively with Shelley’s damaging failures of imagination. We do not
                  need to decide which of Lorde’s Black, feminist, and queer positionalities are most
                  needed as critical expansions of Shelley’s writing. Lorde’s emphases on defining her
                  own terms for vital work, and in searching for modes of survival that constitute both
                  a philosophy and a praxis, impart a necessary corrective to even the most fruitful
                  of Shelley’s contingent or constitutive failures.</p>
               <p>Having introduced Lorde here and provided the core rationale for my purpose to read
                  her writings with Shelley’s, the first section of this essay returns to <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> in the context of the recent collaborative theorizing of public feelings by Lauren
                  Berlant and Kathleen Stewart, to establish a critical idiom for the world of public
                  feeling and the world-making practices of Romantic poetics. The essay then argues
                  that Lorde’s critique of the poetic tradition offers an insight Shelley shared but
                  tried desperately to cover. Lorde’s examination of the very light by which we think,
                  write, and love participates in the critical reassessment of poetic imagination set
                  in opposition to calculative managerial reason. By the essay’s close I show how Lorde’s
                  “quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives” helps us to intervene in Shelley’s
                  unresolved problematic—both theoretical and lived—concerning the relation of love
                  to the ugly major feelings of anger and fear. Shelley feared (his own) anger and treated
                  it as a force to disavow not work through. Lorde shows us how to properly situate
                  Shelley’s repressed negative feelings and how to make such unaddressed negative feelings
                  a poetic and political resource. Lorde’s writing actualizes the more livable conditions
                  of a just, transformative community of poetic creation and exchange, that is only
                  inchoate in Shelley’s defense of poetry.</p>

                  <p>Lorde begins 
                     “The Uses of the Erotic”
                      with an urgently compelling sentence that makes no display of its allusion to Shelley’s
                     most famous pronouncement at the end of the <em>Defence</em>: “There are many kinds of power, used and unused, acknowledged or otherwise” (53).
                     The personal tone of acknowledgement here is reflective, not declarative and constitution-making.
                     But Lorde’s mixing of these spheres of experience and voice, wrought by a feminist
                     poet and thinker in the decades that gave the truth that the personal is the political,
                     makes the point that many kinds of insight can be publicly transformative. Lorde’s
                     scrutiny of what poetry means illuminates and shapes a heretofore “private” experience
                     that is the basis of potential collective action: a poetry of life that is not an
                     adjunct to living but of vital necessity. Brought forward into a future it welcomes
                     but cannot anticipate or enclose, Shelley’s outsized conclusion in <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> that “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the World” enjoins difficult thinking
                     about feeling and examining public feeling (535). Raymond Williams, originator of
                     the influential concept of “structures of feeling,” locates in Shelley’s statement
                     “the felt helplessness of a generation” at “the very moment when [poets] were being
                     forced into practical exile” by the literary print culture of the novel and the economic
                     structures of industrial capitalism (<em>Culture</em>, 47).

                     to Fred Moten’s project in <em>Black and Blur</em>, the first volume in the <em>consent not to be a single being</em> trilogy. Moten’s work musically churns in the collective yet fragmented poetics of

                     of the effectuating/ helpless turn of counterfactual mood? Are poets a) everywhere
                     the unacknowledged but effective agents behind larger values and institutions? Or

                     historical analysis of linguistic agency, but upon an attitude the sentence models
                     as an unacknowledged public feeling, or what Ngai calls an aesthetic emotion (5).
                     This attitude shapes response to another difficult implied question: c) If poets are

                  participating in the “Public feelings project” may help us to engage further with
                  this critical dilemma of how a world may be held in common, without reverting to an
                  enlightenment universalism that over-clarifies these issues of agency, intelligibility,
                  and publicity (Berlant, viii). “Writing throws the world together,” Lauren Berlant
                  and Kathleen Stewart maintain in their recent work of “noetic collaboration,” <em>The Hundreds</em> (11, 8). The “thrown-together” world of Berlant and Stewart’s writing both fails
                  to add up and exceeds the alternately grandiose and annihilative worldview of the
                  individual Romantic author if we continue to view the latter as a figure who must
                  either creatively legislate his imaginative world, or struggle in a wake of fragments
                  to compose a catastrophe. Mingling the legacy of Shelleyan Romanticism with twentieth-
                  and twenty-first century inflections of public feeling(s), this essay asks how it
                  might be that the unpredictably collaborative, suspensive “world” of such a “Public
                  feelings project” is answerable to and answered by Shelley’s conception of the world-making
                  activity of poets. Can the minimally conditioned notion of unforeclosed experience,
                  found in the writings of the “Public feelings” group, sustain the imaginative horizon
                  of a dynamic and common world envisioned by Romantic poetry? Never quite organized
                  or formalized, there is at least one kind of answer in terms of shared mental imagery:
                  the prose poetry of contemporary “life in suspension” links in its circuitry, its
                  charged and sagging zones, and in its varieties of the genre Berlant calls the impasse,
                  to Shelley’s own charged dispersive poetics (Berlant and Stewart, 8).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The tradition of thinkers who radically apply David Hume’s critique of induction provides
                     a background for my proposed reading. In <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> and elsewhere, Shelley follows the Humean skeptical critique of those unilateral constructions
                     of agency and causality that are temporally as well as logically linear. This Romantic
                     skeptical mobilization of Hume’s empirical argument holds that one cannot reason back
                     up the line from an effect to its cause to posit the seat of some prior metaphysical
                     origin. Causational force in itself has no ontological priority to the relational
                     event in which it manifests. The creatively skeptical move Shelley develops from Hume
                     thereby dissolves the hard idea of causality into what one might call the associative
                     field poetics of constant conjunction and by analogy the domain of the socially “juxtapolitical”
                     (Berlant 20).

                     the effect as a synonym of the cause” (513). Shelley deploys Humean skepticism toward
                     causation but realizes that its mitigated tenor in Hume is little more than a sociable
                     choice. He freely diverts skepticism into the metaleptic commingling of “effects”

                  <p>With this critique of cause in mind, no wonder if Shelley, more than other poets,
                     is judged ineffectual. In its role as a poetics treatise, <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> defines a poem as “the very image of life” in opposition to story, precisely by way
                     of the dependence of the latter on cause and effect (515). Shelley reads the definitional
                     reliance of storytelling on causation itself as a form of narrative poetics. He does
                     so, however, not to establish a grounding philosophical relationship, but as evidence
                     that “a story is a catalogue of detached facts, which have no other bond of connexion
                     than time, place, circumstance, cause and effect” (515). It is a wonderfully dissatisfied
                     mood that can find disappointment in the small worldview wherein there is “no other”
                     form of relationship than the Kantian categories: time, space, and cause! Shelley
                     boldly rejects a normatively fixed version of cause and effect in order to create
                     openings that promote other “bond[s] of connexion.” As Shelley says of “the promotors
                     of utility,” actually rather attractively (as an author might to acknowledge a good
                     partner or dean), “[t]hey make space, and give time” (529). His metaleptic critique
                     of cause-and-effect thereby expands Hume’s tastefully mitigated skepticism, extending
                     its reach beyond epistemology to other areas including ethics, love, and historical
                     poetics.

                  passing dreams of choice,” the privilege to harness this appropriately creative skepticism
                  only to curative love, denying the reality (for himself and for others) of fearful
                  confrontations. Humean skepticism thus requires modes of livable, poetic rewriting
                  for the human subject whose own survival cannot be taken for granted. (Though as Kara
                  Keeling writes in reply to Lorde’s concept of survival as “enduring <em>as such</em>”: “None of us survive as such; indeed, perhaps, freedom requires we give way to other
                  things” [ix].) I draw Lorde’s powerful critical and poetic insight into a jagged arc
                  with what is already a creatively critical swerve in Shelley’s Romantic revision of
                  the Enlightenment. Lorde’s poem 
                  “A Litany for Survival”
                  unforgettably marks this relay, beginning with Hume’s classic locus of the problem
                  of skepticism, in terms of the historical experience of that problem for Black bodies:
                  “And when the sun rises we are afraid / it might not remain / when the sun sets we
                  are afraid / it might not rise in the morning.”</p>

                  <p>In light of the issue of causality in particular, the distinction between poetry and
                     story closely resembles and shares elemental components with the distinction between
                     affect and emotion. It is precisely on narrative and causal grounds that the protean
                     realm of affect differs from the more fixed, organized, and symbolically pre-interpreted
                     domain of emotion (Ngai 24–7).

                     </div> The tradeoff comes in intellectual capital: as opposed to Ngai’s “ugly” affectively-laden
                     feelings of irritation and envy, the classical emotional terms of anger, jealousy,
                     the sublime, and even anxiety enjoy greater and more clearly activated and analyzed
                     levels of intellectual prestige (9, 35). Shelley’s presentation of <em>poets</em> as the unacknowledged legislators implicitly worries the issue of the availability
                     of this prestige to lyric as opposed to narrative modes. Though the strong analogy
                     I’ve just presented holds between Shelley’s contrast (on the grounds of causality,
                     as its foremost aspect) of lyric and narrative poetics and the contrast between affect
                     and emotion, Shelley nonetheless departs in advance from recent cultural theory of
                     affect in terms of the range of feelings his work privileges, or even allows. Shelley
                     in his moral and political thought is particularly insistent on affirming the heroic
                     and major emotions over ugly minor feelings. The preface to <em>The Revolt of Islam</em> outright rejects the politics of ugly feelings: “There is no quarter given to Revenge,
                     or Envy, or prejudice. Love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should
                     govern the moral world” (qtd. by McLane, 217–8). Similarly, the preface to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> rejects Milton’s Satan as a result of this heroic character’s motivation by ambition,
                     envy, and revenge (207).</p>

                  sensing of contemporaneity (Berlant, 5). The <em>Defence</em>’s prophetic mantle must not obscure its value as a tool to help make emergent life
                  livable. Despite its idealistic pitch, the <em>Defence</em> affords many responsive forms of historical and social attunement. Berlant lays hold
                  of this Shelleyan sympathetic insight in saying “the present is perceived, first,
                  affectively” (4). She drops the vatic idiom. But is not Berlant claiming, like Shelley,
                  that poets are hierophants of futurity? (And again, not even just narrowly poets:
                  Berlant cites Marx that “the senses have become theoreticians” [31].) Presentness
                  is first perceived poetically, that is to say; so long as we follow in the Shelleyan
                  tradition of defining poetry as socially sympathetic formative making—not in rigid
                  terms of traditional form and genre. In Shelley’s well-known binary of “mental action”
                  between the faculties of reason and imagination, the first insight of the imagination
                  is the perception of value (510).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Both Berlant and Stewart recurrently deploy Shelleyan imagery of electric charge,
                     circuitry, and (especially in Berlant’s case) electrical infrastructure in their work
                     on routes and energies of public feelings. Rather than using it as an idealistic symbol,
                     electricity for these thinkers figures intersubjective and (occasionally) collective
                     modes of thought that are invisible conceptually as low affects and wide infrastructures.
                     Electrical (dis)charge is of course an unmistakable Romantic and Shelleyan image.
                     The preface to Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> contrasts the “spirit” to the “forms” of the age by calling the spirit an “uncommunicated
                     lightning” (207). In the same preface, he credits the influence of Milton to his republican
                     age and sees that age of English revolution as a source of stocked energy for the
                     ideals of outflowing energy in Romanticism. Shelley heralds: “The cloud of mind is
                     discharging its collected lightning” (208). Writers in the public feelings group often
                     use electrical grid imagery, crackling with potential energies but unyoked from sovereign—or
                     any clear—agency as many of our public structures crumble. “The ordinary lives only
                     in the moment of its surge” (Stewart 56). The Shelleyan “Spirit of the Age” in <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> anticipates and shares this field of charged, subjective but not individual, potentialities
                     in its well-known image of the collective genius of the age as a gathering discharge
                     of lightning. The uncontainable, unlocalized character of this figure and its agency
                     offers indeed one handy symbolic means to distinguish the worldview of Romantic artists
                     from the philosophes of European Enlightenment. Rejecting the “gross vice or weakness”
                     in which tenuous historical values of heroic conduct, as he finds in Addison’s <em>Cato</em>, robe poetic forms, Shelley writes: “To such purposes Poetry cannot be made subservient.
                     Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that
                     would contain it” (520).

                              in Shelley’s image of lightning should be contrasted to the much more grandiose anti-heroic
                              image in Byron of lightning as a figure of potency and mortal fatigue. This image

                     life, erotics, and teaching as major contributors to the living thought of Romanticism
                     and post-Romanticism. Lorde writes in 
                     “Coal”
                      that “There are many kinds of open.” The rest of this essay is devoted to exploring
                     a mode of openness unwelcome to Shelley, though not to a collective and intimate Romantic
                     project moving from and beyond him. For the main instance of a textual provocation
                     that arcs beyond chronological Romanticism, I take Shelley’s valuable insight in the <em>Defence</em> and in his short essay 
                     “On Love”
                      that the outgoing structure of love and hope “beyond ourselves” also comprehends fear.
                     I see this double insight and its necessary edge of vulnerability as an understanding
                     that by himself Shelley is unable to effectively use. This aversion exposes him rightly
                     to the harsh light of critique by Lorde: “But giving in to the fear of feeling and
                     working to capacity is a luxury only the unintentional can afford” (Lorde 54). It
                     takes subsequent trajectories of poetic experience and expression, which I find in
                     the thought of Lorde, to address this need for courage of insight and bring it to
                     bear on “the image of life” and its creative and critical practice (<em>SPP</em> 515).

                              Venus, “too feeble to be fraught” with all of Venus’ sex in the back seat (376–7).
                              This “living Image” of the career of Love indicates playfully just the extent to which
                              Shelley in all seriousness needed to bring ordinary, lived, sexuality into his mythopoetic

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Lorde’s and Shelley’s writings are particularly generative to think with and teach
                     together because they share a fundamental argument about the necessity of poetry.
                     Lorde and Shelley develop two of the strongest, fiercest, and most flexible articulations
                     of the purpose and life of poetry without even a minimum of technical scaffolding—that
                     is, without supportive reference to the traditional techniques of verse. Both resolutely
                     refuse to take their bearings from the technical aspects of poetry as language enclosed
                     in pattern. Their defenses of poetry are instead grounded in human capacities. And
                     despite the individual notes of apology and negation in their titles, as makers of
                     global arguments, Lorde and Shelley both also assume boldly non-defensive attitudes.
                     Thinking primarily through the body, 
                     “Poetry Is Not a Luxury,”
                      redefines the essential transformative thesis of Shelley’s <em>Defence</em> concerning ideation, that poetry is not a recombinative exercise, or an adjunct to
                     sense, but a necessity at the center and circumference of life at peril of social
                     death. Thus, in Kara Keeling’s richly generative response to Lorde’s essay (an account
                     which also references capitalism’s reproduction of fear in the body), for Lorde “poetry
                     is a way of thinking the space/time of politics for those deemed disposable or socially
                     dead” (xi). Though she never refers to Shelley and does not need his example—or seemingly
                     the creative precedent of any other male canonical poets, alien if not hostile to
                     her own situated body—nonetheless in my view, Lorde both supports and critically supplements
                     Shelley’s resistance to the definition of poetry as a formal object. She does so in
                     the name of lived specificity, as the means to envision human flourishing under a
                     larger horizon of solidarity. Lorde rejects the reduction of poetry to verse as what
                     she calls a “distillation of experience . . . to . . . sterile word play” (37). She
                     feared that poetry and poets themselves had become the “promotors of utility” that
                     Shelley despises. Equally, she despised the view of poetry as a civilized game, as
                     in even the most flexible rendition we might give to R.P. Blackmur’s definition of
                     poetry as “a game we play with reality” (1).

               <p>Yet in the articulation of her own situated and specific dimension of a vitally Shelleyan
                  poetics in the broadest sense, Lorde also formulates what is perhaps the deepest problem
                  in this tradition and relates it in sharp terms, by assigning the institution of poetry
                  to “the white fathers [who write] . . . in order to cover their desperate wish for
                  imagination without insight” (37). Beyond even the irrefutable “white fathers” aspect
                  of her critique, how much poetic production—how much literary theory and criticism—is
                  rightly subject to this second accusation of whitewashing; that is, of the writer’s
                  wish to court imagination without the work and the pain of delivering insight? “Insight,”
                  in this reading, is not a quantum of new knowledge, or a projective vision, but a
                  harsh and rich encounter with an ancient-emergent knowledge one must unearth and face.
                  Romantic writings must remain uncomfortably open to Lorde’s statement in order to
                  grapple with the kind of revelatory experience that comes only from painful self-examination.
                  One of the aspects of Shelley’s privilege is his ability not to recognize the fundamental
                  realities of suffering and pain—alike as a personal and as a political experience.</p>
               <p>Maureen McLane expresses this differently when she preserves and reverses, in and
                  with Shelley, the slogan of 1970s activist feminism: “For with Shelley <em>the political is personal</em>” (215). Rather than the courageous breakthrough of a feminist praxis, this inversion
                  of the feminist motto for Shelley sounds brittle to me and suggests the potential
                  elision of self-knowledge. As the title of her essay-address bears out, Lorde’s way
                  of saying that language is vitally metaphorical, that the creation of poetry is the
                  conduct and “very image of life,” and, furthermore, that life-making is a world-making
                  practice, is to say that 
                  “Poetry is not a Luxury.”
                  If poetry is now typically thought to be a luxury good or a productively “useless”
                  activity, in her essay Lorde mobilizes a compelling and atypical concept of luxury.
                  In typical definitions “luxury” comprises an object that is desirable but inessential,
                  marked by a differential symbolic prestige as well as being expensive and difficult
                  to obtain. Lord deploys an alternative sense of “luxury” based on a lived concept
                  of economies of spirit. It is important to note that the essay was written at a time
                  when Lorde was awaiting a potentially terminal medical diagnosis for her first appearance
                  of cancer. This personal reference bears on her characterization of waiting upon a
                  time of fearlessness as the “final luxury” she could not afford. Lorde did not have
                  the luxury of a conception of empty, extended time to expend on delays due to fear.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Lorde also presents a fundamental critique of the metaphysical idea of a separate
                     time of enjoyment, the idea that luxury must come after and be thereby distinguished
                     from necessity or even use value in temporal terms. I read this aspect of her work
                     through Kristen Ross’s recent study, <em>Communal Luxury </em>[<em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">L’Imaginaire de la Commune</span></em>], which makes available and recharges for public use the idea of a far-flung tradition
                     of luxurious working in common. The argument of <span style="font-style:italic">Communal Luxury</span> builds from the eponymous French communard manifesto regarding “transforming aesthetic
                     coordinates” in the reliance of political and social transformation upon public art:
                     “We will work cooperatively toward our regeneration, the birth of communal luxury,
                     future splendors and the Universal Republic. –Federation of Artists Manifesto, April
                     1871” (Ross 39, 58). For Ross, appending the word “communal” to “luxury” changes the
                     meaning of the latter term. After the model of the 1871 Communards, Ross breaks down
                     the duality between necessity and luxury. Both Lorde and Ross insist that what is
                     needed is to uncover previously submerged forms of living, in Ross’s words to maintain
                     a vital prolongation, a “life beyond life” (6). Lorde and Ross both, too, are making
                     an argument against the further misapplication of assigning inverted values from this
                     binary: the wrongful designation of necessary things as luxury goods.

                              kind, would be replaced by communal luxury, or equality in abundance” (Ross, 63.)</span></div>

               <p>Within her “project of making art lived—not superfluous or trivial, but vital and
                  indispensable to the community,” Ross promotes the term luxury (59). Indeed, <em>Communal Luxury</em> maintains that it is the Malthusian calculus of modern capitalism itself that generates
                  the model of economic scarcity through which the system is perpetuated (72, 127).
                  In the urgency of Lorde’s project, necessity comes to the front. For her all luxury
                  is what Ross calls “senseless luxury,” the privilege to suffer the illusion to be
                  careless of need (63). Shelley, Lorde, and Ross align in their individual conceptualizations
                  of the roles of value and imagination in relation to productive reason—to material
                  and even to mental production. We don’t need more knowledge. For Lorde specifically,
                  “there are no new ideas still waiting in the wings to save us as women” (38). All
                  three writers are committed to a different form of the analysis: “We want the creative
                  capacity to imagine that which we know; we want the generous impulse to act that which
                  imagine; we want the poetry of life: our calculations have outrun conception; we have
                  eaten more than we can digest” (530). Lorde, indeed, often construes the important
                  new information to be gained by poetic creation and scrutiny as outside the domain
                  of thought altogether. Rather, poetic practice makes deep and even pre-verbal knowledges
                  available for living.</p>
               <p>In “The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action,” Lorde shares an idiosyncratic
                  tactical definition of fear and fearlessness as the “final luxury.” She writes: “For
                  we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own needs for language and definition,
                  and while we wait in silence for that final luxury of fearlessness, the weight of
                  the silence will choke us” (44). Or again, in 
                  “Uses of the Erotic”
                  : “But giving in to the fear of feeling and working to capacity is a luxury only the
                  unintentional can afford, and the unintentional are those who do not wish to guide
                  their own destinies” (54). In a passage from 
                  “The Transformation of Silence,”
                  Lorde says that “[w]e can learn to work and speak when we are afraid in the same way
                  we have learned to work and speak when we are tired” (44). The necessity of poetry
                  and the sense of communal luxury that one finds so strikingly in Lorde and Ross and
                  the livable habit of working and speaking “when we are afraid,”—seeking “our own needs
                  for language and definition” by moving through, not halting in, fear—contrast to the
                  final luxuries of fear and scarcity (of biological life, time, and socially necessary
                  goods) that are senseless. These cannot be afforded.</p>
               <p>The introduction to <em>Sister Outsider</em> presents Lorde’s writing as a contribution to “an impulse toward wholeness.” (Bereano
                  8). Such a presentation anticipates Lorde’s sentence from “The Transformation of Silence”:
                  “Tell them about how you’re never really a whole person if you remain silent” (42).
                  This deep impulse to realize wholeness comes from the expression of resistance to
                  an experience of alternately fragmented, managed, and administered life known so well
                  by earlier Romantic writers. Lorde transmutes the two fundamental enlightenment figures
                  of light and critical examination in 
                  “Poetry is Not a Luxury”
                  and other essays. Like Shelley’s atmospheres of light in the <em>Defence</em>, in the opening paragraph on the fundamentally poetic act of valuation, she writes
                  of “[t]he quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives”; this light we create
                  and bring with us “has direct bearing upon the product which we live, and upon the
                  changes which we hope to bring about through those lives” (36). “And there is, for
                  me, no difference between writing a good poem and moving into sunlight against the
                  body of a woman I love” (58). Giving a rich form of self-evidence to a haptic and
                  erotic body of anti-enlightenment knowledge and helping to develop what Ferguson calls
                  an eros of the critical imagination (297), Lorde’s writings perform an unanticipated
                  but necessary inner transformation of Shelley’s critique of Enlightenment stockpiling
                  of knowledge in the <em>Defence</em>, in which Lorde pursues “the felt above the ideational, affect above theory” (Mangrum
                  338).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This poetics develops fully in what remains the merely potentially human space of
                     the contrasts Shelley implies in the <em>Defence</em>, between “practice,” “distribution,” and “poetry” on the one hand, and “wisdom,”
                     “knowledge,” and “systems of thought” on the other: <span class="quote">‘We have more moral, political, and historical wisdom than we know how to reduce into
                        practice; we have more scientific and economical knowledge than can be accommodated
                        to the just distribution of the produce which it multiplies. The poetry in these systems
                        of thought, is concealed by the accumulation of facts and calculating processes. There
                        is no want of knowledge respecting what is wisest and best in morals, government,
                        and political oeconomy, or at least, what is wiser and better than what men now practice
                        and endure. (530)’</span> Of a piece with the felt conviction and persuasiveness with which she writes, Lorde
                     views the activity of thinking itself suspiciously. She even fears it.

                              people did and that you had to sort of practice? That it wasn’t something you just
                              did”: ‘“‘It was a very mysterious process for me. And it was one I had come to suspect

                              or convictions I had come to about my own life, my own feelings, that defied thought.

                     multiple essays, Lorde does not allow her relation to fear to metastasize or describe
                     regions of experience she will not open. Her language around fear is proportionate
                     to the discussion of loving and nearly as rich. She analyzes the experience of living
                     actively with fear as a part of a non-utilitarian practice of “feeling and working
                     to capacity” in practical, ethical, and poetic forms of life.</p>

                     embodied subjects may feel in being forced to enlighten those in privilege suggests
                     the need for a politics of solidarity in fatigue, as much as a relational affirmation
                     of love-politics.

                     </div> In order to step into the erotics of light, the handling of anger in Lorde’s writings
                     offers a profoundly necessary continuation and corrective for the disabling fear of
                     anger, a relation to fear and anger shown throughout the career of Percy Shelley.
                     Lorde’s range of affective and political investments in poetry point the way to a
                     more productive relation to the emotions, thoughts, and insights we fear, using the
                     very condition of the body as a means to go forward, asking courageously “Does it
                     feel right to me?” As Lorde says caringly of her son in 
                     “Man Child”
                     : “I do not exist to do his feeling for him” (74). However, in Shelley’s distribution
                     of feeling-in-thought, fear and anger are both philosophically and personally deprived
                     working through. Denied metaphysical reality in Shelley’s utopian politics, anger
                     and fear are thereby relegated to status of the demonic. Barbara Johnson captures
                     this with cutting briskness as a primary fact of Shelley’s existence: “He was a vegetarian,
                     but was trained as a skilled huntsman and harbored murderous feelings” (83). Similarly,
                     James Chandler remarks that Shelley’s aristocratic identity by birth was the basis
                     for a lifelong attitude of “self-renunciation” (344).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Disavowal is among Shelley’s deepest-rooted impulses. Politically this makes sense,
                  while it seems to me at the same time to limit and distort Shelley’s relationship
                  to the self-querying of the rightness of some of his uglier feelings. Shelley claims
                  in the fragmentary essay 
                  “On Love,”
                  an essay only published at Mary Shelley’s discretion in <em>The Keepsake</em> of 1829, that: <span class="quote">‘“[Love] is that powerful attraction towards all that we conceive of fear or hope
                     beyond ourselves when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient
                     void and seek to awaken in all things that are community with what we experience within
                     ourselves. If we reason we would be understood; if we imagine we would that the airy
                     children of our brain were born anew within another’s, if we feel, we would that another’s
                     nerves should vibrate to our own, that the beams of their eyes should kindle at once
                     and mix and melt into our own, that lips of motionless ice should not reply to lips
                     quivering and burning with the heart’s best blood. This is Love. This is the bond
                     and sanction which connects not only man with man, but with every thing which exists.”
                     (504–5)’</span> In <em>A Defence of Poetry</em>, there is no fear in the parallel version of the statement: “The great secret of
                  morals is Love; or a going out of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves
                  with the beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own” (517).
                  The “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty” ends by enjoining the “SPIRIT fair” to “fear himself,
                  and love all human kind” (96). These lines are often given the unwarranted, restrictive
                  parsing of fear as self-respect. But they are based on a want of self-trust and inward
                  examination in traversing “the chasm of an insufficient void.”</p>
               <p>Colin Jager has written discerningly on Shelley’s philosophical poetics and the “adventures
                  of human flourishing,” in a reading that elaborates the stakes and risks to the meaning
                  of the poet’s atheism as an occupation (240). As part of this commentary, Jager observes,
                  Act IV of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> operates “on the far side of fear” (243). But this boundary marking of a dispensation
                  after fear only makes the discontinuous handling—an Ariel-like vaulting over to the
                  farther shore, not a culture of working through—that much clearer to view. The elisions
                  of fear practiced by Shelley, and at times by his commentators, leave the dark and
                  legitimate sources of their emotional power and need unaddressed. If Shelley at such
                  moments is disabled by his own aversion to the processing of anger and fear, the repression
                  is directed toward a fear, foremost, of his own responsive capacity for anger, and
                  therefore instances a repression of susceptibilities and responsibilities that are
                  inseparable from language and feeling as such.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Here Lorde can offer a strong and necessary comparative contrast in which we do not
                     require sympathetically outgoing desires to be valued alone by the false innocence
                     bought with disavowal, and thus we can risk the achievement of both integrity and
                     experience. In her poem, 
                     “Between Ourselves,”
                      Lorde models the ossified psychic form of hatred so as to give opportunity to life
                     outside the containment of the interlocking structure of a nested, negative conformity
                     of self and other: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                        </div>
                     </blockquote> This poetics of a public feeling communicated “between ourselves” bears with great
                     insight on Shelley’s desire, in 
                     “On Love,”
                      go decisively “beyond ourselves” by awakening a sort of community-in-harmonics with
                     experience “within ourselves.” But Lorde’s love-politics does not seek the mirroring
                     symmetry of that “same direction.” Rendered anew in the analogy with 
                     “Between Ourselves,”
                      Shelley’s geometry of a responsive sympathy looks instead like the orientation of
                     bodies in the hold of a ship, or a cemetery full of headstones all levelled one way
                     after a storm. To read Lorde’s 
                     “Poetry is Not a Luxury”
                      back into and with Shelley, is to return to a felt and embedded, not mirroring, relationship
                     of the public feeling of love, “going out” of the self, and to the working through
                     of experiences of fear that cannot be expelled from “our own needs for language and
                     definition,” an examination of the full value carried by imagination. It is also,
                     as in the brief reading of 
                     “Coal”
                      at the start of this essay, to examine and develop capacities that seem too occluded
                     to bring to light; to go deeper into the densities of relation, in an inversion of
                     the way Keats urged Shelley to mine concertedly for the sake of the extraction of
                     beauty for poetry.

               the feminist quarterly journal <em>Chrysalis</em> (337). Mangrum’s work is one source of my emphasis on administered culture.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">As Wolfson notes, the corresponding passage in <em>A Philosophical View of Reform</em> (1819–20) states that “Poets and philosophers are the unacknowledged legislators
               of the world” (341). In this sense <em>A Philosophical View of Reform</em> does not merely anticipate and “repeat” in advance the more famous conclusion of
               <em>A Defence</em> but may seek to stabilize concepts beyond the flux of aesthetic emotion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Gilles Deleuze’s philosophy from his early work on represents the most coherent and
               suggestive major attempt to cleave to the radical implications of Humean skepticism;
               see Deleuze (2005, 2011). Also, relevant and exciting here on a different philosophical
               trajectory is Morton, 
               “An Object-Oriented Defense of Poetry.”
               Morton’s essay pursues the idea of agency as inhering in the essences of all objects,
               as expressed in their “causal” aesthetic relations.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               in <em>A Defence</em>, see Shelley’s <em>Selected Poetry and Prose</em>, page 511(“and as the lyre trembles and sounds after the wind has died away, so the
               child seeks…”); page 516 (“In the infancy of the world, neither poets themselves nor
               their auditors are fully aware of the excellency of poetry: for it acts in a divine
               and unapprehended manner, beyond and above consciousness; and it is reserved for future
               generations to contemplate and measure the mighty cause and effect in all the strength
               and splendour of their union”; page 534 (“Poetry, as has been said, in this respect
               differs from logic, that it is not subject to the control of the active powers of
               the mind, and that its birth and recurrence has no necessary connexion with consciousness
               or will. It is presumptuous to determine that these are the necessary conditions of
               mental causation, when mental effects are experienced insusceptible of being referred
               to them.” But rather than simply annulling causation, Shelley also delineates effects
               that are mutual determinations, particularly upon poets and poetry: “Poets, not otherwise
               than philosophers, painters, sculptors, and musicians, are in one sense the creators
               and in one sense the creations of their age. From this subjection the loftiest do
               not escape” (208).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               open to queer affiliations he did not anticipate. For a complex, rhetorically negative
               reading of Shelley’s poem <em>The Triumph of Life</em> along these lines, see Edelman. McLane accounts for Shelley in terms of sex-positive
               1990s queer poetics (231).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               go no more a roving.” Phallic as it is, the atmosphere of potentiality and latency
               in Shelley’s image of lightning should be contrasted to the much more grandiose anti-heroic
               image in Byron of lightning as a figure of potency and mortal fatigue. This image
               fixated Shelley and needed a counter.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">In Shelley’s <em>The Witch of Atlas</em>, another seriocomic poem of 1820, the mischievous and undesiring Witch kneads together
               a “sexless” hermaphrodite from “liquid love,” in order to help power her journeys
               in the boat refitted from the unwanted car of Venus, “too feeble to be fraught” with
               all of Venus’ sex in the back seat (376–7). This “living Image” of the career of Love
               indicates playfully just the extent to which Shelley in all seriousness needed to
