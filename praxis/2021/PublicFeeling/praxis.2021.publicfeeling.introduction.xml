                editorial rationale for why we and these essays' authors aim to seek different ways
                of reading that merge or overlap questions of aesthetic form, social life, and
                affective disposition. We begin with the reminder that the imaginative precincts
                within which such questions might be raised were always and already inseparable for
                Romantic writers: in the Romantic poetics outlined here, feeling is not strictly
                private. We then provide summaries of the four essays and afterword, placing
                emphasis on the authors' various attention to sociable affects, including disgust,
                complicity, guilt, and hope.</p>

We are particularly grateful to this issue’s essay contributors (each of whom presented papers at that seminar), whose patience and generosity of thought helped to shape the issue and our rationale for it. We thank Nancy Yousef for joining us, and for her guidance and humor throughout the editing process. Our special thanks too to the general editors of Romantic Circles Praxis Series. Tristram would like to recognize Samantha Botz (PhD, Northwestern) as a valued interlocutor on ideas about collective feeling in the Romantic century. Finally, we want to recognize here the recent loss of Lauren Berlant: without their work this project would be unimaginable.</note>

                <div type="section">
            <p>The quotations above from Wordsworth, Blake, and Barbauld offer three different takes
                on the sharedness of feeling: the surprise of joy and of the disappointment that
                there is no one with whom to share it; the presumed inevitability of sharing someone
                else’s sorrow just from the sight of their tears; and the warning that belonging to
                a nation means partaking of its guilt and pain. As distinct as these passages are,
                Wordsworth’s question “Oh! with whom” could be asked in all three poems. The
                fellow-feeling that Blake may seem to be describing as natural was neither
                inevitable nor guaranteed to all persons, and as Steven Goldsmith has suggested, we
                might read the rhetorical questions in <title level="a">On Anothers Sorrow</title> literally to reveal
                Blake’s despair about a hypocritical or calculated kind of sympathy and
                sentimentalism (191). What is more, James Chandler’s account of the economic
                language at work in Blake’s poetics of feeling suggests that “share” as a noun here
                recalls an affective economy in which emotion is not only calculable but also
                complicit: “Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody poor” (27).
                Barbauld’s lines too might, at first glance, seem certain about who is sharing
                feeling, but in addressing the British public, she imagines a dispersed, communal
                guilt and woe that belongs to everyone and no one at once.</p>
            <p>In this special issue, we have assembled a collection of essays that take a closer
                look at how collective feeling—or “feeling together,” as Nancy Yousef puts it in her
                “Afterword”—takes poetic form in Romantic writing. How is a particular collective, a
                “public,” congealed or construed through the stances and textures of imaginative
                writing? And why should we specify that feeling is “public” at all, if (as we
                believe) all feeling is relational? The individualization or privatization of
                feeling, like the desire for its calculability, is a kind of open question for
                Romantic-era writers. “Publics are queer creatures,” writes Michael Warner: “You
                cannot point to them, count them, or look them in the eye. You also cannot easily
                avoid them. They have become an almost natural feature of the social landscape, like
                pavement” (7). The apparently simple fact of sharing feeling, then—with another
                person or with an entire nation—subjects both the feeling and the feeler to a shaky
                dispersion; where does feeling end if it is public? Turning to share feeling’s
                transport and finding the question “Oh! with whom,” might capture, in one way, the
                questions of public feeling that the essays in this collection seek to address. With
                whom is feeling shared, as it becomes evident that it exceeds the individual?
                Perhaps we should ask, then, not how feelings become public, but how feelings create
                publics, or how publics already vibrate with feeling. What does it feel like to be
                (or not to be) attached to a country or community, to have (or not to have)
                membership or citizenship, in ways that one can neither contain nor control?</p>
            <p>This volume turns to Romanticism, as a historical and a literary formation, to
                consider how public feelings operate and circulate through the language of poetry.
                How does poetry mediate the politics and sociality of feeling? How can poetry
                register not just the solitary, recollected overflow of powerful feeling, but also a
                communal, complicit, or contagious one? Along with our contributors, we would like
                to pose the question here: how are feelings implicated in and around poetry—and how
                does poetry interfere in, perpetuate, or rearticulate feelings circulated in zones
                of sociality loosely denoted as public? Intervening variously in poetics, affect
                theory, and critical social theory, the contributors to this volume examine literary
                scenes in order to assert that feeling is part of a structured world—in other words,
                that public feeling is what builds and unravels the conflicted experience of
                collective life.</p>
            <p>We have gathered this selection of essays in order to bring together in new
                configurations the study of poetics, affect, and politics for the field of
                Romanticism. In response to Lauren Berlant’s suggestion that “public spheres are
                affect worlds at least as much as they are effects of rationality and
                rationalization” (450), the contributors collectively pursue the question of how
                poetry and poetic form might provide a different kind of understanding of the
                formation of publics and counter-publics that compete for historical visibility. In
                a critical tradition that has already—as Mary Favret has shown—increasingly revealed
                “the intractably social and material bases for romantic esthetics and the poets’ deep awareness of this dependency” (<title level="a">Study
                of Affect and Romanticism,</title> 1163), we aim here to pursue more explicitly questions
                of social and political urgency that emerge in an unfolding historical present. Just
                like any other domain of culture, Romantic poetry is rife or riven with feeling. But how might we recognize its feelings as tuned
                in to the political or the communal, or as public?</p>
            <p>In focusing on “public feeling,” we take a cue from the recent work in affect theory
                by Ann Cvetkovitch and Lauren Berlant (members of the Public Feelings project from
                the early 2000s on), as well as that of Jennifer Nash, Sara Ahmed, Sianne Ngai, and
                Eve Sedgwick. These scholars draw on feminist and queer studies to articulate the
                intricacies and histories of social and political feeling and the ways in which
                feeling might produce new forms of sociality. Indeed, as Nash has written, pointing
                to, among others, the work of poets June Jordan and Audre Lorde (the latter of whom
                Eric Lindstrom’s essay in this volume takes up), “the labor of constructing
                political communities around ‘public feelings’ and ‘communal affect’ has been a
                black feminist investment for decades” (20). But “public feeling” could describe
                sensibilities plainly active in the Romantic era, as well. In investigating what she
                describes as the “unfinished business of sentimentality,” Berlant reminds us that
                the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were crucial moments for understanding the
                origins of the modern interlacing of politics and feeling. Writing about
                contemporary political feeling, Cvetkovich links her account of depression as a
                public feeling to Romantic-era debates about slavery and abolition, reminding us
                that we must understand sentimental, abolitionist modes of representation, in order
                to understand “contemporary human rights discourses that still traffic in the
                generation of affect through representations that aim to touch their audiences” (9).
                In his recent discussion of affect, “mood,” and the Black romantic subject, Bakary
                Diaby argues that historicity itself is “a Romantic mood that still sets the terms
                by which we discuss racial subjection in the present” (121). Romanticism, it seems,
                describes the beginning of an affective political moment in which we are still
                immersed.</p>
            <p>The phrase “public feeling” also recalls the preoccupation in eighteenth-century
                British moral philosophy with describing and prescribing the fellow-ness of feeling.
                The vast and excellent scholarship in the last thirty or so years on the history of
                sympathy and sensibility by—among others—James Chandler, Julie Ellison, Lynn Festa,
                Steven Goldsmith, Thomas Pfau, Adela Pinch, Amit Rai, and Nancy Yousef, has
                demonstrated how deep the interest in, and anxiety about, fellow-feeling ran. What
                bothered David Hume and Adam Smith, Pfau explains, was that “something as ostensibly
                private and inward as a feeling should be imbued with so much social energy” (4). In
                other words, sympathy acts, as Pinch puts it, as a reminder that “one’s feelings may
                really be someone else’s” (7). In Ellison’s view, the literature of sensibility
                “exposes a complicated awareness of the human costs of national and imperial
                economies, as well as the knowledge that sensibility itself is a privilege.
                Sensibility is the <emph>admitted</emph> connection
                between speculation, mood, and power” (7). Festa also situates discussions of
                sympathy and sentimentality in the context of empire, arguing that “by governing the
                circulation of feeling among subjects and objects, sentimentality helps to define
                who will be acknowledged as human” (3). More recently, Yousef has taught us to
                “soften the hard opposing edges of solitary inwardness and interpersonal exposure”
                and suspend the ethical and epistemic questions that so often arise about sympathy
                by shifting terms to “intimacy” (4). In her afterword to this collection, Yousef
                also suggests a rearrangement of terms, replacing “public feeling” with an expansive
                sense of “complicity” that exceeds its more typical connotations of guilt and
                responsibility.</p>
            <p>If historians have argued that a new kind of national identity and sympathy took hold
                during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England, what feelings did
                that newly imagined community elicit, rely upon, and silence?<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Linda Colley’s <title level="m">Britons: Forging the Nation
                                1707–1837.</title></note> What were the feelings that
                surrounded, propelled, and resisted the development of industrialization,
                colonialism, war, and slavery? These are questions that were asked directly and
                urgently at the time. Barbauld, for example, in her anonymous anti-war pamphlet from
                1793, <title level="m">Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation,</title> asks “how far
                as individuals are we really answerable for the guilt of national sins?”
                (<title level="m">Selected Poetry and Prose</title>, 315). As the
                essays in this volume by Anastasia Eccles and Amelia Worsley both emphasize, the
                thinking in the 1790s and early years of the nineteenth century about government,
                power, violence, and citizenship led to a growing awareness and self-consciousness
                about widespread complicity. The literatures of sentiment, Ellison writes, serve “as
                indices of the pain caused by political arrangements from which artists and
                intellectuals knowingly benefited but at the same time could not control” (7). The
                idea of communal feeling was perhaps described most commonly at the time through the
                word “general”; it is Barbauld again who wrote that “the whole time of war ought to
                be a time of <emph>general mourning</emph>, a mourning in the heart, a
                mourning much more sincere than on the death of one of those princes whose cursed
                ambition is often the sole cause of war” (<title level="m">Civic Sermons</title> 19).
                Anticipating Percy Shelley’s diagnoses of the politics of mourning, Barbauld’s
                demand for general mourning and Shelley’s calls for “universal grief” at “national
                calamity” (379) both work reactively, pushing back against the emotional demands of
                the state, demands that are often “curiously announced from outside and on high”
                (Favret, <title level="m">The General Fast</title> 130).</p>
            <p>We are certainly accustomed to thinking of poetry as both representing and producing
                powerful feeling, but we have perhaps given less attention to how a poetics might
                produce or reveal important political feelings in the reader. This is familiar
                territory in the study of abolitionist literature, carefully calculated to elicit
                the reader’s delicate sympathies. But as Worsley’s essay reminds us, the gap between
                Romanticism and abolitionist literature has in some ways been wider than it needs to
                be, part of a broader aesthetic vilification of “public poetry.” We think there is
                still more work to be done on how poetic figure and form alter our conception of the
                feelings that both compose and decompose the individual in its historical forms. How
                does imaginative literature study the feelings that mark both our alienation from
                others and our attachments? How does poetry register not individual emotion but
                emergent political formations of indifference or care, such as the urban repulsion
                tracked here by Samalin between Wordsworth’s poetry and the sociology that emerged
                across the nineteenth century? How might narratives of this kind prompt a different
                engagement between Romantic poetics and contemporary expressions of social
                inextricability, such as that described by Nash in her recent account of “black
                feminist love-politics” (14)?</p>
            <p>Although it is not a term of art used by the contributors themselves, the rubric of
                “reading practices” offers a ground for thinking together the affective,
                epistemological, and sociological valences that animate these essays. For instance,
                the idea of a feeling of readerly “complicity” that both Eccles and Worsley develop
                becomes, in their respective essays, an occasion for theorizing the relation between
                the narrative theme of guilt and the affective experience of standing idly by, both
                modeled for, and produced in, the reader. Eccles identifies the trope of apostrophe
                in Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794) as a stylistic means for
                focusing on the power of highly localized, emotionally-fraught linguistic events in
                forming a public. Worsley examines how Southey’s use of the ballad form subtly
                confronts the reader with the interaction among personae that spring into life
                through the iterative structure of the ballad, forcing readers to feel their desire
                to be an observer to suffering.<note place="foot" resp="author"> This observation draws on especially generative scholarship on the “medium” of the ballad, by Maureen McLane and Celeste Langan.</note>
                In both these essays, formal features derived from poetic and narrative theory are
                recast as ethically-charged stances. Poetry is considered not simply as a collection
                of historically shifting genre forms, but more emphatically—in the poetics of knowledge that emerge across genres—as
                a set of imaginative protocols for understanding how publics take shape through
                intimate social and psychic relations.<note place="foot" resp="author"> We borrow the term “poetics of knowledge” from Jacques Rancière.</note></p>
            <p>One crucial requisite for our interest in “public feeling,” then, following Berlant’s
                observation about public spheres as affect worlds, is that we take the term poetry
                to mean something quite expansive, something like the aesthetic flexibility of form
                in a given corner of communicative or emotional life. Zachary Samalin’s essay adopts
                a genealogical method, assembling poetic and sociological scenes from Wordsworth to
                Weber, that allows him to trace the affective disposition of disgust or revulsion in
                city life across new formalizations of social theory in the nineteenth century.
                Representations of the urban crowd, argues Samalin, increasingly teach analysts of
                nineteenth-century social form to understand the fact of bodily proximity and the
                welter of unwelcome sensory stimuli through the “unwanted feeling” of disgust. This
                disgust is then quietly converted, in mid-century texts by Engels and Mayhew, into
                the more abstracted feeling of alienation. By the end of the nineteenth century,
                when Durkheim set out to fix the outlines of the study of society on scientific
                principles, it is utterly forgotten that a sublimated feeling of disgust is the
                basis for neutral observation of other humans, now fully alienated from the analyst:
                hence Durkheim’s disavowal of the relevance of feeling anything at all while
                analyzing society. In Samalin’s vivid account, we can see how Wordsworth’s visceral
                response to the sights, sounds, and smells of the city in Book 7 of the <title level="m">Prelude</title> (1850)—the “funhouse mayhem” of Bartholomew
                Fair—prefigures an entire way of thinking about urban disaffection, in preparation
                for its eventual codification as the prerequisite for a science of society. But it
                is not until we know that observational neutrality is fashioned from intense
                repulsion that we can recognize this as a kind of paradox. By reading the “poetics”
                of sociology, Samalin demonstrates that affective norms take shape historically, and
                more specifically, that social imaginaries have what he calls an “emotional
                grammar.”</p>
            <p>Following Samalin’s genealogical sweep, we turn to the pair of essays already
                described, each of which pursues closer-textured literary readings with broad
                implications for the study of reading practices and Romantic genres. While Anastasia
                Eccles tackles a narrative politics embedded in the novel’s care for how the reader
                might read herself into (and out of) the novelistic scene, Amelia Worsley addresses
                a similarly choreographed situation in narrative poetry that guides the
                identificatory options available through its mediated form and structure of address.
                Interestingly, as noted above, both essays hinge on the invitation to a readerly
                sense of complicity. Eccles’s <title level="a">Feeling Complicit in William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title></title> does this while carrying out a striking
                re-evaluation of this canonical work, using an affectively attuned formalism.
                Keeping in mind Godwin’s philosophical accounts of agency and causation, Eccles
                finds in the novel’s plot an attention to “complicity,” or an unwilled, precarious
                state of “interdependence” that, Eccles argues alongside Godwin, should constitute
                mutual responsibility in any given social formation. Building her readings of
                Godwin’s fiction (and its reception) through perceptive recourse to his political
                theory, Eccles makes the compelling suggestion that fiction—even while offering, in
                this case, a page-turning Gothic detective novel—can serve as an almost didactic
                technology for inducing an awareness of shared damage everywhere enacted, but rarely
                acknowledged, in the ordinary practices of everyday life. Eccles brings to light
                several specific devices the novel uses to angle in on the many ways of relating to
                one’s own practice of reading (e.g., the novelistic use of apostrophe). Like
                Samalin’s “unwanted feeling,” the felt complicity both dramatized in, and passed
                along by, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794) is partly defined as social
                in the sense of “atmospheric,” or unwilled. Yet its inevitability can equally be, as
                Eccles points out in closing, a necessary, perhaps even invigorating reminder of
                “the ways we always read as, against, and through one another.”</p>
            <p>As in Samalin’s account of a network of affective relations submerged in a poetics of
                sociology, Eccles makes her case by suggesting that it is the poetics latent in
                Godwin’s prose—those “forms of lyric address that confuse guilty characters and
                eavesdropping readers”—that gives the novel’s expressions both their local ambiguity
                and their potential durability in the public feeling of complicity. From sociology
                and narrative, we proceed in Worsley’s and Lindstrom’s essays to several modes more
                familiar to scholars of Romantic poetry: the ballad, the abolitionist poem, and the
                “defense” of poetry. In <title level="a">Abolitionist Publics,</title> Worsley looks at readerly complicity
                in the context of the preeminently public genre of the abolitionist poem, which she
                suggests has been too often derogated in aesthetic terms, precisely on the basis of
                its aspirations to sway the public on a live question in political debate. Using one
                example of abolitionist poetry’s “shadow canon” as a case study, Robert Southey’s
                1799 ballad <title level="a">The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade,</title> Worsley shows how—in
                ugly tension with the poem’s “abhorrent” thematic transferal of suffering from Black
                bodies to white consciences—the poem’s form seeks to create an abolitionist public.
                Long read as a minor work—a failed attempt to translate the archaic mariner of
                Coleridge’s 1798 <title level="a">Rime,</title> as a notoriously nebulous allegory of guilt, into a
                present-day sailor and explicit participant in Britain’s slavery economy—Southey’s
                ballad becomes, for Worsley, a place to examine the formation and perception of
                ethical norms regarding the politics of enslaved labor. Reading a precise
                choreography of voices in the poem—both as it repurposes the ballad as “medium,” and
                as it diagrams guilt between confessor, captain, minister, and reader—Worsley reveals
                an unexpected complexity in the structures of liberal sympathy, disidentification,
                and misrecognition experienced by the reader in traversing the poem’s staged “space
                of collective consciousness.” Refusing merely to dramatize the remorse of a sailor
                coerced into murder and confirm the sentimental reader’s innocence, the poem instead
                rewrites sympathy and individual guilt as a pervasive and banalized chain of
                complicity: the reader can neither “sympathize with” nor “condemn” the poem’s actors
                without mimicking the sailor’s desire for self-exculpation. Thus, even as it
                explicitly aims to broadcast abolitionism with a pious call to prayer, Worsley
                unearths how the poem also indicates that the slave trade is a “communal violence”
                that belongs as well to the counterpublic it calls into being.</p>
            <p>Shifting theoretical gears, Lindstrom’s essay builds around the climactic claims of
                two very different and yet, in this account, profoundly cognate essays: Audre
                Lorde’s <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury</title> (1984) and Percy Shelley’s <title level="a">A Defence of Poetry</title>
                (1821). In both, poetry becomes the stuff of everyday life and initiates the
                possibility of (a new) society, turning a claim for the ordinariness of aesthetic
                experience into “a fundamental argument about the necessity of poetry.” This
                “necessity” is expressed famously by Shelley as a kind of “unacknowledged”
                legislation, and arrestingly by Lorde as “the skeleton architecture of our lives.”
                Lindstrom teases out the contrast between Lorde and Shelley in a series of readings
                that draws directly on the affect theories of Lauren Berlant, Kathleen Stewart, and
                others. In pursuing unforeseen convergences between Lorde and Shelley, arguably one
                of the “white fathers” alluded to in her essay <title level="a">Poetry is Not a Luxury,</title> his essay
                creatively locates a “lateral agency” in Shelley’s thought, which highlights not the
                negative effects of Shelley’s “dispersive poetics” but rather a “collective
                experiential promise.” This allows us to glimpse how, read with Lorde, something
                quite different emerges from Shelley’s thought. Lindstrom contrasts Shelley’s
                lightning-like visions with what Lorde calls that “quality of light” that
                characterizes the collective she has in mind, now emphatically situated and
                embodied: “<emph>For women</emph>, then, poetry is not a luxury” (37);
                indeed, Lorde’s poet is aligned with “the black mothers in each of us,” an “us”
                meant to disable the universalization of experience. Lindstrom’s essay thus proposes
                that there is much to learn when Lorde is read “into and with” Shelley: for Lorde’s
                conception of poetry as “the distillation of experience” (39) builds its shared,
                ordinary feelings from something like Shelley’s inchoate futurity, only now in a
                manner attuned to the practical, embodied necessities of emotional life, where
                affective relations like anger, fear, or love are imagined through a “felt and
                embedded, not mirroring, relationship.”</p>
            <p>Lastly, Nancy Yousef’s “Afterword” concludes the series by offering a new lens for
                looking at the issue’s themes, while situating these themes and their treatment as
                pregnantly “symptomatic of our moment.” Articulating an unstated premise of what the
                contributors hold in common, Yousef opens by suggesting a “redundancy” in the phrase
                “public feeling,” insofar as feeling takes place in expression as an ongoing “call
                upon us” (in the words of Stanley Cavell). The notion of private feeling is then
                revealed as a subset of the social: that is, what we think of as private feeling is
                a learned etiquette of tacit legibility, or of open concealment, that we have
                chances to notice or let be. Taking up several lines from Godwin, which Eccles
                examines in her essay on readerly complicity, Yousef pursues and expands the idea of
                shared feeling across all four essays, now as a “more capacious” complicity, one
                that will “require new ways of speaking about agency” if it wants to redefine
                “public” so as to span “the vast extent of our co-implication with one another.” As
                Yousef has it, the essays together seek out the gradations of reception and response
                in the formation of expressive publics—fine lines to which romantic writing
                regularly returns us, in the many and various versions of what Anne-Lise François
                has memorably called “recessive action” (1). In pointing to the contributors’
                collective understanding of close reading as a practice of shared life, Yousef
                argues that it is through the essays’ “renewed commitment” to reading that
                complicity earns the expansive redefinition it receives here.</p>
            <p>Such complicity would take many forms, not all negative. In being “<emph>Surprised</emph> by joy,” Wordsworth’s narrator has in a sense already “shared” the feeling which comes over him. In her powerful overview of the issue, Yousef
                reminds us that the essays in this collection “all address the imbrication of
                aesthetic form and emotions,” in order to find “points of ethical inflection.” While
                differing significantly in their methods, each contributor addresses the formal
                dimension of feeling that structures aesthetic production, at least implicitly
                imagining the intimate circumstances required for social identification and
                recognition. Their shared point of departure might be said to match what Judith
                Butler calls our impressionability, a way of imagining subject formation taking
                place through unwilled publics, through ethical call and expressive response: more
                than a kind of conduct, the ethical becomes “a way of understanding the relational
                framework within which sense, action, and speech become possible” (12). To return to
                Cavell, and to Yousef’s insightful joining of the notion of “public feeling” with
                the supposed problem of private language, we might say that the work we gather here
                seeks not merely to insist on revealing that what seems private is really public, as
                though that were the point, but also to redefine “public” as the collective task of
                putting something together, of composition: “It is little help in this work . . . to
                take reassurance from the supposed fact…that language <emph>is</emph>
                public, that it is shared. This prompts us to avoid seeking sociably to provide help
                and example sufficient to <emph>make</emph> it public, to see it shared”
                (185). Perhaps it is poetry, in the ordinary sense—Lorde’s “quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives” (36)—that makes
                feeling together possible.</p>
