            <p class="noCount">This essay considers the role of disgust in the emergence of sociological theory over
               the course of the nineteenth century. It argues that what began as the bourgeois social
               analyst’s disgust towards the modern city gradually transformed, over the course of
               the century, into the modern sociological theorization of alienation as a form of
               low-level repulsion. To track these changes in the function of disgust within social
               analysis, the essay begins with a reading of William Wordsworth’s description in <em>The Prelude</em> of London as a "vast mill, / …vomiting, receiving on all sides, / Men, women, three-years’
               children, babes in arms,” before turning to Friedrich Engels’s claim that “the very
               turmoil of [London’s] streets has something repulsive, something against which human
               nature rebels.”</p>

            <p>“Feeling is an object for scientific study,” Émile Durkheim declares in <em>The Rules of Sociological Method</em> (1895), “not the criterion of scientific truth” (39–40). Emotional bias and sentimental
               attachment needed to be “rooted out” from the sociologist’s method, he insists, in
               order for the discipline to establish itself as a legitimate branch of scientific
               knowledge distinct, crucially, from the socially critical ambitions of realist or
               naturalist literature in the same period. However, social phenomena posed a special
               problem to this process of excluding emotions, precisely because they were so deeply,
               constitutively value laden. “We enthuse over our political and religious beliefs and
               moral practices very differently from the way we do over the objects of the physical
               world,” Durkheim goes on. Indeed, the uncritical, reflexive emotional bonds formed
               with the social are so potent, he writes, “they will not tolerate scientific examination.
               The mere fact of subjecting them . . . to cold, dry analysis is repugnant to certain
               minds.” Feeling therefore not only clouds judgment, in Durkheim’s view, but defends
               the social from critical investigation in the first place, deflecting inquiry. This
               twofold methodological problem had dogged disciplinary sociology from the start. Herbert
               Spencer, for instance, devoted an entire chapter of his 1873 methodological treatise
               <em>The Study of Sociology</em> to “Subjective Difficulties—Emotional”: “How, then,” he asks, “with such perverting
               emotions, is it possible to take a rational view of sociological facts?” (144).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Durkheim asserted that it was imperative for the sociologist to overcome the protective
                  feelings of repugnance shielding social phenomena from scientific analysis. The failure
                  to disentangle fact from feeling, to root out emotion, he warns, would mean “the negation
                  of all science" (40). Compared to some of his contemporaries, this wholesale repudiation
                  of emotion represented a polemical position. Max Weber, by contrast, remained unconvinced
                  throughout his career that the objects of the social world could be entirely isolated
                  from the evaluative presuppositions and subjective attachments which constituted them
                  to begin with. Nevertheless, Durkheim’s strong, unambivalent stance captures something
                  of the fin-de-siècle mood of residual Enlightenment enthusiasm over the possibility
                  of producing a modern scientific knowledge of the social domain freed from superstition
                  and emotional prejudice. This enthusiasm was shared across all the emerging social
                  scientific disciplines, each of which took a pronounced interest in bringing a methodological
                  objectivity modeled on the natural sciences to bear on the study of the affective
                  life of the subject. The neoclassical economists of the late nineteenth century epitomized
                  this tendency, at once intensifying their focus on the pleasures and desires of the
                  utilitarian subject while deriving their increasingly impersonal methodological premises
                  from mathematics and the physical sciences. Alfred Marshall, for example, understood
                  the ebb and surge of human appetites to be the principal engine of social and economic
                  life—but he modeled his conception of appetite on the law-bound, measurable oscillation
                  of a pendulum.

                  </div> Affective life was at the heart of the social, but in order to study it, feeling needed
                  to be overcome.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In the following pages, I offer a condensed genealogical account of how this particular
               social scientific coordination of feeling and unfeeling came to take on its commonsense
               character, such that, having emotions would come to seem like an impediment to understanding
               emotions, rather than a prerequisite or an aid. I focus in particular on the prominent
               role that the negative emotion of disgust played in this historical process. I examine
               two scenes of proto-sociological repulsion from the nineteenth century: Friedrich
               Engels’s disgust at Londoners’ alienation, and William Wordsworth’s description, in
               the seventh book of <em>The Prelude</em>, of London’s Bartholomew Fair “as if the whole were one vast mill, / Are vomiting,
               receiving on all sides, / Men, women, three-years’ children, babes in arms” (7.692–4).
               By comparing Engels and Wordsworth, and the work of later social analysts, like Georg
               Simmel, I build on and extend canonical readings by Raymond Williams and Steven Marcus,
               among others. These works sought to excavate and analyze a tradition of city writing
               that cut across genres and disciplines and reflected a new awareness of the material
               conditions of social life under nineteenth-century capitalism. My aim is different.
               While Williams was interested in analyzing the changes in what he influentially called
               the structure of feeling of modern urban life, I focus more specifically on the role
               of feeling within the development of the increasingly scientific techniques of social
               analysis in the period. In so doing, I hope to unsettle the presumed continuity that
               Williams and others have ascribed to what feeling meant in the nineteenth century.
               I also hope to shed light on the contradictory parts it played in the description
               of modern social life.</p>
            <p>This difference in focus has important methodological consequences for the way that
               I view the relationship between the literary and non-literary texts I read in this
               article. Although I do regard Wordsworth’s “Residence in London” as an important starting
               point for a genre-crossing tradition of modern city writing, my analysis also takes
               into account the role of feeling and affect in the entanglement of literary and sociological
               writing over the course of the nineteenth century, as well as in their ultimate disaggregation
               as separate disciplines. When I turn at length to Wordsworth’s description of London
               as a vomiting mill, or to his diagnosis of the metropolis as the place “where the
               human heart is sick,” I do so partly because they anticipate later analyses of urban
               alienation as an affective sickness, but more crucially because they reflect an early
               nineteenth-century moment when such analysis had yet to be subjected to the methodological
               interdiction of feeling that Durkheim so forcefully articulated at the close of the
               century. Thus, while each of the “scenes” of modern sociological repulsion I examine—Wordsworth,
               followed by Engels, then back to 1900—dramatizes an encounter with the malady of feeling
               first diagnosed by Wordsworth, what changes is the underlying normative sense of what
               feelings are, what they are meant to do, and what constitutes their deformation.</p>
            <p>Disgust played a special part in the slow emergence of nineteenth-century sociology.
               One can already begin to trace the outline of disgust’s sociological function in Durkheim’s
               ascription of a special function to repugnance. Repugnance here exemplifies the benighted
               irrationality of emotion in general, a distortion of rational judgment that demands
               the practiced restraint of the social scientist in order to be overcome. Yet even
               this rather boilerplate dualism turns out not to be so simple, since Durkheim also
               implies that repugnance is a medium of restraint in its own right. It is an emotion,
               he suggests, whose articulation fends off the claims of reason. Hence feeling was
               to be resisted, but some feelings also exerted their own forms of resistance. How
               then could one distinguish between the disciplinary restraint of the sociologist and
               the affective resistances that were to be overcome?</p>
            <p>This complexity in the sociological conception of disgust is best approached through
               a related problematization of feeling that arose specifically out of the study of
               urban life over the course of the nineteenth century, and which came to inform social
               theory in the opening decades of the twentieth. Approached from the perspective of
               urban sociology, the salient problem of modern social relations was not human emotionality
               per se, but alienation. That is, it was not the overabundance or primacy of feeling
               that was central to social theoretical analysis, but rather its deficiency, absence,
               overregulation, or deformation through life in the modern capitalist city. Indeed,
               the characterization of urban sociality as indifferent or emotionless was typical
               of turn of the century social thought. In Simmel’s influential formulation, for example,
               life in the capitalist metropolis is characterized by its emotional “reserve”: the
               “blasé attitude” whose “essence is an indifference towards the distinctions between
               things,” which stemmed from the preeminence of economic exchange (<em>Metropolis</em> 331). Weber, too, writes of the “impersonality” of city life (<em>City</em> 77), while Durkheim develops his conception of anomie—a "hatred or disgust for the
               prevailing order”—out of what he saw as the specific mismatch between the normative
               strictures of industrial society and the “bottomless abyss” of the human “capacity
               for feeling” (<em>Suicide</em> 337, 208).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The widespread diagnosis of alienation as a state devoid of feeling or of deformed
                  feeling was bound up with an equally prevalent set of ideas about the centrality of
                  disgust to human sociality. This focus on disgust as a social affect was shared by
                  social theorists working with a variety of different conceptual idioms. Most notably,
                  in Simmel’s conception of the blasé attitude, indifference and the absence of feeling
                  shade into what he describes as “a slight aversion, a mutual strangeness and repulsion
                  [<em><span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Abstoßung</span></em>]” (<em>Metropolis</em> 331). For Simmel, repulsion was a primary negative force operating beneath the veneer
                  of interpersonal neutrality. Without such “feelings of mutual strangeness and repulsion,”
                  he writes in his long essay of 1908, 
                  “Conflict,”
                   “we could not imagine what form modern urban life…might possibly take” (<em>Conflict</em> 21).

                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>On this point, see Harvey’s discussion of Simmel, 
                           “Revulsion and Revolt,”
                           in The Urban Experience (180–5).</span></div>
                  </div> Norbert Elias, too, memorably describes the slow formation of what he called the civilized
                  habitus, over the course of the medieval and early modern periods, as the outcome
                  of “advances in the threshold of repugnance” (102). Elias argues that the emotional
                  restraint that characterized modern social life was, counterintuitively, produced
                  by <em>heightened</em> disgust. In a more bombastic idiom, Georges Bataille would proclaim, in the first
                  of a pair of 1938 lectures on “Attraction and Repulsion,” that “everything leads us
                  to believe that early human beings were brought together by disgust and common terror.”
                  “The social nucleus is, in fact…untouchable and unspeakable,” Bataille declared, “[it
                  is] the object of a fundamental repulsion” (106). Cool indifference and alienation
                  might be the affective states that best diagnosed modern life, but stronger feelings
                  of disgust, antipathy and repulsion were never too far off. As Simmel puts it, repulsion
                  is “the inner side” of indifference.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The identification of repulsion with alienation posed an implicit conceptual problem
               for early social theory, one that I am arguing ought to be understood as having arisen
               out of particular historical circumstances and transformations. On the one hand, the
               conflation of the two affective states and their installation at the heart of modern
               social life would seem to exemplify Durkheim’s call for sociology to treat feeling
               as an object of scientific analysis rather than a criterion of scientific judgment.
               The wager was that affective life could be studied objectively, impersonally, without
               feeling creeping into the sociological method. Yet on the other hand, the counterintuitive
               discovery that strong, binding feelings of disgust lurk beneath the veneer of affective
               neutrality introduced a complication. For now, it began to seem as though negative
               affects such as antipathy and repugnance might in some sense be preconditions for
               the practiced restraint and distanced impassivity of the modern social scientific
               habitus itself. Were the social scientific enthusiasm for objectivity, and the call
               to root out feeling from method, modern disciplinary innovations that would illuminate
               heretofore concealed dimensions of social life? Or were they themselves part of the
               processes of emotional discipline and deformation that seemed increasingly evident
               to those social theorists who followed the entangled threads of feeling, unfeeling,
               and unwanted feeling through the modern city?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Addressing these questions requires pushing back into the nineteenth century and examining
                  the role of disgust not only in the proto-sociology of the 1840s and 1850s, but also
                  in the literary archive of the period. As has often been observed, the emergence of
                  disciplinary sociology—and urban sociology in particular—over the second half of the
                  nineteenth century depended not only on the appropriation of natural scientific and
                  statistical methods for the study of social life, but on sharpening the distinction
                  between the literary and the sociological to the point where they would eventually
                  appear as self-evidently separate and even mutually exclusive domains.

                           differentiation and disaggregation see Lepenies, Between Literature and Science and
                           Poovey, Making a Social Body. Other useful accounts of the burst of disciplinary innovation
                           around the year 1900 include Levine, Visions of the Sociological Tradition; Heilbron,

                           1857–1886.</span></div>
                  </div> However, the process of their differentiation was gradual and uneven. Throughout the
                  century, one is as likely to encounter proto-sociological texts that draw on literary
                  conventions—Henry Mayhew’s reliance on characterization and anecdote, for instance,
                  or Harriet Martineau’s direct appeals to readerly sympathy—as one is to encounter
                  novelists articulating their social scientific ambitions. Indeed, prominent late nineteenth-century
                  authors sought to frame the literary text itself as a scientific laboratory in which
                  the passions and pathologies of social life could be examined and controlled, as with
                  Émile Zola’s notion of the “experimental novel” and Thomas Hardy’s elaboration of
                  a “science of fiction.” Even though the emergence of disciplinary sociology depended
                  on progressively sharpening its distinction from literature, literary realism in this
                  very period shared a horizon of sociological ambition.</p>

               <p>Questions of feeling and, in particular, of unwanted feeling, were central to this
                  process of disciplinary entanglement and disaggregation. At the close of the century,
                  such questions revolved largely around the status of disgust as an emotion to be surmounted
                  or set aside. Indeed, one does not need to dig deep to find literary preemptions of
                  Durkheim’s call to overcome the repugnance that protects social reality from analysis.
                  An 1884 preface to the English translation of Zola’s <em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">L’Assommoir</span></em>, to name one example, argues that in order to read Zola properly “you must conquer
                  the first feeling of repugnance; then, whatever may be the final judgment pronounced
                  upon the writer, you are glad to have read his works, and you arrive at the conclusion
                  that you ought to have read them…even if it bring with it an odour not altogether
                  agreeable” (De Amicis 1). By the same token, criticism of the realist or naturalist
                  novel often took issue precisely with its failure to transcend its merely sociological
                  ambitions, which were framed as a kind of quasi-scientific prurience. Historically
                  speaking, these allegations of realism’s insensitivity to the grotesque, and of its
                  morbid obsession with the deformed, have appealed to a broad ideological spectrum
                  of literary critics. It is in this vein, for instance, that John Ruskin accuses realists,
                  including Zola and Dickens, of reducing literary art simply to a “science of fiction,
                  concerned mainly with the description of…[the] forms of disease” of industrial society
                  and of being motivated only by the “curiosity of science in morbid phenomena” (269).
                  In a very different idiom, György Lukács repeats the claim that Zola’s “descriptive
                  method” had degraded the novel form by “attempt[ing] to make literature scientific,
                  to transform it…into sociology,” thus “intensifying the decay” of modern culture under
                  bourgeois capitalism (127).

                           the inclusion of the fourth estate [i.e. the proletariat] in serious realism was decisively
                           advanced by those, who in their quest for new aesthetic impressions, discovered the

               <p>Before delving deeper into the nineteenth century and turning to Wordsworth’s 
                  “Residence in London,”
                   I want to flesh out more fully the emotional grammar of the process of disciplinary
                  knowledge formation I am describing. At the turn of the century, we have seen, novelists
                  and sociologists alike shared a sense that the production of the form of objectivity
                  specific to analysis of the social domain required the management of the observer’s
                  disgust. From this perspective, the sociological impulse appears to depend on an idea
                  of emotion as a reflexive impulse that can be restrained or “conquered”; the diagnosis
                  of modern society’s complex problems is only possible if one’s disgust is expelled,
                  kept in, or otherwise overcome.

                           on internalization in Romantic poetry and psychoanalytic thought, Feeding on Infinity:

                           here a similar (or perhaps inverted) confusion in the phenomenology of the sociological
                           conception of disgust: it is an emotion whose paradigmatic expressions can be seen

                  ambition as part of a more general cultural malady, the absence of feeling was itself
                  the pathology to be diagnosed. Yet it is important to note that this position also
                  staked its claim in a conception about the overcoming of disgust; the disagreement
                  concerned whether or not overcoming feeling was the poison or the cure. In both cases,
                  then, what is needed in order to understand the emergence of the sociological impulse
                  is a clearer sense of what it meant to conquer one’s disgust or overcome it.</p>

            <p>Turning to an earlier text such as Wordsworth’s 
               “Residence in London”
               can help to disentangle these interweaving questions of feeling and unfeeling in the
               sociological method. Indeed, the seventh book of <em>The Prelude</em> has often struck readers as a kind of proximal origin for a tradition of urban sociological
               writing that includes figures like Engels and Simmel, though it of course shares neither
               the disciplinary nor the scientific ambitions of these later accounts of modern city
               life. Raymond Williams, for one, saw 
               “Residence in London”
               as “one of the major early records of new ways of seeing the city,” describing Wordsworth’s
               account of urban alienation as “the first expression of what has since become a dominant
               experience of the city” (150). In a whole range of later poets, novelists and sociologists,
               Williams identifies and describes a “way of seeing London that has a clear continuity
               from Wordsworth,” which stems from “the sense of paradox: that in the great city itself,
               the very place and agency—or so it would seem—of collective consciousness, it is an
               absence of common feeling, an excessive subjectivity, that seems to be characteristic”
               (215). Less attuned to the historical development of this structure of feeling, Steven
               Marcus likewise finds “similar if not identical tendencies” in Engels’s, Simmel’s,
               and Wordsworth’s accounts of urban life (148). This critical consensus continues to
               characterize more recent criticism, as well. For instance, James Chandler and Kevin
               Gilmartin have persuasively detailed the affinities between 
               “Residence in London”
               and later social theoretical accounts of the modern metropolis, most notably Walter
               Benjamin’s writings on Baudelaire’s Paris and Simmel’s on Berlin; while Eugene Stelzig
               argues that “the negative presentation of the city of London in Book 7 of <em>The Prelude </em> is part of a larger and well-known literary typecasting, Romantic <em>and</em> Modern, that scripts the city as a site of extreme alienation and even a kind of
               necropolis” (184).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>More specifically, readers of <em>The Prelude</em> have long noted the precision with which Wordsworth details the aspects of the experience
                  of alienation that would come to seem characteristic in the century after his writing.
                  Foremost among these are the sense that one is surrounded by and yet cut off from
                  others—that Londoners live “even next-door neighbours (as we say) yet still / Strangers,
                  and not knowing each other’s names” (1805, 7.119–20); and the sense that all sociality
                  has been reduced to economic exchange—and that consumption and production have been
                  fundamentally confused “amid that concourse of mankind / Where Pleasure whirls about
                  incessantly, / And life and labour seem but one” (1850, 7.69–81). As in later accounts
                  of alienation, Wordsworth also describes the emotional deformation and inauthenticity
                  of city life, “where the human heart is sick” and one lives “among the wretched and
                  the falsely gay” (1805, 13.202, 7.396). The general movement is outward, from the
                  recognition of the city as a space of overwhelming sensory confusion—“the quick dance
                  / Of colours, lights, and forms; the Babel din; The endless stream of men, and moving
                  things”—to the analysis of that sensory experience as part of a broader social phenomenon
                  that transcends mere loneliness and perceptual overstimulation (1805, 7.162–4). This
                  complex account of urban alienation finds its figure most famously in the poet’s confrontation
                  with a blind beggar, whose explanatory placard seems to Wordsworth “a type / Or emblem
                  of the utmost that we know / Both of ourselves and of the universe,” and whose disfiguration
                  and isolation have long been taken by critics to represent Wordsworth’s most focused
                  mediation on the social as well as the existential conditions of an incipient modernity.

            <p>The language of disgust supplies Wordsworth with a negative moral-sensory rhetoric
               that allows him to articulate the unwantedness of his experiences of the city. For
               instance, in the passage mentioned earlier, the poet describes the funhouse mayhem
               of London’s Bartholomew Fair “as if the whole were one vast mill, / …vomiting, receiving
               on all sides, / Men, women, three-years’ children, babes in arms” (7.692–4). This
               figure of the city as a churning mill consuming and then spewing forth a stream of
               people is in keeping with Wordsworth’s numerous other epithets for London’s fallen
               world, most notably “parliament of monsters” (1805, 7.691) and, in the 1850 revision,
               “huge fermenting mass of human-kind” (1850, 7.621) and “monstrous ant-hill on the
               plain / Of a too busy world” (1850, 7.149–50). These grotesque epithets register the
               poet’s sensory revulsion as well as his moral disapprobation towards the crowded city
               and the undifferentiated “swarm of its inhabitants” (7.698). In the view of the poem,
               the metropolis is overeating and vomiting; it is yeasted, at once outgrowing itself
               and rotting; it is a teeming swarm of bugs. The negative affective charge of these
               epithets extends to the whole narrative of 
               “Residence in London”
               : Wordsworth gives readers a vivid image of London, but it is an image filtered through
               a condemnatory rhetoric of revulsion and sensory outrage; we see the city, but as
               an unwanted sight.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is possible to see in Wordsworth’s rhetoric of disgust a crystallization of precisely
                  the kind of emotional prejudice that sociologists later in the century would describe
                  as an impediment to the accurate knowledge of social life. The normative quality of
                  the emotion influences the description of social perception to such an extent that
                  it becomes difficult to separate the one from the other in the text. At the same time,
                  the grotesque characterization of the city comes to seem, from this angle, like something
                  projected onto the city, rather than something revealed by the poet’s insight. And
                  indeed, even in his own day—and even to those who knew him—Wordsworth’s overwhelming
                  antipathy for the city could seem inordinate and out of place. Charles Lamb, for instance,
                  observes that “the very deformities of London, which give distaste to others, do not
                  displease me. The endless succession of shops…excite in me no puritanical aversion.
                  I gladly behold every appetite supplied with its proper food. The obliging customer,
                  and the obliged tradesman…do not affect me with disgust…I love the very smoke of London.”

                  </div> Published in the <em>Morning Post</em> in 1802 but adapted from a letter he had written to Wordsworth the year before, Lamb’s

                  “Residence in London”
                   almost point by point. The column takes aim at precisely the kind of strong aversive
                  reaction to London that Wordsworth’s poem would reenact in 1805, and it does so principally
                  by attributing disgust to the unaccustomed spectator or outsider, for whom the mere
                  sight of excessive consumption is repulsive. Disgust, distaste and aversion, Lamb
                  suggests, cloud one’s perception of city life, deforming the way that social relations
                  appear. More significantly, one’s disgust offers up powerful judgments, rooted in
                  habituation, that nonetheless masquerade as neutral perceptions. “From habit I perceive
                  nothing but urbanity,” he writes, “where other men, more refined, discover meanness.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>I want to pause here to take stock of our discussion so far. In this section, I have
               outlined three components of what we might call the structure of unwanted feeling
               in Wordsworth’s poem of London. First, there is what has generally been understood
               by literary critics as Wordsworth’s anticipation of later influential accounts of
               urban alienation. Second, there is Wordsworth’s rhetorical presentation of his account
               of London through a condemnatory language of disgust, which draws on the conventions
               of the grotesque. And finally, there is Lamb’s allegation that disgust might be an
               unreliable guide to the city, insofar as it projects characterizations onto the social
               that are based solely on the habituated emotional reactions, or habitus, of the spectator.
               In what remains of this section, I want to contrast this structure of feeling with
               the genealogical problem I outlined at the opening of this essay. To recall, there
               were two contrary sides to that problem. The first was that feeling came to seem,
               by the close of the nineteenth century, like something that needed to be rooted out
               from the sociological method, whereas the second was that the strong, excessive feeling
               of disgust had come over the course of the same historical period to be identified
               with the deformation or absence of feeling constitutive of modern alienation.</p>
            <p>Contrasting the structure of feeling with the genealogical problem can help to illuminate
               several historical shifts and transformations that have otherwise remained indistinct
               in the critical consensus concerning the influence of 
               “Residence in London”
               on later city writing. For if Wordsworth’s account of alienation is understood to
               have anticipated and even structured later accounts, then what are we to make of the
               allegedly distorting quality of his disgust? Conversely, the fact of Wordsworth’s
               disgust towards the fallen world of London can hardly account for the later identification
               of repulsion with alienation. Instead, the rhetorical function of disgust in 
               “Residence of London”
               would seem to be Wordsworth’s insistence on maintaining a distance from what he disapprovingly
               sees. Whereas a century later Simmel would yoke together “feelings of strangeness
               and mutual repulsion,” in Wordsworth there is hardly even a minimal identification
               of his own feelings of moral and sensory disapproval with the sickness of the human
               heart those feelings serve to identify and diagnose. Reading Wordsworth’s poem in
               the context of later sociological accounts of city life is useful, then, not so much
               because it anticipates the latter as because it shows us how much would have to change
               over the course of the nineteenth century, even to the point of inversion, in order
               to arrive at the conceptually conflicted state of affairs out of which modern social
               theory emerged. On the one hand, the opposition between two seemingly opposed affective
               states would have to collapse, while on the other hand, the dependence of an entire
               habitus or observational mood on the evidence of strong and unwanted feelings would
               have to be overcome or disavowed.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Much of what I am describing will come into sharp focus only by staging different
                  scenes of sociological repulsion diachronically and analyzing its diverse rhetorical
                  functions throughout the long nineteenth century. As we will see in the next section
                  on Engels, my emphasis falls on change over time, rather than anticipation and continuity,
                  though it is important to stress the continuities as well. Before moving on, however,
                  I want to spend a bit more time with Wordsworth’s figure of London as a “vast mill”
                  devouring and then vomiting out its inhabitants, and to suggest that this ambiguous
                  figure does in fact illuminate something about the eventual conflation of repulsion
                  with estrangement within sociological discourse. To recall, Wordsworth’s image is
                  fundamentally one of confusion. After enumerating all of Bartholomew Fair’s “freaks
                  of nature… / All jumbled up together to make up / This parliament of monsters,” the
                  figure of the mill “vomiting, receiving, on all sides” suggests an inability to distinguish
                  between comers and goers to the freak show, between lurid spectacle and grotesque
                  spectator (1805, 7.688–91). This “blank confusion,” Wordsworth goes on, exemplifies
                  “what the mighty city is itself”: a place in which distinctions between consumption,
                  production, and excretion have been effaced, just as earlier in the poem a panorama
                  painter is described as “with his greedy pencil taking in / A whole horizon on all
                  sides,” as though the very implements of creativity and production were themselves
                  the means of consumption.

                  into excreting, using into destroying, and pleasure into repulsion—it is a place where
                  opposing processes have become identical, and even the seemingly unbridgeable gulf
                  between the organic (vomiting) and the industrial (mill) no longer seems so absolute.</p>

               <p>Another principal confusion embedded in Wordsworth’s figure is between the expression
                  and the object of disgust, or between disgust and the disgusting. Indeed, it is one
                  of the singular features of the emotion of disgust that vomiting—its paradigmatic
                  form of expression—is often deemed in its own right to be an object of disgust. This
                  is in part because of the emotion’s association with the lowly parts of the body,
                  with the belly and its wastes, which perhaps stems from the primary confusion of boundaries
                  and of organic functions that is inherent to the physiological experience of the emotion;
                  few other emotions, after all, can throw the basic directionality of the digestive
                  system fully into reverse.

                  </div> In this vein, Denise Gigante observes of the figure of the vomiting mill that “Wordsworth
                  seems to have learned . . . that a powerful way to demonize someone is to portray
                  him or her not in the act of logocentric expression but in a parodic version of unsignifying
                  emission” (97). Yet beyond this denigrative function, I believe we can see in Wordsworth’s
                  figure the rudimentary elements of the sociological association of repulsion with
                  alienation, of excess feeling with pathological unfeeling. The confusion here requires
                  a more complex understanding of the projection of disgust than that which Lamb described.
                  Now it is not simply that the poet’s unwanted feelings color his way of seeing social
                  phenomena, but that this reflux of unwanted emotion itself is poured out into “the
                  vast receptacle” of London, coming to serve as a derogatory emblem of the city conceived
                  as a whole. And even this does not quite fully capture the slippery, recursive character
                  of this dynamic, in which what is projected is in its own right an image of projection
                  or misplaced expulsion, as the metropolis extrudes itself.

                           a personification, and a more sustained analysis of this specific rhetorical structure
                           would lead us down two distinct but mutually-reinforcing paths. First, historically
                           speaking, after Wordsworth, variations of this grotesque figure of the city as a vomiting
                           body would reemerge in certain strains of nineteenth-century social theory that stressed
                           precisely the organic character of the so-called “social organism.” Marx, for instance,
                           compares the processes of capital (production, circulation, etc.) to the “change…</span></div>
                  </div> In this early nineteenth-century image, then, we see an association just barely forged
                  between disgust and alienation, as well as a repudiation of feeling that is also in
                  some manner an excess feeling.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We can understand these shifts in the relationship between feeling and unfeeling over
                  the course of the whole nineteenth century more precisely if we now turn to the analysis
                  of city life at midcentury. Indeed, the five decades between Wordsworth’s first stabs
                  at <em>The Prelude</em> and its publication in 1850 saw major upheavals in the writing and practice of social
                  observation and analysis. In the first place, the bug-eyed sensory outrage of the
                  figure in the city, which had been a source of innovation in Wordsworth’s poem, had
                  by midcentury become a generalized feature of social investigation literature. Even
                  in the most systematic and theoretically sophisticated proto-sociological texts of
                  the mid-nineteenth century, disgust now appeared as the characteristic affective response
                  of the bourgeois social investigator to unwanted social realities of the city. Moreover,
                  what had been a relatively undefined aesthetic field of moral and sensory revulsion
                  in Wordsworth now appeared unequivocally under the aegis of disgust. From Edwin Chadwick’s
                  sanitary report to Friedrich Engels’s survey of Britain’s industrial towns, the explicit
                  appeal to disgust at midcentury had developed into a dependable rhetorical technique.
                  Most significantly, the appeal to disgust carried with it an implicit yet powerful
                  expectation that collectively shared sense experience could serve as a basis for social
                  agreement. In public discourse across a variety of genres and media, the appeal to
                  disgust served to galvanize a public around a social or even civilizational wrong.
                  In this regard the revolted spectator resembled what Lauren Berlant describes as “the
                  subject of true feeling”: a wounded subject whose affective experiences lay claim
                  to a “hard-wired truth, a core of common sense [that places it] beyond ideology, beyond
                  mediation, beyond contestation” (<em>True Feeling</em> 47).

               <p>In contrast, midcentury also saw decisive developments in the social sciences that
                  tugged the still-coalescing sociological method away from its rhetorical dependency
                  on the “true feeling” of disgust, and indeed away from the articulation of feeling
                  in general. The most salient among these changes were advances in statistical analysis
                  by Adolphe Quetelet in France, and Robert Jones, Charles Babbage, and T.R. Malthus
                  and others in the Statistical Society of London; this burgeoning field was itself
                  developing out of an increasing awareness that the subjectivity of individual perspectives
                  rendered them incapable of accounting for changes in the social whole.

                  critiques of political economy that emerged in the 1840s, most notably in Marx’s and
                  Engels’s writings. Marxist social theorists often note a decades-long shift in Marx
                  and Engel’s thought away from their early humanistic focus on the worker’s alienation
                  and deformed subjectivity in the 1840s towards the objective analysis of his or her
                  exploitation and the extraction of surplus value in <em>Capital</em> (1867). However, even in Marx’s early writings on alienation, one sees for the first
                  time the analysis of feeling [<em><span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">fühlen</span></em>] as a mutable social phenomenon subject to historical variation as well as change
                  under political and economic pressure. This transformation of emotion and subjectivity
                  into an object of analysis was, to recall Durkheim’s observation, representative of
                  the overall development of the social sciences throughout the nineteenth century.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Engels’s 1845 social survey of Britain’s industrial towns epitomizes this double movement
               in sociology, at once towards and away from the appeal to feeling as an epistemological
               basis for knowledge of the social. “The very turmoil of the streets has something
               repulsive [<em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">etwas Widerliches</span></em>],” he writes in <em>The Condition of the Working Class in England</em>, “something against which human nature rebels” (36–7). What follows this articulation
               of disgust is one of the century’s most influential descriptions of urban alienation,
               culminating in Engels’s indictment of “the social war, the war of each against all,”
               and of capital, “the weapon with which this social warfare is carried on”:<span class="quote">‘The very turmoil of the streets has something repulsive, something against which
                  human nature rebels. The hundreds of thousands of all classes and ranks crowding past
                  each other, are they not all human beings with the same qualities and powers, and
                  with the same interest in being happy? And have they not, in the end, to seek happiness
                  in the same way, by the same means? And still they crowd by one another as though
                  they had nothing in common, nothing to do with one another, and their only agreement
                  is the tacit one, that each keep to his own side of the pavement . . . while it occurs
                  to no man to honour another with so much as a glance. The brutal indifference, the
                  unfeeling isolation of each in his private interest becomes the more repellent and
                  offensive, the more these individuals are crowded together, within a limited space.
                  And, however much one may be aware that this isolation of the individual, this narrow
                  self-seeking is this fundamental principle of our society everywhere, it is nowhere
                  so shamelessly barefaced, so self-conscious as just here in the crowding of the great
                  city. The dissolution of man into monads, of which each one has a separate principle
                  and a separate purpose, the world of atoms, is here carried out to its utmost extreme.’</span> Much has been written about the vision of London and of capitalism that Engels offers
               in this passage, but I wish specifically to characterize the disgust that Engels articulates
               towards the alienation of the crowded streets of the city. Disgust, according to Engels,
               is the rebellion of human nature against the inhumanity of this historical state of
               “crude solitariness” that masks the violence of social warfare. The emotion rejects
               the inhuman social organization under capitalist political economy, the “discord of
               identical interests” that permits people to “regard each other only as useful objects,”
               by opposing it to a collective morality grounded in a shared human nature. What stands
               out foremost in this passage is the implicit expectation of disgust’s unique persuasiveness
               as a mode of response. Held up as the token of an underlying “human nature” in revolt
               against industrial capitalism, the emotion lays claim to a quasi-instinctual authenticity
               and force. Who could argue, Engels seems to ask, with the commonsense of disgust?
               The invocation of repulsion is in this sense meant to place Engels’s analysis beyond
               contestation in precisely the way Berlant attributes to the appeal to “true feeling.”
               Moreover, Engels means for his repulsion to evidence the ideological character of
               social life in the capitalist metropolis. Disgust is how we come to know that there
               is something wrong, something lurking behind the indifference of the metropolis. It
               is through the rhetorical presentation of his repulsion that Engels lays bare the
               emotional fragmentation that follows from the saturation of social relations by capital.
               We are in this sense far off from Durkheim’s notion of a repugnance that precludes
               social analysis. To the contrary, disgust here appears to play a necessary role in
               revealing society’s true nature.</p>
            <p>Engels’s account of the “offensive and repellant” nature of economic alienation establishes
               an antithesis between the two affective states. On the one hand there is “brutally
               indifferent” life in the metropolis—emotionless, artificial, monadic, and gray; on
               the other hand, there is the disgust of the bourgeois observer—unwanted but alive,
               human nature itself in revolt. Whereas life in the alienated city shuttles between
               the neutral and the negative, Engels here tacitly refers us to a full-throated wholeness
               or human essence that has not been drained of its vitality. However, I want to stress
               the new proximity that Engels establishes here between disgust and alienation, rather
               than their overt and conventional opposition. What is unique to Engels’s formulation
               is the implicit analogical relationship he establishes between his own repulsion and
               the alienation it diagnoses. Disgust is not only the proper, the natural, and the
               automatic response to the ravages of industrial capitalism, but it is also in a sense
               a reflection, however distorted, of the affective state of alienated life under this
               new mode of social organization.</p>
            <p>If we fast forward fifty years to Simmel’s analysis of metropolitan repulsion, or
               a full century to Sartre’s existentialist nausea, we see that this analogy progressively
               takes on the status of a commonplace. Alienation, <em>anomie</em>, <em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="it" lang="it">la noia</span></em>, <em>angst</em>, gradually become entangled, if not fully interchangeable, with <em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la nausée</span></em>, the <em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">taedium vitae</span></em>, attraction-repulsion, primary repression, and other states of low-grade negativity
               that explicitly take disgust as their basis. This is not so in Engels, for whom the
               diagnosis of alienation depends on disgust without yet being fully identified with
               it. But repulsion is now specifically named as the unwanted affective response through
               which the alienation of the individual under the modern social system becomes recognizable;
               the points of contact between the two states are already becoming clear. I am suggesting
               that, historically speaking, part of the work Engels accomplishes in this passage
               is to establish a discursive link between his own excessive feeling and the pathological
               unfeeling he diagnoses. If social theory wound up conceptualizing repulsion as a fundamental
               truth of human relationships, it was precisely because disgust had already been so
               closely associated with the analysis of social life. Indeed, the sociologist’s disgust
               already claimed an affective and epistemological authority over the experience of
               the observed, such that Engels’s repulsion comes to seem like the missing truth of
               Londoners’ alienation, a complement to their emotional deformation. The disgust of
               the bourgeois observer was the frame within which the experience of the observed could
               appear.</p>
            <p>In order to satisfy the increasingly scientific aspirations of disciplinary sociology,
               this disgust had to migrate from the observer to the observed, from the method of
               inquiry to the object of study, without abandoning the posture of observational authority.
               From one angle, this process clearly resembles the rooting out of feeling from method
               that the fin de siècle sociologists called for: affect’s shift from criterion of truth
               to scholarly object. Social science cannot depend on the feelings of the observer—this
               much was already apparent to Engels, though he had not fully processed it. One can
               feel the method of analysis pulling Engels in two opposing directions, at once towards
               the burning evidence of unwanted feeling, and the cold truths of inhumane political
               economic structures, which themselves find a strange reflection in the demand for
               an anaesthetized social science.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But I also want to insist that there is something surreptitious about this transfer
                  of affect, according to which the characteristic moral-visceral outrage of the bourgeois
                  sociologist comes to be generalized as the innermost nature of the social itself.
                  When Simmel writes that without “feelings of mutual strangeness and repulsion…we could
                  not imagine what form modern urban life…might possibly take,” it would not be mistaken
                  to say that he attributes what had been Engels’s vexed identification with the sight
                  of industrial alienation to his own generalized definition of modern social relationships
                  in the metropolis. From this perspective, feeling is not so much extracted from sociology
                  as it is buried within it or projected onto the social domain—more concretely and
                  directly here than in Wordsworth’s figure of the vomiting mill. Only a decade after
                  Engels’s stated opposition between disgust and alienation, for example, Marx would
                  turn to the language of repulsion [<em><span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Abstoßung</span></em>] in order to theorize the social antagonism that binds people to their class.

                  as a core tenet of sociological and social theoretical discourse, as disgust <em>towards</em> alienation was slowly reconstituted as disgust <em>as</em> alienation.</p>
            </div>
            <p>“[T]here is no science,” Durkheim writes, in the passage with which I opened this
               essay: "Which at its beginnings has not encountered similar resistances. There was
               a time when those feelings relating to the things of the physical world, since they
               also possessed a religious or moral character, opposed no less violently the establishment
               of the physical sciences. Thus, one can believe that, rooted out from one science
               after another, this prejudice will finally disappear from sociology as well, its last
               refuge, and leave the field clear for the scientist" (<em>Rules</em> 40). Contra Durkheim, I have been arguing that the role disgust played in this process
               of rooting out emotional bias and superstition from the social scientific method cannot
               be explained straightforwardly in the terms of a progressive narrative—although it
               may at first blush seem to do just that. As our examination of Wordsworth and Engels
               has suggested, the genealogy of sociological attraction-repulsion can be made to hew
               closely to Durkheim’s proposed trajectory, according to which an emotion that had
               been erroneously taken as a “criterion of scientific truth” by the innovative but
               prescientific fumblers of the mid-nineteenth century was gradually transformed into
               an “object for scientific study” that could be shown to “have been shaped through
               history” at the century’s close.</p>
            <p>But as I hope to have shown, this story of the hard-won isolation of social fact from
               subjective value raises more questions than it settles. Perhaps most crucially, we
               have seen precisely how difficult it is to disentangle fact from value within the
               structures of unwanted feeling that gave rise to modern sociology. To the contrary,
               the rhetoric of disgust would seem to suggest instead that certain features of social
               life can only become legible in the first place through the filter of the repulsion
               they inspire—that is, can only become legible as unwanted facts. And in this regard,
               the problem of disgust begins to look like a condensation of the basic problem of
               determining the composition of social scientific knowledge, as it related to what
               Weber referred to as the “hair-thin line” separating objective fact and subjective
               value. Weber thought it was the proximity of fact and value in the sociological domain
               that gave the field its unique character because he believed that all social phenomena
               depended on the prior positing of an underlying value that allowed them to become
               sensible and recognizable as phenomena in the first place. “The <em>objective</em> validity of all empirical knowledge,” he writes, “rests, and rests exclusively, upon
               the fact that the given reality is ordered according to categories that are in a specific
               sense <em>subjective</em>, in that they form the <em>precondition</em> of our knowledge, and that are based upon the presupposition of the <em>value</em> of that truth which empirical knowledge alone is able to give us” (<em>Objectivity</em> 137). The task that Weber sees falling to the social sciences is to explore these
               meeting points where the acts of valuation, which are the precondition for knowledge
               of the social world, allow for the production of knowledge itself.</p>
            <p>What I have been arguing throughout this essay is that the function of disgust in
               the gradual and uneven distinction of the sociological from the literary domain represents
               precisely one of these hinges between value and fact, but one which in certain contexts
               has also been invested in the surreptitious disavowal of its own rootedness in subjective
               feeling. For with the unwanted fact of repulsion, the fact is constituted by the very
               strength of its empirical, sensory appeal; the fact that it is unwanted houses the
               fact that it is real. While from a certain perspective, disgust’s disturbance of the
               Enlightenment distinction between fact and value might be dismissed as irredeemably
               irrational, I suggest instead that precisely this disruptive power had an intensely
               generative effect on the entangled trajectories of literature and social science over
               the course of the nineteenth century. A literary history of disgust in the period
               (which would include but exceed the literary history of the city) that started out
               from Wordsworth’s vomiting mill would, however, look very different from the outline
               of the emergence of sociology and its disavowal of feeling that I have traced in this
               essay. Even the most insistently realist of literary texts depends on an implicit
               avowal of something like Weber’s point that the reality or truth of its world derives
               from the affective value with which it has been invested. Disgust held out to a great
               variety of nineteenth-century novelists and poets, as well as literary and aesthetic
               theorists, the promise of a medium for exploring the instability of the relationship
               between unwanted fact and negative value: a recurrent motif for Baudelaire, a plot
               device for Gissing—Walter Pater went so far as to assert that “the way to perfection
               lies through a series of disgusts” (103). For sociology, by contrast, disgust served
               as the uncredited source of a series of fundamental concepts and premises. Foremost
               among them was the very idea of the social life of the modern city itself: the rotten
               and fermenting city, the distended mill vomiting out its Malthusian hordes of alienated
               citizens. The need to be rid of the unwanted fact of the social was not merely a starting
               point for social analysis, but the affective logic according to which the basic objects
               of sociological discourse were initially rendered legible and distinct as objects
               rather than as experiences—the affective logic that, over the long term, gave rise
               to the birth of social theory from the spirit of disgust.</p>

               debasement of literature. “It is surprising but undeniable,” Auerbach writes, “that
               the inclusion of the fourth estate [i.e. the proletariat] in serious realism was decisively
               advanced by those, who in their quest for new aesthetic impressions, discovered the

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Here and throughout my thinking is informed by and indebted to Joshua Wilner’s work
               on internalization in Romantic poetry and psychoanalytic thought, <em>Feeding on Infinity: Readings in the Romantic Rhetoric of Internalization</em>. Wilner observes that, in both of these paradigms, to internalize can mean either
               to bring something into the self from without or to keep something internal that seeks
               to get out. I am suggesting here a similar (or perhaps inverted) confusion in the
               phenomenology of the sociological conception of disgust: it is an emotion whose paradigmatic
               expressions can be seen either as an expulsive form of externalization (vomiting)
               or a corking up of the self (holding one’s nose). The conceptualization of disgust
               might therefore be said to alternate between a characterization of the emotion as
               opening the body up and a characterization of it as a form of enacted closure. The
               question of what it means to overcome or conquer one’s disgust looks different, I
               would argue, depending on which characterization one has in mind.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">It is important to note as well that Wordsworth’s strange, concatenated figure is
               a personification, and a more sustained analysis of this specific rhetorical structure
               would lead us down two distinct but mutually-reinforcing paths. First, historically
               speaking, after Wordsworth, variations of this grotesque figure of the city as a vomiting
               body would reemerge in certain strains of nineteenth-century social theory that stressed
               precisely the organic character of the so-called “social organism.” Marx, for instance,
               compares the processes of capital (production, circulation, etc.) to the “change of
               form and matter…in the organic body,” going on to detail the different rates of change
               at which a body sheds or repulses [the German word is once again <span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Abstoßen</span>] and replenishes its “flesh, blood” and even its “skeleton.” See: Marx, <span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign"><em>Grundrisse</em></span>, 661. Second, there is also an important psychological and psychoanalytic tradition
               of theorizing disgust as an uncannily “animistic” emotion. “The meaning of the disgusting
               object often includes some animistic notions,” an influential study of the 1940s observes,
               “It is not regarded as belonging to the class of inorganic matter but as something
               related to life, as something ‘almost living’ which has the tendency or is endowed
               with the capacity to sneak up on, and to penetrate, the body in some unnatural way.”
               See: Angyal, 
               “Disgust and Related Aversions,”
               397. Were there time to do so, this animistic psychological theory of disgust could
               be traced back to the British and German aesthetic theory of the second half of the
               eighteenth century and hence brought into even closer contact with Wordsworth’s rhetoric
               of grotesque personification. See, for instance, Menninghaus, <em>Disgust</em>, 25–101.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of inherited, ideological, moral, socioeconomic, intellectual and personal factors,”
               including” a heritage from the Enlightenment….a realization that great social changes
               were taking place that no one understood as a whole…a conclusion that social reform
               was needed but could not be justified without evidence…a desire to refute Ricardo
               and a general dissatisfaction with the deductive school of social theorists” (<em>Science in Culture</em>, (240–4). Goldman quotes Cannon and expands on her discussion in 
               “The Origins of British ‘Social Science.’”

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">The language recurs throughout Marx’s discussion of antagonism in the <em><span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Grundrisse</span></em>. See for instance: Marx, <em><span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Grundrisse</span></em>, 453. As Gareth Stedman Jones has observed, Marx’s dissertation had in fact delved
               deeply into the topic of physical repulsion—at the level of the atom—in the philosophical
               theories of Democritus and Epicurus. Unlike Epicurus, Marx accused Democritus of having
               seen “in repulsion only the material side, the fragmentation, the change, and not
               the ideal side, according to which all relation to something else is negated and motion
               is established as self-determination.” Quoted in Stedman Jones,<em>Karl Marx: Greatness and Illusion</em>, 81.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
