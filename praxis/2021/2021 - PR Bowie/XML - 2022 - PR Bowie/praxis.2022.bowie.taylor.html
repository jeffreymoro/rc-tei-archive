            <p class="noCount">This essay seeks to demonstrate how David Bowie’s (New) Romantic project engaged with
               spatial understandings that were first embedded in poetic practices in early-nineteenth-century
               Britain. Building on Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s—fundamentally spatial—concept of the
               “I AM,” this essay suggests that spatial readings of Bowie’s “Major Tom” series can
               help us to echolocate innovative forms of (New) Romantic identities. More than this,
               it argues that reading Bowie’s tracks in light of Romantic concepts might assist in
               our ongoing project to engage with and respond to earlier works in ways that productively
               bring modern technological and spatial experiences to bear on historical literatures.</p>

            </header><br/><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <p>In his sonnet “The Poet,” published in the <em>North of England Magazine</em> in February 1842, Hartley Coleridge mused that the poet “smit with love of fame”
                  must accept their own vanishing. In a sense, Hartley pushed a Keatsian negative capability
                  to its logical conclusion: the poet’s inevitable fate is to become, like Ovid’s Echo,
                  “a nothing, save a voice, a name, / Which lives, when other voices give it birth”
                  (91). Indeed, according to Hartley it is only in this extreme form of containment—a
                  synecdochal reduction from body to voice—that the poet can hope for expansive influence.
                  The poet’s very identity is expressed in the echo between the poetic self and the
                  wider world, and particularly between the poet’s work and repetitions of it.</p>
               <p>How this same relationship between space, echo, and identity operates in David Bowie’s
                  corpus—and how it can be better understood when read through and as Romanticism—is
                  what I want to explore in this essay. When Bowie reflected on his creative relationship
                  with Tony Visconti—the producer with whom he worked intermittently from his second
                  album in 1969 until his last in 2016—he concluded that what made their collaboration
                  so effective was that they knew “between [them], how to landscape a song and give
                  it a real place, an identity and a character” (qtd. in Pareles). This landscaping
                  generated lyric and sonic spaces that encourage a “collapse” of the boundaries between
                  artist and listener, track and text, song world and real world (Cinque, Moore, and
                  Redmond 4). Bowie’s works, in short, deployed odd relationships to and in space as
                  complex metaphors through which to explore the connection between the self and the
                  wider world.</p>
               <p>To investigate how Bowie deploys spatiality to explore a form of (New) Romantic selfhood,
                  I focus on one of his most iconic, and most Romantic, characters: Major Tom, the enigmatic
                  spaceman who appears both in Bowie’s early music of the late sixties and—paratextually
                  at least—on his last album. By tracing Major Tom’s evolution throughout Bowie’s corpus—from
                  “Space Oddity,” through “Ashes to Ashes” and “Hallo Spaceboy,” to “Blackstar”—I demonstrate
                  how his metamorphosis is registered most strongly in (New) Romantic spatial oddities.
                  In tracing these synergies, my aim is to demonstrate how Bowie’s (New) Romanticism
                  engaged with spatial understandings that became embedded in poetic practice in early
                  nineteenth-century Britain.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>More than this, though, I want to indicate the ways in which (re-)reading Bowie in
                     light of Romanticism also asks us to re-assess some of our thinking about the Romantics,
                     wherein ‘New Romanticism’ is not simply a descendent of Romanticism proper, but offers
                     something of its own back. That is to say, considering Bowie’s material as a descendent
                     of Romantic poetry asks us to reconsider how we respond to those earlier texts and
                     highlights these earlier works as the products of a similarly rich perceptual field
                     to that which inspired Bowie. Bowie’s corpus emphasizes a kind of multi-sensory perception
                     that, as Barish Ali and Heidi Wallace astutely note, disrupts “the boundaries between
                     author, text, audience and culture” (263). The unsettling of these boundaries is a
                     distinctively Romantic concern, and returning to Romanticism via Bowie highlights
                     the importance of paying attention to embodied creativity. In particular, Bowie emphasises
                     sound’s role in negotiating the relationship between the self and the world in ways
                     that have often remained underappreciated in Romantic-era works—although this neglect
                     has begun to be rectified in recent years.

                              adeptly explored how sound functions as a literary device from the late Romantics
                              onward, but the importance of sound as a Romantic historical and literary phenomenon
                              has been considered recently by scholars including Matthew Rowney, Michele Speitz
                              and Susan Wolfson (see Works Cited for the relevant publications). I have also written
                              on this topic elsewhere (see “Echoes in the Mountains: The Romantic Lake District’s
                              Soundscape”).</span></div>
                     </div> To align these issues, I want to suggest that Bowie drew on the imaginative possibilities
                     of notions about contained expansion that emerged in—and, I think, were fundamental
                     for understandings of—Romantic literature. The imaginative possibilities of contained
                     space found their most powerful expression in the use of the echo as trope and metaphor
                     for the (New) Romantic creative self.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The most strident definition of selfhood in the Romantic period depends precisely
                     on the interplay between containment and expansion that Hartley Coleridge and David
                     Bowie identify as being core to expressions of individual identity. Samuel Taylor
                     Coleridge’s concept of the Imagination depended upon motion within a contained space.
                     At its most successful, the Imagination could queer the boundaries between subject
                     and object. The wealth of scholarly interpretations of Coleridge’s theories of the
                     Imagination and the “I Am” notwithstanding, little attention has been paid to the
                     fact that Coleridge conceived of the Imagination as an essentially spatial construct.

                              up to the mid-1980s.</span></div>
                     </div> Imagination was a mode that facilitated a self-discovery based upon what Helen Vendler
                     terms “lyric intimacy”; it depended for its origins on circumscribed boundaries, and
                     it was the transgressing of those borders which revealed self-knowledge. The primary
                     Imagination was a form of motion that operated through the movement of the “finite
                     mind” within the “infinite I AM” (<em>Biographia</em> I:304), by which Coleridge meant “spirit, self, and self-consciousness” (<em>Biographia</em> I:273). The primary Imagination depended, in other words, upon an interplay between
                     containment in the finite and expansion into the infinite.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The secondary Imagination, meanwhile, was the “echo” of the primary: it “dissolves,
                  diffuses, dissipates in order to recreate” (<em>Biographia</em> I: 304). Jonathan Wordsworth thinks that this phrasing is proof that the secondary
                  Imagination was less important for Coleridge than the primary; he finds that the word
                  “echo” suggests a “diminishment” (75). Yet, in this instance, the echo’s diffusion
                  does not necessarily render the effect weaker; in fact, Coleridge thought that this
                  diffusion caused an erasure of the boundary between the self and God, allowing them
                  to blend together. At its most successful—the generation of “the absolute I AM”—the
                  Imagination could lead to a discovery of the divine in the self, and the self in the
                  divine. And the echo—the “<em>act of writing itself</em>,” as Wordsworth interprets it (83)—linked this divine self to the rest of Creation;
                  Coleridge concluded his “Literary Life” with the thought that the “filial WORD” of
                  “the great I AM” created a “choral echo [which] is the universe” (<em>Biographia</em> II: 247–8). Here, it is not just the poet’s voice that lives through other voices;
                  God himself depends for his influence on the echoes created by individual voices and
                  texts. As Denis Flannery suggests is the case for Bowie’s sounds, the Coleridgean
                  Imagination is a force that can “queer” the limits of the self, leading to new understandings
                  of the individual’s sense of identity and relationship to the cosmos.</p>
               <p>Bowie’s version of the “I Am” is inherited from Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who Coleridge
                  anticipated in believing that the “I Am” cannot be demarcated. Instead, it “moves
                  outwards” to provide personal, phenomenological definition to the physical, moral,
                  and historical worlds (Merleau-Ponty ix). It has seemed to a number of Bowie scholars
                  that this move outwards is indicative of a form of liminality that translates into
                  a loss of selfhood. Ian Chapman finds that liminality indicates Bowie’s perpetual
                  fear about a such a loss (2015), whilst Nicholas Greco conceives of Bowie’s liminal
                  space as a kind of labyrinth: Bowie “enters into it and is lost,” he thinks (164).
                  But what Greco and Chapman interpret as liminality is, in Bowie’s own terms, a “third
                  dimension” (Yentob 1975). It is a queer landscape, located between the borders of
                  established spaces, which translates a loss of selfhood into something more like an
                  excess of it. Yet—as I want to demonstrate in the remainder of this essay—Bowie recalls
                  Coleridge in foregrounding the role of the echo in the discovery of the “I Am.” In
                  Bowie’s works, the echo is the principal means of communicating this new idea of the
                  “I Am”; it opens out new possibilities for the individual to diffuse and diffract
                  into what Shelton Waldrep calls “performances of self.”</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Echolocation and (New) Romanticism</span></h2>
               <p>When Drew Daniel writes that sound—“<em>not music</em>,” he clarifies, “<em>but sound</em>”—is uniquely able to queer the boundaries between individual, community, and environment,
                  he posits a theory of listening that is fundamentally indebted to the kind of Romantic
                  imaginary I have been outlining. By its very nature, Daniel argues, sound operates
                  through a disruption of the boundaries between inside and outside. Sound can reinforce
                  our sense of individuality through its creation of a personal sonic experience, but
                  what Daniel calls the “promiscuous open-ness of the ear” means that “[s]ound intrudes
                  upon us with the fact of the world.” Listening itself, in this reading, becomes a
                  form of contained expansion, whereby intrusion “affords us the possibility of forgetting
                  . . . attachments to our subjective particularity and affiliation and instead forces
                  us to register the everywhere of an ongoing being, an outside where we thought there
                  was no outside.” Sound, meanwhile, becomes a unique way of communicating both the
                  tensions and affinities between the individual and a “perceptual community” that links
                  us to “the world beyond that community.” In short, Daniel concludes, sound “blurs
                  the edges” of the self.</p>
               <p>Daniel believes this process to be specific to sound, rather than music—or, at least,
                  recorded music—because the kind of queerness he describes relies upon the true experience
                  of what he calls an “immanent occasion”; since recording fixes a certain sound in
                  place, it removes the possibility for sonic spontaneity that Daniel sees as central
                  to sound’s inherent queerness. But what not even recording music can do is to fix
                  the affect it produces in the listener—and, in Romantic thinking, it was affect that
                  distinguished music from sound. John Ruskin, for instance, drew on the philosophies
                  of Plato and Hesiod when he clarified in <em>Fors Clavigera</em> (1875) that “the Greeks only called ‘Music’ the kind of sound which induced right
                  moral feeling . . . and any other kind of sound than that, however beautiful to the
                  ear or scientific in composition, they did not call ‘Music’” (261). The recognition
                  of such feelings relied on a listener trained in the art of translating a sonic “impulse
                  on the organ” into an “observation of the mind.” The physical quality of sound, and
                  the ability to hear it, was only part of the point, as Ruskin explained in “The Queen
                  of the Air” (1869): <span class="quote">‘It is quite true that the tympanum of the ear vibrates under sound, and that the
                     surface of the water in a ditch vibrates too: but the ditch hears nothing for all
                     that; and my hearing is still to me as blessed a mystery as ever, and the interval
                     between the ditch and me, quite as great. If the trembling sound in my ears was once
                     of the marriage bell which began my happiness, and is now of the passing bell which
                     ends it, the difference between those two sounds to me cannot be counted by the number
                     of concussions. (354)’</span> Ruskin acknowledges something that Daniel risks overlooking: that both sound and
                  music can mean something different at every encounter, a reflection of the influence
                  that social codes and personal circumstances have on the act of listening. Ruskin
                  acknowledges the role of feeling in listening: he concludes that music is a combination
                  of the soundwave with the listener’s affective response to it. In this sense, music
                  becomes sound properly interpreted. It is this kind of slippage between sound and
                  music with which Bowie’s corpus plays; in seeking to affect his listener’s space as
                  much as to communicate a track-specific sonic world, Bowie floats in a most peculiar
                  way between, as Denis Flannery observes, “recognition and anonymity, the cohering
                  force of music and the dissolving, queering effect of sound” (159). Bowie’s material
                  mediates between coherence and dissolution, and between sound and music, in part through
                  the careful ways in which it was landscaped to communicate a sense of spatiality through
                  both his lyrics and the record’s sonic formation of space. Bowie’s aim was not to
                  induce a Ruskinian “right moral feeling”; rather, these tracks created a contained
                  space in which feeling—as a changeable, mutable experience—could be explored as the
                  centre-point of a form of individualism which acknowledged that individuality need
                  not be fixed.</p>
               <p>This is, perhaps, particularly true of “Space Oddity,” which self-consciously marks
                  out a form of soundbox, a musicological concept that visualises music as a four-dimensional
                  model and attempts, as Ruth Dockwray and Allan F. Moore explain, to map the “locations
                  of sound sources in recordings” (182). It offers a way of “conceptualizing the textural
                  space that a recording inhabits, by enabling us to literally hear recordings taking
                  space” (Moore 30) and creates a visualization that allows the analyst to ask where
                  particular sounds appear to be coming from (Figure 1). The soundbox is envisaged as
                  a contained space, but there are two key ways of enlarging it: reverberation and echo
                  (Moore 46). Peter Doyle has written extensively about the generic differences between
                  these two effects but, to summarise drastically, he defines reverberation as something
                  that seems to continue a sound, whilst an echo repeats it. John Hollander offers a
                  nuance to this definition in his study of figurative echoes in poetry after Milton,
                  when he notes that the distinction is partly temporal: echoes reach the ear approximately
                  one-fifteenth of a second after reverberations thanks to the fact that an echo must
                  travel to and from a reflective surface (1). Before sound recording technologies were
                  developed in the mid-nineteenth century, echoes—“and,” Hollander writes, “perhaps
                  parrots”—were the only real means of perpetuating sound (1–2).</p>

               <p>Doyle thinks that the echo is especially tricky to interpret, because it leads us
                  “further into the area of connotation.” In “teasing . . . meanings out,” he thinks,
                  “we run the risk of overinterpreting, or of misreading” (14). In this reading, the
                  echo might be a key part of a song’s transition into a text. By the 1960s, echoes—and
                  their counterpart, reverberation—were a standard element of pop music. Doyle shows
                  how music from this period—building on the rockabilly, rock n roll, and jazz traditions
                  of the 1940s and 50s (under the influence of which Bowie grew up)—took advantage of
                  stereo recording, and the possibilities for echo and reverb it afforded, to make spatiality
                  “a new component in the musical totality” (5). The studio space in which these effects
                  were created was particularly suggestive (Doyle 6); it is, perhaps, the ultimate symbol
                  from this era of the creative possibilities afforded by enclosure. Phil Spector’s
                  “Wall of Sound”—a mode of production that foregrounded the interplay between an exaggerated
                  musical texture and the close confinement of the studio—is perhaps the best-known
                  use of this new space (Moorefield 11–2). For Doyle, as for Oliver Read and Walter
                  Welch, this new sense of sonic spatiality was fundamentally Romantic; it was, they
                  think, Romanticism which brought “the listener into the studio or auditorium” (377).
                  The echo became an important element in communicating a Romantic “world-creating demiurge”
                  (Doyle 58). As a phenomenon entirely dependent on containment, the echo was particularly
                  suggestive of a “sublime dreamed world” conjured by the artist (Doyle 5).</p>
               <p>The echo is a record—or a “memory,” as Sean Street terms it—of sound’s interactions
                  with the environment (3). Formed by soundwaves’ reflections from a surface, an echo
                  depends for its formation on a degree of containment, but its repetitions of a sound
                  event make it a vehicle for a sense—both physical and imaginative—of vastness. The
                  echo exaggerates what George Revill identifies as the core properties of heard sounds
                  by giving “embodied sensation to properties of depth, distance and proximity” (247).
                  Echoes or reverberations—and the related concept of resonance—each emphasise an ecological
                  relationship between sound and listener, but the echo’s relationship to space makes
                  it distinctive. As Hollander explains,</p>
               <p>[i]n modern discourse, the word <em>echo</em> is used figuratively to indicate a musical or linguistic repetition, usually of a
                  short utterance or the terminal portion of a longer one, with the additional qualification
                  that the repeated sound is not only contingent upon the first, but in some way a qualified
                  version of it.(3)</p>
               <p>What Hollander does not explicitly acknowledge, though, is that these qualifications
                  are both figurative and physical: an echo returns a weaker version of the original
                  sound—a kind of “speaking silence,” as Christina Rossetti memorably termed it (314).
                  Each repetition of an image or idea alters the original in some way that develops
                  or complicates its meaning. An echo also changes the way sound is perceived in space,
                  transforming it from a mono-directional entity into a multi-directional experience.
                  That makes conceiving of a track’s soundbox more difficult; the artist who deploys
                  the echo deliberately complicates what Drew Daniel might call the locatability of
                  the sonic experience. By challenging a sound source’s identity in these ways, the
                  echo might also effect an ontological shift from music back to sound.</p>
               <p>Such performances of unlocatability thus emphasise what Daniel calls “the queerness
                  of sound”; since the echo is in itself based on dissolution and diffusion, it is in
                  itself a queer—and queering—experience. Daniel takes this concept further by suggesting
                  that sound might help us to “echolocate the edges of subjection.” This is a powerful
                  metaphor for thinking about the (New) Romantic self. Echolocation, a natural cartographic
                  tool that situates the individual within their environment, becomes in Daniel’s reading
                  an ecological process that both reinforces an individual’s private subjectivity and
                  positions them as part of a system that might be local, national or global. But it
                  was in Romantic writing that the echo became a particularly potent metaphor for creativity
                  as well as a popular means through which to explore new places: Goethe’s and Rousseau’s
                  enjoyment of the Venetian gondoliers’ echoing voices was just one instance of the
                  echo’s important role in personal understandings of space and spatiality (Agnew 73–4).
                  By the Victorian period, sound, soundwaves, and echoes were widely enough understood
                  concepts to feature prominently in popular advertising campaigns and the works of
                  influential authors, not least Charles Dickens, George Eliot (Picker 8–10), and—as
                  we have already seen—Hartley Coleridge.</p>
               <p>A century later, when Bowie too was asking “who are we / So small in times such as
                  these” (“Slow Burn”), advancements in sound technologies offered portals through which
                  to explore tensions between personal space and global spatiality. Peter Doyle goes
                  so far as to associate the fascination with space in music, witnessed throughout the
                  1960s, with the new-found portability of what he calls “virtual spatiality” that the
                  development of stereo equipment had facilitated (6). As Bowie discovered, these technologies
                  meant that sound could be employed both metaphorically and literally to explore the
                  individual artist or listener’s connection to the world around them. One answer to
                  that question—who are we?—posits that, for Bowie(as for Simon and Garfunkel) the “echoes
                  in tenement halls” might hold some important answers.</p>
               <p>The possibilities communicated by the physical echo, and held open by the imaginative
                  one, are brought together in Bowie’s penultimate release, “Blackstar.” “Blackstar”
                  alternates between declaring all the things that Bowie is not—a film star, a pop star,
                  a marvel star—and what he is: a Blackstar, which Bowie’s vocals confirm when he echoes
                  the mantra. This is a subversive, playful echo: the main vocalist repeats the backing
                  vocals, rather than the other way around. The interplay between the two marks out
                  a sonic third space, in the middle of which is what the lyrics label “the great I
                  Am.” The line is adapted, via Merleau-Ponty and Coleridge, from God’s declaration
                  to Moses: “I am who I am” (Exodus 3:14). Bowie turns this into a playful declaration
                  of precisely the kind of blending between the human and the divine which Coleridge
                  had mused upon. “The great I Am,” here, is a rebuttal to the previous line’s summary
                  of his early critics’ dismissals: “you’re a flash in the pan.” When Bowie responds
                  by declaring himself to be “the great I Am,” it is a Coleridgean claim for creative,
                  poetic greatness that celebrates the slipperiness of (New) Romantic selfhood: the
                  “Great I Am” can be the “I Am” of a great many things.</p>

               <p>The allusions in the “Blackstar” video to a lost spaceman link this affirmation of
                  “the great I Am” back to Major Tom. In the video’s opening scene, the link between
                  the astronaut and the Blackstar are made explicit through the framing of the spacesuit
                  by a ring of black stars. This intertextual echo makes clear that Bowie had been considering
                  questions about expansion, containment, and their effect on the self since early in
                  his career—and that Major Tom remained the key for echolocating Bowie’s (New) Romantic
                  self.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Odd Spatiality in “Space Oddity”</span></h2>
               <p>“Space Oddity” was Bowie’s “antidote to space fever” (qtd. in Doggett 53). The dystopian
                  consequences of humanity’s expansion into outer space had been starkly imagined in
                  Stanley Kubrick’s <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (1968). This was the film that inspired Bowie’s track, and “Space Oddity” also communicates
                  a profound ambivalence towards the space race. The song’s tone appears to have been
                  missed by some of its early listeners, though; it was first aired on the BBC, apparently
                  without irony, during TV coverage of the moon landing on 20 July 1969 (Doggett 53).
                  Nevertheless, this event marked “Space Oddity” as the anthem for new forms of questioning
                  about earth-bound and extra-terrestrial individualisms. It does so by immersing the
                  listener in the dialectics of contained expansion that “Space Oddity” both describes
                  and, through its deployment of complex narrative and structural echoes, enacts. These
                  echoes foreground the track’s interest in spatiality, as well as space, and—in Doyle’s
                  terms, inspired by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari—makes its “territorial project
                  fully explicit” (17): this is somewhere the “I Am” might be discovered.</p>

               <p>[Insert videos]</p>
               <p>“Space Oddity” imagines the journey of one astronaut, Major Tom, into outer space.
                  This endeavour turns Tom into a celebrity—“the papers” become desperate to know “whose
                  shirts [he] wear[s]”—but Tom ultimately rejects this exaggerated celebration of consumer-centred
                  individualism; he leaves the capsule and, bidding farewell to his wife, disconnects
                  from Ground Control to float away from both the technologies and peoples that bind
                  him to earth. This journey is echoed in the track’s musical structure, which Brad
                  Erickson thinks “models escape from terrestrial confinement” (564–5): the way it fades
                  out at the end seems to follow Major Tom’s floating away into space. The effect, as
                  Peter Doggett poetically puts it, is to “[leave] the listener uncertain where they
                  might touch down” (56). For Michael Mooradian Lupro, on the other hand, Major Tom’s
                  disappearance into space offers more than a sense of freedom: it indicates the character’s
                  embracing of “difference” as he willingly moves into “a place unbound by terrestrial
                  norms of comportment and expression” (14). The narrative and structure both reinforce
                  this odd sense of the individual’s dissolution into an unknown space.</p>
               <p>But “Space Oddity” does not just mimic the space experienced by Major Tom. As Lupro
                  puts it, Major Tom “intertwines with our understanding of what it might be like to
                  exist as a real human being in real space” (14). The track’s auditory space becomes
                  the listener’s tin can, and it inscribes a sonic orbit around the listener that enfolds
                  them into a space that blends the fictional song world with their real one. The way
                  the track fades in at the beginning and out again at the end positions the listener
                  alongside Tom as the centre of its journey. In Ken McLeod’s words, it “mediates our
                  internal space (feelings, desires, dreams) with external space (the physical, the
                  experienced)” (337). It encourages the listener to make the same discovery as Major
                  Tom: that ultimate freedom might arise out of extreme containment.</p>
               <p>This spatiality operates through the technologies the song employs as much as those
                  which support Major Tom’s journey: for “Space Oddity,” Bowie insisted—against his
                  producer’s advice—on a recording technique that was still rare in the late 1960s,
                  and which emphasizes the song’s intent to contain the listener in a space of its own.
                  Throughout the track, Bowie’s voice shifts, as Lupro explains, “from singular centred
                  to multiple stereo” (20). The effect, Ali and Wallace argue, is to transform Bowie’s
                  voice into “both subject and object of its own enunciations” (275). When those shifts
                  occur is crucial: the first line is spoken by a single voice: that of one person in
                  Ground Control. Bowie’s voice splits in the second line; a low-pitched voice sings
                  in the listener’s right ear and is doubled by one singing an octave higher in their
                  left. When the countdown begins, this higher voice becomes the countdown, leaving
                  its companion to continue communicating with the astronaut. The effect is to place
                  the listener alongside Major Tom inside the capsule, surrounded by Ground Control’s
                  plural commanding voices. This doubling is echoed imperfectly when we first hear from
                  Major Tom; to begin with, the voice is singular, but as he steps “through the door”
                  it splits as Ground Control’s had done. So far, Major Tom and his controllers are
                  in line with each other. But when Major Tom notices how “very different” the stars
                  look from this angle, and locates himself in this queer space—“for here am I”—the
                  vocals alter: now, the lower-pitched voice comes from the left. For Lupro, these stereo
                  vocals resituate Major Tom from a celebrity—an extreme form of individualistic selfhood—into
                  “a universal cosmopolitan speaking uneasily for, of, and to, multiplicitous positions”
                  (20). This echo indicates a subtle, yet significant, shift in Tom’s sense of identity.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This change occurs as Tom begins to feel the effects of anti-gravitational forces;
                     he finds himself “floating in a most peculiar way.” But this peculiarity is made ambiguous
                     by Bowie’s mode of singing the line—adding a syllable so that it actually sounds like
                     Tom is “floating in a most a-peculiar way.” In this way, the line holds the potential
                     both for oddness and normalcy (Flannery 161; Lupro 20). In either case, Tom finds
                     that his mode of perception is altered: “the stars look very different” from this
                     angle. This new form of motion, as Flannery perceptively observes, “involves a massive
                     change, either in the world(s) around one or in the way in which that world is apprehended,
                     or in a fusion, always theatrical, of both” (161).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)

                     </div> It holds the possibility for multiple versions of the future. Initially, Tom situates
                     himself within an exaggeratedly everyday earthly object in a way that highlights his
                     affinity with his home planet: “here am I sitting in a tin can / far above the world.”
                     Yet, there is an echo in the line that indicates a subtle shift in meaning: “I Am”
                     becomes “am I.” The shift is significant: “am I” contains the potential for plurality,
                     in a way that the more definitive “I Am” may not. Just as each echo subtly changes
                     the expression of an initial sound, offering multiple experiences of the same root
                     source, so do “Space Oddity”’s lyrics encode the possibility that Major Tom might
                     encode multiple selves. As soon as Major Tom steps through the door, his confident
                     declarations of selfhood invert, and that odd formulation indicates a new fluidity
                     in his terrestrial sense of self. An implied question—am I?—hovers with Tom around
                     the space ship. The second time the line is repeated, Tom provides a different locus
                     for his sense of identity; now, Tom expresses ownership over the tin can, and positions
                     himself not in relation to earth, but to the moon. The fact that “planet earth is
                     blue / and there’s nothing I can do” is no longer, in this second utterance, merely
                     a statement of fact, but an acknowledgement of individual impotence in the face of
                     a global problem—environmental degradation—and the individualistic human condition.</p>
               </div>
               <p>It is while he’s floating in this way that Major Tom is able to echolocate a mappable
                  point. Doggett thinks that the guitar solo that offers an interlude in the interstellar
                  conversation between Tom and Ground Control “seemed to be testing out the walls of
                  Major Tom’s prison” (56). Certainly, it is in this break that Tom seems to undergo
                  the “sort of transformation” that Niall Boyce believes befalls him (528). Tom’s floating
                  has caused him to re-evaluate his relationship to Ground Control and the society they
                  represent. When Ground Control loses contact with their astronaut, their panic is
                  evident in the high-pitched stereo vocals through which they repeatedly ask: “Can
                  you hear me?” This question morphs into Major Tom’s declaration that he is “here.”
                  This echo, from “hear” to “here,” indicates the discovery of a space in which Bowie
                  can echolocate a new sense of identity for Major Tom that is predicated on the relationship
                  between space, sound, and listening. His “floating” no longer seems peculiar, but
                  rather allows him to affect a reversal of the earlier containment: now, it is he who
                  encircles the spaceship. It is at this moment that Tom’s understanding of the “I Am”
                  alters: this is when he becomes—to adapt Coleridge’s terms—a finite being moving in
                  infinite space. It’s at this moment, too, that the grand-sounding “capsule” becomes
                  nothing more than a “tin can,” while Tom stops aligning himself with the terrestrial
                  community and begins to consider himself a space oddity.</p>
               <p>Major Tom’s metamorphosis is registered most strongly through alterations in this
                  spatial relationship between Tom and the tin can, between inside and outside, and
                  between the “I Am” and “I Am Not.” The “unearthly” stereo vocals, alongside what McLeod
                  calls the “series of atonal and rhythmically irregular tape effects and electronic
                  squelches in combination with an ethereal string section” (341), emphasise how queer—or
                  how odd—space itself is in this track. It highlights the ways Major Tom feels himself
                  to be different from the people he has left behind. Tom’s sense of alienation, resulting
                  in what Lupro believes is a “metaphorical <em>social</em> suicide” (22), seems like the logical extreme of the individualism from which he
                  excludes himself. In a sense, Major Tom rejects individualism in order to embrace
                  his own individuality. As Tom’s afterlives suggest, however, this kind of anti-social
                  action is not considered a virtue by the community on the blue earth.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Echoing “Space Oddity”: I Am (not) Major Tom</span></h2>
               <p>Bowie’s final performance of the 1970s was of “Space Oddity” on <em>Kenny Everett’s New Year’s Eve Show</em> in the UK and <em>Dick Clarke’s Salute to the Seventies</em> in the US. Doggett reads this moment as the dissembling of a key Bowie myth in the
                  face of a new age of Thatcherite social conservatism: <span class="quote">‘The oddity was no longer the individual ostracised from society but, in the Britain
                     of Thatcher’s government, the person who still dared to believe in the power of collective
                     action and the ability of society to care for all of its members, however alienated
                     they might be. (309)’</span> The kind of (New) Romantic identity that attempted to negotiate the relationship
                  between individual and society seemed to be dead. In its place was a philosophy that
                  valorised individualism but suspected individuality. Major Tom’s fate was illustrative
                  of the damaging effects of the ostracization to which this new age might lead. Bowie’s
                  performance of the track indicated that it was no longer only a space-age anthem;
                  it was also a powerful metaphor for a drug culture that emphasised what might happen
                  when an individual collided with the social order.</p>
               <p>When Bowie performed “Space Oddity” on <em>Kenny Everett</em>, his performance indicated a shift in the way that Major Tom’s declaration of individuality
                  might be read. The prolonged silence after Ground Control sends “God’s love” to Tom
                  allows Bowie to cross the stage from acoustic guitar to piano, but also leaves a significant
                  emptiness in which Tom, we imagine, lifts off alone. In this version, Tom is disconnected
                  both from Ground Control and, when he arrives at his orbit, from space itself: now,
                  Tom tells Ground Control that he is simply “floating far above the moon.” He seems,
                  now, not to be actually in space, but rather to be experiencing the kind of lonely
                  drug trip with which Bowie’s jerky movements, twitching face and anxious posture—moving
                  between sets with his arms tightly folded—suggest familiarity. More than this, Bowie
                  performs the song on a stage made to look like the padded room of an asylum. The performance
                  suggested an alternative fate for Major Tom. He had not, in the manner of Bowie’s
                  other guises, been artistically killed off; rather, he metamorphoses yet again from
                  a spaceman-turned-alien into an earth-bound, if delusional, junkie who retrospectively
                  anticipates the Thin White Duke.</p>
               <p>After this, Major Tom became one of Bowie’s most distinctive and long-lasting echoes—but
                  each time he appears, in the true nature of an echo, he seems to get weaker. John
                  Hollander calls this characteristic the echo’s “decaying dynamics,” and it is an apt
                  metaphor for Major Tom (3). After “Space Oddity,” Major Tom’s identity—his sense of
                  the “I Am”—seems to diminish as the echoes fade. Doyle might add that this effect
                  renders the echo incapable of communicating a solid sense of identity; at some point,
                  the echo is “spread too thinly to ‘hold’ the territory” (18). Tom never speaks for
                  himself again after “Space Oddity,” but others pass judgement on his mental and physical
                  state. In “Ashes to Ashes,” perhaps Major Tom’s most (in)famous subsequent appearance,
                  “we know Major Tom’s a junkie.” More than that, Major Tom’s excessive individualism
                  has become a threat to social and personal productivity: “to get things done,” the
                  narrator is repeatedly told, “you better not mess with Major Tom.” The reference might
                  be to Tom himself, or to the cocaine, alcohol, and cigarettes with which Bowie himself
                  was by now associated. For Waldrep, this coded reference “nominally recasts Major
                  Tom . . . to use him as a stand-in for Bowie himself” (91). Each time these lines
                  are repeated, the warning against Major Tom becomes starker, and the line between
                  the character and the artist—the boundaries necessary for the (New) Romantic “I Am”—are
                  increasingly blurred. Major Tom’s inverted expression of self—“am I”—contains increasing
                  tensions throughout each of these echoes; they offer dark parodies of individualism
                  that seem, in Major Tom’s case, to have brought about a troubling plurality that is
                  reinforced through each of the character’s iterations (that is, until “Blackstar”).</p>
               <p>These weakening echoes perhaps reach their apotheosis in “Hallo Spaceboy,” from Bowie’s
                  1995 album <em>1. Outside</em>. Waldrep thinks that this album is where Bowie’s “presentations of his performative
                  selves” reached their peak, and that seems to be true of Major Tom (18). The track
                  plays with notions of bounded identities and sexualities—“Do you like girls or boys?
                  / It’s confusing these days”—and its almost excessive echoing enacts the sense of
                  “chaos” that the lyrics describe. The track’s central tension is between bodily constraint
                  and freedom, containment and expansion:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">Spaceboy, you’re sleepy now</div>
                     <div class="l">Your silhouette is so stationary</div>
                     <div class="l">You’re released but your custody calls</div>
                     <div class="l">And I wanna to be free</div>
                     <div class="l">Don’t you wanna be free?<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> This verse, and the chorus that follows, is repeated twice throughout the song—and,
                  more than that, an echo shadows almost every word. Bowie’s voice reverberating around
                  the song-space reinforces the track’s repetitious nature, but emphasises, too, an
                  ongoing attempt to echolocate Major Tom’s (New) Romantic individuality. In “Hallo
                  Spaceboy,” the Major Tom figure has become naturalised in space; not quite an alien,
                  nor is he any longer straightforwardly human. Nevertheless, he remains a companion
                  in the struggle to negotiate individual boundaries: although he is “released”—presumably
                  from terrestrial constraints—he is not able fully to discard a sense of imprisonment.
                  Freedom seems to exist, here, in a third dimension between girls and boys, inside
                  and outside, the “I Am” and the I am not.</p>
               <p>Although “Hallo Spaceboy” is preoccupied with saying “bye bye” to Major Tom, his death
                  is not confirmed until Bowie’s penultimate video. In “Blackstar,” Bowie asserts that
                  he has become a different kind of star, and the song plays with the very nature of
                  the echo: this time, Major Tom seems to return more strongly than any time since “Space
                  Oddity.” The treatment of Major Tom’s remains reinforces that oddity: his bejewelled
                  skull becomes the focus of a ritual at the heart of a labyrinthine city, whilst the
                  rest of his skeleton floats, peculiarly, away, morphing into the eponymous black star.
                  This is when two of Bowie’s identities—his first and his last—collide. That intertextual
                  echo effects an erasure of the boundaries between selves that Coleridge described,
                  bringing with it all the versions of Major Tom that have accumulated along the way:
                  astronaut, junkie, spaceboy, and relic. In the end, as Coleridge also indicated, at
                  this point nothing remains but the words, echoing in and through new kinds of spatial
                  and individual oddities. But this diffusion is not aesthetically or philosophically
                  a weakness: Major Tom himself become a “choral echo,” morphs into the universe and
                  indicates Bowie’s own diffusion into “the Great I Am.” The echoes that Bowie wrote,
                  performed, and recorded located a (New) Romantic individualism that interrogated its
                  own identity both within and without (extra-)terrestrial communities.</p>
