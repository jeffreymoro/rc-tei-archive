               <p>This introduction lays out the predicates of <emph>David Bowie and the Legacies of
                    Romanticism</emph>, exploring the diversity of Romantic
                        inheritances and considering the ways in which David Bowie can be seen as
                        engaging with them. It argues that while the Romantic period’s influence is less
                        obvious than that of some other literary epochs, this is in large part because
                        Romantic innovations changed so fundamentally the ways in which culture
                        conceives of art and identity. Considering how Bowie engages with these changes
                        allows us to see how Romanticism survives in a range of dynamic shaping forces,
                        empowering later artists through providing both flexible tools to repurpose and
                        overarching systems to reconfigure and oppose.</p>

               <p>“Poetry makes nothing happen,” W.H. Auden contends in his
                    elegy “In Memory of W.B. Yeats.” However, he goes on to write that nevertheless
                    “it survives, / A way of happening, a mouth” (246). This collection is concerned
                    with the ways in which the clusters of ideas awkwardly bundled together under
                    the heading of Romanticism survive as ways of happening in the twentieth and
                    twenty-first centuries, albeit in forms necessarily “modified in the guts of the
                    living” (245). Our prisms for examining the ongoing currency of Romantic
                    conceptions are the works, performances, and legacies of David Bowie. We argue
                    that many of Bowie’s manifestations engage in meaningful creative and critical
                    conversations with assumptions that originally crystallized in Romantic-period
                    discourses and forms. Specifically, the five essays that follow explore ideas
                    relating to space, childhood, identity, artistry, and the image of freedom: all
                    key Romantic concerns that continue to resonate in Bowie and his works. In
                    discussing how Bowie’s music, personae, and cultural presences engage with
                    late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century thoughts and artworlds, this volume
                    traces a variety of different forms of remediation, including reflection,
                    diffusion, resistance, amplification, and transfiguration. Bowie is far from
                    being straightforwardly a Romantic artist, but the very complexities of his
                    relationships with Romanticism make him a more revealing lens through which to
                    explore the pervasiveness, richness, and predicaments of our Romantic
                    inheritances. As Auden does for poetry, we wish to reject a straightforwardly
                    functional vision of Romanticism as a form of action in the present in favour of
                    seeing it as a series of modalities that inventive interpreters like Bowie have
                    been able to extend, nuance, transform, and—in some circumstances—shuck
                    off.
            </p>
               <p>This collection, like many good things, owes its existence
                    to connections sparked by conference conviviality. Its roots lie in after-dinner
                    discussions between Joanna E. Taylor, Beatrice Turner, and myself at the 2015
                    British Association for Romantic Studies (BARS) Conference in Cardiff. The idea
                    of juxtaposing Bowie and Romanticism (two great tastes that we hoped would taste
                    great together) swiftly created a compelling play of possibilities, and the
                    notion of working these up continued to nag at us long after we departed from
                    Wales. Bowie’s subsequent passing—one of the first of 2016’s numerous great
                    losses—intensified our desire to see what we could do by examining Bowie through
                    the prism of Romanticism and vice versa. On the helpful recommendation of
                    Michael Gamer, we asked Emily Bernhard-Jackson—who was already completing new
                    work on Bowie and Byron—to join us, and the four of us presented our ideas as a
                    panel at the 2017 BARS Conference in York. We were gratified both by the number
                    of people who showed up at a relatively early hour on the Sunday morning after
                    the banquet and by the enthusiasm expressed in questions and responses. This
                    made us keen to develop our thoughts for publication to extend the stimulating
                    conversations we had begun. When we submitted a proposal to the Praxis series,
                    Orrin Wang kindly mentioned that Forest Pyle had recently been thinking about
                    Bowie in relation to his current projects on contemporary Romanticisms. When we
                    subsequently approached him, it swiftly became apparent that his perspective
                    would bring something new and distinctive beyond what we’d gathered in the
                    original panel, so we were delighted when he agreed to contribute a concluding
                    essay to this collection. The completion of this volume is thus a tribute to
                    Romantic Studies’ openness and cordiality. We’d like to offer heartfelt thanks
                    to all those who’ve listened to, supported, and provided feedback on this
                    research as it has developed.
            </p>
               <p>The framing of this collection begs two related questions:
                    why place such emphasis on Romantic legacies, and why use David Bowie to explore
                    these? To begin with the first question: we are aware that from certain
                    perspectives, exploring Romantic resonances in David Bowie might seem to be a
                    rather tangential—or even quixotic—endeavour. For the past three decades,
                    mainstream scholarship in Romantic Studies has been strongly invested in
                    recovering historical circumstances, vesting value claims for works in their
                    conditions of possibility at the times of their creations. This has led many
                    scholars to implicitly favour a stance Tom Mole has called “punctual
                    historicism,” which he defines as a tendency to “think the most important
                    context for understanding literature is the context of its composition or its
                    first publication” (21). This impulse has been the spur for a huge body of
                    significant critical and editorial work that has helped immeasurably in getting
                    us to a position where we can more adequately claim that we might “read a text
                    like its first readers” (23). However, such scholarship, while immensely
                    valuable, should not constitute the whole literary-critical picture. The ways
                    that texts happened in the past are hugely important, but texts and the idea
                    clusters they spawn are also fascinating for the complex ways that they continue
                    to happen in our lives, institutions, minds, and seminar rooms. Clearly, part of
                    our role as Romanticists is to try to remember, imagine, and explain how the
                    Romantic period was for those who lived through it, but it is also important to
                    be explicit that its works and the new affordances of thought and feeling they
                    developed continue to live on in our understandings, apprehensions, and
                    misapprehensions.

               <p>In recent years, a growing body of work has made
                    significant progress in investigating how Romantic-period artforms and
                    ideologies have played out in the works of successor artists. Interestingly,
                    much of this research has been issued in the form of essay collections; this
                    perhaps indicates a consensus that complex questions regarding legacies are best
                    addressed through providing a series of complementary perspectives, rather than
                    seeking to be singular and definitive.

In <emph>Legacies of Romanticism</emph> (2012), Carmen Casaliggi, Paul March-Russell and their collaborators adroitly explore the ways in which “Romanticism has constituted, and been reconstituted by, subsequent developments in artistic theory and practice” (8). Jacques Khalip and Forest Pyle’s <emph>Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism </emph> (2016) takes a more explicitly theory-led
                                approach, with contributors examining from a range of angles the
                                manners in which modern culture has been drawn to and illuminated by
                                Romantic formations. In doing so, they laudably seek, in words
                                developed from Walter Benjamin, “to make good on the terms of that
                                [secret] agreement [between previous generations and current ones] .

                While many essay volumes have dealt principally with high
                    cultural resonances, a number have also explored connections with contemporary
                    popular culture, often with an eye to demystifying Romanticism in the seminar
                    room.<note place="foot" resp="author">In particular, a lot of excellent scholarship exploring historical consonances and artful anachronism has been published on <emph>Romantic Circles</emph>. We are very glad that our collection will

                Such work brings home both the intellectual potential of
                    revivifying Romanticism through analogy and the very real necessity of thinking
                    about how versions and variants of Romanticism might matter now when
                    constructing our syllabi and explaining our passions.</p>
               <p>However, while such collections provide both excellent
                    sources and helpful methodological toolkits for investigating the longer-term
                    influence of Romantic-period writing—especially poetry—there is as yet no
                    strongly established equivalent in Romantic Studies to the burgeoning interest
                    in Neo-Victorianism in Victorian Studies. This, I would contend, is in large
                    part due to the prevailing nature of Romantic influence. As Ann Heilmann and
                    Mark Llewellyn put it, in many respects “‘the Victorian’ has become a
                    homogenized identity—even a signifier—in contemporary culture” (2).
                    Neo-Victorianism is largely predicated on its subject period being defined (or
                    fossilized) in a series of familiar stereotypes. Heilmann and Llewellyn argue
                    that Neo-Victorian texts engage a “self-analytic drive” and constitute
                    “fictional re-encounters,” playing off the solidity of the period’s cultural
                    presence by subjecting it to parody, remediation, and revaluation (5; 8). In
                    doing so, Neo-Victorian works assert—always implicitly, and often very
                    explicitly—that we are no longer Victorian: the period is over, done with, and
                    transcended.
            </p>
               <p>By contrast, the Romantic-period influence on contemporary culture is more nebulous but in many ways stronger and more pervasive. In <emph>Keywords</emph> (1976), Raymond Williams observed that “literature was specialized towards
                <emph>imaginative
                writing</emph> within the basic assumptions of Romanticism” (186). Ideals developed and institutionalized in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries remain right at the heart of modern disciplines and the social assumptions that empower and constrain them. When we talk about art and culture, we use a language that has been fundamentally shaped by Romantic assumptions. Despite the efforts of critics like Jerome McGann and Clifford Siskin, it remains far harder to get outside Romanticism than it is to get outside Victorianism. While the latter is associated most strongly with aesthetics and ideologies that can be defined as no longer being our own, the former lingers at the heart of many of our most cherished cultural assumptions.
            </p>
               <p>This is not an unproblematic situation. While Romantic ideologies comprise a powerfully suggestive set of modalities for being and for being in the world, it would be deeply worrying if the recorded thoughts and feelings of two hundred years ago mapped exactly on to our modern ethics and (pre)conceptions. When considered alongside Romanticism’s considerable, and potentially disabling, authority as a discourse, such dissonances have served to create an influential strand of paranoid criticism that sees the art of the Romantic period as exerting an insidious and powerfully negative influence. As Simon Swift has convincingly argued, “the fear of being enchanted by Romantic illusions, as well as the self-defensive critical mechanisms that aim to guard against it, [are] themselves Romantic legacies” (246). Swift’s view of Romanticism has interesting consonances with Harold Bloom’s view of influence. We might well trace a version of Bloomian anxiety in Alain Baidou’s pronouncements about the “question which weighs upon and threatens to exhaust us: can we be delivered,
                <emph>finally</emph> delivered, from our subjugation to Romanticism?” (24).</p>
               <p>It is difficult, then, to see how a discourse closely
                    resembling Neo-Victorianism can arise while Romanticism is still very much with
                    us. However, the currency of Romanticism might well serve to create a space for
                    a different kind of legacy studies that could also address some of the
                    objections of those like Baidou who see Romanticism as an all-encompassing
                    malign influence. I would contend that while Baidou is right to see Romanticism
                    as remaining powerfully operative, the Romanticism that operates now is not the
                    same as that which operated in the early nineteenth century, or indeed in the
                    early twentieth century. Romanticism was always a retrospective imposition, and
                    the very complexities that make defining it so difficult also provide space for
                    artists and critics to shift and change it, moving its centres of gravity and
                    collectively working to challenge its previous assumptions. Like Walt Whitman,
                    Romanticism can internalize contradictions without collapsing; it is large and
                    can “contain multitudes” (24). If we accept this, we might conceptualize
                    ourselves not as subjugated victims begging for delivery from a unitary
                    Romanticism, but rather as stakeholders who possess Romanticism as a cultural
                    legacy and who can remake it in our own images, censuring and jettisoning
                    qualities and discourses that we find objectionable while drawing on its
                    communicative powers to connect us with our pasts and our contemporaries in old
                    and new forms of mutual understanding.
            </p>
               <p>This brings us to the second question: why Bowie? He is
                    far from the most obviously Romantic of artists, but this makes him peculiarly
                    suitable for addressing both the ubiquity of Romantic forms and the manners in
                    which these must variously be negotiated, resisted, and reconfigured. Previous
                    scholars examining Romantic legacies in popular music have often drawn direct
                    connections between poets and pop stars, looking at how the latter evoke and
                    make use of the former.

                However, Bowie offers an excellent test case for
                    considering a more conflicted model of Romantic inheritance. He is a good
                    presence to think with because of the ways he clashes with Romantic conceptions
                    as well as the manners in which he resonates with them. The essays in this
                    volume differ markedly and—we hope—productively in how they conceptualize this
                    combination of harmony and dissonance. At the beginning of his contribution,
                    Forest Pyle writes that “On the surface, David Bowie is one of the least likely
                    matches that I can imagine for a pairing of pop culture with Romanticism.”
                    Bearing in mind the ease with which our initial conversations about Bowie and
                    Romanticism flowed in Cardiff, I was initially quite surprised when I read this,
                    but it makes complete sense as a position. Bowie’s work is not particularly
                    concerned with the natural world and expresses distrust regarding many kinds of
                    visionary experience. It often takes pleasure in the kinds of artifice with
                    which devotees of Romanticism’s cult of authenticity are distinctly
                    uncomfortable. Regardless of the real nature of William Wordsworth’s
                    interactions with Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals or his poetical predecessors,
                    the ideal of the Wordsworthian poet does not chime neatly with the principles
                    behind cut-ups, pin-ups, or oblique strategies. In these respects, Bowie is
                    deeply un-Romantic, although his being so within a paradigm in which Romanticism
                    still holds considerable sway itself provides a telling commentary on the
                    rarefication and remediation of Romantic-period inheritances.
            </p>
               <p>However, for me, Bowie has always seemed of a kind with
                    Romantic artists in his pursuit of iconicity. Like them, he is a figure who
                    sought to be at the center of debates within and about his time, attempting
                    self-consciously to provide a means for audiences and commentators to position
                    their thoughts, feelings, and selves. If Romanticism carved out a space in which
                    artists can stand as recognized yet peculiar representatives of their age, then
                    Bowie is a true heir both in his grapplings with the zeitgeist and in his
                    insistence on maintaining his individual idiosyncrasies even as he appeals for
                    general applause. In “A Defence of Poetry,” Shelley writes that “Poets are the
                    hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows
                    which futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they
                    understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they
                    inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves” (535). This description of
                    the artist as a sensitive but far-from-omniscient barometer seems to me
                    accurately to describe Bowie, whose influence seems profounder, more widespread,
                    and less expected than that of other rock stars of his age. The main word in
                    Shelley’s statement we would need to amend in Bowie’s case is “unapprehended.”
                    In the seventies in particular, Bowie sought successfully to make both his
                    influences and his staged selves garishly visible, blazing across the mediascape
                    both as a roguish assemblage of half-familiar elements and as something
                    audiences responded to as being radically new. The Bowies of the seventies grab
                    the lion’s share of the attention in this collection, probably because this was
                    the period of his career in which the steps he danced were most obviously in the
                    Romantic line. Before the off-kilter embrace of more conventional forms in the
                    eighties, the avant-gardisms of the nineties, and the rueful, experimental
                    referentiality of his twenty-first-century material, seventies Bowies teetered
                    confidently between outsider and archetype, brashly asserting that art was sexy
                    and scuzzy and fake and cerebral, but, above all, that it had the potential to
                    be achingly, Romantically meaningful.
            </p>
               <p>However, this is not to imply that smaller-scale
                    connections cannot be drawn between Bowie and the discourses and affordances
                    incubated in Romantic works. It seems to me that there’s more than a hint of
                    Byron’s Manfred in the return of the Thin White Duke “throwing darts in lovers’
                    eyes” (Bowie, “Station to Station”). Perhaps there’s also an echo of the lamp
                    that must be replenished but which will still never burn long enough (<emph>Manfred</emph>
                1.1.1–2) in the solitary candle burning in the Villa of
                    Ormen (Bowie, “Blackstar”). This echo might easily be multiplied by working
                    through the incantatory self-assertions and self-fashionings that follow in each
                    case. The eyes of the addressee “at the centre of it all” in “Blackstar” would
                    for Manfred be Astarte’s eyes, around which everything else revolves. The
                    contiguousness of Astarte’s eyes with Manfred’s own—“like to mine”
                    (2.2.107)—resonates with the doublings and collapsings in Bowie’s lyric. Manfred
                    defines himself against and within nature in his speeches on the Jungfrau and to
                    the Witch of the Alps, joying in following “through the night the moving moon /
                    The stars and their development” (2.2.70–1) while feeling “degraded back” and
                    “all clay again” (2.2.78–9) when human frames intrude. Similarly, although
                    perhaps more playfully, the voice that cries out in “Blackstar” desires “eagles
                    in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes” and denies the social roles of film star,
                    pop star, porn star, and gangster while self-consciously assuming a more sublime
                    stellar identity. These affinities chime with those expressed by Manfred when he
                    praises the sun as “representative of the Unknown” (3.2.15) or claims that in
                    “starry shade / Of dim and solitary loveliness, / I learn’d the language of
                    another world” (3.4.5–7). Bowie’s version of this declaration is perhaps more in
                    line with the performative ironies of the later Byron than with Manfred’s
                    solipsistic grieving, but glimpses of the mode linger.
            </p>
               <p>In a similar vein, we might read the experimental
                    fragments and oblique scraps of Berlin Trilogy Bowie as an interesting
                    counterpoint to Coleridge’s proliferating notebook projections: certainties that
                    never fully resolve, floating in anxieties and reversionings. There’s a touch of
                    Shelley’s half-chastened but still-burning utopianism in songs like “Starman,”
                    “Memory of a Free Festival,” and “The Bewlay Brothers,” and a flicker of a
                    maximalist “England in 1819” in “Young Americans.” In imagining the descent of
                    an ambivalent—yet sublime and infinitely compelling—cosmic force into a world
                    with “five years left to cry in,”
                <emph>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy
                Stardust</emph> could be read as projecting an Orc for the 1970s rather than the 1790s: a Blakean creation who both streams back into myth and steps out into the quotidian world as a flawed avatar of the times.</p>
               <p>I could go on for a considerable time, expanding on this
                    list to address the questions that it begs. Why focus on the old-school
                    visionary company? Does Bowie resonate with Anna Laetitia Barbauld, or Felicia
                    Hemans (a similarly generous acknowledger of connections), or (perhaps most
                    plausibly) with Letitia Landon, another artist who felt that she’d come late to
                    the party and needed to negotiate a newly-establishing tradition while making
                    her own voice? Might Bowie be, in certain moods and modes, like Jane Austen, or
                    Sydney Owenson, or Walter Scott? Did the suburban kid from unfashionable Bromley
                    fashion himself in ways that chime with Ayrshire’s “heaven-taught plowman,” or
                    with the Helpston man who began by reflecting on the natural world and who ended
                    up echoing everything? However, to continue would take this piece considerably
                    beyond the compass of an introduction, and would intrude on the work of the
                    essays that follow, which combine considerations of the legacies of the Big Six
                    with larger and more diverse constellations of influence. We have by no means
                    covered everything, and we sincerely hope that this collection will inspire
                    other scholars to explore further Romantic resonances in Bowie and in others.
                    Now, though, it is time to proceed to the starts we have made. Having sketched
                    out models of Romantic inheritance and indicated how Bowie might be used to
                    investigate these, all that remains is briefly to trail the individual
                    contributions before shutting up gracefully and letting them speak for
                    themselves.
            </p>
               <p>In the opening essay, Joanna E. Taylor considers the
                    strong consonances between the manners in which Romantic-period writers located
                    selves through conceptualizing forms of contained space and Bowie’s practices in
                    the sequence of songs featuring Major Tom. Her essay pays particular attention
                    to echoes, which serve both as means of reiterating and as forms that can queer
                    the boundaries between individuals, communities, and environments. After
                    exploring Romantic and post-Romantic modes for locating and challenging
                    individualism using space, Taylor zeroes in on the choral echoes of Coleridge’s
                    “great I AM,” a phrase echoed directly in Bowie’s “Blackstar.” She then tracks
                    the forms that “Blackstar” models back to Bowie’s earliest big hit, “Space
                    Oddity,” which both employs and resists echoes and repetitions to show how Major
                    Tom might “[reject] individualism in order to embrace his own individuality.”
                    Taylor concludes by exploring the ways that Major Tom continues to act as a
                    fading but dynamically unsettling (New) Romantic echo in Bowie’s later
                    works.
            </p>
               <p>While Taylor’s essay shows Bowie extending paradigms influenced by Romanticism, Beatrice Turner’s essay finds him appropriating and revoicing Romantic attitudes regarding childhood innocence while also ironizing these and providing emancipatory alternatives. In her conception, the oft-dismissed “Kooks” provides the key to
                <emph>Hunky Dory</emph>’s visions of generational definition, transmission, and conflict. While “Kooks” appears to be a cutesy celebration, when placed in the wider contexts of the album and of Romantic appropriations of children as symbolic figures, its fissures, contradictions, and silencings become apparent. Crucially, however, Turner reads in Bowie a kind of resistance that recognizes the power and potential value of the paradigm it critiques. While
                <emph>Hunky
                Dory</emph> is ultimately on the side of experience rather than endorsing a restricting imposition of innocence, its cynicism is far from unalloyed, providing, in Turner’s reading, a complex and nuanced exploration of the difficulties of inheritance.</p>
               <p>In her discussion of personal and social identities, Emily
                    Bernhard-Jackson argues that the ways in which Bowie configured his personae and
                    self can helpfully be understood as an expansion and extension of a tradition
                    developed in the writings of John Locke, David Hume, and George Berkeley. In
                    opening, she establishes a chain of indexical transmissions through which Bowie
                    may have encountered these philosophers’ ideas, but more importantly, she
                    demonstrates clearly how reading Bowie alongside Enlightenment philosophy
                    surfaces a kind of artistry prepared to commit where its eighteenth-century
                    precursors caviled. In Bernhard-Jackson’s reading, Bowie is revealed to have
                    made a quintessentially Romantic move by taking ideas about the sequential and
                    fungible nature of identity—which had previously been formulated as relatively
                    abstract conceptions—and bringing these into life through a combination of
                    personal commitment, media manipulation, and skilled artistry.
            </p>
               <p>My own essay picks up on some of these arguments by considering how Bowie engages with Romanticism’s creation of specialized forms of artistic identity. After contending that the invention of the capital-A artist was principally a response to Romantic-period innovations, I argue that Bowie works simultaneously within and against this tradition. His lyrics, personae, and mediated existence all serve to expand the range of what can be represented in society and culture, building on the crucial Romantic-period developments that established art as a space of radical exploration and assembly. However, Bowie is more conflicted about the kinds of powers that should be arrogated to the artist than his early-nineteenth-century predecessors. His lyrics often resist the claims to privileged consciousness that canonical Romantic pronouncements like Keats’s “negative capability” letter, Wordsworth’s
                <emph>Prelude</emph>,
                    and Shelley’s agonizingly self-conscious lyrics seem to advance. Instead,
                    Bowie’s works consistently gesture out towards his audiences, insisting on the
                    liberating faultiness of artistic transmissions and on the crucial role of the
                    listener in making meanings and connections.
            </p>
               <p>Finally, Forest Pyle’s essay begins by considering Bowie’s wide range of influences beyond Romanticism, showing his vital engagements with celebrity, modernism, and postmodernity. While he tantalizingly sketches the outlines of a glam Romanticism, the main thrust of Pyle’s essay is concerned with a reconfigured queering Romanticism mediated, among others, by Walter Pater, Oscar Wilde, and Walter Benjamin. His lens for exploring this constellation is Todd Haynes’s 1998 film 
                <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, which does not feature Bowie or include his music in a direct sense, but which is dominated by what Pyle calls the Bowie-Image, a conduit for and avatar of the electric vivacity of art. In Pyle’s reading,
                <emph>Velvet
                Goldmine</emph> is a “site of both nostalgia and ebullience, alternating currents in Romanticism’s transmissions to our future.” In being so, it becomes a place of prospective liberation and of freedom from the need to be redeemed, capturing—albeit with nuance—the image of potential transcendence transmitted through Romantic poetry and through Bowie’s “gift of sound and vision.”
            </p>
               <p>
                When Bowie himself (or one of his personae) imagined what
                    being a “Star” would be like, its potentialities included both the deeply
                    personal or banal (“I could fall asleep at night”) and the nakedly commercial
                    (“I could do with the money”). However, he also invested stardom with the
                    potential for radical change, arguing that he “could play the wild mutation as a
                    rock &amp; roll star.” In this collection, we have experimented with taking
                    Bowie at his word, tracing the ways in which we might see his personae, lyrics,
                    music, and presences as wild mutations of Romantic inheritances. The extent of
                    our success is for you to judge, but it’s been an amazingly fun project to put
                    together. We hope you enjoy this collection as much as we have, and that you
                    find some of the things it has to say useful in your own examinations of
                    Romantic lineages and transformations.

               <p rend="noCount">Poised at the start of the 1970s, David Bowie’s <emph>Hunky
                        Dory</emph> now feels prophetic in its visions of a cynical “world to come”
                    and the embittered generation who lived the long post-Woodstock comedown. This
                    essay argues that the album mobilizes a discourse of idealized childhood that is
                    one of Romanticism’s most enduring legacies, in order to enact a generational
                    struggle that is both personal—the anxiety of the parent who fears creative
                    displacement by their child—and public: the nostalgic and idealistic parent
                    generation of the 1960s versus the bitter realism of their descendants. Tracing
                    how “Kooks” replicates the image of the ‘Romantic child’ as articulated
                    primarily in Wordsworth and Coleridge’s poetry, the essay situates the
                    narrator’s reactionary impulse to keep the child a child forever against the
                    album’s surrounding cast of angry, knowing teenagers. It argues that the
                    Romantic child discourse—and the ways in which it still shapes, implicitly or
                    otherwise, ideas about the relationships between parents and children, authors
                    and texts, and reproduction and creative genius—enables the album to dramatize
                    as a coherent text the ways in which those who inherited 1960s counterculture
                    might, like Romanticism’s children in the 1820s and 1830s, resist calls to
                    mythic, timeless unknowingness and instead turn to face painfully unfolding
                    knowledge.</p>

               <p>
                  <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> (1971) is a record on which things are everything but.
                    Exemplifying David Bowie’s talent for inhabiting and dramatizing multiple
                    identities, it is spoken both by and to the kids who have been left, as
                    “Changes” has it, “up to our necks in it” by an etiolated parent generation. At
                    its centre, however, is “Kooks,” a track whose inclusion at the heart of the
                    record bothered me when I first heard the album as an undergraduate and has
                    continued to bother me since. The bothering is, in fact, a not insignificant
                    factor in my abiding love for <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> above any other record by
                    Bowie. Set against the lyrical cynicism and extravagant orchestrations of “Oh!
                    You Pretty Things,” or “Life on Mars?”, or the visionary anti-prophecy of
                    “Quicksand” which follows it to close Side A, “Kooks”’s simple, twee arrangement
                    and sentimental parental address has always seemed wilfully naïve to me, at odds
                    with the rest of the album’s knowing embrace of coming apocalypse and its
                    associated regenerative possibilities. In an album otherwise oriented towards “a
                    world to come,” it is an appeal against change, against growing up, pointing
                    both lyrically and musically back into a mythologized childhood.</p>
               <p>The friction generated by that juxtaposition of imaginative stasis and knowing
                    momentum, or innocence and experience (to make plain the thread this essay will
                    string between a proto-glam pop album and Romantic poetry), is central to
                    understanding the album’s powerful sense of tectonic cultural shift, and to
                    understanding it as a profoundly Romantic text. <emph>Hunky Dory</emph>, as some
                    of its early reviewers recognized, is about “both fathers and sons” (Ross). But
                    childhood and parenthood as concepts do double duty in this text in a way that
                    will be familiar to readers of Romantic poetry: the album understands both the
                    powerful, ambivalent feelings that parents and children produce in each other,
                    and the no less ambivalent forms of response and interrogation at play when a
                    parent generation is supplanted by its descendants. In both of these senses, the
                    personal and the cultural, <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> speaks about the implicit
                    violence of reproduction. It presciently identifies how comfortably naïve 1960s
                    ‘Flower Power’ counterculture would look when eyed up by the more jaundiced
                    teenagers of the 1970s, while it also seeks self-consciously to mystify Bowie’s
                    own feelings about impending fatherhood. Historical particularities of 1970s
                    Britain aside, this is an agon with a clear and specific Romantic origin.
                    “Kooks” reproduces with remarkable precision an image of the idealized child of
                    nature—located most commonly in a handful of William Wordsworth and Samuel
                    Taylor Coleridge’s poems—which scholars have named the ‘Romantic child’. But it
                    also reproduces the fraught relationship this text-child has with their
                    parent-author, while the album’s surrounding cast of angry, knowing adolescents
                    dramatize the ways in which this reactionary idea of childhood has to be
                    negotiated by those who inherit it. </p>
               <p> My argument, then, is that we should read—and hear—“Kooks” as a text that
                    articulates this Romantic archetype of childhood, and <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> as
                    a text that works through a way of responding to that archetype, and to the
                    wider Romantic project. The Romantic child is the idealized child of
                    Wordsworth’s “We Are Seven” or his Boy of Winander, or Coleridge’s “Frost at
                    Midnight”. This is the child figure who arrives direct from heaven “trailing
                    clouds of glory” in Wordsworth’s “Intimations Ode” (l. 64), the “seer blest!,”
                    who Barbara Garlitz could claim in 1966 had completely redefined attitudes to
                    childhood for a century, and whose legacy in fact remains the dominant cultural
                    understanding of childhood in the Western imagination (Garlitz 639).These poems
                    imagined a radical new image of the child as someone preserved in eternal
                    innocence and creative potentiality by their seclusion from formal education,
                    society, the city, or any other form of experience that might taint their
                    intuitive ability to read the natural world. They also, however, consciously and
                    unconsciously dramatize the ways in which the adult author or parent creates
                    this ideal child by over-inscribing a real child with a set of meanings that
                    meet the author’s psychological and creative need for an eternal, archetypal
                    child. By reifying the child into an aesthetic production, its creative
                    potentiality is always forestalled; the child remains the adult’s own creation.
                    As I have argued elsewhere, it is this process of reification, and the authorial
                    anxiety of replacement that underlies it, that the Romantic poem is about when
                    it speaks about childhood.<note place="foot" resp="author">See especially
                        section two of Chapter One, “The Family, the Child, and the Memorial,” in
                            <emph>Romantic Childhood, Romantic Heirs: Reproduction and Retrospection
                            1820−1850.</emph> Palgrave, 2017.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This reading of the child as the creative production of the adult speaker who
                    cannot allow them to grow up shows us what is at stake for those who reject
                    Romantic innocence, and it is this tension that <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> repeats,
                    knowingly or otherwise. It is not my intention to claim that Bowie is
                    consciously responding to and critiquing Romantic constructions of childhood;
                    however, I am arguing that they form an available and culturally powerful
                    discourse with which <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> engages. This discourse, and the
                    ways in which it still shapes, implicitly or otherwise, ideas about the
                    relationships between parents and children, authors and texts, and reproduction
                    and creative genius, enables the album to dramatize as a coherent text the ways
                    in which those who inherited 1960s counterculture might, like Romanticism’s
                    children in the 1820s and 30s, resist calls to mythic, timeless unknowingness
                    and instead turn to face painfully unfolding knowledge.</p>
               <p> Before I consider the ways in which “Kooks” in particular draws on a Romantic
                    discourse of childhood, it is useful to think about what makes it a Romantic
                    text at all, because the milieu the song works to establish, one in which Bowie
                    and son might “take the car downtown,” is firmly the contemporary everyday. This
                    sets it at odds with the rest of the album, in which the songs generally
                    freewheel between imagined temporalities, mixing present, future, and mythic
                    timelessness in a way more consistent with the usual swooping through-lines and
                    leapings-off of the Romantic lyric. “Oh! You Pretty Things,” for instance, opens
                    on a scene of cozy, anachronistic domesticity (“throw another log on the fire
                    for me / I’ve made some breakfast and coffee”) only to jump dizzyingly forwards
                    and outwards into cosmic prophecy via the image of the “crack in the sky and a
                    hand reaching down to me.” Linguistically, too, there’s an opposition between
                    the contemporary slanginess of “Kooks”’s vernacular (“I’m not much cop at
                    punching other people’s dads”) and the stylized, surrealist imagery of, for
                    example, “Eight Line Poem”: “But the key to the city / Is in the sun which pins
                    the branches to the sky.” Contemporary setting and language aside, however, it
                    is in the song’s celebration of quotidian detail and structural simplicity that
                    its Romantic influence lies.</p>
               <p> Like many of Wordsworth’s ballad poems, or Coleridge’s conversation poems, the
                    song creates a domestic universe with an affect in excess of its constituent
                    parts. This is achieved by picking out small individual images or events and
                    elevating their intensity whilst limiting the imaginative horizon of the
                    protagonists. In “Kooks,” that horizon is marked by the chorus refrain: “soon
                    you’ll grow / So take a chance / On a couple of kooks . . .” The baby boy Bowie
                    addresses will “soon . . . grow,” but into who, or what, is deferred for now.
                    Just as the world of the “little cottage girl” of “We Are Seven” is
                    circumscribed by the limits of the churchyard in which her siblings lie, Bowie
                    the new father cannot imagine a spatial or temporal world beyond the newly
                    established familial borders. Instead, he lists the items he and his wife have
                    prepared for their child’s impending arrival: “a lot of things to keep you warm
                    and dry / A funny old crib on which the paint won’t dry”; “a pair of shoes, a
                    trumpet you can blow, and a book of rules / Of what to say to people when they
                    pick on you.” As in “We Are Seven,” in which it is left to the reader to infer a
                    family’s grief from the little girl’s recitation of her mundane daily rituals of
                    eating, singing, and sewing at her siblings’ graves, this list does its own
                    explicatory work without the narrator’s explicit realization: the
                    inexpertly-painted crib and baby clothes sit on one side of the caesura created
                    by the shift in melody and metre, and on the other, the presumably decorative
                    rather than protective “paaaair of shoes” (the single stress awkwardly drawn out
                    for two beats to make up the bar), the trumpet (mimetically illustrated), and
                    the book of comebacks. It is left to the listener to get an immediate joke about
                    these bohemian parents’ preparedness (or otherwise) for their new baby, and to
                    recognize a more profound claim about the impossibility of anyone ever really
                    being able to imagine what it’s like after a child arrives.</p>
               <p> Lyrically, then, “Kooks” might be considered a Romantic poem in the
                    Wordsworthian mould. It certainly fits Wordsworth’s own criteria of “incidents
                    and situations from common life” expressed in “plainer and more emphatic
                    language,” especially in comparison to the heightened, occasionally grandiose
                    language and stylized imagery of the rest of the album (Wordsworth 596; 597). It
                    is also a good exemplar of his rule that in a poem “the feeling therein
                    developed gives importance to the action and situation, and not the action and
                    situation to the feeling” (599): the song builds upon the very slightest of
                    actual incidents. Musically, too, it has a structural simplicity which echoes
                    the plain diction of the lyrics. The song’s 4:4 time signature, the simplest of
                    tempos (and usually the first learned), has an analogue in the ballad metre
                    which drives many of Wordsworth’s narrative poems such as “Goody Blake and Harry
                    Gill,” “The Idiot Boy,” or “We Are Seven.” The ballad metre, which alternates
                    lines of iambic tetrameter and trimeter in four-line stanzas, would have been
                    familiar to an eighteenth-century reader from popular broadsides: it is what
                    might be called a ‘folk’ metre. It emphasizes rhythm over flow, drawing primary
                    attention to the repetitive bouncy stanzas, and creates an effect that is, as
                    numerous Romantic critics have observed, naïve or childlike, suggesting a
                    nursery rhyme rather than a poem with more serious literary intent.<note place="foot" resp="author">See, for example, Heather Glen’s <emph> Vision

                    “Kooks”’s syncopated four-beat bars work in a similar way, establishing a
                    relationship between childlike rhythm and subject, and suggesting, perhaps, that
                    here is something that, unlike the rest of the album, ought not to be taken
                    particularly seriously.<note place="foot" resp="author">A version recorded for

                        emphasis on the beat, and sometimes off it altogether. The result is an
                        elegiac, quite different song, but one in which the central resistance to
                        growing up remains.</note>
               </p>
               <p> And yet its central position in the track order suggests that “Kooks” does
                    matter, very much, and in what follows I will attempt to show why by reading it
                    as an instance of a Romantic child poem and by unpicking the Romantic child’s
                    relationship to creative and paternal authority. The song celebrates
                    unselfconscious childish innocence and joyful resistance of adult knowledge in
                    favour of an authentic native wisdom. That stance rests upon a central tenet of
                    the Romantic child ethos, which is the suspicion of, and downright resistance
                    to, formal education and socialization, as numerous Romantic critics have noted,
                    to very different interpretive ends. <note place="foot" resp="author">The
                        ‘fantasy versus reason’ debate is familiar enough that I do not need to
                        rehearse it extensively. In the hands of children’s literature scholars such
                        as Geoffrey Summerfield, Mary Jackson and, earlier in the twentieth century,
                        F. J. Harvey Darton, Percy Muir and Mary Thwaite, the Romantic child’s lack
                        of education represented the triumph of “fantasy over reason” (Summerfield
                        175) or “a revulsion among those of enlightened artistic and literary
                        predilections against an airless, inhumanly narrow view of the child’s mind”
                        (Jackson 191). To later critics such as Mitzi Myers, Judith Plotz, Andrew
                        O’Malley and Alan Richardson, who are influenced by the social and political
                        perspectives of feminist criticism and new historicism, the Romantic
                        discourse of childhood conceals a reactionary conservatism which uses the
                        state of childhood to retreat to “a conservative fantasy of an idyllic past”
                        rather than engage with the ambivalence and complexity of a socially and
                        industrially developing society (O’Malley 128). In this reading, the
                        Romantic child’s lack of education strips deprives them of agency and
                        ensures their economic and social subjugation.</note> The fifth book of
                        <emph>The Prelude</emph> famously conjures up the “monster birth” of “these
                    too industrious times”: this is a child who has been crammed with “learning and
                    books” at the expense of his visionary connection with nature (V:293–4; 319).
                    This product of a structured education system has become “no Child / But a dwarf
                    Man” (V:295–6) while: <quote>

                  </quote> The ultimate horror of the rational child, Wordsworth suggests here, is
                    its inability to value Nature’s gifts. The visionary access to the world which,
                    as the Intimations Ode says, all children claim as their birthright, is lost to
                    a brain “choked with grammars” (V:325).</p>
               <p> “Frost at Midnight” offers a hopeful vision of an alternative future. Drawing on
                    the same language of entrapment and freedom, it deplores Coleridge’s own
                    schooldays, “pent mid cloisters dim,” and revels instead in the “far other lore”
                    that his son Hartley shall know: the “lovely shapes and sounds intelligible” of
                    the landscapes he wanders through unhindered (52; 59–60). In both texts,
                    structured learning is an impediment to accessing creative potential and to true
                    insight. “Kooks” repeats this central idea, with Bowie telling his baby son, “if
                    you ever have to go to school / remember how they messed up this old fool.” Like
                    the education in nature Coleridge desires for Hartley, he imagines his son’s
                    freedom from the formal schooling that “messed” him up: “if the homework brings
                    you down / we’ll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown.”</p>
               <p> Another important aspect of the Romantic child is their social seclusion: the
                    Boy of Winander’s companions are the owls whose “mimic hootings” he repeats (l.
                    398); those of the little girl of “We Are Seven” are her dead brother and
                    sister. Dialogue with nature requires solitude; social exchange blocks the
                    child’s visionary interpretation. “Kooks” replicates this too; Bowie’s gift of
                    “a book of rules / of what to say to people when they pick on you” makes clear
                    that being a ‘kook’, with its attendant creative gifts, means social exclusion.
                    If this all sounds equally reminiscent of the much more recent counter-cultural
                    imperative to “turn on, tune in, and drop out,” it is worth thinking about the
                    importance of Blake to Ginsberg and Dylan, Wordsworth’s influence on Ray Davies,
                    and flower power’s pantheist overtones. The popular culture of the 1960s, as
                    Luke Walker notes, was heavily indebted to the Romantic poets (1). I want to
                    insist however that on <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> we can hear something other than
                    Romanticism as it was refracted through the 1960s. The discourse of Romantic
                    childhood which it engages can be read as a celebration of the child’s intuition
                    and inherent creativity—the “self-born carol”—but we can also read it as one
                    that seeks to hold off experience and induction into the social order for
                    reasons that have much more to do with the desires of the narrating adult than
                    the child who is addressed and written into being under the supervising eye of
                    the parent-author.</p>
               <p> In Wordsworth’s “We Are Seven,” the little girl’s ideality derives from her
                    inability to understand (and therefore her proximity to) death, and I think in
                    that poem we are asked to regard the increasingly frustrated speaker not just
                    with contempt but with profound suspicion. Alan Richardson observes that
                    “Wordsworthian children of nature . . . must die so early” because, “rooted in a
                    transcendental nature rather than culturally produced,” they are left
                    “unsocialised and frozen in a state of eternal innocence” (Richardson 1989,
                    861). In fact, they are aligned with death <emph>because</emph> they are
                    culturally produced. Richardson means that Wordsworth’s children always appear
                    isolated from society and cultural structures, but this overlooks the fact that
                    they are also produced as aesthetic objects that meet certain creative or
                    psychological needs of the author. Even as the little cottage girl gracefully
                    evades her interlocutor’s attempts to subjugate her worldview to his rational
                    scheme, the poet-narrator’s interrogation compels her to produces herself for
                    him as exactly what he really needs her to be: the death-marked Romantic child.
                    His self-conscious presence in the poem reminds us that we can only ever
                    approach a child in a Wordsworth poem through the poet’s mediating art. It is
                    their production as this aesthetic ideal, as art rather than something natural,
                    that the unavoidable death of the child in nature overwrites. Lucy’s fate, to be
                    “Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course / With rocks and stones and trees,” is
                    that of all immortal Wordsworthian children: bodily interment and disintegration
                    is not just the price of transcendent immateriality but the sign of an exchange
                    between death and art (ll. 7–8).</p>
               <p> The innocent creativity of the Romantic child is always forestalled by early
                    death because a condition of being a Romantic child is that their creative
                    potential cannot ever be realized. Wordsworth’s “To H. C., Six Years Old,” makes
                    this quite explicit: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">

                  </quote> Coleridge’s description of poetic genius, the ability “to
                    carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood” (IV.i.9),
                    suggests why. His definition sets up the child as an emotional and imaginative
                    repository to be drawn on for inspiration and consolation by the poet. The child
                    in the Romantic poem, therefore, can only be either the poet’s child self
                    encountered in memory or a figure that remains fixed in a perpetual childhood,
                    their creative threat neutralized. Viewed in these terms, the Romantic child
                    figure represents a psycho-creative anxiety of replacement: this figure can
                    produce no rival poems. When, as is the case for Coleridge and for the speaker
                    of “Kooks,” that authorship is complicated and overwritten by fatherhood, the
                    anxiety of replacement is magnified, engendering a more disturbing displacement
                    of biological child by textual creation. The generative ‘shalls’ of “Frost at
                    Midnight” make Hartley a doubly-produced child: his future path determined by
                    his father’s verse. “Kooks” may style its productive force as a question—“will
                    you stay?”—but like Coleridge’s commandments, the lyrics inscribe the son as a
                    future fellow kook. Bowie’s promotional notes hammer the point: “The baby was
                    born and it looked like me and it looked like Angie and the song came out
                    like—if you’re gonna stay with us you’re gonna grow up Bananas” (Bowie,
                        <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> promotional material). Non-kookiness means not
                    staying. It means not belonging to the father.</p>
               <p> “Frost at Midnight” and “Kooks” both show a father responding to a son’s birth
                    with another creative act, an implicitly competitive gesture. But these are also
                    texts that in both cases reproduce the child as a silent creation who possesses
                    no authorial power of his own. In “Frost at Midnight,” Hartley is not merely a
                    silent presence in the text, but is imagined by his father as always without the
                    means to articulate himself: though he’ll learn to read the “lovely shapes and
                    sounds intelligible of God in nature,” the only language Hartley is going to
                    learn is that which “God utters”—a language it would be blasphemy to speak (l.
                    61). As such, the poem imagines a perpetual infancy in which Hartley’s “silent
                    breathing” is the only possible—or desirable—communication (l. 7). “Kooks” is
                    framed as a one-sided dialogue, the chorus a repeated question that leaves no
                    opening for a reply: <quote>

                    kid, surely, who’s being romanced, seduced into an endless childhood through
                    that repeated entreaty to “stay” in the adults’ “story.” The speaker’s offer to
                    his son of his own extended “season of delight” conceals the fact he is
                    subordinate to the narrator’s personal narrative, one in which the author
                    remains the lover and the kook—the Romantic poet—and the child remains a child.</p>
               <p> The Oedipal threat, and the implicit violence of reifying one’s child into art
                    which “Frost at Midnight” dramatizes, reveals the problematic nature of the
                    adult desire for the child to remain a child. The question of whether this
                    desire might stem from something more personal than the politics of education
                    and the question of social progress is something to which criticism has paid
                    surprisingly little attention. The consequence has been that in texts such as
                    “Frost at Midnight” and “We Are Seven,” which dramatize this adult address to
                    and production of the ideal Romantic child, the extent to which these poems are
                    self-aware about that process has not really been acknowledged in the critical
                    urge to either condemn or to celebrate Romantic childhood. As James Holt
                    McGavran and Jennifer Daniel argue, scholarship which emphasizes the perceived
                    social and political disengagement of the Romantic child does not adequately
                    “recognize how deeply the sense of crisis—of repeated threats to children and
                    childhood across time, class, race and gender—is embedded in the Romantic
                    concept itself” (xv). Yet it is precisely that flickering self-awareness, the
                    way that Coleridge and Wordsworth poise a poem on the edge of admitting the fear
                    and jealousy the child raises whilst also acknowledging its ideality, that
                    “Kooks” engages, and that <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> as a whole responds to.</p>
               <p> Whether it is consciously understood as a Romantic tension or not, in
                        <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> Bowie puts this address to the child at the heart of
                    an album that that speaks insistently back to “Kooks”’s idealizations. In so
                    doing it reveals why, despite Bowie’s publicity statements, the relationship
                    between David Bowie the person and the speaker of “Kooks” is far from
                    straightforward. The performance works to bring out the ways in which the lyrics
                    ventriloquize this adult speaker who may well represent counter-cultural
                    freedom, but also doesn’t want the kid to grow up and become, as “Changes” has
                    it, “immune to your consultations.” There’s a neat congruence between the
                    subject and the arrangement—that simple 4:4 time, the childish-sounding piano
                    arrangement—which is missing from the other tracks. The coherence of form and
                    content almost seems designed to resist thought. Unlike “Life on Mars?” and “Oh!
                    You Pretty Things,” or “Fill Your Heart,” the listener is not required to unpick
                    the lyrics from the orchestrations. The speaker has a complex relationship to
                    Bowie: while the song was written as a response to the birth of Bowie’s
                    real-life son, he is also doing one of his voices on “Kooks.” Of course, he is
                    arguably always doing a voice, but this I think is a performatively insincere
                    voice. When he rolls his R’s on “brings you down,” we’re supposed to hear not
                    just a Bowie cipher speaking but a parody of parochial Englishness. It is a more
                    exaggerated version of Ray Davies’s vocal performance on <emph>The Kinks are The
                        Village Green Preservation Society</emph> (1968), an album with its own
                    ambivalent relationship to Romantic poetry, and to Wordsworth in particular. The
                    speaker of “We Are Seven” belongs to a text that wants to make fun of his
                    pedantry, and in a similar way Bowie’s vocal performance on “Kooks” works to
                    make the narrator sound old-fashioned and fussy, for all his carefree Romantic
                    intentions.</p>
               <p> It is the presence of this adult figure, and his Romantic conservatism
                    (although, like the Coleridge of “Frost at Midnight,” he’d never view himself as
                    a reactionary), that provides the album with a focal figure at which the rest of
                    the album’s anger and grim sense of prophecy can be directed. The opening track
                    makes this generational conflict central to the album. In “Changes,” the
                    children of the old generation are “trying to change their worlds,” exchanging
                    monolithic certainties for fragmentation and multiplicity, and the speaker turns
                    from his self-interrogations to admonish that listening parent figure: “Don’t
                    tell them to grow up and out of it.” It’s clear that a different kind of growing
                    up is stake when he asks, “Where’s your shame, you’ve left us up to our necks in
                    it”: growing up on those terms means exchanging adolescent rebellion for
                    acceptance of the status quo, rather than acquiring the social knowledge that
                    sparks the desire to create your own bespoke world. Teenaged anger at the social
                    and cultural inheritance left by the previous generation is repeated in various
                    ways across the album, but it comes into focus, and responds most directly to
                    “Kooks”’s performance of Romantic nostalgia in “Oh! You Pretty Things.”</p>
               <p> The track begins with a Blakean visionary awakening into a nightmare: “look out
                    my window, what do I see / a crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me.”
                    This vision, seemingly addressed to one of the pretty young things, seems to
                    prophesize a new social order, a “world to come.” In the present, “the earth is
                    a bitch, we’ve finished our news / Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use,” but
                    the future offers regenerative potential that is both exhilarating and
                    terrifying to the speaker: the “nightmares” are “here to stay.” In a move that
                    exemplifies the speakers’ ambiguous position as neither one of the “coming race”
                    nor their parents, he switches address between the first and second verse, so
                    that the song is addressed back to the parents: “look at your children, see
                    their faces in golden rays / don’t kid yourself they belong to you, they’re the
                    start of a coming race.” On the album version, Bowie sings this line in an
                    ambiguous way, with a slight pause after “yourself,” so that it could mean
                    “don’t be fooled that your children or the golden rays that illuminate them have
                    anything to do with you,” or it could mean, “don’t kid yourself, these rather
                    sinister Nietzschean super children are precisely your fault.” Either way, if
                    the coming age of “Homo Superior” promises hope or destruction, the cheerful,
                    bathetic chorus line “don’t you know you’re driving your mamas and papas insane”
                    makes plain how little the parent generation understands what is happening, or
                    what futures are at stake. The father of “Kooks” who wants his son to “stay in
                    our lovers’ story” here becomes the unknowing one, unable to see that the
                    children who rejected his call for eternal innocence are engaged in remaking the
                    world for their own purposes, rather than merely driving him insane.</p>
               <p> When <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> was released, Bowie’s notes on each of the tracks
                    were used as promotional material. This is the note for “Pretty Things”: “The
                    reaction of me to my wife being pregnant was archetypal daddy—Oh he’s gonna be
                    another Elvis. This song is all that plus a dash of sci-fi” (Bowie, <emph>Hunky
                        Dory</emph> promotional material). If the song records at one level a
                    father’s sense that his child will, and should, eclipse him, then “Kooks” offers
                    an interesting corollary. It is a narrative in which the speaker’s son is not
                    part of “the coming race” and he and his generation have not “outgrown their
                    use,” but rather imagines a perpetual summer of love in which, crucially, the
                    new Elvis cannot displace him creatively. The resonance between those two tracks
                    reflects the Romantic anxiety of replacement I described in “Frost at Midnight’”
                    and in Wordsworth’s dead Romantic children, an anxiety which finds release in
                    the act of fixing the child in text. In an interview with <emph> Melody Maker
                    </emph> shortly after the album’s release, Bowie described his work as analogous
                    to psychotherapy: “my act is my couch” (Watts).</p>
               <p> But offering the text and its performance up as analysand’s narrative marshals
                    the listener into a private reading while also concealing both the cultural work
                    the song does and its historical sense. To suggest the song is a straightforward
                    conduit into his inner psychology is a characteristically misleading piece of
                    Bowie commentary. Like Wordsworth and Coleridge’s constructions of Romantic
                    childhood, “Kooks” encodes its own fissures, wearing the signs of a strained
                    artifice. The speaker is not or does want to be aware that his personal and
                    cultural moment is drawing to a close; his repeated entreaty to “stay” is
                    symptomatic of his refusal to confront both his son’s eventual adulthood and his
                    own creative displacement by the harsher art of the new pretty things. As an
                    album, <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> belongs to that new generation. It dramatizes the
                    gaze of the child back at the texts and cultural monuments of their parents, and
                    the ways in which they find those monuments wanting. “Kooks”’s position at the
                    album’s center directs our attention to its tonal incongruity, while Bowie’s
                    shapeshifting acts (from nostalgic dad to furious teenager to dispassionate
                    narrator) suggest that he’s ultimately on the side of experience, not innocence.</p>
               <p> As I said at this essay’s outset, childhood and parenthood are doubled concepts
                    in the Romantic poem, and they are on <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> , too. If “Kooks”
                    subconsciously articulates an Oedipal struggle between the poet-father and his
                    text-son that is intensely personal, it also dramatizes a publicly-oriented
                    reactionary adult incursion into teenaged self-awakening that brings into focus
                    the rest of the album’s call to “wake up, sleepyhead.” As Shelton Waldrep notes,
                    from <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> onwards, “Bowie quickly established himself and his
                    songs as anti-sixties, pro-seventies anthems for the doomed youth of the future”
                    (106). <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> seems eerily prescient about the ways in which
                    the revolutionary optimism of the 1960s would in the 70s be replaced by economic
                    stagnation and social unrest on both sides of the Atlantic. The utopian visions
                    of the 1960s, personified by “Kooks” Romantically-inclined narrator, must have
                    felt distant and naïve to those who came of age in the decade after Woodstock.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Hunky Dory</emph> describes a cultural shift from a Romantic idealism, one
                    in which Major Tom can look in awe at the beauty of “Planet Earth,” unifying the
                    human race through his gaze from “one hundred thousand miles,” to a social order
                    characterized by fragmentation and pop culture’s demand for performance, in
                    which, as “Life on Mars?” has it, we are each the stars of “the freakiest” and
                    “the best-selling show,” trapped in endless representation (“it’s about to be
                    writ again”). In this vision, rather than gaze back approvingly at ourselves
                    from afar, we are instead strangers to each other and ourselves, looking
                    outwards for aliens. This bears comparison I think with another
                    post-revolutionary comedown. After the Battle of Waterloo, the Romantic
                    counter-culture movement also gave way to a more cynical and conservative
                    pervading spirit. Victor Nemoianu called the post-1815 period one which
                    registered “the social and spiritual shock of the preceding age,” manifested in
                    both a “feeling of chaos” and a therapeutic interest in the family, in
                    empiricism and factual precision and in history (14–6; 30). A new generation of
                    authors, some of whom, like Hartley and Sara Coleridge, had to contend with
                    their father’s textualizations of their child selves, like the disenchanted
                    teenaged voices of <emph>Hunky Dory</emph>, saw that their parents’ generation’s
                    experiment had failed to turn radical enthusiasm into the promised better world.
                    The conservative decades of the 1820s and 1830s, like the 1970s and 1980s, would
                    require new forms of protest and new forms of art. The nihilism of punk, disco,
                    and new wave appear on the face of it to articulate creative identities that
                    stood apart from the utopian aesthetics of their precursors more successfully
                    than Romanticism’s direct inheritors were able to find sufficiently new forms of
                    expression. Yet Romanticism proved a resilient set of ideas in both centuries,
                    able to survive both Europe’s bitter struggle towards representative democracy
                    in the 1830s and the depredations of free market economics, and it remains the
                    structuring discourse for how we think and feel about childhood. The baby of
                    “Kooks” and the sleeping Hartley of “Frost at Midnight” retain an emotional
                    force that manages to transcend scepticism about their parents’ motives,
                    encoding our ambivalent collective cultural investment in the idea of the
                    eternal child.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay seeks to demonstrate how David Bowie’s (New)
                        Romantic project engaged with spatial understandings that were first embedded in
                        poetic practices in early-nineteenth-century Britain. Building on Samuel Taylor
                        Coleridge’s—fundamentally spatial—concept of the “I AM,” this essay suggests that
                        spatial readings of Bowie’s “Major Tom” series can help us to echolocate innovative
                        forms of (New) Romantic identities. More than this, it argues that reading Bowie’s
                        tracks in light of Romantic concepts might assist in our ongoing project to engage
                        with and respond to earlier works in ways that productively bring modern
                        technological and spatial experiences to bear on historical literatures.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>In his sonnet “The Poet,” published in the <emph>North of England Magazine</emph> in February 1842, Hartley Coleridge
                mused that the poet “smit with love of fame” must accept their own vanishing. In a
                sense, Hartley pushed a Keatsian negative capability to its logical conclusion: the
                poet’s inevitable fate is to become, like Ovid’s Echo, “a nothing, save a voice, a
                name, / Which lives, when other voices give it birth” (91). Indeed, according to
                Hartley it is only in this extreme form of containment—a synecdochal reduction from
                body to voice—that the poet can hope for expansive influence. The poet’s very
                identity is expressed in the echo between the poetic self and the wider world, and
                particularly between the poet’s work and repetitions of it.</p>
                  <p>How this same relationship between space, echo, and
                identity operates in David Bowie’s corpus—and how it can be better understood when
                read through and as Romanticism—is what I want to explore in this essay. When Bowie
                reflected on his creative relationship with Tony Visconti—the producer with whom he
                worked intermittently from his second album in 1969 until his last in 2016—he
                concluded that what made their collaboration so effective was that they knew
                “between [them], how to landscape a song and give it a real place, an identity and a
                character” (qtd. in Pareles). This landscaping generated lyric and sonic spaces that
                encourage a “collapse” of the boundaries between artist and listener, track and
                text, song world and real world (Cinque, Moore, and Redmond 4). Bowie’s works, in
                short, deployed odd relationships to and in space as complex metaphors through which
                to explore the connection between the self and the wider world.</p>
                  <p>To investigate how Bowie deploys spatiality to explore a
                form of (New) Romantic selfhood, I focus on one of his most iconic, and most
                Romantic, characters: Major Tom, the enigmatic spaceman who appears both in Bowie’s
                early music of the late sixties and—paratextually at least—on his last album. By
                tracing Major Tom’s evolution throughout Bowie’s corpus—from “Space Oddity,” through
                “Ashes to Ashes” and “Hallo Spaceboy,” to “Blackstar”—I demonstrate how his
                metamorphosis is registered most strongly in (New) Romantic spatial oddities. In
                tracing these synergies, my aim is to demonstrate how Bowie’s (New) Romanticism
                engaged with spatial understandings that became embedded in poetic practice in early
                nineteenth-century Britain.</p>
                  <p>More than this, though, I want to indicate the ways in
                which (re-)reading Bowie in light of Romanticism also asks us to re-assess some of
                our thinking about the Romantics, wherein ‘New Romanticism’ is not simply a
                descendent of Romanticism proper, but offers something of its own back. That is to
                say, considering Bowie’s material as a descendent of Romantic poetry asks us to
                reconsider how we respond to those earlier texts and highlights these earlier works
                as the products of a similarly rich perceptual field to that which inspired Bowie.
                Bowie’s corpus emphasizes a kind of multi-sensory perception that, as Barish Ali and
                Heidi Wallace astutely note, disrupts “the boundaries between author, text, audience
                and culture” (263). The unsettling of these boundaries is a distinctively Romantic
                concern, and returning to Romanticism via Bowie highlights the importance of paying
                attention to embodied creativity. In particular, Bowie emphasises sound’s role in
                negotiating the relationship between the self and the world in ways that have often
                remained underappreciated in Romantic-era works—although this neglect has begun to
                be rectified in recent years.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Angela Leighton’s recent study <emph>Hearing Things: The Work of Sound in Literature</emph> has adeptly explored how sound functions as a
                                literary device from the late Romantics onward, but the importance
                                of sound as a Romantic historical and literary phenomenon has been
                                considered recently by scholars including Matthew Rowney, Michele
                                Speitz and Susan Wolfson (see Works Cited for the relevant
                                publications). I have also written on this topic elsewhere (see
                                “Echoes in the Mountains: The Romantic Lake District’s
                                Soundscape”).</note> To align these issues, I want to
                suggest that Bowie drew on the imaginative possibilities of notions about contained
                expansion that emerged in—and, I think, were fundamental for understandings
                of—Romantic literature. The imaginative possibilities of contained space found their
                most powerful expression in the use of the echo as trope and metaphor for the (New)
                Romantic creative self.</p>

                  <head>Coleridge and Bowie’s “great I Am”</head>
                  <p>The most strident definition of selfhood in the Romantic
                period depends precisely on the interplay between containment and expansion that
                Hartley Coleridge and David Bowie identify as being core to expressions of
                individual identity. Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s concept of the Imagination depended
                upon motion within a contained space. At its most successful, the Imagination could
                queer the boundaries between subject and object. The wealth of scholarly
                interpretations of Coleridge’s theories of the Imagination and the “I Am”
                notwithstanding, little attention has been paid to the fact that Coleridge conceived
                of the Imagination as an essentially spatial construct.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jonathan Wordsworth offers a helpful overview of the most prescient of interpretations up to the mid-1980s.</note>
                Imagination was a mode that facilitated a self-discovery based upon what Helen
                Vendler terms “lyric intimacy”; it depended for its origins on circumscribed
                boundaries, and it was the transgressing of those borders which revealed
                self-knowledge. The primary Imagination was a form of motion that operated through
                the movement of the “finite mind” within the “infinite I AM”
                (<emph>Biographia</emph> I:304), by which Coleridge
                meant “spirit, self, and self-consciousness”
                (<emph>Biographia</emph> I:273). The primary
                Imagination depended, in other words, upon an interplay between containment in the
                finite and expansion into the infinite.</p>
                  <p>The secondary Imagination, meanwhile, was the “echo” of the
                primary: it “dissolves, diffuses, dissipates in order to recreate” (<emph>Biographia</emph> I: 304). Jonathan Wordsworth thinks that this
                phrasing is proof that the secondary Imagination was less important for Coleridge
                than the primary; he finds that the word “echo” suggests a “diminishment” (75). Yet,
                in this instance, the echo’s diffusion does not necessarily render the effect
                weaker; in fact, Coleridge thought that this diffusion caused an erasure of the
                boundary between the self and God, allowing them to blend together. At its most
                successful—the generation of “the absolute I AM”—the Imagination could lead to a
                discovery of the divine in the self, and the self in the divine. And the echo—the
                    “<emph>act of writing itself</emph>,” as Wordsworth interprets it
                (83)—linked this divine self to the rest of Creation; Coleridge concluded his
                “Literary Life” with the thought that the “filial WORD” of “the great I AM” created
                a “choral echo [which] is the universe” (<emph>Biographia</emph> II:
                    247–8). Here, it is not just the poet’s voice that
                lives through other voices; God himself depends for his influence on the echoes
                created by individual voices and texts. As Denis Flannery suggests is the case for
                Bowie’s sounds, the Coleridgean Imagination is a force that can “queer” the limits
                of the self, leading to new understandings of the individual’s sense of identity and
                relationship to the cosmos.</p>
                  <p>Bowie’s version of the “I Am” is inherited from Maurice
                Merleau-Ponty, who Coleridge anticipated in believing
                that the “I Am” cannot be
                demarcated. Instead, it “moves outwards” to provide personal, phenomenological
                definition to the physical, moral, and historical worlds (Merleau-Ponty ix). It has
                seemed to a number of Bowie scholars that this move outwards is indicative of a form
                of liminality that translates into a loss of selfhood. Ian Chapman finds that
                liminality indicates Bowie’s perpetual fear about a such a loss (2015), whilst
                Nicholas Greco conceives of Bowie’s liminal space as a kind of labyrinth: Bowie
                “enters into it and is lost,” he thinks (164). But what Greco and Chapman interpret
                as liminality is, in Bowie’s own terms, a “third dimension” (Yentob 1975). It is a
                queer landscape, located between the borders of established spaces, which translates
                a loss of selfhood into something more like an excess of it. Yet—as I want to
                demonstrate in the remainder of this essay—Bowie recalls Coleridge in foregrounding
                the role of the echo in the discovery of the “I Am.” In Bowie’s works, the echo is
                the principal means of communicating this new idea of the “I Am”; it opens out new
                possibilities for the individual to diffuse and diffract into what Shelton Waldrep
                calls “performances of self.”</p>

                  <head>Echolocation and (New) Romanticism</head>
                  <p>When Drew Daniel writes that sound—“<emph>not
                    music</emph>,” he clarifies, “<emph>but sound</emph>”—is uniquely able
                to queer the boundaries between individual, community, and environment, he posits a
                theory of listening that is fundamentally indebted to the kind of Romantic imaginary
                I have been outlining. By its very nature, Daniel argues, sound operates through a
                disruption of the boundaries between inside and outside. Sound can reinforce our
                sense of individuality through its creation of a personal sonic experience, but what
                Daniel calls the “promiscuous open-ness of the ear” means that “[s]ound intrudes
                upon us with the fact of the world.” Listening itself, in this reading, becomes a
                form of contained expansion, whereby intrusion “affords us the possibility of
                forgetting . . . attachments to our subjective particularity and affiliation and
                instead forces us to register the everywhere of an ongoing being, an outside where
                we thought there was no outside.” Sound, meanwhile, becomes a unique way of
                communicating both the tensions and affinities between the individual and a
                “perceptual community” that links us to “the world beyond that community.” In short,
                Daniel concludes, sound “blurs the edges” of the self.</p>
                  <p>Daniel believes this process to be specific to sound,
                rather than music—or, at least, recorded music—because the kind of queerness he
                describes relies upon the true experience of what he calls an “immanent occasion”;
                since recording fixes a certain sound in place, it removes the possibility for sonic
                spontaneity that Daniel sees as central to sound’s inherent queerness. But what not
                even recording music can do is to fix the affect it produces in the listener—and, in
                Romantic thinking, it was affect that distinguished music from sound. John Ruskin,
                for instance, drew on the philosophies of Plato and Hesiod when he clarified in <emph>Fors Clavigera</emph> (1875) that “the Greeks only called ‘Music’
                the kind of sound which induced right moral feeling . . . and any other kind of
                sound than that, however beautiful to the ear or scientific in composition, they did
                not call ‘Music’” (261). The recognition of such feelings relied on a listener
                trained in the art of translating a sonic “impulse on the organ” into an
                “observation of the mind.” The physical quality of sound, and the ability to hear
                it, was only part of the point, as Ruskin explained in “The Queen of the Air”
                (1869):
            <quote>It is
                    quite true that the tympanum of the ear vibrates under sound, and that the
                    surface of the water in a ditch vibrates too: but the ditch hears nothing for
                    all that; and my hearing is still to me as blessed a mystery as ever, and the
                    interval between the ditch and me, quite as great. If the trembling sound in my
                    ears was once of the marriage bell which began my happiness, and is now of the
                    passing bell which ends it, the difference between those two sounds to me cannot
                    be counted by the number of concussions. (354)</quote>
            Ruskin acknowledges something that Daniel risks
                overlooking: that both sound and music can mean something different at every
                encounter, a reflection of the influence that social codes and personal
                circumstances have on the act of listening. Ruskin acknowledges the role of feeling
                in listening: he concludes that music is a combination of the soundwave with the
                listener’s affective response to it. In this sense, music becomes sound properly
                interpreted. It is this kind of slippage between sound and music with which Bowie’s
                corpus plays; in seeking to affect his listener’s space as much as to communicate a
                track-specific sonic world, Bowie floats in a most peculiar way between, as Denis
                Flannery observes, “recognition and anonymity, the cohering force of music and the
                dissolving, queering effect of sound” (159). Bowie’s material mediates between
                coherence and dissolution, and between sound and music, in part through the careful
                ways in which it was landscaped to communicate a sense of spatiality through both
                his lyrics and the record’s sonic formation of space. Bowie’s aim was not to induce
                a Ruskinian “right moral feeling”; rather, these tracks created a contained space in
                which feeling—as a changeable, mutable experience—could be explored as the
                centre-point of a form of individualism which acknowledged that individuality need
                not be fixed.</p>
                  <p>This is, perhaps, particularly true of “Space Oddity,”
                which self-consciously marks out a form of soundbox, a musicological concept that
                visualises music as a four-dimensional model and attempts, as Ruth Dockwray and
                Allan F. Moore explain, to map the “locations of sound sources in recordings” (182).
                It offers a way of “conceptualizing the textural space that a recording inhabits, by
                enabling us to literally hear recordings taking space” (Moore 30) and creates a
                visualization that allows the analyst to ask where particular sounds appear to be
                coming from (Figure 1). The soundbox is envisaged as a contained space, but there
                are two key ways of enlarging it: reverberation and echo (Moore 46). Peter Doyle has
                written extensively about the generic differences between these two effects but, to
                summarise drastically, he defines reverberation as something that seems to continue
                a sound, whilst an echo repeats it. John Hollander offers a nuance to this
                definition in his study of figurative echoes in poetry after Milton, when he notes
                that the distinction is partly temporal: echoes reach the ear approximately
                one-fifteenth of a second after reverberations thanks to the fact that an echo must
                travel to and from a reflective surface (1). Before sound recording technologies
                were developed in the mid-nineteenth century, echoes—“and,” Hollander writes,
                “perhaps parrots”—were the only real means of perpetuating sound (1–2).</p>

                  <p>Doyle thinks that the echo is especially tricky to
                interpret, because it leads us “further into the area of connotation.” In “teasing .
                . . meanings out,” he thinks, “we run the risk of overinterpreting, or of
                misreading” (14). In this reading, the echo might be a key part of a song’s
                transition into a text. By the 1960s, echoes—and their counterpart,
                reverberation—were a standard element of pop music. Doyle shows how music from this
                period—building on the rockabilly, rock n roll, and jazz traditions of the 1940s and
                50s (under the influence of which Bowie grew up)—took advantage of stereo recording,
                and the possibilities for echo and reverb it afforded, to make spatiality “a new
                component in the musical totality” (5). The studio space in which these effects were
                created was particularly suggestive (Doyle 6); it is, perhaps, the ultimate symbol
                from this era of the creative possibilities afforded by enclosure. Phil Spector’s
                “Wall of Sound”—a mode of production that foregrounded the interplay between an
                exaggerated musical texture and the close confinement of the studio—is perhaps the
                best-known use of this new space (Moorefield 11–2). For Doyle, as for Oliver Read
                and Walter Welch, this new sense of sonic spatiality was fundamentally Romantic; it
                was, they think, Romanticism which brought “the listener into the studio or
                auditorium” (377). The echo became an important element in communicating a Romantic
                “world-creating demiurge” (Doyle 58). As a phenomenon entirely dependent on
                containment, the echo was particularly suggestive of a “sublime dreamed world”
                conjured by the artist (Doyle 5).</p>
                  <p>The echo is a record—or a “memory,” as Sean Street terms
                it—of sound’s interactions with the environment (3). Formed by soundwaves’
                reflections from a surface, an echo depends for its formation on a degree of
                containment, but its repetitions of a sound event make it a vehicle for a sense—both
                physical and imaginative—of vastness. The echo exaggerates what George Revill
                identifies as the core properties of heard sounds by giving “embodied sensation to
                properties of depth, distance and proximity” (247). Echoes or reverberations—and the
                related concept of resonance—each emphasise an ecological relationship between sound
                and listener, but the echo’s relationship to space makes it distinctive. As
                Hollander explains,</p>
                  <p>[i]n modern discourse, the word <emph>echo</emph> is used figuratively to indicate a musical or linguistic
                    repetition, usually of a short utterance or the terminal portion of a longer
                    one, with the additional qualification that the repeated sound is not only
                    contingent upon the first, but in some way a qualified version of it.(3)</p>
                  <p>What Hollander does not explicitly acknowledge, though, is
                that these qualifications are both figurative and physical: an echo returns a weaker
                version of the original sound—a kind of “speaking silence,” as Christina Rossetti
                memorably termed it (314). Each repetition of an image or idea alters the original
                in some way that develops or complicates its meaning. An echo also changes the way
                sound is perceived in space, transforming it from a mono-directional entity into a
                multi-directional experience. That makes conceiving of a track’s soundbox more
                difficult; the artist who deploys the echo deliberately complicates what Drew Daniel
                might call the locatability of the sonic experience. By challenging a sound source’s
                identity in these ways, the echo might also effect an ontological shift from music
                back to sound.</p>
                  <p>Such performances of unlocatability thus emphasise what
                Daniel calls “the queerness of sound”; since the echo is in itself based on
                dissolution and diffusion, it is in itself a queer—and queering—experience. Daniel
                takes this concept further by suggesting that sound might help us to “echolocate the
                edges of subjection.” This is a powerful metaphor for thinking about the (New)
                Romantic self. Echolocation, a natural cartographic tool that situates the
                individual within their environment, becomes in Daniel’s reading an ecological
                process that both reinforces an individual’s private subjectivity and positions them
                as part of a system that might be local, national or global. But it was in Romantic
                writing that the echo became a particularly potent metaphor for creativity as well
                as a popular means through which to explore new places: Goethe’s and Rousseau’s
                enjoyment of the Venetian gondoliers’ echoing voices was just one instance of the
                echo’s important role in personal understandings of space and spatiality (Agnew
                73–4). By the Victorian period, sound, soundwaves, and echoes were widely enough
                understood concepts to feature prominently in popular advertising campaigns and the
                works of influential authors, not least Charles Dickens, George Eliot (Picker 8–10),
                and—as we have already seen—Hartley Coleridge.</p>
                  <p>A century later, when Bowie too was asking “who are we / So
                small in times such as these” (“Slow Burn”), advancements in sound technologies
                offered portals through which to explore tensions between personal space and global
                spatiality. Peter Doyle goes so far as to associate the fascination with space in
                music, witnessed throughout the 1960s, with the new-found portability of what he
                calls “virtual spatiality” that the development of stereo equipment had facilitated
                (6). As Bowie discovered, these technologies meant that sound could be employed both
                metaphorically and literally to explore the individual artist or listener’s
                connection to the world around them. One answer to that question—who are we?—posits
                that, for Bowie(as for Simon and Garfunkel) the “echoes in tenement halls” might
                hold some important answers.</p>
                  <p>The possibilities communicated by the physical echo, and
                held open by the imaginative one, are brought together in Bowie’s penultimate
                release, “Blackstar.” “Blackstar” alternates between declaring all the things that
                Bowie is not—a film star, a pop star, a marvel star—and what he is: a Blackstar,
                which Bowie’s vocals confirm when he echoes the mantra. This is a subversive,
                playful echo: the main vocalist repeats the backing vocals, rather than the other
                way around. The interplay between the two marks out a sonic third space, in the
                middle of which is what the lyrics label “the great I Am.” The line is adapted, via
                Merleau-Ponty and Coleridge, from God’s declaration to Moses: “I am who I am”
                (Exodus 3:14). Bowie turns this into a playful declaration of precisely the kind of
                blending between the human and the divine which Coleridge had mused upon. “The great
                I Am,” here, is a rebuttal to the previous line’s summary of his early critics’
                dismissals: “you’re a flash in the pan.” When Bowie responds by declaring himself to
                be “the great I Am,” it is a Coleridgean claim for creative, poetic greatness that
                celebrates the slipperiness of (New) Romantic selfhood: the “Great I Am” can be the
                “I Am” of a great many things.</p>

                  <head>Odd Spatiality in “Space Oddity”</head>
                  <p>“Space Oddity” was Bowie’s “antidote to space fever” (qtd.
                in Doggett 53). The dystopian consequences of humanity’s expansion into outer space
                had been starkly imagined in Stanley Kubrick’s
                <emph>2001: A Space Odyssey</emph> (1968). This was
                the film that inspired Bowie’s track, and “Space Oddity” also communicates a
                profound ambivalence towards the space race. The song’s tone appears to have been
                missed by some of its early listeners, though; it was first aired on the BBC,
                apparently without irony, during TV coverage of the moon landing on 20 July 1969
                (Doggett 53). Nevertheless, this event marked “Space Oddity” as the anthem for new
                forms of questioning about earth-bound and extra-terrestrial individualisms. It does
                so by immersing the listener in the dialectics of contained expansion that “Space
                Oddity” both describes and, through its deployment of complex narrative and
                structural echoes, enacts. These echoes foreground the track’s interest in
                spatiality, as well as space, and—in Doyle’s terms, inspired by Gilles Deleuze and
                Félix Guattari—makes its “territorial project fully explicit” (17): this is
                somewhere the “I Am” might be discovered.</p>

                  <p>“Space Oddity” imagines the journey of one astronaut, Major
                Tom, into outer space. This endeavour turns Tom into a celebrity—“the papers” become
                desperate to know “whose shirts [he] wear[s]”—but Tom ultimately rejects this
                exaggerated celebration of consumer-centred individualism; he leaves the capsule
                and, bidding farewell to his wife, disconnects from Ground Control to float away
                from both the technologies and peoples that bind him to earth. This journey is
                echoed in the track’s musical structure, which Brad Erickson thinks “models escape
                from terrestrial confinement” (564–5): the way it fades out at the end seems to
                follow Major Tom’s floating away into space. The effect, as Peter Doggett poetically
                puts it, is to “[leave] the listener uncertain where they might touch down” (56).
                For Michael Mooradian Lupro, on the other hand, Major Tom’s disappearance into space
                offers more than a sense of freedom: it indicates the character’s embracing of
                “difference” as he willingly moves into “a place unbound by terrestrial norms of
                comportment and expression” (14). The narrative and structure both reinforce this
                odd sense of the individual’s dissolution into an unknown space.</p>
                  <p>But “Space Oddity” does not just mimic the space
                experienced by Major Tom. As Lupro puts it, Major Tom “intertwines with our
                understanding of what it might be like to exist as a real human being in real space”
                (14). The track’s auditory space becomes the listener’s tin can, and it inscribes a
                sonic orbit around the listener that enfolds them into a space that blends the
                fictional song world with their real one. The way the track fades in at the
                beginning and out again at the end positions the listener alongside Tom as the
                centre of its journey. In Ken McLeod’s words, it “mediates our internal space
                (feelings, desires, dreams) with external space (the physical, the experienced)”
                (337). It encourages the listener to make the same discovery as Major Tom: that
                ultimate freedom might arise out of extreme containment.</p>
                  <p>This spatiality operates through the technologies the song
                employs as much as those which support Major Tom’s journey: for “Space Oddity,”
                Bowie insisted—against his producer’s advice—on a recording technique that was still
                rare in the late 1960s, and which emphasizes the song’s intent to contain the
                listener in a space of its own. Throughout the track, Bowie’s voice shifts, as Lupro
                explains, “from singular centred to multiple stereo” (20). The effect, Ali and
                Wallace argue, is to transform Bowie’s voice into “both subject and object of its
                own enunciations” (275). When those shifts occur is crucial: the first line is
                spoken by a single voice: that of one person in Ground Control. Bowie’s voice splits
                in the second line; a low-pitched voice sings in the listener’s right ear and is
                doubled by one singing an octave higher in their left. When the countdown begins,
                this higher voice becomes the countdown, leaving its companion to continue
                communicating with the astronaut. The effect is to place the listener alongside
                Major Tom inside the capsule, surrounded by Ground Control’s plural commanding
                voices. This doubling is echoed imperfectly when we first hear from Major Tom; to
                begin with, the voice is singular, but as he steps “through the door” it splits as
                Ground Control’s had done. So far, Major Tom and his controllers are in line with
                each other. But when Major Tom notices how “very different” the stars look from this
                angle, and locates himself in this queer space—“for here am I”—the vocals alter:
                now, the lower-pitched voice comes from the left. For Lupro, these stereo vocals
                resituate Major Tom from a celebrity—an extreme form of individualistic
                selfhood—into “a universal cosmopolitan speaking uneasily for, of, and to,
                multiplicitous positions” (20). This echo indicates a subtle, yet significant, shift
                in Tom’s sense of identity.</p>
                  <p>This change occurs as Tom begins to feel the effects of
                anti-gravitational forces; he finds himself “floating in a most peculiar way.” But
                this peculiarity is made ambiguous by Bowie’s mode of singing the line—adding a
                syllable so that it actually sounds like Tom is “floating in a most a-peculiar way.”
                In this way, the line holds the potential both for oddness and normalcy (Flannery
                161; Lupro 20). In either case, Tom finds that his mode of perception is altered:
                “the stars look very different” from this angle. This new form of motion, as
                Flannery perceptively observes, “involves a massive change, either in the world(s)
                around one or in the way in which that world is apprehended, or in a fusion, always
                theatrical, of both” (161).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lupro, by contrast, thinks that floating becomes mundane over the course of the song.</note>
                It holds the possibility for multiple versions of the future. Initially, Tom
                situates himself within an exaggeratedly everyday earthly object in a way that
                highlights his affinity with his home planet: “here am I sitting in a tin can / far
                above the world.” Yet, there is an echo in the line that indicates a subtle shift in
                meaning: “I Am” becomes “am I.” The shift is significant: “am I” contains the
                potential for plurality, in a way that the more definitive “I Am” may not. Just as
                each echo subtly changes the expression of an initial sound, offering multiple
                experiences of the same root source, so do “Space Oddity”’s lyrics encode the
                possibility that Major Tom might encode multiple selves. As soon as Major Tom steps
                through the door, his confident declarations of selfhood invert, and that odd
                formulation indicates a new fluidity in his terrestrial sense of self. An implied
                question—am I?—hovers with Tom around the space ship. The second time the line is
                repeated, Tom provides a different locus for his sense of identity; now, Tom
                expresses ownership over the tin can, and positions himself not in relation to
                earth, but to the moon. The fact that “planet earth is blue / and there’s nothing I
                can do” is no longer, in this second utterance, merely a statement of fact, but an
                acknowledgement of individual impotence in the face of a global
                problem—environmental degradation—and the individualistic human condition.</p>
                  <p>It is while he’s floating in this way that Major Tom is
                able to echolocate a mappable point. Doggett thinks that the guitar solo that offers
                an interlude in the interstellar conversation between Tom and Ground Control “seemed
                to be testing out the walls of Major Tom’s prison” (56). Certainly, it is in this
                break that Tom seems to undergo the “sort of transformation” that Niall Boyce
                believes befalls him (528). Tom’s floating has caused him to re-evaluate his
                relationship to Ground Control and the society they represent. When Ground Control
                loses contact with their astronaut, their panic is evident in the high-pitched
                stereo vocals through which they repeatedly ask: “Can you hear me?” This question
                morphs into Major Tom’s declaration that he is “here.” This echo, from “hear” to
                “here,” indicates the discovery of a space in which Bowie can echolocate a new sense
                of identity for Major Tom that is predicated on the relationship between space,
                sound, and listening. His “floating” no longer seems peculiar, but rather allows him
                to affect a reversal of the earlier containment: now, it is he who encircles the
                spaceship. It is at this moment that Tom’s understanding of the “I Am” alters: this
                is when he becomes—to adapt Coleridge’s terms—a finite being moving in infinite
                space. It’s at this moment, too, that the grand-sounding “capsule” becomes nothing
                more than a “tin can,” while Tom stops aligning himself with the terrestrial
                community and begins to consider himself a space oddity.</p>
                  <p>Major Tom’s metamorphosis is registered most strongly
                through alterations in this spatial relationship between Tom and the tin can,
                between inside and outside, and between the “I Am” and “I Am Not.” The “unearthly”
                stereo vocals, alongside what McLeod calls the “series of atonal and rhythmically
                irregular tape effects and electronic squelches in combination with an ethereal
                string section” (341), emphasise how queer—or how odd—space itself is in this track.
                It highlights the ways Major Tom feels himself to be different from the people he
                has left behind. Tom’s sense of alienation, resulting in what Lupro believes is a
                “metaphorical <emph>social</emph> suicide” (22),
                seems like the logical extreme of the individualism from which he excludes himself.
                In a sense, Major Tom rejects individualism in order to embrace his own
                individuality. As Tom’s afterlives suggest, however, this kind of anti-social action
                is not considered a virtue by the community on the blue earth.</p>

                    Tom</head>
                  <p>Bowie’s final performance of the 1970s was of “Space
                Oddity” on
                <emph>Kenny Everett’s New Year’s Eve Show</emph> in
                the UK and <emph>Dick Clarke’s Salute to the Seventies</emph> in the US.
                Doggett reads this moment as the dissembling of a key Bowie myth in the face of a
                new age of Thatcherite social conservatism:
            <quote>The oddity was no longer the individual
                    ostracised from society but, in the Britain of Thatcher’s government, the person
                    who still dared to believe in the power of collective action and the ability of
                    society to care for all of its members, however alienated they might be.
                    (309)</quote>
            The kind of (New) Romantic identity that attempted to
                negotiate the relationship between individual and society seemed to be dead. In its
                place was a philosophy that valorised individualism but suspected individuality.
                Major Tom’s fate was illustrative of the damaging effects of the ostracization to
                which this new age might lead. Bowie’s performance of the track indicated that it
                was no longer only a space-age anthem; it was also a powerful metaphor for a drug
                culture that emphasised what might happen when an individual collided with the
                social order.</p>
                  <p>When Bowie performed “Space Oddity” on <emph>Kenny Everett</emph>, his performance indicated a shift in the way that Major
                Tom’s declaration of individuality might be read. The prolonged silence after Ground
                Control sends “God’s love” to Tom allows Bowie to cross the stage from acoustic
                guitar to piano, but also leaves a significant emptiness in which Tom, we imagine,
                lifts off alone. In this version, Tom is disconnected both from Ground Control and,
                when he arrives at his orbit, from space itself: now, Tom tells Ground Control that
                he is simply “floating far above the moon.” He seems, now, not to be actually in
                space, but rather to be experiencing the kind of lonely drug trip with which Bowie’s
                jerky movements, twitching face and anxious posture—moving between sets with his
                arms tightly folded—suggest familiarity. More than this, Bowie performs the song on
                a stage made to look like the padded room of an asylum. The performance suggested an
                alternative fate for Major Tom. He had not, in the manner of Bowie’s other guises,
                been artistically killed off; rather, he metamorphoses yet again from a
                spaceman-turned-alien into an earth-bound, if delusional, junkie who retrospectively
                anticipates the Thin White Duke.</p>
                  <p>After this, Major Tom became one of Bowie’s most
                distinctive and long-lasting echoes—but each time he appears, in the true nature of
                an echo, he seems to get weaker. John Hollander calls this characteristic the echo’s
                “decaying dynamics,” and it is an apt metaphor for Major Tom (3). After “Space
                Oddity,” Major Tom’s identity—his sense of the “I Am”—seems to diminish as the
                echoes fade. Doyle might add that this effect renders the echo incapable of
                communicating a solid sense of identity; at some point, the echo is “spread too
                thinly to ‘hold’ the territory” (18). Tom never speaks for himself again after
                “Space Oddity,” but others pass judgement on his mental and physical state. In
                “Ashes to Ashes,” perhaps Major Tom’s most (in)famous subsequent appearance, “we
                know Major Tom’s a junkie.” More than that, Major Tom’s excessive individualism has
                become a threat to social and personal productivity: “to get things done,” the
                narrator is repeatedly told, “you better not mess with Major Tom.” The reference
                might be to Tom himself, or to the cocaine, alcohol, and cigarettes with which Bowie
                himself was by now associated. For Waldrep, this coded reference “nominally recasts
                Major Tom . . . to use him as a stand-in for Bowie himself” (91). Each time these
                lines are repeated, the warning against Major Tom becomes starker, and the line
                between the character and the artist—the boundaries necessary for the (New) Romantic
                “I Am”—are increasingly blurred. Major Tom’s inverted expression of self—“am
                I”—contains increasing tensions throughout each of these echoes; they offer dark
                parodies of individualism that seem, in Major Tom’s case, to have brought about a
                troubling plurality that is reinforced through each of the character’s iterations
                (that is, until “Blackstar”).</p>
                  <p> These weakening echoes perhaps reach their apotheosis in
                “Hallo Spaceboy,” from Bowie’s 1995 album <emph>1. Outside</emph>. Waldrep
                thinks that this album is where Bowie’s “presentations of his performative selves”
                reached their peak, and that seems to be true of Major Tom (18). The track plays
                with notions of bounded identities and sexualities—“Do you like girls or boys? /
                It’s confusing these days”—and its almost excessive echoing enacts the sense of
                “chaos” that the lyrics describe. The track’s central tension is between bodily
                constraint and freedom, containment and expansion:<quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>Spaceboy, you’re sleepy now</l>
                           <l>Your silhouette is so
                stationary</l>
                           <l>You’re released but your custody
                    calls</l>

                           <l>Don’t you wanna be free?</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
           This verse, and the chorus that follows, is repeated twice
                throughout the song—and, more than that, an echo shadows almost every word. Bowie’s
                voice reverberating around the song-space reinforces the track’s repetitious nature,
                but emphasises, too, an ongoing attempt to echolocate Major Tom’s (New) Romantic
                individuality. In “Hallo Spaceboy,” the Major Tom figure has become naturalised in
                space; not quite an alien, nor is he any longer straightforwardly human.
                Nevertheless, he remains a companion in the struggle to negotiate individual
                boundaries: although he is “released”—presumably from terrestrial constraints—he is
                not able fully to discard a sense of imprisonment. Freedom seems to exist, here, in
                a third dimension between girls and boys, inside and outside, the “I Am” and the I
                am not.</p>
                  <p>Although “Hallo Spaceboy” is preoccupied with saying “bye
                bye” to Major Tom, his death is not confirmed until Bowie’s penultimate video. In
                “Blackstar,” Bowie asserts that he has become a different kind of star, and the song
                plays with the very nature of the echo: this time, Major Tom seems to return more
                strongly than any time since “Space Oddity.” The treatment of Major Tom’s remains
                reinforces that oddity: his bejewelled skull becomes the focus of a ritual at the
                heart of a labyrinthine city, whilst the rest of his skeleton floats, peculiarly,
                away, morphing into the eponymous black star. This is when two of Bowie’s
                identities—his first and his last—collide. That intertextual echo effects an erasure
                of the boundaries between selves that Coleridge described, bringing with it all the
                versions of Major Tom that have accumulated along the way: astronaut, junkie,
                spaceboy, and relic. In the end, as Coleridge also indicated, at this point nothing
                remains but the words, echoing in and through new kinds of spatial and individual
                oddities. But this diffusion is not aesthetically or philosophically a weakness:
                Major Tom himself become a “choral echo,” morphs into the universe and indicates
                Bowie’s own diffusion into “the Great I Am.” The echoes that Bowie wrote, performed,
                and recorded located a (New) Romantic individualism that interrogated its own
                identity both within and without (extra-)terrestrial communities.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">The developments of the Romantic period set the stage for modern
                framings of art and the artist, establishing powerful institutionalized discourses
                that both created the privileged spaces in which art is presumed to operate and
                reified the special modes of authority that Romantic poetry and poets had claimed.
                However, these discourses have never been set in stone. Instead, subsequent
                practitioners have negotiated and renegotiated them in making their selves and
                works. While the rock stars of the sixties did so principally through amplification,
                David Bowie established a more skeptical relationship with Romantic notions of art
                and artistry. His mastery of mediated interaction allowed him to throw himself with
                gusto at the task of expanding the field of the represented and representable, but
                his works also consistently articulate meaningful doubts about the possibility of
                transcendent communication through art. Rather than claiming to reveal truths in the
                manner of high Romantic conceptions, his works place the power to make meanings in
                the hands and minds of his audiences, employing the potency of Romantic vision while
                knowingly undercutting its potential for totalizing imposition.</p>

               <p>This essay discusses how David Bowie’s self-conscious
                self-fashioning as an artist drew upon Romantic models created in canonical lyric
                poetry and through the self-presentations and receptions of Romantic poets. His
                practices, I will argue, improved on and critiqued these models’ representational
                potential and complicated their ideals of literary communication, but without
                surrendering their affective impact or their belief in the power and value of art.
                In some respects, Bowie was straightforwardly an heir to many oppositional
                Romantic-period writers, buying in to their collective programme of pushing back the
                boundaries of representation by celebrating atypical forms of experience and
                sociality. However, Bowie’s productions also work to subvert the Romantic paradigm
                that was dominant both in twentieth-century accounts of early-nineteenth-century art
                and within the music scene from which he emerged. Rather than straightforwardly
                proclaiming a triumphant subjectivity, his works challenge the veneration of stars
                by positing forms of artistry that privilege the swapping of masks, the
                fragmentation of canonical identities, and the collaborative interpretative power of
                audiences. In this, we might align him with the more sceptical views expressed by
                younger Romantic writers like Lord Byron, John Keats, and Letitia Landon, who
                sometimes pushed back against the conservative forms of universalizing
                self-aggrandizement they detected in the later work of William Wordsworth and Samuel
                Taylor Coleridge by favouring more contingent and questioning modes of
                self-fashioning. However, with the intellectual and media resources of a further
                century-and-a-half behind him, Bowie was able to go much further than those writing
                in the 1810s, 1820s, and 1830s, creating multiform fractures in his
                self-presentations that made his personas and works radically reinterpretable,
                thereby passing ownership of the powerful affects he evoked to audiences he
                conceived of as being active, dynamic, and involved.</p>
               <p>In discussing Bowie alongside canonical Romantic poetry, I will
                draw out discontinuities as well as considering similitudes. The twentieth-century
                rock song is a different beast than the nineteenth-century lyric poem, both formally
                and in sociocultural terms. The critical frameworks for discussing one form do not
                always transfer seamlessly over to the other. However, examining consonances and
                clashes has a great deal to offer to Romantic Studies and the analysis of popular
                culture. There has been a longstanding tentativeness about discussing Romantic
                legacies beyond making relatively straightforward claims regarding poetic and
                philosophical influences on rarefied forms of art. However, there are good reasons
                to make wider-ranging claims for the continuing popular currency of the modes of
                artistry developed in the early nineteenth century. Many scholars of the Romantic
                period would argue—and I would agree—that it was a time during which the roles of
                literature and artists were fundamentally renegotiated. As we are still living with
                the consequences of that renegotiation, it seems germane to be rather more explicit
                in our discussions of its ongoing pertinence, in order both to better understand the
                culture within which we live and to demonstrate the continuing liveliness of the
                artworks of an age characterized by conflicts between those who attempted radical
                expansions and powerful forces of reaction.</p>
               <p>To set the terms for discussing Bowie’s interactions with the
                legacies of Romanticism, it will first be necessary to engage with the thorny issue
                of exactly what constitutes a Romantic artist. This is at once a relatively simple
                and a very complex matter. An ideal of Romantic artistry centred on the individual
                creative genius, and ostensibly constructed around the Big Six Romantic poets
                (William Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron, Percy Shelley, and Keats), is the most
                recognizable and enduring cliché arising from early-nineteenth-century British
                literature, and one that has a considerable influence on how we understand and
                contextualize music and musicians. Discussing rock’s discourses of authenticity,
                David Tetzlaff opines that “Romanticism remains the common language of middle class
                rebelliousness” (115). As well as marking Romanticism’s ongoing currency, Tetzlaff’s
                brief summation does a good job of bringing out some of the contradictions inherent
                in Romantic ideologies. While these can serve to constitute a shared space, that
                space is one implicated in privilege and one from which many of the specificities of
                its purported originators have been bleached away. The compound notion that
                positions the ideated Romantic as an individual indulging Byronic passions while
                producing Wordsworthian lyricism would certainly have horrified both poets.
                Nevertheless, this uneasy yet enticing blend of transgressive iconoclast and
                inspired prophet is one of the dominant cultural legacies of Romantic-period writing
                for society in general and for creative artists in particular—David Bowie included.
                When Bowie was casting around for subjects for the early songs that appeared on <emph>David Bowie</emph> in 1969, Romantic positions came easily to hand.
                The “missionary mystic of peace/love” in “Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud;” the
                “Thinker” who “sits alone growing older / And so bitter” in “Cygnet Committee;” the
                bohemian “madness” of “An Occasional Dream;” and the “Children of the summer’s end”
                in “Memory of a Free Festival”—all have a distinctively Romantic cast. While
                “Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed” seems aware of the ironies implicit in
                declarations like “I’m the cream / Of the great utopia dream,” placing the artist
                “Upon the forehead of the age to come” (Keats, “Addressed to the Same” l. 10) is a
                quintessentially Romantic move.</p>
               <p>The notion of Romantic artistry expressed in positionings like
                these continues to inform representations, inspire imitations, condition receptions,
                and invite refutations that oppose its presumptions even as they reinscribe those
                same presumptions through evoking them. While many individual creative artists
                dispute the tenets of Romanticism, the cultural authority of the artist is still
                predicated in large part on their being an individual who is “endued with more
                lively sensibility, more enthusiasm and tenderness, who has a greater knowledge of
                human nature, and a more comprehensive soul, than are supposed to be common among
                mankind” (Wordsworth, “Preface” (1802) xxviiii). While eighteenth-century artists
                commonly purported to be social beings much like the members of their audiences,
                Romantic artists took pains to stress that they saw and felt differently. This
                special capacity for insight was a key justification when nineteenth-century
                institutions began to canonize a heightened notion of artistry, consequently
                allowing literature, in Jon Klancher’s words, to “become a specialized world in its
                own right” (1). While Romantic ideals of artistry were formed partly in opposition
                to older, pragmatic, elite paradigms, their principles of resistance were relatively
                easily normalized within subsequent secular pantheons and systems of cultural
                control. In Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre’s view, Romanticism “represents a revolt
                against the civilization created by capitalism” (19–20), but, as Tetzlaff suggests,
                evocations of this revolt have proved to be very appealing as saleable
                commodities.</p>
               <p>The Romantic paradigm of artistry is, of course, deeply problematic
                for all sorts of reasons, particularly when considered as the defining feature of an
                epoch within which it was an inchoate and oppositional discourse. Jerome McGann and
                Clifford Siskin have shown that the development of Romantic ideals and the adoption
                of the term “Romanticism” were complex and belated phenomena, particularly in a
                British context. The valuable contributions of other scholars, including David
                Higgins, Julian North, and Tom Mole, have demonstrated that the second and third
                quarters of the nineteenth century comprised the most significant period for the
                propagation of the ideals of literary Romanticism. During this period, an unstable
                composite of received social and textual elements compiled from a diverse and
                fractious body of influences was brought to some degree of coherence in the popular
                consciousness through periodical culture, biography, memorialization,
                anthologization, and the rise of institutionalized forms of literature. The most
                familiar versions of Romanticism can be seen as even more recent innovations. Seamus
                Perry has shown that while a “certain archetype of the poet, living in the dreamy
                introverted remoteness of his own consciousness, had been current throughout the
                nineteenth century . . . [a] growing conception of idealism as fundamental to a
                definition of the Romantic” was a phenomenon of the second quarter of the twentieth
                century (7). While the artists of the Romantic period and their productions created
                the conditions for a reconsideration of what an artist was (or should be), this
                reconsideration took a considerable time to bed in, and remains subject to
                reconfigurations.</p>
               <p>The status of Romanticism as an event that continued (and
                continues) to happen across different cultures and circumstances makes it difficult
                to delineate all its attributes with any degree of definitiveness. Nevertheless,
                while a critical analysis can never establish all the things that Romanticism might
                be in its multifarious national, formal, and temporal contexts, it remains possible
                to focus on aspects that sit close to the heart of its fuzzy set of potential
                meanings. One paradigmatic aspect worth considering would be Romanticism’s complex
                alignments with nature, but this does not appear to be a particularly fruitful
                avenue to pursue in discussing Bowie. While Bowies is deeply concerned with human
                nature, he makes sparse reference to the natural world in his oeuvre except as a
                subsidiary to anthropocentric conceptions. In “Eight Line Poem” (1971), for example,
                the “prairie” that the “tactful cactus” surveys is the floor of a room, and “the sun
                that pins the branches to the sky” is defined by its role as “the key to the city.”
                However, another key aspect of Romanticism—its concern with the articulation of
                selves and identities—sits right at the core of Bowie’s art, and it is in this area
                that we can trace some significant continuities and reactions.</p>
               <p>For the purposes of this discussion, I propose to examine Romantic
                identity as operating through two contrary impulses. One of these is expansive,
                seeking to include in literary representations individuals and circumstances
                hitherto excluded. The other is a more introverted and potentially problematic
                impulse that seeks to establish the special qualities of a particular self, often
                either implicitly or explicitly that of the artist. In addressing these
                sequentially, I will seek to show that Bowie’s works often align with and celebrate
                the Romantic impulse towards acceptance and understanding, while also often
                articulating a clear-eyed view of the social and psychological challenges of radical
                forms of empathy. However, Bowie’s work from the seventies onwards consistently
                questions the value of a strongly articulated artistic self, at least when this self
                is articulated in the singular. While Bowie was able to activate a potent form of
                artistic heroism, it was different in its qualities and its emphases from heroic
                visions constructed by the canonical Romantics, although while being so it
                nevertheless employed a number of archetypal Romantic techniques, including the
                fetishization of fragmentation and the glorification of abjection.</p>
               <p>First, though: representation. The centrality of Romantic
                assumptions to modern accounts of artistic value can sometimes make it tricky to
                recover a sense of their genuine radicalism at the time of their initial emergence.
                However, something of the shock of the new can still be discerned through examining
                the scathing critiques authored by advocates of the older systems Romantic thinking
                challenged. A good example is Francis Jeffrey’s review of Robert Southey’s <emph>Thalaba the Destroyer</emph> (1801) in the first number of the <emph>Edinburgh Review</emph>, in which he wrote that the new sect of
                poets he was assessing “seem[ed] to value themselves very highly, for having broken
                loose from the bondage of ancient authority, and re-asserted the independence of
                genius” (63–4). However, for Jeffrey, the Lakers’ supposed declaration of
                independence from a socialized tradition was an embarrassing imposture resulting
                from a fundamental misconception about what poetry was supposed to represent:
            <quote>The love, or grief, or indignation of an enlightened and refined
                character is not only expressed in a different language but is in itself a different
                emotion from the love, or grief, or anger of a clown, a tradesman or a market-wench.
                The things themselves are radically and obviously distinct; and the representation
                of them is calculated to convey a very different train of sympathies and sensations
                to the mind. The question, therefore, comes simply to be—which of them is the most
                proper object for poetical imitation? (66)</quote>
            For Jeffrey, needless to say, the rural, dejected, exotic, and
                psychological objects selected by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey were decidedly
                improper. In the world that the <emph>Edinburgh</emph> sought to
                legitimate and defend, poetry was principally a refined form of communication within
                a dominant class. In that role, it served as both an embodiment of that class’s
                values and a validator of its right to rule. The notion of poetry that Jeffrey
                sought to reinforce was essentially imitative, rather than creative in an expansive
                or imaginative sense. Consequently, Jeffrey saw Wordsworth’s “perverted taste for
                simplicity” (68) as a monstrous imposition on polite readers that broke down
                necessary boundaries between classes and nonsensically evoked the priorities of
                people from whom poets differed in fundamental and irreconcilable manners.</p>
               <p>In making these assertions, Jeffrey was echoing a common position,
                and one on which Whiggish and more conservative commentators anxiously agreed.
                Introducing the fourth and final dialogue of his satire
                <emph>The Pursuits of Literature</emph> (published in
                parts between 1794 and 1797 and first published in full in 1798), Thomas James
                Mathias mixed an ambivalent recognition of progress with contempt and concern,
                opining that:
            <quote>We no longer look exclusively for learned authors in the usual
                place, in the retreats of academic erudition, and in the seats of religion. Our
                peasantry now read the <emph>Rights of Man</emph> on mountains, and moors,
                and by the way side; and shepherds make the analogy between their occupation and
                that of their governors. (238)</quote>
            While the full emergence of a genuinely expansive reading public is
                better dated to the 1820s than the 1790s, Mathias’s account makes it clear that the
                fear of new readers and writers was becoming a potent force. Those who strutted on
                the stage of culture were intensely aware of the growing ranks of other actors and
                of increasingly copious, inscrutable, and potentially demanding audiences.
                Commentators like Mathias figured this plenitude as fundamentally destructive: “The
                objects of publick regret and offence are
                <emph>now</emph> so numerous and so complicated, that
                all the milder offices of the Muse have lost their influence and attraction”
                (250).</p>
               <p>Mathias’s pronouncements are strikingly similar in tone to
                Wordsworth’s contention in the 1800 “Preface” to <emph>Lyrical
                    Ballads</emph> that “The invaluable works of our elder writers, I had almost said
                the works of Shakespear and Milton, are driven into neglect by frantic novels,
                sickly and stupid German Tragedies, and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in
                verse” (xix). Such similitudes demonstrate that Wordsworth was in certain ways quite
                a conventional and conservative thinker when it came to addressing cultural change,
                pressured by what Lucy Newlyn has accurately characterized as an intense anxiety of
                reception. However, his impulse in the face of a perceived expansion of the literary
                franchise was not to retrench established privilege, like Jeffrey and Mathias, but
                rather to experiment with new positionings. This was by no means a wholehearted
                embrace of new media forms and audiences—it was in many respects a form of
                resistance—but it was a response that was fundamentally creative. While his
                essentialist evocation of “great and permanent objects” (xix) ostensibly models a
                return to fundamental values, Wordsworth’s rhetorically locating these fundamental
                values in “common life” (x) enacted a paradigm shift in terms of what art could take
                as its subjects. In the eyes of more traditional commentators, Wordsworth’s solution
                to cultural desensitization was worse than the problem. However, for the acolytes
                and popularizers who spread his reputation through the same burgeoning print culture
                that he feared, Wordsworth succeeded in reflecting subjectivities not hitherto made
                available in art. In seeing this as a triumph, his advocates began the process of
                rewriting the rules by which artistry was henceforward to be judged.</p>
               <p>Discussing Jeffrey’s <emph>Thalaba</emph> review, Robert
                Miles contends that Jeffrey suspiciously detected “a striving towards the
                representation of the full otherness of others, which naturally begged the question
                of the social and political entitlements of others” (82). It seems safe to say that
                while Jeffery’s Whigs and the conservative establishment disapproved of such
                strivings, a radical expansion of the boundaries of representation in literature is
                one of the unambiguously great achievements catalysed by Romantic-period practices.
                Romantic and post-Romantic art has trumpeted the artist’s ability imaginatively to
                sympathize and encompass, changing formerly improper objects into recognized
                subjects. We might choose centrally canonical cases to exemplify this, such as
                Wordsworth’s connection with the spirit of nature at Tintern Abbey, or Blake’s
                evocations of London’s poor, or Byron’s glamorization of literal and emotional
                outlaws. However, such expansions are far from being solely the province of the Big
                Six. We might as easily consider sympathetic subjectivities in instances such as
                Charlotte Smith’s taking creative possession of Petrarch and Werther in her <emph>Elegiac Sonnets</emph>; or the bird and animal consciousnesses that
                John Clare creates; or Ann Radcliffe’s explorations of how it feels to fear or
                control; or Jane Austen’s subtle craft of human gradation. By being perceived as
                expanding the range of representable subjectivities, these writers’ works—regardless
                of their authors’ political stances—played important roles in emancipating artistic
                practice from implicitly endorsing prevailing systems of social superiority.
                Post-Romantic art claims both the world and the mind as its purview, justifying
                itself through asserting its ability to see differently and draw new connections.
                While in practice art can never wholly escape social and cultural conventions, the
                developments of the Romantic period saw it repositioned as a critical and
                experimental process whose practitioners were granted licence to push back the
                boundaries of expression and empathy. The artist was no longer a custodian of
                established forms, but rather a forger of new modes for appreciating things formerly
                neglected, misunderstood, or despised.</p>
               <p>Positioning Bowie as part of this tradition of liberation is
                relatively straightforward. Much of his work is heavily invested in parody,
                appropriation, and reinvention, but in his hands, these become means for opening up
                formerly closed systems and mindsets. A fairly obvious example would be “Lady
                Stardust” (1972):<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>People stared at the makeup on his face</l>
                        <l>Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace</l>
                        <l>The boy in the bright blue jeans</l>
                        <l>Jumped up on the stage</l>
                        <l>And Lady Stardust sang his songs</l>
                        <l>Of darkness and disgrace</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
            The laughter in the second line of this first verse could be read
                as mockery, but the tone allows for delight too, and it is clear from the chorus
                refrain—“he was alright”—that while Lady Stardust’s performance challenges some
                members of the imagined audience, it nevertheless works as art, in part because it
                challenges. While “I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey” in the second verse
                looks back in a somewhat retrogressive manner to the cliché of “the love that dare
                not speak its name,” the reaction remains one of strong admiration, and the femme
                fatales and boys described in the previous lines constitute a crowd that is mixed,
                engaged, and itself composed of performers.</p>
               <p>As “Lady Stardust” shows, Bowie’s art pushes the value of the
                idiosyncratic, the formerly excluded, and the potentially improper. Sometimes this
                investment manifests lyrically in surreal declarations that communicate despite
                themselves. While there is no pre-established poetic context for parsing what Bowie
                means when he declares “I’m an alligator” at the beginning of “Moonage Daydream”
                (1972)—or to explain exactly what “squawking like a pink monkey bird” might
                entail—the song is a come-on made more intriguing by its fascinating crypticisms.
                Other Bowie lyrics explicitly defend neglected subjectivities. When in “Changes”
                (1971) Bowie describes “these children that you spit on / As they try to change
                their worlds,” the plural “worlds” is significant, acknowledging myriad valuable
                subjectivities, rather than Jeffrey’s singular “proper object.” The supposed
                children’s creative capacities serve to grant them liberty and self-awareness:
                “They’re immune to your consultations / They’re quite aware of what they’re going
                through.” Similarly, when Bowie asks who will love Aladdin Sane (the title character
                of his 1973 album), this is a call for a potentially impossible form of empathy,
                rather than a sneering objection. Like most pop music, Bowie’s oeuvre is shot
                through with desire, but desire in Bowie is multiple, thwarted, and shifting. His
                lyrics generally refuse to lay out one rule for the refined or to demarcate an
                in-crowd without considering who this might exclude. Instead, his songs present a
                series of possible masks that can be worn authentically despite their capacity for
                being shucked off.</p>
               <p>While Bowie might be seen as drawing on discourses rooted in
                Romanticism in moments such as these, his methods of communicating his artistry
                arguably represent a considerable improvement on those available to
                early-nineteenth-century poets and novelists. The mechanics of print production
                before the second quarter of the nineteenth century meant that even the most
                successful literary writers of the Romantic period addressed restricted and affluent
                readerships during their lifetimes, although their posthumous Victorian audiences
                were far more extensive. However, even the late-nineteenth-century reading audience
                was small by the standards of those that could be reached by singers in the
                mid-twentieth century. By the 1960s, the potential existed, in John Lennon’s words,
                for musicians to be “more popular than Jesus” (Cleave), in large part due to the
                range of media forms through which they could engage with their audiences. No longer
                were communications largely limited to written words, still visual images, and
                performances reliant on direct personal proximity; now, recorded and transmitted
                sound and vision allowed for a panoply of new forms of interaction. As a
                performative rock star in an age of mass media, the representational potential
                immediately available to Bowie was far greater than that accorded to his writerly
                Romantic forebears, in terms of both the forms he could employ and the audiences he
                could reach. He may not have had long black hair, but it was clear that he had
                makeup on his face when he sang “Lady Stardust” and its brethren to audiences of
                thousands in theatres; it was similarly obvious when he projected himself to
                millions through carefully designed records and TV appearances that deliberately
                distorted the line between stagecraft and self. By committing to visual and personal
                performance as well as lyric selves, Bowie was able to blur towards a key ideal of
                musical Romanticism: the Wagnerian total artwork—although, as I will go on to
                discuss, his manners of expression undercut the claims to universal importance that
                are often associated with this term.</p>
               <p>Romantic-period authors commonly attempted to be parsimonious with
                their biographical significations, seeking carefully to control their images.
                Wordsworth, in particular, expressed considerable frustration when he was
                refashioned by essayists like William Hazlitt and Thomas De Quincey. By contrast,
                Bowie, with the full resources of a postmodern perspective available to him, was
                able to take a more magnanimous approach. Recognizing the impossibility and
                undesirability of policing all the ways in which he might be interpreted, he instead
                multiplied himself in manners that were “open to limitless interpretations of
                meaning” (Morley 462). This proved to be an extremely effective strategy in
                commercial, aesthetic, and affective terms. As Shelley wrote enviously and somewhat
                hyperbolically of Byron in 1822, Bowie’s multifarious representations “touched a
                chord to which a million hearts responded”
                (<emph>Letters</emph> II:436).</p>
               <p>A crucial aspect of the media environment into which Bowie emerged
                was the space it provided for his audiences to co-author the meanings of his works
                in manners that were far more comprehensive than those available in the early
                nineteenth century. As David Baker puts it, “Bowie as rock star/artist functions in
                a pop/rock economy of alliance and commonality” (111). Byron and Wordsworth were
                certainly imitated, and Byron in particular—along with his publishers and
                collaborators—was a pioneer in developing what Tom Mole has characterized as a
                hermeneutic of intimacy. However, what Bowie could achieve was on a different scale.
                Rebuking a newspaper article that describes Byron as having drawn “hordes of
                screaming young women,” Mole contends accurately that these hordes “were spliced
                into Byron’s story from an entirely different cultural memory. They screamed not for
                Byron but for the Beatles” (2007 xi). While the media environment was opening up
                during the 1810s and 1820s, writers in this period were by no means as readily
                available for appropriation as twentieth-century artists who positioned themselves
                knowingly within a constellation of magazines, television appearances, costume
                designers, other musicians, movements, newspapers, controversies, personal
                interactions, radio broadcasts, sleeves, vinyl, and technology.</p>
               <p>Fans responded to this cornucopia of stimuli both through forming
                shared interpretive communities and through valuing particular irreducible
                specifics. Bowie’s productions proved to possess an enormous capacity for conjuring
                feelings of affinity. In Nick Stevenson’s words, fans reacted to Bowie and his works
                by employing them for “the creation of meaning through diverse patterns of
                identification” (149). Creative audiences were able to use Bowie’s multivalent
                capacities to transcend dominant media narratives. Patrick Glen, examining Bowie’s
                outing himself as bisexual in the <emph>Melody Maker</emph> in 1972,
                argues that while reportage often attempted to position the singer and his
                characters within constrained traditions of queer expression, Bowie’s use of
                “references drawn from complex scenes that could accommodate a number of narratives,
                symbols, individual and sexual identities” meant that “[t]hose who had not
                encountered these scenes . . . could appropriate elements of Bowie’s identity and
                references for themselves” (423). John Gill writes similarly that Bowie provided a
                powerful and outrageous, if not unproblematic, model for gay identity “at a time
                when queer appearances in the media tended to be in the form of arrests and police
                statistics” (110). Bowie was by no means always an ideal role model; as Will Brooker
                has pointed out, certain performances, such as “China Girl” (1983, although written
                earlier for Iggy Pop), can rightly be challenged for their uncomfortable cultural
                appropriations (98–100). Nevertheless, the kinds of fan responses recorded by
                Stevenson, Glen, Gill, and thousands upon thousands of articles, conversations,
                comments, forum posts, Tumblr memes, and blogs make it clear that Bowie’s modes of
                expression have often been received as being enormously liberating. While Bowie was
                not wholly responsible for the emancipatory potential of his self-presentations, he
                was nevertheless a master manipulator of the forms available to him, creating spaces
                for alternative subjectivities. These subjectivities were modelled at least in part
                on Romantic exemplars (in a few cases explicitly, as with Screaming Lord Byron, as
                Emily Bernhard-Jackson has discussed (2018)). However, these were often cleverly
                subverted by new contrasts and contexts. The affordances of modern media forms
                enabled Bowie to expand considerably on the Romantics’ accomplishments in terms of
                visibility, ease of transmission, and potential for immediate remediation.</p>
               <p>Bowie’s approaches to core Romantic concerns might also be seen as
                improvements in other respects. While we would now reject the exclusionary
                conservatism in Jeffrey’s <emph>Thalaba</emph> review, we might
                nevertheless recognize his accuracy in contending that the discourses of Romanticism
                are often intrinsically egocentric. There is a crucial contradiction at the heart of
                Romantic artistry between expanding the range of possible representations and
                focusing in on the special minds that performatively accomplish these expansions.
                This contradiction is implicit in Keats’s ideal of “<emph>Negative
                    Capability</emph>, that is when a man is capable of being in uncertainties,
                Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason” (<emph>Letters</emph> I:193). While the notion of negative capability is
                ostensibly focused on avoiding certain kinds of overdetermination, the evocation of
                uncertainties in Romantic poetry nearly always connotes a viewing consciousness,
                privileging the discriminating powers of the artist. This privileging of the
                artistic consciousness is a quintessentially Romantic phenomenon. In no previous era
                would it have been tenable to write an epic poem whose central subject was the
                “growth of a poet’s mind” (Wordsworth, <emph>Prelude</emph>) or to claim
                in all seriousness that “poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the World”
                (Shelley, “Defence” 535). Shelley and Wordsworth may have differed on a great number
                of issues, but they were united in ferociously exalting the power of the poetic
                self. In his sonnet “To Wordsworth” (1816), Shelley valorizes a “Poet of Nature” (l.
                1) who has the sublime ability to rise above “the blind and battling multitude” (l.
                10) through weaving “Songs consecrate to truth and liberty” (l. 12). Of course,
                Shelley goes on to add, “Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve, / Thus having
                been, that thou shouldst cease to be” (ll. 13–4). Perhaps these final lines might
                helpfully be read an early-nineteenth-century equivalent of the betrayed Bob Dylan
                fan yelling “Judas!” at the Manchester Free Trade Hall—an attack that criticises a
                perceived swerve from genuine art into falsity. However, while Shelley and
                Wordsworth differed regarding the appropriate politics <emph>for</emph>
                art, they essentially concurred regarding the politics <emph>of</emph>
                art. Romantic artists might express doubts about their sociocultural effectiveness,
                but in both Shelley and Wordsworth’s visions and versions, they possess the ability
                and the responsibility to “see into the life of things” (“Tintern Abbey” l. 50) and
                be seen as reporting back authentically and comprehensively.</p>
               <p> Crucially for the purposes of this essay, this is an ideal of
                artistry that Bowie’s work at once partly endorses and utterly undercuts, showing it
                to be simultaneously absolutely ersatz and absolutely true. For Bowie, as he worked
                through a series of characters and selves compromised by recognizably Romantic
                maladies, such as self-love, madness, and addiction, the artist was simultaneously a
                visionary and a fraud. A paradigm of authentic inauthenticity lies at the heart of
                his artistic practice, which rebukes key aspects of the Romantic paradigm while
                preserving its affective charge.</p>
               <p>In seeking to become a rock star, Bowie was working in a tradition
                that often drew uncritically on the legacies of Romantic artistic exceptionalism. We
                might think here of Mick Jagger quoting <emph>Adonaïs</emph> at the Brian
                Jones memorial concert in 1969. By intoning some of Shelley’s least ambivalent
                stanzas, Jagger claimed Jones as an exemplary paragon for a vast corporeal and media
                audience. Bowie was a keen if slightly alienated observer of such spectacles. Unlike
                some sixties stars, whose careers blazed to life with astonishing quickness—but like
                many of the poets of the Romantic period who later became established as
                canonical—Bowie had to struggle to refine his own radical artistry into forms that
                would communicate, a process that entailed the development of an intense kind of
                self-reflexivity that we might liken to negative capability. However, in Bowie’s
                case, assertions about insights and performed processes of doubt are commonly
                alloyed with a reflexive irony. As Shelton Waldrep put it when discussing the
                aesthetics of self-invention, “Bowie’s famed artificiality sprang from a desire to
                reject the immediate history of rock music”
                (<emph>Aesthetics</emph> 106). We might extend this
                insight to other forms of discourse that insist on the authority of authenticity.
                Bowie was very uncomfortable with the idea of legislating the world, and through
                staging his discomfort in a plethora of different manners, he encouraged his
                audience to think about the limits of his powers of communication and the
                possibility that the performances he put on might as easily mislead as lead.</p>
               <p>A good early example of Bowie’s suspicious staging of his artistic
                self can be found in a key lyric from “Changes”:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>So I turned myself to face me</l>
                        <l>But I’ve never caught a glimpse</l>
                        <l>Of how the others must see the faker</l>
                        <l>I’m much too fast to take that test</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
            “Changes” presents a vision of identity both more fluid and more
                playful than that found in stereotypical Romantic discourse. Rather than being the
                subject of infinite contemplations, the self slips easily out of view, proving
                impossible to pin down. The song recognizes that the identity others see must always
                be falsified to a certain extent and must always remain in some respects ineffable
                to its possessor. In this paradigm, the outpourings of self that Romantic poems
                imagine are not valuable because they genuinely communicate lucid truths; rather,
                their value lies in their evoking the possibility of such powerfully affective
                communications. For Bowie, the vision of transcendent, authentic correspondence that
                Romantic art holds out should not be accepted as a totalizing paradigm, and neither
                should it inevitably be seen as admirable. In his work, space is created for the
                audience and the artist to appropriate, misunderstand, and move onward. An
                unintended or misconceived meaning need not be any less powerful than an intended
                one, and painstakingly seeking to draw distinctions is a slow game to play when you
                can just communicate again with a different mask. When Bowie tells his audience in
                “D.J.” (1979) “I am what I play,” he evokes the ease with which art can efface
                identity, but also its capacity for being duplicated, reconfigured, and shared—for
                meaning different things to different people at different times and in different
                places. While the Romantic artist is capable of being in uncertainties, Bowie is
                prepared to replace the self who performs the balancing of these uncertainties with
                a kaleidoscope of different possibilities, without any irritable reaching after
                definitiveness. Through doing so, he captures a vast range of contingent forms of
                originality that model character as being lambent and mutable, rather than centred
                and cerebral.</p>
               <p>The extent to which Bowie’s self-presentations differ from strong
                Romantic evocations of the self might be demonstrated by contrasting a poem like
                Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind” (written in 1819) with a lyric like Bowie’s
                “Quicksand” (1971). Both these works deal with an element of nature often depicted
                as being difficult to grasp, but they approach these elements in ideologically
                disparate manners. Shelley’s “Ode” is a powerful act of shamanism with a singular
                focus. The first three stanza pile up calls and invocations, a constant stream of
                addresses that conjure the wind in its various aspects and locales before seeking
                tightly to align it with the poet’s own identity. Shelley ostensibly recognizes his
                separation from the wind in his showy falling away onto the “thorns of life” (l.
                54), but the echoes of Christlike suffering point towards a rise and a resurrection
                for one self-confessedly “tameless, and swift, and proud” (l. 56). In the final
                stanza, Shelley completes a comprehensive process of identification and alignment,
                first imagining the wind sounding through him, harrowing him into a pure voice, and
                then imploring it to become the best part of his self-as-poet:<quote>

            Shelley’s megalomaniacal focus reaches its apotheosis in this
                moment, where the poet and the poem become one, encoding in being so the seeds of a
                revolution modelled as being necessarily eventually successful.</p>
               <p>This visionary mode, despite its potency and attractiveness, is one
                regarding which Bowie’s works display considerable suspicion. While he sometimes
                employs the abject manner that Shelley assays in the penultimate stanza of the
                “Ode,” he is not generally willing to crash through to the kinds of transcendence
                modelled in the final stanza, at least not without encoding a substantial degree of
                ambivalence. The subjects Bowie addresses commonly prove to be unresponsive or
                treacherous. When he breathes words into the void on a key track from <emph>Station to Station</emph> (1976)—“Lord, I kneel and offer you / My
                word on a wing / And I’m trying hard to fit among / Your scheme of things”—the song
                ends with doubts as to whether the singer’s struggles can ever be successfully
                reconciled with eternal verities: “Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of
                things?” Time in “Time” (1973) is a toxic and unreliable muse, who “speaks of
                senseless things,” demands the lives of friends, and attenuates the bonds of
                relationships. In the song bearing his name (1971), Andy Warhol is just as capable
                of doing “jolly boring” things as he is of looking “a scream”, and ultimately, he
                cannot be differentiated from a “Silver Screen”: he represents a mode of artistic
                reflection, but not of a kind that provides definitive answers.</p>
               <p> Lyrics that maintain a single subject of address in the manner of
                Shelley’s most famous lines, or Keats’s odes, or (perhaps more in theory than in
                practice) Coleridge’s conversation poems are relatively uncommon among Bowie’s
                oeuvre. Instead, he often flickers from image to image even in brief songs, creating
                effects through collage or accumulation rather than the careful delineation of a
                central presence. In “Quicksand,” he begins by evoking hermetic modes of order—“I’m
                closer to the Golden Dawn / Immersed in Crowley’s uniform / Of imagery”—but these
                opening lines already contain crucial degrees of deflection and alienation very
                different from Romantic reachings-out. Closer is not the same as part of, a uniform
                is not its wearer, and imagery is not that which is represented. Where Shelley longs
                for purity, truth, and authenticity (even while partly recognizing the desperation
                of such an ideal), Bowie suspends himself in a network of suggestions and
                possibilities that rely on allusions to others’ arts and artifices. While Shelley
                begs the wind to be his avatar, Bowie asserts himself as an aspect of wider
                cultures, a being unable to cohere into a position of singular subjectivity or
                devotion:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>I’m the twisted name on Garbo’s eyes</l>
                        <l>Living proof of Churchill’s lies, I’m destiny</l>
                        <l>I’m torn between the light and dark</l>
                        <l>Where others see their targets, divine symmetry</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
            Nor does the song present this lack of definitive positioning as a
                bad thing. There are moments of paranoia and melodrama in the lyrics of “Quicksand,”
                but these are underpinned by the beauty of the elegant string parts, which evoke a
                kind of harmony that grounds the words’ reflections. Shelley’s verse is desperate to
                validate its writer’s self, to make his utterances truths, to spread across the
                globe what he asserts he knows to be right. By contrast, Bowie’s song cautions
                against certainties. Its reference to the “next bardo” evokes Buddhist notions of
                multiple lives comprising cyclical orders, rather than lines directed forwards. The
                words of the chorus—“Don’t believe in yourself, don’t deceive with belief /
                Knowledge comes with death’s release”—rebuke the kinds of confidence that would seek
                to trumpet forth prophecy. While Shelley’s “Ode” concludes with a question that begs
                a particular answer, the sung part of Bowie’s song ends with voices producing pure,
                open-throated sounds rather than words, fading into pure musicality.</p>
               <p>Through this comparison, I am not seeking to assert that either
                “Quicksand” or “Ode to the West Wind” is a better artwork than the other. Rather, I
                wish to draw out and characterize a difference in their ideological approaches that
                reflects what Bowie rejects and reconfigures from the Romantic project. Romantic
                poems depict their poets as concerned with and capable of locating meaningful
                things. Sometimes these can be captured in aphorisms like “Beauty is truth, truth
                beauty” or “The Child is Father of the Man,” sometimes their assertions are more
                diffuse or allusive, but in either case, the Romantic poems that have been
                particularly valued often frame themselves as their poet’s responses to significant
                questions about existence. Biographical circumstances meant that Shelley’s Rousseau
                was never able to tell the narrator of “The Triumph of Life” what life is, but the
                framing of the question nevertheless implies that this is something that poetry
                might potentially establish. Bowie’s work challenges such attempts at definitive
                meaning-making, in part due to his greater awareness of the importance of his
                audiences. According to <emph>Hunky Dory</emph>’s producer, Ken Scott,
                Bowie intended “The Bewlay Brothers” (1971) to be “specifically for the American
                market . . . the lyrics makes absolutely no sense, but the Americans always like to
                read into things, so let them read into it what they will” (Buckley 97). To the more
                Romantically inclined, this might sound like a terrible abdication of artistic
                responsibility, but it reflects Bowie’s sense that meaning can never be created
                solely by the artist (particularly an artist who works in concert with skilled
                musicians, technicians, and designers). Rather, significance is the product of
                complex processes of collaboration. In his practices, Bowie actively sought out
                spaces for the co-creation of meaning through the use of cut-ups in the late sixties
                and early seventies and Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt’s Oblique Strategies for
                elements of the Berlin Trilogy (<emph>Low</emph> (1977), <emph>“Heroes”</emph> (1977), and <emph>Lodger</emph> (1979)). This
                preoccupation with the interpretations of others also manifests in his lyrics. The
                subjects of his songs often shift in manners that model crossings-over of
                responsibility and identity. After the bridge in “Young Americans” (1975), the
                song’s subject moves from being a series of pitied characters (he or she “wants the
                young American”) to the audience (“You want the young American”) and finally the
                singer (“I want the young American”). The narrator of “Panic in Detroit” (1973) is a
                fan and an imitator of revolutionaries, rather than a revolutionary himself in any
                uncomplicated sense. The film-devouring potential ravers in “Drive-In Saturday”
                (1973) require a crash course in a practice in which they feel irredeemably
                secondary. On <emph>Diamond Dogs</emph>’s “Sweet Thing” (1974), the singer
                depicts himself as “a portrait in flesh,” but also wonders desperately whether his
                auditor will “see that I’m scared and I’m lonely.” Such framings demand that their
                audiences recognize that identities must necessarily be staged and seen. As Waldrep
                puts it, “Bowie gives us a way to understand the vicissitudes of performance,
                aestheticizing the link between rock music and everyday life by calling attention to
                the artificiality of both”
                (<emph>Future Nostalgia</emph> 3).</p>
               <p>A personal and ideological investment in the creative potential of
                unstable identities lies at the heart of Bowie’s artistry. He was fully capable of
                “play[ing] the wild mutation as a rock &amp; roll star” (“Star” (1972)), but in
                showing this to be play, albeit of a serious kind, he argued implicitly for a more
                fluid notion of genius that recognized the roles played by change, chance, and
                auditors. The characters who he both played and observed are commonly flawed,
                fragmented, doubting, or blinkered. Over the course of <emph>The Rise
                    and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</emph>, it becomes clear that the title character is at
                least in part an awful person, self-absorbed and self-regarding. When asked by Alan
                Yentob whether “Ziggy was a monster,” Bowie replied, “Oh he certainly was” (<emph>Cracked Actor</emph>). The nature of Ziggy’s monstrosity is often
                coded Romantically. The flaw that Jeffrey detects in the Lakers, “Making love with
                [one’s] ego,” is also Ziggy’s flaw, and “leper messiah” (“Ziggy Stardust” (1972))
                sounds like a status that Shelley would have been glad to claim in his more
                self-abasing moments. However, for Bowie, Ziggy is far from being an all-consuming
                role. His rise and fall is a story told around its central character. Even the song
                that bears his name is narrated by his bandmates, frustrated by the alienating
                effects of their lead singer’s megalomania. Crucially, though, this does not mean
                that Ziggy’s project is necessarily a failure. What matters is not so much the
                artist himself, but the inspiration that other people draw from him and build upon.
                What’s reported of the starman’s “hazy cosmic jive” (1972) is vague and garbled;
                what’s important is how his transmission makes his listeners feel, creating a
                community united for a moment in the ecstasy of shared excitement. The unity at the
                heart of the song is not so much in the lyrics, but rather in the many-voiced “na
                na” chant that follows the later choruses and runs into the closing fade. While <emph>Ziggy Stardust</emph> ironizes artistic egocentricity, it is also a
                record that advocates repeatedly for art’s power to create and evoke powerful
                connections. In both his lyrics and his practice, Bowie shows that art and its
                insights do not have to be perfect or essentially true to communicate powerfully.
                Discussing Bowie’s voice, Waldrep writes that he employs “a distinctive type of
                singing that almost oversignifies to remind listeners repeatedly that what they are
                hearing is a self-conscious performance of character and emotion (singing to make
                you think about singing) that yet connects to so many people because it is closer to
                how they experience emotion than music that attempts to be ‘naturalistic’” (<emph>Aesthetics</emph> 116). In Bowie’s work the medium and the message
                are both shown to be fallible, but their human fallibility is intrinsic to their
                effectiveness as meaningful and appropriable art.</p>
               <p>An investment in exploring the interlinked power and fragility of
                selves and communications is remarkably consistent across Bowie’s many reinventions,
                from the overdetermined dead circuit in “Space Oddity” (1969), to the insistence on
                glorious potential existing “just for one day” in “‘Heroes’” (1977), to the final
                song on his final record, “I Can’t Give Everything Away” (2016):<quote>

            In the stanza’s first line, there is perhaps a little echo of the
                epitaph of W.B. Yeats, one of the self-proclaimed “last romantics” who “chose for
                theme / Traditional sanctity and loveliness” (“Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931” ll.
                41–2). Yeats’s self-chosen grave inscription, as laid out in “Under Ben Bulben,”
                runs “<emph>Cast a cold eye</emph>
                / <emph>On life, on death / Horseman, pass by!</emph>”
                (ll. 92–4). However, while Yeats’s lines are decisive, Bowie’s second line flips to
                give the other side of the equation: not quite a contradiction, but a reversal of
                the dynamics between the internal and external worlds that the first line lays out.
                While seeing more and feeling less implies a desire for a kind of cold, objective
                voyeurism, saying no but meaning yes gestures towards a positive connection
                expressed through the performance of alienation. In these lines, denial and
                affirmation tangle together in a paradox that nevertheless communicates. You can’t
                give everything away—there’s never time or words enough—but the faith remains
                nevertheless that something, perhaps something unexpected, carries and can suffice
                for someone else. If Bowie’s work throws into doubt the Romantic authority of the
                artist as transcendent visionary, it does not do so in order to break the potency of
                art, but rather to think about how accepting artists’ limitations need not
                compromise the power of their works to work for others. Bowie’s concern with his
                audience and his respect for his listeners’ capacity for making meanings maintains a
                modified faith in the value of artistic communication, but recognizes that for art
                to be genuinely representative, it needs to reach out beyond the concerns of its
                maker by embracing the potential for radical openness in the lyric utterance.</p>
               <p>While this embrace is sometimes oblique in Bowie’s music, at other
                times, it is startlingly and touchingly direct. The last song on <emph>Ziggy Stardust</emph>, “Rock ‘n’ Roll Suicide” (1972), makes a strange shift from
                much of the preceding album, moving to a second person that projects Romantic ennui
                onto its addressee. While the song begins by telling the listener that they’ve
                fallen into a state of irrevocable solipsism—“Oh, no, no, no, you’re a rock ‘n’ roll
                suicide”—the last words gloriously counterpoise this with a cry of connection that
                reasserts the brilliance not of the singer, but of the auditor who responds:<quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l> You’re not alone.</l>
                        <l>Gimme your hands ’cause you’re wonderful</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
            This invitation to take hold of what the song provides and use it
                as a mooring point seems to me to typify Bowie’s works’ laudable openness to
                imaginative and emotional appropriation. The capital-P poet can be a powerful ideal,
                but it also one that risks actuating Romantic art’s unpleasant potential for insular
                elitism, where the insights art models are for an elect who might perhaps deign to
                share them as long as their genius is acknowledged. Bowie’s work flirts with this
                position on occasion, but he recognized its dangers. Even in troubled moments, such
                as when he asserted that he “always had a repulsive sort of need to be something
                more than human” (Crowe), his recognizing this need as repulsive registers a concern
                about modes that close off, rather than open up. His success at tempering the
                Romantic desire for transcendence created the space for him to recognize others, and
                to be made a part of others’ lives in ways that have allowed him to persist as an
                avatar of empathy, transformation, and perverse integrity. In an article marking the
                fifth anniversary of his death, Lynsey Hanley writes that “life, for Bowie, was a
                series of encounters with people and things that made change possible, not a series
                of transactions designed to get one over on other people.” In the same article, the
                singer Edwyn Collins states that “He was warm; you could walk around with him in
                your head all day and it comforted you.” If these feelings typify what Bowie can
                conjure, then it seems clear to me that his artistic self-fashioning has been
                profoundly, Romantically successful.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Neither David Bowie nor Romanticism are explicitly named in Todd Haynes’s 1998 film,
                        <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>; but this essay takes on Haynes’s
                        fictional account of the origins of “glam rock” to reflect on Bowie’s Romanticism
                        and Romanticism’s Bowie. The essay approaches the topic using what Brian Eno called
                        “oblique strategies” and what Walter Benjamin called “constellations”: Percy Shelley
                        and Oscar Wilde, Benjamin and Bowie, Todd Haynes. At the center of this
                        “constellation” is the “Bowie-Image,” an image <emph>of</emph> and <emph>about</emph> the Romantic image and what Shelley would call its
                        “electric energies” or what might be called its “currencies” for Romanticism and for
                        the “sounds and visions” of contemporary popular culture.</p>

                  <p>On the surface, David Bowie is one of the least likely matches that I can imagine for
                a pairing of pop culture with Romanticism, at least in the most agreed upon items in
                our catalogue of Romantic images, themes, and motivations. To list just a few of
                these entries: the relationship between an individual subject and the natural world,
                reflections on or depictions of the beautiful and the sublime, a visionary poetics,
                the gothic monstrous, the thematics of revolution, and an apostrophizing lyricism
                that revisits and reanimates the genres of the ode and the ballad. And if many of
                Bowie’s most compelling songs address or express the experience of solitude or
                alienation we associate with Romanticism, his is the solitude and even “derangement”
                of a “space oddity,” the cosmic alien “floating in a most peculiar way.” With Bowie
                we are very far removed from the project of a Wordsworthian Romanticism as it is
                presented, for example, in Stanley Cavell’s admirably concise formulation: “the task
                of bringing the world back, as to life . . . a new creation of our habitat” (Cavell
                53).<note place="foot" resp="author"> In <emph>Last Things</emph>, Jacques Khalip explores this passage and
                                the “alternating” route of Romanticism in Cavell’s thinking
                                (51–2).</note> In his most compelling images, Bowie
                was the “starman waiting in the sky,” at home nowhere, without earthly habitat,
                concerned more with life on Mars or with how the stars looked today.</p>
                  <p> There are certainly many other artists in contemporary Anglo-American pop music from
                Bowie’s era and after whose relationship to Romanticism, both earthbound and
                visionary, is far more explicit. Patti Smith comes to mind, of course, not only for
                her devotion to William Blake but for the experimental play of innocence and
                experience, naivete and transgression, that animates her cultural projects.
                Morrissey’s mock anthems, both with the Smiths and in his solo work afterwards,
                generate an affective irony that turns so many of his songs into magnificent pop
                melodramas, brilliant camp performances that are unthinkable without the Byron of
                    <emph>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</emph>. Thom Yorke’s songs with
                Radiohead, by turns twitchy, torqued, and exquisite, conjure Percy Shelley’s
                political sensibility, aesthetic experimentation, and a poetic impulse to learn “how
                to disappear completely.” Elsewhere, I’ve argued that singer-songwriters as diverse
                as Kurt Cobain, Nick Drake, Cat Power, Elliott Smith, and Leonard Cohen are
                affectively and formally marked by what I call “the Keats effects,” more
                specifically the aura of a “shrine of no prospects” (Pyle 2020). Mary Shelley’s
                Romanticism established its constitutive relationship with popular culture early
                enough for her to witness first-hand its beginnings, though that effect is
                registered in theatre and cinema rather than popular music.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Mary
                            Shelley was an enthusiastic member of the London audience for the
                            first—and quite popular—stage adaptation of <emph>Frankenstein</emph> in 1823, a version of the story retitled as <emph>Presumption, or The Fate of
                        Frankenstein</emph>.</note> The prospect of establishing a vital
                current that runs from British Romanticism to David Bowie is made even more
                challenging by the fact that his songs, at least to the best of my knowledge, make
                no references to Romantic poets, no allusions to Romanticism in form or figure.</p>
                  <p> One might address the challenge of developing a relationship between Bowie and
                Romanticism by asking how his songs or his personae might change the way we receive
                or interpret certain Romantic texts. We might, for example, consider how Percy
                Shelley’s “The Witch of Atlas,” arguably the “glammiest” of Romantic poems,
                anticipates Bowie, Ziggy Stardust, and their aftermath. From this perspective
                Shelley’s “witch” is the “glam queen” who commands all images, bestowing beauty upon
                the world in jeweled forms, the “many-star beams” woven into “a subtle veil,” “a
                shadow for the splendor of her love” (ll. 149, 151–2).<note place="foot" resp="author"> References to Shelley use <emph> Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</emph>, edited by Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat, 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> edition, Norton, 2002. References to poetry are given with line numbers; references to prose are given with page numbers.
                        </note> From her cosmic perspective, Shelley’s playful “witch”
                beholds “the constellations reel and dance / Like fire-flies” (ll. 269–70) on a
                dancefloor. Shelley’s “glam-witch” belongs to “the spirit of the wind,” and “her
                light feet / Past through the peopled haunts of mankind, / Scattering sweet
                visions,” bestowing “strange panaceas in a chrystal bowl” “to those she saw most
                beautiful” and “playing pranks among the cities” (ll. 521, 523–4, 594, 593, 665).
                From the hands of this playful glam-witch “a living Image” “did flow,”—the
                genderqueer “Hermaphroditus,” a “fair Shape,” blessed with “all the grace of both”
                sexes and adorned with “heaven-coloured pinions,”—Shelley’s own figural anticipation
                of the man who fell to earth (ll. 325–6, 331, 393, 404).</p>
                  <p> But as pleasurable as that mode of interpretive exercise might be, I’m not convinced
                that British Romanticism offers sufficiently glam examples to make it work in a
                sustained form. It is more immediately plausible to speak of Bowie and his various
                cultural and musical “personae” as “performing” the catalogue of postmodernism,
                specifically in the canonical version elaborated by Fredric Jameson: an emphasis on
                surfaces and the refusal of notions of depth or interiority, the “flattening” out of
                temporality, a celebration of style for its own sake, the aesthetics of pastiche,
                and even a song dedicated to “Andy Warhol,” icon of postmodern art. In fact,
                Jameson’s principal example of the new mode of multiplied sense experience demanded
                by the logic of postmodernism is David Bowie in the role of Thomas Jerome Newton,
                the alien “who watches fifty-seven television screens simultaneously” in Nicolas
                Roeg’s <emph>The Man Who Fell to Earth</emph> (1976).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jameson’s account of this moment—and Bowie’s role in it—deserves to be quoted in full: “The postmodernist viewer . . . is called upon to do the impossible, namely to see all the screens at once, in their radical and random difference: such a viewer is asked to follow the evolutionary mutation of David Bowie in <emph>The Man Who Fell to
                                Earth</emph> (who watches fifty-seven television screens simultaneously) and to rise somehow to a level at which the vivid perception of radical difference is in and of itself a new mode of grasping what used to be called relationship: something for which the word <emph>collage</emph> is still only a very feeble name” (<emph>Postmodernism</emph>, 31).</note> Moreover, Jameson
                identifies <emph>David Bowie</emph>, the
                <emph>cinematic image</emph> and not the <emph>character</emph> he plays in the film, as the one what has undergone
                the “evolutionary mutation” that makes possible this new postmodern mode of multiply
                simultaneous perception. In this version of the “Bowie effect,” he’s as much a
                symptom as a paradigm.</p>
                  <p> If postmodern Bowie is the most obvious for his exemplification of what Jameson
                calls the “cultural logic of late capitalism,” in terms of “elective affinities,”
                the critical and theatrical modernisms of Brecht, Weill, Genet, and Brel are far
                more crucial to Bowie’s own aesthetic project. In 1982, Bowie reprised the title
                role of <emph>Baal</emph>, Bertolt Brecht’s first play; Bowie’s version of
                “Alabama Song” became a staple of his live performances; and the influence of Kurt
                Weill is audible in many of his songs, perhaps most distinctly in the chorus of
                “Velvet Goldmine” (1971). “Jean Genie” is a fierce homage to Jean Genet; and Bowie’s
                versions of Jacques Brel’s “Port of Amsterdam” and “My Death” became signature
                covers during a long stretch of his live performances. Bowie’s own performative
                affect and stagings—at least until the disappointing bluesy authenticity of <emph>Let’s Dance</emph> (1983)—are perhaps the most paradigmatic example
                in pop music of Modernism’s “alienation effect,” a reiterated thematization of the
                    <emph>Verfremdungseffekt.</emph> There is certainly nothing comparable
                for Bowie in British Romanticism to this vital curatorial reclamation of European
                modernism. From my perspective, discerning Romanticism’s relationship with David
                Bowie demands something other than a logic of exemplification or aesthetic
                allusions. It demands an oblique strategy, one that reorients Romanticism according
                to Oscar Wilde.</p>
                  <p> It is fair to say that for many of the stops on Wilde’s 1882 North American lecture
                tour he was regarded by his audiences as something of a “space oddity,” his
                aestheticism serving as a punchline for the accompanying Gilbert and Sullivan
                musical <emph>Patience</emph> whose protagonist, Bunthorne, was taken to
                be a parody of the tall, young Irish dandy, preacher of art and beauty. At the age
                of twenty-eight, Wilde undertook this lecture tour long before he had written the
                plays, dialogues, and novel that established his extraordinary position in British
                culture. On his American Tour, Wilde not only lectured in the cosmopolitan centers
                of New York, Boston, and San Francisco, but America’s aesthetic hinterlands: Topeka,
                Dubuque, Leadville, Galveston, Ogden. Newspaper accounts of his visits convey the
                sense of an alien aesthete preaching his unknown pleasures to these provincial
                    audiences.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For an excellent account of this extraordinary tour and its implications for our notion of celebrity, see David M. Friedman, <emph>Wilde in America: Oscar Wilde
                                and the Invention of Modern Celebrity</emph>.</note> And somewhere along the way, Oscar Wilde
                became a pop star.</p>
                  <p> The tour’s inaugural lecture was delivered in New York and its title—“The English
                Renaissance of Art”—refers not to the flowering of literature and culture in early
                modern England but to what Wilde claimed as “our romantic movement,” :an open-ended
                aestheticist current of Romanticism that dispenses with Wordsworth and Coleridge and
                runs instead from Keats and Shelley through Walter Pater, Dante Rossetti, and
                himself. Most importantly, Wilde’s conception of “our romantic movement” does not
                have a terminus: it is available to any future artists who feel themselves hailed as
                one of “ours.” Wilde’s Romanticism is not confined to a historical period, nor is it
                bound to the most prominent themes of the period. For Wilde Romanticism is defined
                by its “most vital tendencies”: “the two most vital tendencies of the nineteenth
                century—the democratic and pantheistic tendency and the tendency to value life for
                the sake of art—found their most complete and perfect utterance in the poetry of
                Shelley and Keats, who to the blind eyes of their own time, seemed to be as
                wanderers in the wilderness, preachers of vague or unreal things” (259).<note place="foot" resp="author"> In <emph>Art’s Undoing: In the Wake of a
                                Radical Aestheticism</emph>, I have
                                explored the implications of Wilde’s account of “our romantic
                                movement” for the cultivation and radicalization of his aestheticism
                                (11–3, 209–43).</note> With this assessment, Wilde is
                espousing a Paterian principle: literature and culture are valued precisely for
                their “most vital tendencies,” a vitality that exists in spite of “the blind eyes of
                their own time.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In his preface to <emph>The Renaissance: Studies in Art
                                and
                                Poetry</emph>, Pater characterizes this “vital tendency” as “the <emph>virtue</emph>, the active principle” of poetry and art
                                which it is the “function of the aesthetic critic” to “distinguish,
                                and analyse, and separate from its adjuncts” this “active
                                principle,” “disengag[ing] that virtue, and not[ing] it, as a
                                chemist notes some natural element” (xx–xxi).</note>
                For Wilde, “our romantic movement” is never what Raymond Williams calls the “the
                cultural <emph>dominant</emph>,” but always a subterranean “current” that
                is counter-hegemonic and, in ways that remain in need of elaboration, <emph>queer</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Raymond Williams develops his notion of the “cultural dominant” and its historical relation to the “residual” and the “emergent” in <emph>Marxism and Literature</emph>, esp. 121–7. If the image of an
                                “subterranean current” sounds like a mixing of
                                metaphors—electromagnetic currents that become subterranean
                                forces—one might call to mind Nikola Tesla’s “grand capacitor” that
                                he was building at the Wardenclyffe Tower near Shoreham, New York in
                                1901, designed to gather electrical currents from the heavens which
                                it would transmit to underground channels for distribution across a
                                spidery network of “pop-up” receptors.</note> This is
                where we can find Bowie’s Romanticism and Romanticism’s Bowie, in these queer and
                oblique strategies which come about by way of a set of relays: Shelley and Keats,
                Pater and Wilde, Benjamin and Bowie.</p>
                  <p> For Walter Benjamin, the truth of history was not its chronology or causality but
                precisely such a set of relays. His most compelling historical model was the stellar
                constellation, images beheld with connections that are less causal than affective:
                shared radiances, activated currencies, tokens bestowed. What registers as an
                <emph>event</emph> for Benjamin is not the historical
                occurrence, not the <emph>what</emph> that happened but the <emph>image</emph> [<emph>bild</emph>] projected from the past
                that may—or may not—be “caught” as it passes through the “sky of history,” most
                notably when we are presented with shifting constellations in the firmament at
                night. “The true image of the past flits by,” writes Benjamin in the fifth thesis:
                “the past can be seized as an image that flashes up at the moment of its
                recognizability, and is never seen again” (390).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Benjamin’s account of the “flitting” and “flashing” of the image appears as something like a refrain in his work, and not only as the “true” form of the past’s historicity. See for instance the 1933 fragment “On the Mimetic Faculty”: “The mimetic element in language can, like a flame, manifest itself only through a kind of bearer [<emph>Trager</emph>]. This bearer is the semiotic element. Thus, the
                            nexus of meaning of words or sentences is the bearer through which, like
                            a flash, similarity appears. For its production by man—like its
                            perception by him—is in many cases, and particularly the most important,
                            tied to its flashing up. It flits by [<emph>Sie huscht vorbei</emph>]” (722).</note> For Benjamin, the <emph>truth</emph> of history is its status as an image: fragile, transient, fugitive.
                The Benjaminian historian is one who “ceases to tell the sequence of events like
                beads of a rosary” and resists the poverty of historicism’s directive to “establish
                a causal nexus” among consecutive events and its prescription to tell the past “as
                it really was” (397). For Benjamin, the truth of history is not its sequential
                narrative but its composition as images that coalesce in a constellation, connecting
                cultural phenomena that might be separated by epochs. The task of the cultural
                historian, according to Benjamin, is to seize those “flitting” images as they
                “flash” first by recognizing oneself <emph>as seized by them</emph> and
                then learning to behold the constellations these images form, often under disparate
                historical conditions. This is how I hope to position myself in order to seize and
                release—in other words, to <emph>redeem</emph>—the Bowie-image for the
                constellation we call Romanticism.<note place="foot" resp="author"> My “seize and release” metaphor is inspired by Jacques Khalip and Rob Mitchell’s introduction to <emph>Releasing the Image</emph>.</note>

                  <head>“singled out for a great gift”: the Bowie-image</head>
                  <p>What fans of Bowie often call his various “personae”—Major Tom, Ziggy Stardust,
                Aladdin Sane, The Thin White Duke, etc.—I prefer to call his images: those that he
                fashioned in songs and performance as well as those that fashioned him to his
                audiences. The Bowie-Image flickers in a Benjaminian “constellation” that relays us
                from the glittering Romanticism of Shelley and Keats to Pater and Wilde, all by way
                of Todd Haynes. Therefore, the text I regard as the “alpha star” of this
                constellation is not a song or performance by Bowie. It is Haynes’s 1998 film which
                takes its title from a Bowie B-side. <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> is an
                ambitious and delirious film about a fictitious episode in 1970s British glam rock,
                a film in which Bowie is and is “not there”: never named as such. The singer in his
                Ziggy days is conjured and “imaged” in the figure of Brian Slade, whose career we
                follow from the end of the 60s through the glam and glitter period until the
                “staged” assassination, which results in “the death of glitter,” a hoax which
                alludes to Bowie’s own faked assassination of his Ziggy Stardust image at the
                Hammersmith Odeon in 1973.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Bowie did not permit any of his own music to be used in the film, though “Velvet Goldmine,” recorded in 1971, is the title of a B-side to a 1975 rerelease of “Space Oddity.” In Oren Moverman’s interview that introduces the published screenplay, Haynes acknowledges that he “wanted the song, along with other Bowie tracks, in the film, but Bowie didn’t feel he wanted to let his music be used in <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>. I think he had some other plan for the songs
                            from the Ziggy era. It was very disappointing to me, . . . [but] I think
                            it ultimately serves the film not to have Bowie’s music . . . because,
                            while they are fantastic songs that can never be matched, I think their
                            absence makes it easier to make Brian Slade his own character”
                            (“Superstardust,” xv–xvi).</note> Though there are no Bowie
                songs in the film, it features music from or inspired by some of the most prominent
                British glam bands of the period—Marc Bolan and T. Rex, Roxy Music, and Brian Eno’s
                early solo records—as well as the New York Dolls, the “glammiest” band on the west
                side of the Atlantic. For the Brian Slade songs of his “Maxwell Demon” period,
                Haynes employed Grant Lee Buffalo and Shudder to Think, a 90s indie version of a
                rock “glam” band, to write several Ziggy-themed songs, which are performed as highly
                stylized music videos.</p>
                  <p> Of course, glam was always as much about the visual as it was the music; and the
                camera lavishes as much attention to the fashion in <emph>Velvet
                    Goldmine</emph> as it does to any character: the feathers, the boas, the make-up,
                the hats, the costumes, the jewelry that made it a <emph>scene</emph> as
                visual as it was musical, as flamboyant and ironic as it was affectively rich and
                jubilant. As Mary Ann Doane puts it, “in <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, the
                complexity of feeling and intelligence is located in glam rock, music that is
                emotionally powerful, moving, and knowingly cynical or ironic, undercutting its own
                seriousness” (14–5).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Doane’s essay is the single most insightful essay I’ve encountered on the ambition and accomplishment of Haynes’s films; and I will have occasion to return to it below. Here I would qualify what is otherwise her laser-like account of the “complexity of feeling and intelligence” in the music: while glam rock is saturated with irony, the best of it is never <emph>musically</emph> “cynical.” In a contemporaneous <emph>City Pages</emph> interview, Haynes delivers the most precise account of the emotional tone of the best of the glam records, especially the early adventurous work of Roxy Music: “the early Roxy Music records that Eno was a part of, and the few that followed, sum up the most interesting dualities between this highly referenced, tongue-in-cheek kind of musical presentation and, <emph>somehow</emph>, this incredibly emotional quality at the same
                            time. That combination still baffles me, and it’s something that I tried
                            with all my gumption to bring to the film itself.”
                    (Nelson).</note> This “complexity of feeling and intelligence” extends
                to the many cinematic genres and styles the film invokes “knowingly” and lovingly
                without ever quite adopting one predominant mode: moments of fable, examples of
                music videos, B-movie sci-fi, Busby Berkeley musicals, the
                <emph>Citizen Kane</emph> investigation, biopic,
                documentary, Fassbinder’s melodrama, jittery super-8s, even his own experimental
                animated bio-film about the life and death of Karen Carpenter. This cinematic
                kaleidoscope of visual and generic prisms makes it clear that <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> is not a film <emph>about</emph> Bowie or even
                glam rock as much as it is a cinematic fable of a queer cultural history and the
                political, sexual, and artistic possibilities opened by the “glittering” eruption of
                a “glam” spirit and “the electric life”—the “vital tendencies”—of these astonishing
                songs and performances, this momentary “spirit of the age” in London’s 1970s
                underground. It is, as I argue elsewhere, “an allegory of cultural history in the
                vein of Benjamin, Wilde, and Shelley,” which is to say a Romantic cultural
                    history.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In “On the Currency of Images: Percy Shelley’s Minor Event,” I focus primarily on the role of the image in Shelley’s <emph>The Triumph of
                                Life</emph>; and I also examine a couple of brief scenes from Haynes’s film. I regard the essay as a companion to the present one. And I regard Shelley’s <emph>Defense</emph> and Wilde’s “The English Renaissance of Art” as kindred examples of the mode of cultural history Benjamin develops in his “Theses.” See <emph>Art’s
                                Undoing</emph>, 37–47 and 210–5. To this constellation I would add Greil Marcus’s <emph>Lipstick
                                Traces</emph>, a book to which Haynes also pays homage as he tracks across a series of glam rock album covers in a record store, and we see one of Slade’s fictional singles bearing the title <emph>Lipstick
                            Traces</emph>.</note>
                What we encounter in this remarkable film is what Joel Faflak, in an essay about
                Shelley’s relationship to some other film musicals, describes as “images that body
                forth life, then compromise any return to life itself” (168).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Faflak’s formulation deserves to be quoted more fully: “<emph>The Triumph of
                            Life</emph> reflects a society of the spectacle still in visual flux. But it predicts a history fascinated by the production of image that body forth life, then compromise any return to life itself.”	The topic of Romanticism and “life” (or Romantic “vitality”) has been a rich and compelling site of research over the past ten to fifteen years. While my own interest here is in aesthetic life and life’s aestheticization, I want to acknowledge some of the signal studies on the topic that have most influenced my thinking. See Denise Gigante; Sara Guyer; Jacques Khalip, <emph>Anonymous Life</emph>; Sharon Ruston; Ross Wilson; and Amanda Jo
                                Goldstein.</note> But, as Shelley himself asks in the
                famous prose fragment he composed on the back of notebook in 1819, “What is life?”:
                this is a question that Shelley, characteristically, doesn’t answer, but “leaves” as
                “a vacancy” (<emph>SPP</emph> 506, 507). We are
                better equipped by the poet to say what Shelleyan “life” is <emph>not</emph>: it’s not a personal possession or subjective quality; and its truth
                is not revealed by religion or empiricism or historicism. It’s certainly more
                Shelleyan to ask what the figure of life <emph>does</emph>; and one of the
                best examples of that is one I quoted above in passing: “electric life.” In the
                final aspirational paragraph of <emph>A Defense of Poetry</emph>, when
                Shelley is assessing the “compositions of the most celebrated writers of the present
                day,” he asserts that “it is impossible to read” them “without being startled with
                the electric life which burns within their words” (<emph>SPP</emph> 535).
                Shelleyan life is <emph>poetic</emph>, measured by the force of its
                “electricity,” just as Wilde’s “vital tendency” is the electric current that
                activates aesthetic expressions, and Benjamin’s “images” flash through a darkness
                that receives them. Thus, for Shelley and for Wilde, as for Benjamin and Haynes,
                “life” is delivered in images and measured by its “maximization” <emph>and</emph> its “compromise.” This describes <emph>Velvet
                    Goldmine</emph>’s affective oscillation, its “alternating currents”: “<emph>Although what you are about to see is a work of fiction</emph>,”
                reads a line drawn across the bottom of the dark screen before the images appear,
                    “<emph>it should be played at maximum volume</emph>.”</p>
                  <p> This work of cinematic fiction orbits around two principal performers of the period,
                Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), “images that body
                forth” Bowie and Iggy Pop during their unlikely collaborations in the mid 1970s. In
                Haynes’s depiction of this relationship, Slade, a long-haired “shirt-lifter from
                Birmingh’m,” is struggling to make his queer torch-song cabaret act work in an
                afternoon slot at an outdoor “hippie” rock festival in Southwest England. Dressed in
                a long purple frock, Slade performs an acoustic version of Steve Harley’s folky
                “Sebastian” for “rock audiences bred on Creedence Clearwater and the Beatles” who
                “were not entirely sure what to make of this particular brand of revolt”: “Get the
                fuck off! Cut the shite! Bugger off, you wooftah!” Following this dismissive
                reception by a meager but abusive and homophobic audience, Slade angrily storms out
                of his tent at the moment the festival announcer introduces Curt Wild: “all the way
                from New York City, lead singer and founder of the greatest garage band known to
                mankind.” In the next shot, we behold Brian Slade, his back to the camera, suddenly
                seized by a primal scream onstage, the opening of Wild’s electrifying version of the
                Stooges’s “T.V. Eye.” Abruptly turning his face to the stage, Slade is arrested by
                Wild’s eruptive snarling proto-punk vocalization which comes out of the dark and
                from nowhere, a throaty guttural wail that could only be apprehended as “music” in
                the context of the fringes of rock and roll.</p>
                  <p> In Haynes’s cinematic fable, this moment of ecstatic seizure is the unlikely origin
                of glam rock. I call it unlikely, because “Maxwell Demon”—the “glam” persona Slade
                fashions in the aftermath of this concert—bears no resemblance to Ewan McGregor’s
                Curt Wild or his stage representation of that iconic Iggy Pop garage song, just as
                there was certainly nothing ever “glammy” about Iggy or the Stooges. Wild’s version
                of “T.V. Eye” has no evident visual or musical connection to anything glam or
                glitter, other than the can of gold dust he sprinkles over his naked chest and then
                lewdly gestures with in the mode of a golden shower before he strips entirely in the
                course of the song and concludes with a punk-rock stage-dive over flames.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “T.V. Eye” is a fascinating example of this affinity, given Bowie’s participation in the live album versions released in 1977.</note>
                Nor does the theatrical flamboyance of Slade’s subsequent campy “Maxwell Demon”
                videos resemble Curt Wild’s manic proto-punk performance, just as the crucial
                personal and musical collaborations between Bowie and Pop never involved a
                resemblance or melding of musical styles or genres or themes. Their connection was
                what Benjamin would call a sort of pop music “elective affinity,” one which Haynes
                makes into an “electric” affinity in his fantasy of the affective and aesthetic
                connection between Slade and Wild. No rock music historicist would describe the
                origins of glam rock as Haynes conceives these “resonant images;” but this is how
                Benjamin teaches us to understand the <emph>current</emph> that connects
                these distinctive “images, making them resonate.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Haynes describes Bowie’s role in glam rock, “he was the most articulate spokesperson of that period; he brought the most resonant images to the glam era. Even though Marc Bolan started the movement, Bowie brought it to an amazing level of sophistication, both musically and visually” (“Superstardust,” xvi). </note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Curt Wild’s back story is presented in voice-over by Cecil (Michael Feast), Slade’s
                first manager during the ongoing live performance of “T.V. Eye” which is intercut
                with tracking shots over the rowdy audience and tight reaction shots of Slade: “<emph>when Curt was fourteen, he was discovered by his mother in the
                    family loo, at the ‘service’ of his older brother and promptly shipped off for
                    eighteenth months of electric shock treatment</emph>.” In a POV shot, the young
                Curt, strapped to a gurney and hooked up to electrodes, sees his older brother give
                him a wink as a nurse bends over to initiate the treatment. “<emph>The
                    doctors guaranteed the treatment would fry the fairy clean out of him</emph>,”
                continues the narration, “<emph>but all it did was make him bonkers
                    every time he heard electric guitar</emph>.” At this point, the film cuts back to
                flames erupting over the foot of the stage as Wild, in the words of the screenplay,
                “shrieking defiantly,” dives over them into the audience
                (<emph>Velvet</emph> 43). In the final shot of the
                scene, the camera again cuts to Slade in “rapt attention” as he responds to the leap
                with a sudden involuntary smile that slowly dissolves into a look of calculating
                envy.</p>
                  <p> In Haynes’s cinematic version of a queer cultural history, beginnings are always
                fables, legends, folklore; and when his film asks where images come from, it is
                never in the service of a straight historicism. If “legend has it” that Wild’s queer
                excursions with his older brother and the subsequent “electroshock” therapy are
                merely “legendary,” the “electric current” that forms this piece of folklore seizes
                Brian Slade at the moment it ignites the stage: the scene establishes the current
                that runs between the two performers and inaugurates the unlikely beginnings of glam
                rock. The charge of this beginning is all the more unusual given that the primitive
                three-chord electric guitar featured in Iggy Pop’s band, the Stooges, and in Curt
                Wild’s simulacrum band called the “Rats,” is not a feature of any of the musical
                instrumentations of glam rock.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I am not suggesting that the electric guitar is not an important feature of glam rock, but that it has a very different role in the mix of instruments, one that rarely features solos and often, as with the early Roxy Music records in particular, can sound as if it has been routed through the fuzziest of synthesizers and is much less prominent than Andy McKay’s alto saxophone, arguably Roxy Music’s “lead” instrument.</note>
                For Brian Slade, the thrilling event of the opening “shriek” of Wild’s performance
                is entirely affective, the charge of a sensation as “sudden” as that which Shelley
                describes in the fifth stanza of “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty” when the poet feels
                the “shadow” of beauty fall upon him: “I shrieked, and clasped my hands in extacy!”
                (ll. 55–60). In Haynes’s version of this “conversion,” it is the “shriek”—certainly
                one of the great inaugurating shrieks in rock history—that falls on Slade and seems,
                as Francis Bacon might describe the affect, to “come off directly onto the nervous
                    system.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In his extraordinary series of interviews with David Sylvester, Bacon repeats this phrase often enough that it becomes a refrain for his project, one which he describes as “a kind of tightrope walk between what is called figurative painting and abstraction. It will go right out from abstraction but will really have nothing to do with it. It’s an attempt to bring the figurative thing up onto the nervous system more violently and more poignantly” (12). Later in this same interview he will describe the relationship between narrative and the image with the same refrain: “it’s a very, very close and difficult thing to know why some paint comes across directly onto the nervous system and other paint tells you the story in a long diatribe through the brain” (18). The “Bacon-Universe,” his images as well as his words, form a crucial “node” in Deleuze’s constellation; and he adopts Bacon’s refrain in his own project to characterize the relationship between art and affect. See especially his chapters on “Painting and Sensation” and “Painting Forces” in <emph>Francis Bacon</emph>, 31–8 and 48–54.</note> As Haynes
                describes it in the screenplay, Slade stops, “stricken by what he sees.” The event
                of the shriek produces what, in “Hot One,” Slade’s first genuine “glam” song, he
                calls a “momentary seizure”: it’s a conversion experience in which a performer is
                yoked into spectatorship and suddenly transformed, like a sea-change, into something
                rich and strange, the feathered angels of David Bowie and Roxy Music.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “Hot One” is one of two numbers in the film that are not covers of Glam or Glam-era songs. In the temporal looping of the film’s narrative structure, “Hot One,” written and performed by the band Shudder to Think, tells the story of Maxwell Demon, Slade’s Ziggy-like glam persona.</note>
                Throughout the film, staged performances are often experienced or remembered as
                forms of a “momentary seizure”: not only Slade’s beholding of Wilde, but Cecil’s
                “seizure” by Slade’s early performance of Roxy Music’s “2HB” at the Sombrero Club in
                Kensington or Arthur Stuart’s (Christian Bale) reaction when he hears Cecil utter
                the name “Curt Wild.” Whether in the moment of beholding, or its recollection, the
                film addresses the many forms of aesthetic address and “seizure” that reference the
                nature of aesthetic identification and the more rarified version of it known as
                “fandom.”</p>
                  <p> In <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, “glam rock” is not so much a clearly
                defined musical genre as it is, in the Shelleyan sense, the momentary appearance of
                a queering spirit that, as Faflak puts it, “bodies forth life” and erupts in its
                “maximized” form from London’s underground in the 1970’s as a utopian possibility, a
                fleeting but thrilling moment of affective redemption. When the film flashes forward
                in time, we find ourselves in “New York in 1984,” a world in which this spirit has
                been dispatched or “compromised.” This New York is a lifeless Reagan-era urbanscape
                in which the musical, cultural, and sexual excitement and potentiality of the
                London’s glam moment has been drained of its color: a grey, washed-out world of
                cultural regression and political repression. Arthur Stuart is a journalist—“the
                resident Brit”—for a New York newspaper assigned to write a story on the mysterious
                disappearance of Brian Slade ten years after. Stuart’s investigation—has Slade
                re-surfaced as the surgically reconstructed right-wing arena-rock star “Tommy Stone”
                who proclaims the most reactionary American values?—is really only a lure. Whatever
                the “real story” of the assassination hoax—one derived from Bowie’s own onstage
                “killing off” of Ziggy—Brian Slade and the spirit of the Bowie-image have “passed
                away,” leaving “our state, / This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate”
                (“Hymn to Intellectual Beauty” ll. 15–7). And though the film’s structural allusion
                to <emph>Citizen Kane</emph> is its central narrative conceit, Haynes
                shifts his principal focus to the “reporter”: unlike
                <emph>Kane’s</emph> Jerry Thompson, Bale’s Arthur
                Stuart, the figure who beheld the glittering eruption of glam rock and lives in the
                aftermath of its demise, is a prominent object of the film’s narrative attentions.
                In the guise of journalistic research, Haynes zeroes in on how Stuart’s relationship
                to a personal past that orbits around a painful adolescent “coming out” that was
                bound up with the liberating and erotically charged images and music of glam. Stuart
                revisits this era, one that he seems to have withheld from himself, with a wistful
                but unspoken nostalgia for what might have been: the memories of his own fandom, his
                own tortured relationship to his sexual orientation, and his own brush with the
                stars.</p>
                  <p> The nested stories and virtuoso story-telling of <emph>Velvet
                    Goldmine</emph> have received many treatments and discussions, to my knowledge
                none more detailed and urgent than Nick Davis’s “Theses on a Philosophy of Queer
                History,” which opens with this illuminating characterization of the film’s
                narrative structure: “<emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> comprises a bivalve
                narrative structure, . . . suffusing one story with heavy affective fallout from the
                events of a chronologically earlier one, and finding the carryover character . . .
                suspended in a woebegone urban existence.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> This is the final chapter to Davis’s exciting and provocative queering of the Deleuzian cinema-image, <emph>The
                            Desiring-Image</emph>, 206–46. I won’t be able to do justice to Davis’s ambitious “Deleuzian-Benjaminian” reading of <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, a reading which is both dazzling and deeply
                            felt. Ultimately, the chapter seems like an extended and urgent closing
                            meditation on his principal thesis: a Deleuzian “crystal image” and its
                            activation in the “new queer cinema.” Though I’ll again refer to Davis’s
                            chapter and my own “accentual” departure from his reading, I want to
                            acknowledge with what insight Davis’s chapter and book has engaged my
                            understanding of Haynes in particular and the Deleuzian cinematic image
                            in general.</note> Managing to write an entire book chapter on
                the film without a Bowie reference, Davis takes his point of departure from Marcia
                Landy’s claim that <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> is “predicated on the
                question ‘what happened?’ . . . and the film’s technique is investigative” (126).
                This is the decisive question for Landy, whose crisp characterization of the film’s
                generic instability concludes with a reassertion of this question: “The film is
                neither an exposé of stardom, a homage to <emph>Citizen Kane</emph>, a
                conventional biopic, a diatribe against drugs, nor an ‘explanation’ of what went
                wrong [with glam rock]; it is an exploration of ‘what happened’ in and to the
                politics of the 1960s and early 1970s” (126). Amplifying Landy’s account of the
                Benjaminian allusions to the “Theses on the Concept of History” in the film’s
                opening scene, Davis argues that <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> does not
                simply resonate with “Benjamin’s sense of historical crisis, it serially reprises
                the essay’s signature attitude of looking despondently backward, in tandem with its
                famous epitome of the Angel of History” (214).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Davis, <emph>Velvet
                            Goldmine</emph> is not merely a film to be seen but a <emph>reading</emph> with which to reckon: “<emph>Velvet
                            Goldmine</emph> offers as much a sustained reading of ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’ through the prism of queer experience as a glam-and-guitars, sequins-and-sodomy pastiche of <emph>Citizen Kane</emph>” (214).</note>

                splendors is an ambitious thought experiment in which the Bowie-Image and its

                despondent but wistful, occasions for an arresting lyricism: an “attitude” of
                nostalgia which is not only invoked by and expressed in the film but thematized as a
                crucial affective aspect of glam rock, an “attitude” that is something other than
                the hazy regressive sentimentality with which it is most often identified, what
                Jameson, for instance, labels “mere nostalgia”
                    (<emph>Postmodernism</emph> 170).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Though Jameson does refer on occasion to “mere nostalgia” as a “reflex,” <emph>Postmodernism</emph> explores in compelling forms the workings of
                                what we might call a second order nostalgia, especially with regard

                            19–22.</note> For Haynes, the images of the Hollywood
                “silver screen” punctuate the film like icons of a conjured age. Slade and Wild are
                treated by their manager as if they belonged to “those vintage years”: “Tracy and
                Hepburn for the seventies.” Brando, Rooney, Garbo are among the Hollywood stars
                name-dropped as if it were a Frank O’Hara poem. Early in the film, Haynes has a BBC
                commentator describe the movement as “glamour, nostalgia, and outrageousness.” And
                though as Slade’s wife Mandy says, “Brian believed in the future,” we first see him
                performing Roxy Music’s “2HB” in Kensington’s Sombrero Club in the early 70s. The
                song and its dedicatory title—“to Humphrey Bogart”—invoke and enact the glamour of
                cinematic nostalgia, twice-over, by creating a song to a cinematic scene which has
                long been a scene of nostalgia, one which reprises Hollywood’s most iconic and
                clichéd utterance: “here’s looking at you, kid.” By deploying and by naming
                nostalgia as something to be reclaimed, Haynes offers images of the cultural past
                that are something other than our received ideas of “mere nostalgia”: his is a
                memory of a past which never existed except in the present tense of the cinematic
                image, its own sound and vision. When “2HB” appears again later in the film—at the
                concert called “Death to Glitter”—it comes as a nostalgic good-bye to the genre and
                its stars, including the departed Brian Slade, who appears as a projected image
                above the stage and as a shadowy presence off stage. This version of the song is
                performed by Jack Fairy, Haynes’s fictional “patron saint of the movement,” himself
                more an image than a character. His performance at the tribute concert positions him
                as origin and as end of this fleeting episode of cultural history, one which pivots
                around the figures of nostalgia for this dead star: “Your memory stays / It lingers
                ever / Fade away never.” Like every invocation of nostalgia in the film, its effects
                conjure Shelley’s account in his “Hymn” of beauty’s departures from our world, “like
                hues and harmonies of evening / Like clouds in starlight widely spread, — / Like
                memory of music fled” (ll. 8–10). The Roxy Music song and Haynes’s cinematic version
                belongs to this series of “likenesses” and its swirling preface an indication of its
                removal from our world: “Oh I was moved by a screen dream!” “Your cigarette traces a
                    ladder.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> It’s worth noting that the second version of “2HB”—the “Jack Fairy” version—was recorded by “The Venus in Furs,” a band formed for the film that refers to Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s novella and to the Velvet Underground song of that name.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> How are we to assess this Romantic nostalgia that attends to Haynes’s representation
                of glam rock, not only in this emblematic song by Roxy Music but in the
                presentations of the Bowie-Image? To call it a “critical nostalgia” seems oxymoronic
                enough to drain both terms of their meaning. To call it “ironic nostalgia” cancels
                its affective force. How, then, do we characterize the form of Romantic nostalgia
                which “knows” that what it remembers is only an image? What do we call a nostalgia
                that knows what it evokes in memory was always only an image but that <emph>feels</emph> that <emph>image</emph>
                to be true? The <emph>OED</emph> defines nostalgia as “severe
                home-sickness”: a “form of melancholia caused by prolonged absence from one’s home
                or country;” and it records the earliest uses of the word nostalgia, not
                surprisingly, in the era we associate with Romanticism. However, when it first
                appears in English in 1780, it is found not in poetry but in medical discourse:
                nostalgia is a term coined by Dr. William Cullen for the malady that afflicted
                soldiers during long military campaigns in foreign lands. In <emph>A
                    Complete Dictionary of Music,</emph> Rousseau devoted an entry to the particular
                    “<emph>mal de Suisse</emph>” or “homesickness” produced by the simple
                but often irregular melodies played and sung by Alpine mountaineers. Rousseau claims
                one such melody “was forbidden to be played . . . upon pain of death, because it
                made them burst into tears, desert, or, die, whoever heard it; so great a desire did
                it excite in them of returning to their country” (266–7).</p>
                  <p> The status of nostalgia in Rousseau is the principal point of contention in what is
                perhaps the most important—or at least the most celebrated—theoretical dispute
                between the two figures most directly associated with deconstruction, Jacques
                Derrida and Paul de Man. One of the principal objects of Derrida’s painstaking
                deconstruction in <emph>Of Grammatology</emph> is
                Rousseau’s nostalgic “longing for presence” that manifests itself in the
                phonocentrism of his theory of language. Rousseau’s accounts of the seductions of
                native songs might appear to reinforce Derrida’s argument that the Swiss philosopher
                reinscribes the metaphysical privileging of the voice over writing. Derrida’s
                “interpretation of Rousseau,” famously prompted de Man to respond with “The Rhetoric
                of Blindness” which claims that Rousseau is not in fact guilty of the nostalgia for
                presence that Derrida ascribes to the Swiss philosopher. According to de Man,
                Rousseau’s theory of language doesn’t <emph>call for</emph> Derrida’s
                deconstruction, because Rousseau has already performed the dismantling of nostalgia
                for which Derrida takes credit. “The elegiac tone that is occasionally sounded [in
                Rousseau] does not express a nostalgia for an original presence,” says de Man, “but
                is a purely dramatic device, an effect made possible and dictated by a fiction that
                deprives the nostalgia of all foundation” (133). If we believe that this exchange
                set in motion two “tracks” of deconstruction—at least in the North American
                context—then perhaps the exchange pivots on what Gayatri Spivak describes of other
                such charges of “metaphysics” by sparring philosophers: “perhaps this entire
                argument hangs on who <emph>knew</emph> how much of what he was doing”
                    (<emph>Grammatology</emph> xxxvvviii). I’m less interested here in
                taking sides in this sparring match as I am in suggesting how significant nostalgia
                is not only for the sounds and visions of popular culture but for the most
                adventurous theoretical undertakings. In fact, what de Man says of Rousseau’s
                nostalgia could be said verbatim about the images of nostalgia in <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>: “The elegiac tone that is occasionally sounded [in
                Haynes] does not express a nostalgia for an original presence, but is a purely
                dramatic device, an affect made possible and dictated by a fiction that deprives the
                nostalgia of all foundation.” To this we might add that for both Rousseau and
                Haynes, the “purely dramatic device” that “knows” that it is a “fiction” does not
                “deprive the nostalgia” of all <emph>affect</emph>.</p>
                  <p> Derrida’s <emph>Of Grammatology</emph> undertakes the deconstruction of
                any and all sources of nostalgia—speech, presence, the origin, etc. Perhaps the
                underlying target of Derrida’s deconstructive project is the metalepsis of nostalgia
                as an affect that <emph>posits</emph> origins and presences that it comes
                to believe in, after the fact. Early in her translator’s preface, Spivak stresses
                precisely this affective dimension of Derrida’s turn from the “Rousseauist”
                orientation of Levi-Strauss to Nietzsche: “Derrida contrasts Rousseau’s melancholy
                with Nietzsche’s affirmative joy”; and she goes on to quote the passage from
                “Structure, Sign, and Play” which declares and performs this turn and in the process
                declares its break from structuralism: “Turned toward the presence, lost or
                impossible, of the absent origin, [the] structuralist thematic of broken
                immediateness is thus the sad, <emph>negative</emph>, nostalgic, guilty
                Rousseauistic aspect of the thought of play of which the Nietzschean <emph>affirmation</emph> – the joyous affirmation of the play of the
                world, . . . The affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without truth,
                without origin, offered to an active interpretation – would be the other side”
                (<emph>Grammatology</emph> xiii). This “Nietzschean
                affirmation” is made possible by “the gigantic ebullience” of “an <emph>active</emph> forgetfulness” that Derrida pursues in lieu of what he considers
                the nostalgia of Rousseau’s melancholy metaphysics of a lost presence. It was
                Nietzsche, writes Spivak emphatically, who “cracked apart” the metaphysics of
                presence “and then advocated forgetting that fact! . . . It is difficult to imagine
                a solution to the problem [of the metaphysical inheritance] that would go beyond
                Nietzsche’s, to know and then actively to forget, convincingly to offer in his text
                his own misreading”
                (<emph>Grammatology</emph> xxviii). If it is
                “difficult to imagine a solution to the problem that would go beyond Nietzsche’s,”
                what might it mean to have both: the “joyous affirmation of the play of the world,”
                a “gigantic ebullience” <emph>oscillating</emph> with the melancholy
                nostalgia of perpetual loss, of the path of beauty’s departure from the world? What
                happens if we are presented with a movie <emph>about</emph> this
                oscillation and its effects and affects, two opposing dispositions in the same text,
                with their own full range of images and depletions?</p>
                  <p> Perhaps the most surprising feature of the <emph>OED</emph>’s etymological
                record is how recently the meaning of nostalgia as a melancholic affliction for
                one’s home expanded to a longing for a period or a person or an object. Once the era
                of technological reproducibility commences, nostalgia’s domain extends further
                still, to the affective experience evoked by an old photo or recorded song, indeed,
                by any form of <emph>visual</emph> or
                <emph>audio</emph> image that conjures an emotional
                relationship to a remembered person or place or period. Giorgio Agamben (who belongs
                to the constellation of philosophers reflecting on the temporal, epistemological,
                and affective aspects of nostalgia) invokes a brief note by Roland Barthes as his
                point of departure to the question that is posed by Agamben’s essay and, I argue, by
                Haynes’s film: “What Is the Contemporary?” Barthes’s declaration is, as Agamben
                notes, Nietzschean: “the contemporary is the untimely” (Agamben 40). For Nietzsche,
                as Barthes and Agamben characterize his <emph>Untimely Meditations</emph>,
                “those who are truly contemporary” are not those who
                <emph>reflect</emph> or <emph>express</emph> their time: “those who are truly contemporary,” writes Agamben
                “are those who neither perfectly coincide with [their time] nor adjust themselves to
                its demands. They are thus in this sense irrelevant. But precisely because of this
                condition, precisely through this disconnection and this anachronism, they are more
                capable than others of perceiving and grasping their own time” (40). This
                “non-coincidence” is precisely our film’s “condition.” <emph>Velvet
                    Goldmine</emph> is, on the one hand, acutely aware of time and dates and it marks
                them carefully: 1854, “100 years later,” New Year’s night 1969, 1972, 1984, and
                beyond. And yet the film never feels as if it <emph>belongs</emph> to any
                of those moments; and the strongest historical affect the film generates is its
                disconnection with a past which also appears as the “new,” as in the way that Bowie
                in those early days looked and dressed more like Lauren Bacall than a rock and roll
                star.</p>
                  <p> “Naturally,” writes Agamben, “this noncoincidence, this ‘dys-chrony,’does not mean
                that the contemporary is a person who lives in another time, a nostalgic who feels
                more at home in the Athens of Pericles or in the Paris of Robespierre and the
                marquis de Sade than in the city and time in which he lives” (41). “Naturally” is an
                odd qualifier to describe this temporal “noncoincidence,” since nostalgia is often
                claimed to be a “natural” and pre-critical impulse. But this is an index of the
                difficulty of prying nostalgia loose from its “homesickness”; and ultimately Agamben
                is working to develop an understanding of the contemporaneous as “<emph>that relationship with time that adheres to it through a disjunction and an
                    anachronism</emph>” (41). This is Haynes’s “relationship with time” in <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, a cinematic relationship that releases the
                images of history from their obligations to reflect or express their moment and then
                relays those images to possibilities produced by temporal disjunctions. These are
                Haynes’s own “untimely meditations,” achieved through a new filmic practice of
                anachronism. <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> accomplishes this not only
                through the countless flashbacks and flashforwards in this shuffled “flipbook” of
                narrative time loops, but also because its cinematic depictions of the narrative
                present tense—extended scenes not prefaced or accompanied by recollecting
                voice-over—often emit images of pasts and futures: there are visual and auditory
                references to eras which have receded that are “shot through,” as Benjamin would
                say, with “now time” [<emph>Jetzeit</emph>] and there are haunted images
                of a time to come, one the film will never “know.” If “2HB,” which circulates like
                the movie’s refrain, is the paradigm for this nostalgic allure of a past captured in
                the image of the departed film star, there’s another image that addresses this
                temporal disjunction which lodges itself as a nostalgia for that which has <emph>yet to appear</emph>. In the film’s late scenes, Haynes lingers over
                Curt Wild’s uncanny resemblance to Kurt Cobain and deposits a future that the film
                “images” but does not narrate, a future which resides in the spectator’s past and
                elicits what Robert Christgau called “an aura of painful regret,” projecting a once
                future and now lost redemption, its “present” doubly displaced. In the expanding
                universe of <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, the emerald broach is passed
                beyond the narrative frame, generating relays the film “images” without showing,
                images that bleed into the extra-fictional world of the film, into our own
                collective image-world of memories and laments. I offer one such memory that
                registers as a lament on so many levels: in one of the final performances of
                Cobain’s life, for MTV’s “Nirvana Unplugged,” he covers “a David Bowie song”: “The
                Man Who Sold the World.”</p>

                  <head>“for your image”: found and lost in the stars</head>
                  <p>“In the firmament that we observe at night,” writes Agamben, “the stars shine
                brightly, surrounded by a thick darkness.” Agamben is more interested here in the
                nature of this “thick darkness” that makes the stars shine so brightly in the
                firmament than he is in those celestial objects themselves. He takes his guide from
                astrophysics: “In an expanding universe, the most remote galaxies move away from us
                at a speed so great that their light is never able to reach us. What we perceive as
                the darkness of the heavens is this light that, though traveling toward us, cannot
                reach us, since the galaxies from which the light originates move away from us at a
                velocity greater than the speed of light” (46). The celestial darkness teaches how
                the stars disappear completely, in a vanishing that makes constellations possible to
                behold.</p>
                  <p> Likewise, <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> opens not with
                our star, Brian Slade (“The Bowie-Image”), but with a disorienting POV shot among
                the stars in the midst of a nighttime constellation with audio samples of old
                muffled British radio recordings, overlapping transmissions beaming through space
                from different epochs. Haynes’s published screenplay imagines the temporality of
                this scene in more granular detail: “the sound of distant waves rises up. Sounds
                emerge in succession: gunfire, explosions, rinky-tink piano, children at play,
                bar-room singing, opera . . . each enveloping the other like the sound of time
                itself passing” (<emph>Velvet</emph> 3). In the
                film’s final version, “the sound of time itself passing” is a muffled din which
                gives way to the magisterial voice of Janet McTeer, our temporary narrator,
                delivering what sounds like a lost fragment of a thesis from Benjamin’s final
                meditations on history: “<emph>Histories, like ancient ruins, are the
                    fictions of empires. While everything forgotten hangs in dark dreams of the
                    past, ever threatening to return.</emph>”<note place="foot" resp="author"> The remainder of this paragraph and the following two paragraphs are revised and augmented versions of paragraphs I originally wrote for “On the Currency of Images.”</note>
                But the film’s initiating voice-over also channels Benjamin’s efforts in an earlier
                essay on Kafka to attend to the “forgotten”: “Everything forgotten mingles with what
                has been forgotten of the pre-historic world, forms countless, uncertain, changing
                compounds, yielding a constant flow of new strange products.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Quoted by Rèda Bensmaïa in “The Kafka Effect,” xii. Bensmaïa’s account of the “Kafka effect” offers an illuminating model for the kind of “constellation” I am proposing here. Without conflating Deleuze and Guattari with Benjamin or even suggesting a resemblance between them, Bensmaïa posits Kafka as what we might describe as their “nodal” connection. The Kafka that Benjamin shares with Deleuze and Guattari is one resistant to the exegetical modes imposed upon him, the Kafka who rejects symbolic, allegorical, mythical, and theological interpretations in order to allow the “Kafka-universe” to emerge, in Deleuze and Guattari’s case the Kafka who introduces a “minor literature.”</note>
                Haynes’s extraction of this Benjaminian recollection feels like the blueprint to his
                cinematic perception of the production/projection of “glam rock”: something from a
                forgotten world that “mingles” with a darker, more distant past, threatening or
                promising to return, a “present” where with “forms countless, uncertain,” and
                “changing compounds,” it yields “a constant flow of new strange products.”</p>
                  <p> From Haynes’s constellation of a nighttime of shooting stars and scattered sound
                transmissions appears a flying saucer, like an image from B-movie stock, that
                suddenly swoops towards Earth amid tufts of space clouds, depositing on a storybook
                Dublin doorstep in 1854 a baby swaddled in a blanket pinned with an emerald green
                broach. Whether bestowed or abandoned, the baby who fell to earth is Oscar Wilde,
                our first “space oddity,” cosmic nomad. We watch along with the Wildes and their
                housekeeper as the spaceship suddenly returns to the stars; and the film then cuts
                to a scene—“100 years later”—featuring a classroom of Irish schoolboys, nine to ten
                years old, who stand one by one in a tight tracking shot declaring their aspirations
                before their prim schoolmaster: “I want to be a barrister,” says one; “I want to be
                a farmer,” and so on, until the final boy, labeled “O. Wilde” and wearing the green
                broach, rises and declares, “I want to be a pop idol.” And as if to demonstrate how
                “Benjaminian” constellations are formed, the subsequent scene is separated from
                Wilde’s arrival by “one hundred years.” The film cuts to a scene of a young boy,
                Jack Fairy, who—after being beaten by a score of bullying schoolmates—lays face down
                in the street, his lip bloodied, and discovers in the dirt and grime the emerald
                broach that had earlier adorned Oscar Wilde. The following scene looks as if it is a
                hand-drawn page in a children’s picture-book: it features a little boy in school
                shorts walking into the sunlight as the female narrator’s voice-over continues: “<emph>Childhood, adults always say, is the best time in life. But as
                    long as he could remember, Jack Fairy knew better</emph>.” The narration continues
                as the film cuts to a series of dark interior shots featuring the head of young Jack
                Fairy bathed in blue light and poised in three different angles before a mirror we
                never quite see. “<emph>Until one mysterious day when Jack would
                    discover that somewhere there were others quite like him, singled out for a
                    great gift</emph>.” Jack Fairy meticulously draws the blood from his wound as if
                it were lipstick until his eyes flash on his reflection, suddenly smiling directly
                at the mirror/camera/spectator as the narrator concludes her overture: “<emph>and one day the whole stinking world would be theirs</emph>.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> It’s impossible to resist recognizing in this sequence of shots the initiating “mirror stage” of the Lacanian imaginary, even if it’s a <emph>misrecognition</emph>. Perhaps it’s better to call it a <emph>redemption</emph> of the Lacanian scenario, or at least a redemption fantasy. Spoken but not yet speaking, battered and bullied, Jack Fairy not only delights in the image of his bodily integrity suddenly reflected in the mirror (which the screenplay specifies as his “mother’s vanity”), he—and we—recognize his image as both subject and object of desire.</note>
                It’s a fleeting image of redemption—the world itself reclaimed or delivered by a
                queer art—but one that sustains the film as fantasy’s redemption. The title sequence
                erupts from this image as if it were <emph>caused</emph> by it: scores of
                giddy glitter kids pour across the Waterloo Bridge in 1972 and fill the streets to
                the jubilant guitars in the opening strains of Brian Eno’s “Needle in a Camel’s Eye”
                on their way to a Brian Slade concert. These twentieth-century boys and girls appear
                like Shelley’s “glorious phantoms” who “burst” from the “graves” of “England in
                1819” to “illumine our tempestuous day” (13–4).</p>
                  <p> Perhaps there is no better way to describe Jack Fairy’s virtual presence in the film
                than as a “glorious phantom”: “singled out for a great gift,” Fairy remains a
                ghostly if glamorous figure in the story. Haynes calls him the “patron saint” of the
                scene, the “real thing which is not real,” the “origin” which is not the origin,
                “erupting spontaneously” (<emph>Velvet</emph> xvii). Jack Fairy is less a
                    <emph>character</emph> in the film than an ephemeral image, passing
                though London’s streets and clubs, the glam <emph>flâneur</emph>. Fairy
                performs one song—a highly stylized version of Roxy Music’s “2HB”—in the “Death to
                Glitter” concert, lip-synching vocals recorded by Thom Yorke. Jack Fairy is just an
                image, one who conveys a transitory image of transit, the transfer of the emerald
                broach from the stars to Oscar Wilde and Fairy and on to Curt Wild before it is
                deposited with Arthur Stuart near the movie’s end. “The pin will keep moving through
                time,” says Haynes, “and be passed on in many different ways”
                (<emph>Velvet</emph> xxviii). The broach is the “true
                image” in Haynes’s cinematic theses on history, one that bestows “the gift of sound
                and vision” upon those who wait.</p>
                  <p> In the Haynes universe of <emph>Velvet Goldmine,</emph> we encounter a
                distinctive cinematic account of the image, one that is not only concerned with
                cinematic image-making but with the perpetual play of vanishing and appearance that
                is the condition of the image as such. On the one hand, Haynes’s highly
                self-reflexive filmmaking foregrounds its artifice and its image-making with an
                awareness shared by the most adventurous or extravagant glam artists, David Bowie
                and Roxy Music. But Todd Haynes’s <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> universe is
                also a historical one; and this self-consciousness of image-making relays his film
                and his world to the images of Oscar Wilde and beyond. In so doing, the film
                eliminates any sense of “mereness” from the image. Near the film’s end, Arthur
                approaches Curt sitting alone in a bar. Arthur reveals himself as a journalist to
                Curt and ask about his “old friend,” Brian Slade. Curt avoids the question by
                initiating a cryptic dialogue in which the image itself—its movements, its effects,
                its affects—is at stake. After reflecting, via Wilde, on glam rock’s
                cultural-political ambitions—<emph>change the world! no, change
                    ourselves! okay, but look at the world!—</emph>Arthur notices the antique emerald
                pin on Curt’s leather jacket:
            <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>Arthur: That’s quite a pin you got there. Is it old?</l>
                           <l>Curt: Possibly. It was Oscar Wilde’s. Or so I was told by the person who gave it to
                me. This friend of mine who kinda . . . disappeared . . . some years back. I forget
                where we were. On a trip. But he says to me, ‘Curt, a man’s life is his image.’</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
            At this point Curt passes the pin on to Arthur: “here why don’t you hang to it? I’ve
                had it too long anyway. Go ahead. For your image. . .” That last phrase—“for your
                image”—could serve as the film’s dedication or, better, its <emph>destination</emph>. <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> is a film which, via
                Wilde’s Romanticism, asks us to seek the image in its transit and in its autonomy.
                What Curt calls “your image” is not the representation of “your” personal identity
                nor is it the expression of “your” character. “Your image” is the assertion of
                “your” non-identity, something extractable, fungible, and potentially redeemable.
                    <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> understands the agency and circulation of
                images as an ideal but historical space in which an antique emerald pin and the
                Bowie-image circulate in a constellation that posits a new model of cultural
                history: the “true image.”</p>
                  <p> The Bowie-Image is but one of many in <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, a film
                which presents and beholds those images from the past as Benjamin suggests and then
                bestows them to an open futurity. This cinematic constellation is composed of images
                of relays, from the starlit heavens and the relaying of the gift of Oscar Wilde and
                his bejeweled aestheticism on to what Haynes calls its “designated ancestors,” Jack
                Fairy, Brian Slade, Curt Wild, Kurt Cobain. In Haynes’s film, something happens
                through and between them on a plane that does not really belong to the film’s story
                but exists elsewhere, like a refrain in its images among the stars.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For Christian Metz, Godard exhibits the cinematic “intelligence” we are considering with Haynes, a capacity “to suggest with a great deal of truth, but without determining the outcome, several possibilities at the same time. So he gives us a sort of <emph>potential
                            sequence</emph>—an undetermined sequence—that represents a new type of syntagma, . . . <emph>but that remains entirely a figure
                            of narrativity</emph>” (219).</note>
                Or a time-capsule: I can think of no better way than this to describe the film’s
                redemptive closing scene, a giddy super-8 memory-fantasy of a night of 70s rooftop
                sex between Curt and Arthur. Recalling that night, Arthur says, “he called it a
                freedom. A freedom you can allow yourself. Or not.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> I am grateful to Jacques Khalip for the gift of this image of the “time-capsule.”</note>
                In his <emph>Dialogues</emph> with Claire Parnet, Gilles Deleuze offers a
                beautiful account of the constellation of philosophers that “singled him out”; and
                his construction of this “sky-map” of philosophers conveys the sense of the
                relationships I am suggesting, one that exists in the “ideal space” of <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>:
            <quote>Lucretius, Spinoza, Hume, Nietzsche, Bergson: These thinkers have few relationships
                with each other . . . and yet they do have them. One might say that something
                happens between them, at different speeds with different intensities, which is not
                in one or other, but truly in an ideal space, which is no longer a part of history,
                still less a dialogue among the dead, but an interstellar conversation, between very
                irregular stars, whose different becomings form a mobile bloc which it would be a
                case of capturing, an inter-flight, light-years (Deleuze and Parnet 15–6).</quote>
            Shelley, Wilde, Fairy, Wild-Pop, Slade-Bowie, Cobain: these figures in literary and
                popular culture have “few relationships with each other,” at least those we would
                describe according to the available models of intellectual or cultural history. And
                yet in the “ideal space” of <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> “something
                happens between them, at different speeds with different intensities.” “No longer a
                    <emph>part</emph> of history,” the currency between these “irregular
                stars” constitutes its own sort of pop “interstellar conversation.” As Frank O’Hara
                once said in a poem, “the heavens operate on the star system.”</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>“It was Oscar Wilde’s”</head>
                  <p>In Haynes’s version of the “star system” in which his “heavens operate,” the
                “interstellar conversation” is initiated by Wilde. Haynes’s original dedication for
                his screenplay—“For Oscar Wilde, posing as a sodomite”—quotes and corrects the
                spelling of the infamous visiting card left for Wilde by the Marquess of
                Queensberry, “posing as a somdomite,” thereby redeeming the affront by the father of
                Wilde’s lover, turning it into a celebration. If for Haynes, Jack Fairy is the
                film’s version of the “lost originator of the whole glam thing,” Wilde is its
                “perfect manifestation”:
            <quote>It quickly became clear to me that glam came out of the English tradition of camp and
                applied counter-philosophies about art and culture, which I saw originating from
                Oscar Wilde. To me Wilde became the perfect manifestation of the glam era. . . . I
                think glam rock was the first overt alignment of the notion of the alien with the
                notion of the homosexual—both of which became this fantastical, galvanizing
                potential for musical expression, a potential freedom for kids trapped in their
                dreary lives. The space ship definitely brings in the outsider elements of the
                period, which I attribute to Wilde and dandyism, but it also refers to feelings of
                ‘otherness’ confronted at the time of adolescence.
                (<emph>Velvet</emph> xii–xiii)</quote>
                     <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph> is an “alignment” of the
                Wildean “tradition of camp and applied-counter-philosophies about art and culture”
                with Benjamin’s impulse to “brush” cultural history “against the grain” in order to
                tap into what Haynes calls the “galvanizing potential” of “‘otherness’ and its
                “potential freedom.” “It is about pop culture transforming us momentarily,” as
                Haynes describes it, and becoming in the process an agent of redemption. In so
                doing, Haynes not only participates in the ongoing redemption of Wilde; he reads
                Wilde’s work and his image as <emph>agent</emph> of this redemptive
                potentiality. If Wilde’s epigrammatic poetics is made to be deployed and its
                effectivity measured in the delivery of its utterances, I know of no artwork which
                activates the critical potential and the historical implications of a Wildean
                poetics more effectively than <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>. Wilde’s
                extracted words, epigrams, and dialogues, punctuate the film to such an extent that
                we can say of the movie what Curt says of the emerald broach: “It was Oscar
                Wilde’s.”</p>
                  <p> One of the most remarkable features of Wilde’s epigrams is their ability to resist
                context and avail themselves for extraction. This “extractability” extends to every
                feature of his work: the epigram is his <emph>poesi</emph>s, one that
                Haynes mines from Wilde’s texts and deposits in the mouths of his own characters.
                Mandy Slade (Toni Collette in the Angie Bowie role): “Beauty reveals everything
                because it expresses nothing” (“The Critic as Artist”); Brian Slade: “Man is less
                himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask and he’ll tell you the
                truth” (“The Happy Prince”); Freddi in the press soiree: “The first duty in life is
                to assume a pose. What the second duty is no one yet has found out” (“The Critic as
                Artist”),” etcetera. Though they are spoken as if they were personal declarations of
                the characters, their delivery marks them as epigrammatic, bookish, and gnomic
                extractions which address the film’s ethos of artifice and mirrors, in turn the
                ethos of artifice in the glam and glitter movement. In his final exchange with
                Arthur, Curt delivers famous lines from <emph>Dorian Gray</emph> (1890)—“a
                real artist creates beautiful things and puts nothing of his life into them”—as if
                they were spontaneously uttered as his deepest convictions, but they register to the
                viewer as something quoted. Often, as in the lavish mock “press conference,” staged
                with what Haynes calls “a touch of Louis XIV,” Haynes presents Wilde’s epigrams as
                “quoted texts,” including one extraordinary passage, presented by a reporter
                “reading from a large placard” with a “theatrical” delivery, from an article written
                about Wilde in 1895 for the <emph>Daily Star</emph>: “The Aesthete Gives
                Characteristically / cynical Evidence, Replete with Pointed / Epigram and Startling
                Paradox, while / Explaining his Views on Morality in Art.”</p>
                  <p> One of the most exquisite moments in the film is a scene which concludes the “press
                conference,” a long kiss between Slade and Wild (which reproduces the notorious
                publicity kiss between Bowie and Lou Reed). In a tight closeup, Curt says to Brian:
                “The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips
                rewrite history.” Haynes lifts these two sentences from <emph>The
                    Picture of Dorian Gray</emph> where they are reported as lines written in a letter
                late in the novel to Dorian by one of his former lovers. The words he calls
                “idolatrous” overtake his memory; at this point in the novel, Dorian can no longer
                hear what the words say: they simply reiterate the madness of his situation and his
                impulses. But Haynes hears something else, something Wilde must have heard when he
                wrote these words: the intersection of history with a sculpted and gilded beauty,
                the possibility and even necessity that aesthetics intervenes historically, and a
                queer desire might “rewrite history.” What Haynes extracts from Wilde’s aestheticism
                is not solely the camp theatricality and arch performativity that runs from the
                queer pose of the dandy aesthete to Bowie’s glam pop supernova, but the historical
                stakes of this constellation and its “vital tendencies,” which are themselves both
                extractable and redeemable, in part, as Mandy tells Brian, by “strange people”
                “chosen through their art.” Or as Bowie would sing after his glam days were gone, as
                “the man who fell to earth,” “waiting for the gift of sound and vision.”</p>
                  <p> By way of Benjamin, Haynes also understands that it is the image that connects Wilde
                to Bowie and that it is the “image” that makes this constellation of philosopher,
                playwright, singer-performer, and filmmaker an <emph>historical</emph>
                one. It’s also what makes this constellation Romantic, at least in the Shelleyan
                sense of poetry, not “in the more restricted sense” as verse but more expansively as
                the authors of “music, of the dance and architecture
                and statuary and painting” (<emph>SPP</emph> 512). Like Wilde and
                Benjamin, I believe that we can assert that Haynes’s cinematic vision shares with
                Shelley the aesthetic investment that poetry has the capacity:
            <quote>to defeat the curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of surrounding
                impressions. And whether it spreads its own figured curtain or withdraws life’s dark
                veil from before the scene of things, it equally creates for us a being within our
                being. It makes us the inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is a
                chaos. . . . [I]t purges from our inward sight the film of familiarity which
                obscures from us the wonder of our being. It compels us to feel that which we
                perceive, and to imagine that which we know. It creates anew the universe after it
                has been blunted by reiteration. (<emph>SPP</emph> 533)</quote>
            This is arguably the most epistemologically ambitious and philosophically acute
                catalogue of poetic promises that Romanticism has to offer; and each item would be
                at home in quotable fashion in most any text by Wilde. Each of these promises is
                plugged into the Bowie-Image, especially when it resists the prosaic “curse which
                binds us to the accident of surrounding impressions” and looks instead to the stars
                to “create anew the universe.” In the closing scenes, when Arthur and Curt are
                making love, Arthur’s voice-over is from ten years later: “looking back,” he says,
                Curt “patched through my walls and entered my life . . . in waves.” A few scenes
                later, we return to this little episode, shot in super-8 with voice-over. Arthur
                says, “He called it a freedom.” “A freedom you can allow yourself. Or not.” The
                “vital tendency” that I’ve been tracing from Shelley through Wilde and Benjamin to
                Bowie and Haynes is both redemptive and liberatory: in one form or another each
                calls it “a freedom.” It’s not a <emph>promise</emph> of the image’s
                redemption but a shared and urgent investment in the precious and fragile
                possibility of that redemption, one that is simultaneously aesthetic and historical.
                “It compels us to feel what we know”: It compels us to feel that the image, that
                most transitory and fugitive non-being, will not only be what Bowie calls “the gift
                of sound and vision” but what Benjamin calls the “secret index of history.”</p>
                  <p> “<emph>Or not</emph>.” The catalogue of redemptive promises—for Shelley,
                for Wilde, for Benjamin—remains only possibilities, for which the missed or failed
                redemption might well be the rule and not the exception. Nothing in Shelley, Wilde,
                Benjamin, Haynes, Bowie guarantees the fulfilment of the promised redemption—the
                liberation of the image and the image as liberation—and perhaps “the vital tendency”
                offered from Romanticism to our “now-time” or to another futurity will never find
                its recipient, its “great gift” squandered and lost, merely “floating in a tin can.”
                Perhaps we invest—with a critical urgency that slides into uncritical desperation—in
                “constellations of contemporary romanticism,” “Keats and popular culture,” or “Bowie
                and Romanticism” in order to convince ourselves that Romanticism’s redemptive value
                has not passed us by—eager as we may have been to receive it and make good on
                it—when in fact we may only be what Jacques Khalip calls the “misfit,” the “blip,”
                the “has-been” (<emph>Last Things</emph> xi). Perhaps when we make our
                investments in Romanticism’s potentiality, we are more likely to be left with what
                Shelley calls the “path of its departure.” I want to recall the inaugural
                declaration of <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, the one that accompanies the
                image of Jack Fairy’s triumphant smile, the one that sets the film’s story in
                motion: “one day the whole stinking world would be theirs!” In the instant that the
                young queer Jack Fairy flashes his glammy smile and Brian Eno’s song erupts, we <emph>feel</emph> a jubilation that we can certainly take for redemption,
                even when we <emph>know</emph> that the “whole stinking world” remains
                just that and the beautiful “curve of the lips” doesn’t determine history but
                remains merely its “blips” or “might-have-beens;” and Shelley’s promised
                reconciliation between feeling and knowing is never realized. We know that Wilde’s
                Shelleyan promises of aesthetic redemption in his early lectures on the “English
                Renaissance in Art”—“Love art for its own sake, and then all things that you need
                shall be added to you”—turn into the painful realizations of the prison poetry of
                    <emph>De Profundis</emph>. At the end of his letter to Bosie in
                “carcere et vinculis,” Wilde acknowledges that “society, as we have constituted it,
                will have no place for me, has none to offer.”</p>
                  <p> But what does <emph>redemption</emph> mean for Benjamin or Haynes, or for
                Wilde or Shelley, given that none of them believes that it is a “deliverance from
                sin and its consequences through Christ’s atonement” (<emph>OED</emph>)?
                Though Benjamin uses the theologically charged <emph>Erlösung</emph> for
                his notion of historical redemption, Werner Hamacher makes a compelling case that
                Benjaminian redemption is derived not from “a straight-forwardly Judeo-Christian
                theology” but is closer to <emph>Einlösung</emph>, the more prosaic
                redemption of deposits or vouchers; and if it “points towards a theology,” it’s the
                “theology of the missed or distorted – hunchbacked – possibilities” (40).
                “Lower-case redemption” we might call it. The <emph>OED</emph> offers us
                the English-language gift of such a definition: if redemption means “deliverance
                from sin,” it can also mean the “action of freeing a prisoner, captive, or slave by
                payment or ransom.” This is the mode of redemption on which Wilde reflects “in Her
                Majesty’s Prison, Reading”: “Religion does not help me,” he writes to Bosie, “when I
                think about Religion at all, I feel as if I would like to found an order for those
                who cannot believe: the Confraternity of Fatherless one might call it, where on an
                altar, on which no taper burned, a priest in whose heart peace had no dwelling,
                might celebrate with unblessed bread and a chalice empty of wine”
                (<emph>De Profundis</emph> 1019). Wilde’s “order,”
                the “Confraternity of the Fatherless,” seeks redemption not in atonement but in the
                release from captivity, what Curt Wild also “called a freedom. A freedom you can
                allow yourself. Or not.” This redemption is not the deliverance of the sinner, but
                the <emph>release</emph> of the captive—the misfit, the queer, the
                alien—from the Judeo-Christian narrative. The model for this mode of redemption—a
                redemption from Redemption—is located in the notion of the image we’ve traced
                through this constellation of artists and poets and philosophers, an image which
                like <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>’s emerald broach, <emph>seizes and releases</emph>. If it offers an image of
                freedom, it’s because the freedom belongs to the image itself, its agency and its
                currency. Benjamin called it “the true image,” the one that escapes the chronologies
                of history and “flashes up,” but only at the moment of <emph>its</emph>
                “recognizability.” I can think of no better name for this image than “the gift of
                sound and vision,” though the most that those of us in the “Confraternity of the
                Fatherless” can count on is the “waiting.” But that itself is gift enough, since we
                all know what we feel: this refrain is the best part of that song.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay argues that David Bowie’s explorations of identity can meaningfully be
                    linked to explorations of the same topic by Enlightenment philosophers. It analyses
                    these connections in both Bowie’s work and his life and considers the ways in which
                    that life and work extend the thinking of John Locke, David Hume, and George
                    Berkeley to offer a new possible construction of identity, one that depends on the
                    viewer rather than the viewed.</p>

               <p>All culture has a history, of course. We can trace Lord Byron back to Alexander Pope;
                we can trace David Bowie back to the Beat movement.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Kevin Cann writes that in the
                            autumn of 1961 Bowie frequented “central London’s beatnik haunt
                            Trafalgar Square to talk to the denizens about Kerouac and the Beat
                            movement” (21).</note> But every history has its own history:
                we can trace Pope back to Horace and the Beats back to the Enlightenment. This
                lineage of reference prompts a question: Is posterity transitive? If I can link this
                writer to this thinker and this thinker to that thinker, am I justified in linking
                this writer to that thinker? In the case of Byron and Horace the answer is a safe
                “yes,” both because Byron produced a work called “Hints from Horace” and because his
                satire is demonstrably Horatian. The case of Bowie and the Enlightenment, however,
                is less clear. Bowie never acknowledged a debt to Enlightenment philosophy, and what
                critics know of his reading material doesn’t show any direct encounters with it.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Admittedly,
                            the evidence is small—limited to a widely published list of “David
                            Bowie’s Top 100 Books” that originated on his official website. See <ref target="http://www.bowiebookclub.com/david-bowies-100-most-influential-books/">www.bowiebookclub.com/david-bowies-100-most-influential-books/</ref>.</note>
                I would argue, however, that one <emph>can</emph> link Bowie back to the
                Enlightenment, not only because of his connection to the Beats, but also because
                much of his career demonstrates a preoccupation with themes and questions that also
                troubled Enlightenment philosophers. Gavin Budge has suggested that critics might
                profit from exploring Romantic writing’s debt to British Enlightenment philosophy
                (18). This essay offers an exploration of one facet of Bowie’s debt to the same
                movement: his exploration of identity.</p>
               <p>Because “David Bowie” is an elastic term, I want to begin by explaining that the
                David Bowie I consider here is the David Bowie of the years 1972 to 1983. This is
                Bowie’s most fertile period and the one with which he remains most closely
                associated. Moreover, my discussion deals largely with Bowie’s public persona rather
                than his lyrics or music. As Adam Trainer has pointed out, “David Bowie as a
                phenomenon is primarily about performance,” and it is in his public presentation
                that he most clearly engages with Enlightenment thought.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See
                        Adam Trainer’s “‘Well, I Wouldn’t Buy the Merchandise’: David Bowie as
                        Postmodern Auteur.” Although critics have generally tended to consider
                        Bowie’s performance of self rather than his music and lyrics, there are
                        exceptions. See, for example, Wilfred Mellers, “Still Hunky Dory, After All
                        These Years”; Shelton Waldrep, <emph>Future Nostalgia:
                            Performing David Bowie</emph>; and Chris O’Leary, <emph>Rebel
                            Rebel</emph> (itself a descendant of his blog, <emph>Pushing
                            Ahead of the Dame</emph>).</note> I also want to stress that this
                essay is part of the beginning of a longer project that considers Bowie’s engagement
                with Romanticism and its Enlightenment origins. What follows here is thus a series
                of ideas that I may well end up altering or disagreeing with further down the
                line.</p>
               <p>In considering Bowie’s link to the British Enlightenment, it is useful to invoke
                ethnomethodologist Harold Garfinkel’s term, “indexicality.” Garfinkel defines
                indexicality as the meaning an object or concept has for those who invoke it, a
                meaning that does not necessarily align with its original meaning (although it
                retains something of that original meaning).<note place="foot" resp="author"> As the <emph>Encyclopedia of Case Study
                                Research</emph> puts it, “Indexicality takes
                                an interest in the 'rules' people employ to make sense of verbal
                                interaction. Indexical properties of language-in-use may refer . . .
                                words that are understandable for the members of a social or
                                cultural group in a particular context. Language is understood as
                                naturally constitutive of social life and strongly depends on the
                                context and history of the place in which it is used”
                            (352).</note> Indexicality can be both transitive and
                mutable. If you hear Bauhaus’s version of “Ziggy Stardust,” for example, you now
                understand not “Ziggy Stardust” but Bauhaus’s indexicality of it. You may retain
                their indexical understanding, or you may process it into your own indexicality of
                the song, which would be your indexicality of Bauhaus’s indexicality of “Ziggy
                Stardust,” but would retain some of the meanings of Bowie’s original, too. Indexical
                transmission is thus a kind of game of signifying the children’s game of “Whisper
                Down the Lane,” although one in which each whisper does retain at least something of
                the original.</p>
               <p>Bowie’s understanding of Enlightenment thought may be seen as an indexical process
                that begins with the Beats: he often acknowledged the influence the movement had on
                    him.<note place="foot" resp="author"> “I
                            wanted to be just like Sal Paradise and Dan Moriarty [the central
                            characters of <emph>On the Road</emph>],” Bowie once said
                            (Cann 21).</note> The Beats themselves were strongly influenced
                by the works of the Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse, who believed that
                the critical spirit of the Enlightenment found continuation in the theories of Hegel
                and Marx, and “reproached the positivists for having killed the true spirit of the
                Enlightenment by stifling its fundamentally negative dimension.” For Marcuse,
                liberating people from their alienation—from “enslavement to the instruments of
                production” and “subjection to the economic sphere”—was the only true revolution,
                and he believed it could emerge only via “outsiders to the system—the young, the
                unemployed and others at the fringes of society” (Delacampagne 207–9). In light of
                this explanation, it is not surprising that Marcuse also influenced the hippies,
                another central influence on the young David Bowie. Thus, from the Beats and the
                hippies to Marcuse to the Enlightenment, a line of indexicality offers one
                possibility for how Bowie might have encountered Enlightenment thought.</p>
               <p>However, he encountered it, though, it is certain that the most
                obvious way in which Bowie connects to British Enlightenment philosophy is through
                his exploration of the concept of identity. That Bowie both engaged with and enacted
                questions surrounding identity is a commonplace by now. What has not yet been
                discussed, however, is that Bowie’s discomfort with single identity, and his
                attempts both to multiply identity and to determine what constitutes it, are
                engagements with and experiments upon hypotheses advanced by John Locke and David
                Hume.</p>
               <p>In his <emph>Treatise of Human Nature</emph> (1739),
                Hume argues that the notion of cohesive identity is a chimera: “There is properly
                no simplicity in [the mind] at one time, nor identity . . . whatever natural
                propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity . . . They are the
                successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind” (301). The assumption that
                people possess one continuous identity is, for Hume, founded on an error:
            <quote>A fiction, either of something invariable and uninterrupted, or of something
                mysterious and inexplicable, or at least with a propensity to such fictions. What
                will suffice to prove this hypothesis to the satisfaction of every fair enquirer, is
                to shew from daily experience and observation, that the objects, which are variable
                or interrupted, and yet are suppos’d to continue the same, are such only as consist
                of a succession of parts, connected together by resemblance, contiguity, or
                causation. . . . A change in any considerable part of a body destroys its identity;
                but ‘tis remarkable, that where the change is produc’d <emph>gradually</emph> and <emph>insensibly</emph> we are less apt to ascribe
                to it the same effect. The reason can plainly be no other, than that the mind, in
                following the successive changes of the body, feels an easy passage from the
                surveying its condition in one moment to the viewing of it in another, and at no
                particular time perceives any interruption in its actions. (I.4.6)</quote>
           Bowie positions himself as a Humean through the best-known facet of his career: his
                    personae.<note place="foot" resp="author">For more on Bowie
                            and Hume, see Theodore G. Ammon, “The Flux of It All.”</note>
                These personae and their reception prove Hume’s assertion that gradual change,
                although resulting in a new identity, is not perceived that way by those who witness
                it. If one traces the arc of Bowie’s evolution during the 1972–1983 period, one can
                see that the consecutive personae enact a process of progressive, interconnected
                change: Ziggy Stardust’s scarlet hair and pale skin (1972–73) remain in Aladdin Sane
                (1973), who dons an eye patch to become Hallowe’en Jack (1974), who cuts and
                lightens his hair but keeps it an autumnal shade and retains his pallor to become
                the Thin White Duke (1975–76), whose Germanic “kalte Pracht” [“cold splendour”] (Du
                Verger 13) is carried forward to an actual stay in Berlin from 1976 to 1979, during
                which period Bowie grows his hair out to its natural colour, which he keeps for
                1980’s <emph>Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</emph> album, on the cover
                of which not only is his hair helpfully colored red by the designer but he is
                dressed as a Pierrot, an image that features in the cover art of 1969’s <emph>Space Oddity</emph> album.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For further versions of Bowie, see the Pin-Ups gallery on

                resemblance and contiguity, these “successive changes” produce “an easy passage from
                the surveying its condition in one moment to the viewing of it in another.” All are
                understood to be the same “David Bowie,” despite the fact that if one placed a
                picture of Aladdin Sane next to a picture of the <emph>Scary
                    Monsters</emph> persona, one would be hard pressed to define them as sharing the
                same identity.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            This leaves aside the final version of Bowie, wandering Manhattan in a
                            puffa jacket and a messenger bag, who looks nothing like any of the
                            personae. See <ref target="mailto:medium.com/@sadydoyle/waiting-for-bowie-47e07fc3878a">medium.com/@sadydoyle/waiting-for-bowie-47e07fc3878a</ref>.</note>

               <p>[Insert photos]</p>
               <p>In fact, according to Hume, they do not share the same identity, and Bowie seems to
                follow him in this, too. When asked by Russell Harty in 1975 whether for his next
                persona he intended to continue with the “glittery Ziggy Stardust thing,” Bowie
                responded, “I think the image I adopt may well be me. I’m sort of inventing me at
                the moment.” A good deal of music-critic dissatisfaction with Bowie, and a certain
                amount of philosophical discussion, centers around his alleged inauthenticity.
                Matthew Lampert, for example, asserts that “From the beginning, Bowie built his solo
                career on the inauthentic” (152), while Bethany Usher and Stephenie Fremaux argue
                that he “creates fictional characters brought to life through live performance and
                media interviews” (58). But Bowie’s response to Harty suggests something quite
                different: that the personae are not acts but selves. Indeed, he shows an attachment
                to the multiple self throughout his career, particularly vocally in this 1974–76
                period: “If I’ve been at all responsible for people finding more characters in
                themselves than they originally thought they had, then I’m pleased,” he says in the
                1974 documentary <emph>Cracked Actor</emph> (28:19), while the title of
                Bowie’s 1974 song, “Who Can I Be Now?” seems an extension of Hume’s odd description
                of his attempts to quantify selfhood. “When I enter most intimately into what I
                    call <emph>myself</emph>,” Hume writes, “I always stumble on some
                particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred,
                pain or pleasure. I never can catch <emph>myself</emph> at any time
                without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception.” Bowie’s
                title lays bare what these statements suggest: that the self can simultaneously be
                an other, and that humans can simultaneously possess within them more than one self
                (in Hume’s case, one that is analysed and one that analyses).</p>
               <p>Bowie’s personae support this conclusion. Each has a different background (space, the
                Weimar Republic, post-apocalypse), not just fully realized but also different from
                the background of the other personae, and from Bowie’s own background. Each makes a
                different—or differently inflected—type of music; each has his own style of dress;
                each even moves differently on stage, the icy stillness of the Thin White Duke
                bearing no resemblance to the loose knees of <emph>Let’s Dance</emph>’s
                pop singer.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a discussion that argues
                        for a uniformity of movement across Bowie’s personae, see Thorsten
                        Botz-Borstein, “You Don’t Have to Be Stupid to Be Cool.” For one that
                        considers the role of Bowie’s voice in the creation of persona, see Kevin
                        Holm-Hudson, “‘Who Can I Be Now?’: David Bowie’s Vocal Personae.”</note>
                Wade Hollingshaus asserts that “Bowie’s audiences are well trained in their approach
                to Bowie’s work; as they search for and identify the silent speech of that work,
                they allow whatever they find to coalesce around the ‘Bowie’ image” (121), but this
                is not quite the case. Bowie’s audiences may file each persona under the heading
                “David Bowie,” but they also recognize them as distinct beings in their own right:
                no Bowie fan worth her salt would tell you that Ziggy Stardust and the elegant
                clotheshorse of <emph>Let’s Dance</emph> are the same guy.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I use this
                            word deliberately, in anticipation of this article’s later discussion of
                            Locke’s use of the terms “man” and “person.”</note> When
                assuming a persona, then, Bowie both is and is not, simultaneously. Rob Sheffield
                describes the David Bowie of the Thin White Duke period as “a blond coat hanger with
                a dead rock star hanging on it” (39), and this mordant witticism is a more serious
                assessment than it at first appears to be. In <emph>Cracked Actor</emph>
                Bowie muses that “I couldn’t decide whether I was writing the characters or whether
                the characters were writing me” (37:00). Bowie may always be himself, but so are his
                    personae.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Simon Critchley writes, “during the 1970s . . . Bowie, almost
                            ascetically, almost eremetically, disciplines himself into becoming a
                            nothing, a mobile and massively creative nothing that could assume new
                            faces, generate new illusions, and create new forms”
                    (102).</note>
               </p>
               <p> In this way the personae are living enactments of Hume’s assertion that “The mind is
                a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance;
                pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety. . . . There is
                properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in different. . . . They are
                the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind” (I.4.6). The mistake
                critics and philosophers make is to read identity from Bowie’s exterior into his
                interior: because Ziggy Stardust is made visible to the audience from dyed hair,
                make-up, and costumes, the understanding is that he must be an assumed identity, an
                acted part. In fact, it would be more accurate to read from Bowie’s interior to his
                exterior: Ziggy is an extrusion of portion of David Bowie, garbed and colored in
                order to reify an interior way of experiencing the world.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In fact,
                            Usher and Fremaux all but acknowledge this, although they are determined
                            to make Bowie’s adherence to the truth of the personae mean something
                            else: “It is well documented that Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, and the
                            Thin White Duke each took over Bowie to the point of excess. . . . Press
                            and fans’ inability to differentiate between Bowie and his personae was
                            supported by Bowie himself who, at times, spoke in character as Ziggy or
                            emphasized them as being one and the same . . . In this way, Bowie’s use
                            of personae was meant to be a piece of performance art”
                        (58–9).</note>
               </p>
               <p>Funnily enough, critics help Bowie to prove this—via another Humean assertion. In the
                second book of the <emph>Treatise</emph>, Hume argues
                for selves as social constructions:
            <quote>If a person considered himself in the same light, in which he appears to his admirer,
                he would first receive a separate pleasure, and afterwards a pride or
                self-satisfaction, according to the hypothesis above explained. Now nothing is more
                natural than for us to embrace the opinions of others in this particular; both from
                sympathy, which renders all their sentiments intimately present to us; and from
                reasoning, which makes us regard their judgment, as a kind of argument for what they
                affirm. These two principles of authority and sympathy influence almost all our
                opinions; but must have a peculiar influence, when we judge of our own worth and
                character. (2.1.11)</quote>
           As Ruth Boeker has pointed out, “If a self were merely a
                    bundle of perceptions which is given in introspection, then it would be
                    difficult for others to have access to myself, and to praise and blame me . . .
                    a self will be accessible both from a first person . . . perspective and from
                    the perspective of others” (5). By this logic, if a Bowie persona appears to be
                    a fully-formed identity, then he is. A perceived self is (at least to some
                    degree) an actual self. And both critics and fans frequently treat Bowie’s
                    perceived selves as if they were actual selves. Every Bowie fan has a favorite
                    persona, and the choice is based not on the excellence of the costumes nor the
                    execution of the accompanying stage show, but on the character the persona
                    exudes.
                <note place="foot" resp="author"> Certainly the
                            costumes and stage show play a part in creating the persona, but rare is
                            the fan who chooses “her” persona based on these. As for the choice of
                            persona, a very informal straw poll suggests that The Thin White Duke is
                            the
                favourite.</note> Even academic writers often speak of a given persona as a being in his own right: Hollingshaus, for example, asserts that “Ziggy is more than just an alter ego for David Bowie. Ziggy is the protagonist in a rock star suicide” (107). Sometimes even as the personae are understood as Bowie creations they are simultaneously treated as real, as when Hollingshaus writes that “D.A. Pennebaker’s documentary recording of Ziggy’s farewell concert performance shows Bowie and his band, the Spiders, getting into costume backstage before the concert” (102). Strictly speaking, Ziggy doesn’t have a farewell concert. He doesn’t have anything, because he doesn’t exist separately from David Bowie. Yet, as Hollingshaus’s wording shows, it is difficult not to think of the two identities as having separate selfhoods.
            </p>
               <p>Bowie’s fully realized personae, then, raises the very
                    Humean question of how to identify identity. I have written elsewhere about the
                    complications inherent in performances of the song “Ziggy Stardust.” Within the
                    world of that song, its lyrics about a left-handed, odd-eyed rock star are sung
                    in the voice of a member of his backing band. At the same time, in the stage
                    performance, these lyrics are being sung by a left-handed, odd-eyed rock star
                    dressed as the rock star he is singing about, but in the voice of that
                    backing-band member. The singer is, of course, neither the rock star the song
                    describes nor the backing-band member telling the story: he is David Bowie,
                    singing in one persona about another persona. It would be difficult to find a
                    better realization of Hume’s assertion that consciousness is made up of
                    “successive perceptions only.”
                <note place="foot" resp="author"> See Emily Bernhard-Jackson,
                            “‘Sometimes I feel like the whole human race’: Lord Byron and David
                            Bowie Consider the Question of
                    Identity.”</note> Indeed, Bowie’s stage performances of “Ziggy Stardust” raise the possibility that identity may consist of different perceptions occurring <emph>simultaneously</emph>. And in giving shape to Hume’s hypothesis and raising
                    that possibility, the performances also connect back to the question that Hume
                    poses: “What then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity to these
                    successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possest of an invariable and
                    uninterrupted existence thro’ the whole course of our lives?” (1.4.6).</p>
               <p>Well, one might reply, what gives us such a propension in this case is the fact that all of the personae are performed by the same person, David Bowie. What’s more, this assertion has John Locke to back it up. In his
                <emph>Essay Concerning Human
                Understanding</emph> (1689), Locke draws a distinction between “man” and “person,” two labels I have avoided applying to Bowie in this article precisely because Locke gives them quite specific definitions. For Locke, “man” refers to “the same continued life communicated to different particles of matter, as they happen successively to be united to [an] organized living body” (II.27.8), while “person” means “a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places; which it does only by that consciousness which is inseparable from thinking. . . . It [person] is a forensick term appropriating actions and their merit; and so belongs only to intelligent agents capable of a law” (2.27.9–26). Using these definitions, David Bowie is both a man and a person, one who performs the personae and is not a being separate from them.
            </p>
               <p>There is a problem, however. Also using these definitions, David Bowie, both man and
                person, does not exist. Bowie never legally changed his name; his particles of
                matter and thinking intelligent being were both legally—forensically—attached to the name David Jones throughout his life.
                And while arguing for a distinction between David Bowie and David Jones may at first
                seem a piece of pedantic literalism, it becomes less so when one knows that from
                very early on in his career, Bowie (or whatever we should call him) drew a
                distinction between David Bowie and himself. As early as an 1969 interview about his
                involvement with the Beckenham Arts Lab, he speaks of “Bowie” as if he were a
                separate entity:

                90–2)</l>
                  </quote>
            This dissociation of Bowie from Bowie continues as his career progresses. In the 1973
                documentary, <emph>Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</emph>, he
                tells an interviewer that “I believe in my part all the way down the line, right the
                way down. But I do play it. Because that’s the way I do . . . that’s part of what
                Bowie is supposedly all about” (Pennebaker). In a 2014 interview in British
                newspaper <emph>The Guardian</emph>, Bowie’s wife Iman indicated that this
                division continued throughout Bowie’s life: “Bowie is just a persona. He’s a singer,
                an entertainer. David Jones is a man I met” (Cadwalladr). It would seem that David
                Bowie was just another persona for David Jones.</p>
               <p>What are we to do with this? It is possible to discuss Ziggy Stardust, et al., as
                acted personae because it is possible to conceive of them as separate from David
                Bowie the performer. It is extremely difficult, however, to make the cognitive leap
                necessary to conceive of “David Bowie” as merely a persona enacted by the walking,
                talking being that we only know as David Bowie. What is this being if it is not
                David Bowie? Have critics been talking about Bowie when all along they should have
                been talking about Jones? Or are we to give David Bowie the legitimacy of personhood
                when he’s in use (as it were), since in that capacity he gives interviews, expresses
                beliefs, offers thoughts? Are these beliefs and thoughts different to Jones’s? Is
                the man who tells a dumb joke to camera in an outtake posted on YouTube David Bowie
                (he’s on camera!) or David Jones (it’s a personal moment!)?</p>
               <p>All of which is to say that thinking of “David Bowie” as the ultimate piece of
                performance art by David Jones, performed so well that “he” appears to have become a
                fully extant being in his own right, raises fundamental questions about the nature
                of identity, and of personae. At what point does a persona become an identity, and
                to what extent is an identity a persona? Bowie’s “Bowie” persona asks this not in
                the tedious postmodern sense that invokes discourse, performativity, the absence of
                essential self, etc., etc., but in a concrete sense that extends Enlightenment
                questions about identity until they very nearly snap.</p>
               <p>In fact, one might argue that he does make them snap but in the experiences of his
                real life rather than on stage. Having separated man from person, Locke remains
                preoccupied by the question of what precisely makes a person a person:
            <quote>[I]t is plain, consciousness, as far as ever it can be extended—should it be to ages
                past—unites existences and actions very remote in time into the same person . . . so
                that whatever has the consciousness of present and past actions, is the same person
                to whom they both belong. . . . But yet possibly it will still be objected,—Suppose
                I wholly lose the memory of some parts of my life, beyond a possibility of
                retrieving them, so that perhaps I shall never be conscious of them again; yet am I
                not the same person that did those actions, had those thoughts that I once was
                conscious of, though I have now forgot them? To which I answer, that . . . if it be
                possible for the same man to have distinct incommunicable consciousness at different
                times, it is past doubt the same man would at different times make different
                persons. (2.27.9–20)</quote>
           In other words, for Locke, if a man has no memory of a part of his life, then during
                that part he was, quite literally, not himself. Bowie may be the only public figure
                to offer an opportunity to consider the real-life implications of this
                philosophy.</p>
               <p> It’s well known that for Bowie (and Jones) the 1970s were a whirlwind of heavy drug
                    use.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For simplicity’s sake, the essay
                        continues to refer to him as Bowie until its end.</note> One result of
                this excess was that it left him with what he described as “incredible losses of
                memory. . . . Whole <emph>chunks</emph> of my life. I can’t remember, for instance, any—any—of 1975.” In one interview, Bowie detailed watching
                footage of himself performing as Ziggy Stardust and thinking, “This boy used to
                dress like that for a living? My <emph>God</emph> this is funny”; in
                another he remarked of recording the Thin White Duke’s 1976 album <emph>Station to Station</emph> that “I can’t even remember the studio. I know it was
                in LA because I’ve read it was. . . . I listen to <emph>Station to
                    Station</emph> as a piece of work by an entirely different person” (Loder 334),
                and once asked to explain his puzzling 1971 song, “The Bewlay Brothers,” he said, “I
                can’t imagine what the person who wrote that had on his mind” (Pegg 39).</p>
               <p> This real-life self-dissociation is something more extreme than Hume’s “successive
                perceptions.” Even if one agrees with Hume that a consciousness is merely a
                succession of impressions and/or thoughts passing through the mind, one must grant
                that these impressions are in some way connected, since empirical examination of
                one’s own consciousness reveals that one thought gives rise to another, which gives
                rise to another, which connects to an earlier impression, and so on. But the
                condition that Bowie outlines is one of disconnection: a consciousness (or
                personhood, or identity) interrupted then taken up again later. According to Locke’s
                reasoning, this would mean that David Bowie, the man, was in fact different <emph>persons</emph> throughout his life:
            <quote>Let any one reflect upon himself, and conclude that he has in himself an immaterial
                spirit, which is that which thinks in him . . . let him also suppose it to be the
                same soul that was in Nestor or Thersites, at the siege of Troy . . . but he now
                having no consciousness of any of the actions either of Nestor or Thersites, does or
                can he conceive himself the same person with either of them? . . . [T]his
                consciousness . . . not reaching to any of the actions of either of those men, he is
                no more one self with either of them than if the soul or immaterial spirit that now
                informs him had been created, and began to exist, when it began to inform his present body (1.27.14)</quote>
            Since Bowie was ambulant and conversational (albeit sometimes barely), and working,
                during the years he cannot remember, there was some sort of identity existent, but
                by Locke’s lights this identity was not David Bowie. This would seem to turn the
                critical conversation on its head. It suggests that rather than thinking of the
                personae as performances by David Bowie, we should think of David Bowie as being
                performed, at least sometimes, by the personae: the Thin White Duke in 1975, Ziggy
                Stardust in 1973, and someone going by the name “David Bowie” and wearing a dress
                for men in 1971.</p>
               <p> In other words, Bowie’s life experience suggests not simply that a persona can be an
                identity, nor that an identity may actually be a fully-fleshed and embodied persona,
                but that, in the most literal sense of the phrase, we are who we seem to be: if it
                looks like “David Bowie” and it sounds like “David Bowie,” then it <emph>is</emph> David Bowie, no matter who might be living inside it. Bowie’s lacunae
                of memory, coupled with his consistent existence as an acknowledgement as “David
                Bowie” during these periods of blankness, suggest that real, true being lies not
                inside the consciousness or the mind, where things may change and go missing, but in
                the perception of a cohesive self by others.<note place="foot" resp="author"> He put out an album, presented a Grammy, made a movie, and performed with
                        Cher all under this name in 1975.</note>
               </p>
               <p> While this loops back to Hume’s notion of selves as social, it also connects to the
                philosophy of George Berkeley.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For another analysis of Bowie’s connection to
                            Berkeley, see Nicolas Michaud, “The Babe with the
                    Power.”</note> For Berkeley, objects exist only as the mind perceives
                them. This does not mean that they vanish when not perceived, but rather that they
                exist <emph>for</emph> the mind as that mind
                understands them: as Berkeley puts it, “For what are . . . Objects but the things we
                perceive by Sense, and what, I pray you, do we perceive besides our own ideas and
                Sensations?” (I.4). Philosophers often consider what this means for the self that
                perceives, but they don’t tend to focus on what it might mean for the <emph>perceived</emph>. One is on safe ground asserting that a tomato
                exists for a mind only as a mind perceives it, but what about an ant? A cat? A boy
                from Bromley who makes himself into an icon? Berkeley’s <emph>esse est
                    percipi</emph> [to be is to be perceived] suggests that the last of these, at
                least, has a minimum of two identities: the one in his own mind (however
                multifarious that may be), and the one perceived by those who encounter him. It
                further suggests that the identity in his own mind may be less his identity than the
                one others behold. While that interior identity may sometimes be absent, the one
                others see remains present: <emph>percipi est esse</emph>.</p>
               <p> Now, where does that leave us? Both intrigued and somewhat slightly dazed, I
                imagine—but I judge only from my own perceptions. It also, however, leaves us with a
                David Bowie whose most significant connection to Enlightenment thought may be that
                he does what Enlightenment philosophers cannot quite force themselves to do: he
                brings his viewers face to face with the insolubility of identity. Even Hume, the
                boldest of these thinkers, ends his analysis by taking refuge in the assertion that
                “all the nice and subtile questions concerning personal identity can never possibly
                be decided, and are to be regarded rather as grammatical than as philosophical
                difficulties” (I.4.6). Bowie, I think, would disagree, precisely because he makes
                subtle questions concerning personal identity vividly material. Bowie moves abstract
                Enlightenment ideas into the world of lived art—indeed, he literally brings them to
                life. He thus suggests that despite the new media, digital effulgence, and virtual
                reality in which we are all constantly immersed (and of which he took full
                advantage), we continue to wrestle with an old question: Who am I? And who am I now?
                And now?</p>
