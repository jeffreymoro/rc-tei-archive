                <p>This introduction lays out the predicates of <emph>David Bowie and the Legacies of
                    Romanticism</emph>, exploring the diversity of Romantic
                        inheritances and considering the ways in which David Bowie can be seen as
                        engaging with them. It argues that while the Romantic period’s influence is less
                        obvious than that of some other literary epochs, this is in large part because
                        Romantic innovations changed so fundamentally the ways in which culture
                        conceives of art and identity. Considering how Bowie engages with these changes
                        allows us to see how Romanticism survives in a range of dynamic shaping forces,
                        empowering later artists through providing both flexible tools to repurpose and
                        overarching systems to reconfigure and oppose.</p>

            <p>“Poetry makes nothing happen,” W.H. Auden contends in his
                    elegy “In Memory of W.B. Yeats.” However, he goes on to write that nevertheless
                    “it survives, / A way of happening, a mouth” (246). This collection is concerned
                    with the ways in which the clusters of ideas awkwardly bundled together under
                    the heading of Romanticism survive as ways of happening in the twentieth and
                    twenty-first centuries, albeit in forms necessarily “modified in the guts of the
                    living” (245). Our prisms for examining the ongoing currency of Romantic
                    conceptions are the works, performances, and legacies of David Bowie. We argue
                    that many of Bowie’s manifestations engage in meaningful creative and critical
                    conversations with assumptions that originally crystallized in Romantic-period
                    discourses and forms. Specifically, the five essays that follow explore ideas
                    relating to space, childhood, identity, artistry, and the image of freedom: all
                    key Romantic concerns that continue to resonate in Bowie and his works. In
                    discussing how Bowie’s music, personae, and cultural presences engage with
                    late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century thoughts and artworlds, this volume
                    traces a variety of different forms of remediation, including reflection,
                    diffusion, resistance, amplification, and transfiguration. Bowie is far from
                    being straightforwardly a Romantic artist, but the very complexities of his
                    relationships with Romanticism make him a more revealing lens through which to
                    explore the pervasiveness, richness, and predicaments of our Romantic
                    inheritances. As Auden does for poetry, we wish to reject a straightforwardly
                    functional vision of Romanticism as a form of action in the present in favour of
                    seeing it as a series of modalities that inventive interpreters like Bowie have
                    been able to extend, nuance, transform, and—in some circumstances—shuck
                    off.
            </p>
            <p>This collection, like many good things, owes its existence
                    to connections sparked by conference conviviality. Its roots lie in after-dinner
                    discussions between Joanna E. Taylor, Beatrice Turner, and myself at the 2015
                    British Association for Romantic Studies (BARS) Conference in Cardiff. The idea
                    of juxtaposing Bowie and Romanticism (two great tastes that we hoped would taste
                    great together) swiftly created a compelling play of possibilities, and the
                    notion of working these up continued to nag at us long after we departed from
                    Wales. Bowie’s subsequent passing—one of the first of 2016’s numerous great
                    losses—intensified our desire to see what we could do by examining Bowie through
                    the prism of Romanticism and vice versa. On the helpful recommendation of
                    Michael Gamer, we asked Emily Bernhard-Jackson—who was already completing new
                    work on Bowie and Byron—to join us, and the four of us presented our ideas as a
                    panel at the 2017 BARS Conference in York. We were gratified both by the number
                    of people who showed up at a relatively early hour on the Sunday morning after
                    the banquet and by the enthusiasm expressed in questions and responses. This
                    made us keen to develop our thoughts for publication to extend the stimulating
                    conversations we had begun. When we submitted a proposal to the Praxis series,
                    Orrin Wang kindly mentioned that Forest Pyle had recently been thinking about
                    Bowie in relation to his current projects on contemporary Romanticisms. When we
                    subsequently approached him, it swiftly became apparent that his perspective
                    would bring something new and distinctive beyond what we’d gathered in the
                    original panel, so we were delighted when he agreed to contribute a concluding
                    essay to this collection. The completion of this volume is thus a tribute to
                    Romantic Studies’ openness and cordiality. We’d like to offer heartfelt thanks
                    to all those who’ve listened to, supported, and provided feedback on this
                    research as it has developed.
            </p>
            <p>The framing of this collection begs two related questions:
                    why place such emphasis on Romantic legacies, and why use David Bowie to explore
                    these? To begin with the first question: we are aware that from certain
                    perspectives, exploring Romantic resonances in David Bowie might seem to be a
                    rather tangential—or even quixotic—endeavour. For the past three decades,
                    mainstream scholarship in Romantic Studies has been strongly invested in
                    recovering historical circumstances, vesting value claims for works in their
                    conditions of possibility at the times of their creations. This has led many
                    scholars to implicitly favour a stance Tom Mole has called “punctual
                    historicism,” which he defines as a tendency to “think the most important
                    context for understanding literature is the context of its composition or its
                    first publication” (21). This impulse has been the spur for a huge body of
                    significant critical and editorial work that has helped immeasurably in getting
                    us to a position where we can more adequately claim that we might “read a text
                    like its first readers” (23). However, such scholarship, while immensely
                    valuable, should not constitute the whole literary-critical picture. The ways
                    that texts happened in the past are hugely important, but texts and the idea
                    clusters they spawn are also fascinating for the complex ways that they continue
                    to happen in our lives, institutions, minds, and seminar rooms. Clearly, part of
                    our role as Romanticists is to try to remember, imagine, and explain how the
                    Romantic period was for those who lived through it, but it is also important to
                    be explicit that its works and the new affordances of thought and feeling they
                    developed continue to live on in our understandings, apprehensions, and
                    misapprehensions.
            </p>
            <p>In recent years, a growing body of work has made
                    significant progress in investigating how Romantic-period artforms and
                    ideologies have played out in the works of successor artists. Interestingly,
                    much of this research has been issued in the form of essay collections; this
                    perhaps indicates a consensus that complex questions regarding legacies are best
                    addressed through providing a series of complementary perspectives, rather than
                    seeking to be singular and definitive.
                <note place="foot" resp="author">A few highlights: the contributors to Andrew Radford and Mark Sandy’s <emph>Romantic Echoes in the
                                Victorian

In <emph>Legacies of Romanticism</emph> (2012), Carmen Casaliggi, Paul March-Russell and their collaborators adroitly explore the ways in which “Romanticism has constituted, and been reconstituted by, subsequent developments in artistic theory and practice” (8). Jacques Khalip and Forest Pyle’s <emph>Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism </emph> (2016) takes a more explicitly theory-led
                                approach, with contributors examining from a range of angles the
                                manners in which modern culture has been drawn to and illuminated by
                                Romantic formations. In doing so, they laudably seek, in words
                                developed from Walter Benjamin, “to make good on the terms of that
                                [secret] agreement [between previous generations and current ones] .
                                . . to conjure something mutually illuminating in the two-way street
                                of past and present” (1).</note>
                While many essay volumes have dealt principally with high
                    cultural resonances, a number have also explored connections with contemporary
                    popular culture, often with an eye to demystifying Romanticism in the seminar
                    room.<note place="foot" resp="author">In particular, a lot of excellent scholarship exploring historical consonances and artful anachronism has been published on <emph>Romantic Circles</emph>. We are very glad that our collection will

                                collaborated “to think about the similarities and differences

                                literary history” (para. 3). Themes from this collection have
                                recently been revisited in D.B. Ruderman and Rachel Feder’s 2017

                Such work brings home both the intellectual potential of
                    revivifying Romanticism through analogy and the very real necessity of thinking
                    about how versions and variants of Romanticism might matter now when
                    constructing our syllabi and explaining our passions.</p>
            <p>However, while such collections provide both excellent
                    sources and helpful methodological toolkits for investigating the longer-term
                    influence of Romantic-period writing—especially poetry—there is as yet no
                    strongly established equivalent in Romantic Studies to the burgeoning interest
                    in Neo-Victorianism in Victorian Studies. This, I would contend, is in large
                    part due to the prevailing nature of Romantic influence. As Ann Heilmann and
                    Mark Llewellyn put it, in many respects “‘the Victorian’ has become a
                    homogenized identity—even a signifier—in contemporary culture” (2).
                    Neo-Victorianism is largely predicated on its subject period being defined (or
                    fossilized) in a series of familiar stereotypes. Heilmann and Llewellyn argue
                    that Neo-Victorian texts engage a “self-analytic drive” and constitute
                    “fictional re-encounters,” playing off the solidity of the period’s cultural
                    presence by subjecting it to parody, remediation, and revaluation (5; 8). In
                    doing so, Neo-Victorian works assert—always implicitly, and often very
                    explicitly—that we are no longer Victorian: the period is over, done with, and
                    transcended.
            </p>
            <p>By contrast, the Romantic-period influence on contemporary culture is more nebulous but in many ways stronger and more pervasive. In <emph>Keywords</emph> (1976), Raymond Williams observed that “literature was specialized towards
                <emph>imaginative
                writing</emph> within the basic assumptions of Romanticism” (186). Ideals developed and institutionalized in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries remain right at the heart of modern disciplines and the social assumptions that empower and constrain them. When we talk about art and culture, we use a language that has been fundamentally shaped by Romantic assumptions. Despite the efforts of critics like Jerome McGann and Clifford Siskin, it remains far harder to get outside Romanticism than it is to get outside Victorianism. While the latter is associated most strongly with aesthetics and ideologies that can be defined as no longer being our own, the former lingers at the heart of many of our most cherished cultural assumptions.
            </p>
            <p>This is not an unproblematic situation. While Romantic ideologies comprise a powerfully suggestive set of modalities for being and for being in the world, it would be deeply worrying if the recorded thoughts and feelings of two hundred years ago mapped exactly on to our modern ethics and (pre)conceptions. When considered alongside Romanticism’s considerable, and potentially disabling, authority as a discourse, such dissonances have served to create an influential strand of paranoid criticism that sees the art of the Romantic period as exerting an insidious and powerfully negative influence. As Simon Swift has convincingly argued, “the fear of being enchanted by Romantic illusions, as well as the self-defensive critical mechanisms that aim to guard against it, [are] themselves Romantic legacies” (246). Swift’s view of Romanticism has interesting consonances with Harold Bloom’s view of influence. We might well trace a version of Bloomian anxiety in Alain Baidou’s pronouncements about the “question which weighs upon and threatens to exhaust us: can we be delivered,
                <emph>finally</emph> delivered, from our subjugation to Romanticism?” (24).</p>
            <p>It is difficult, then, to see how a discourse closely
                    resembling Neo-Victorianism can arise while Romanticism is still very much with
                    us. However, the currency of Romanticism might well serve to create a space for
                    a different kind of legacy studies that could also address some of the
                    objections of those like Baidou who see Romanticism as an all-encompassing
                    malign influence. I would contend that while Baidou is right to see Romanticism
                    as remaining powerfully operative, the Romanticism that operates now is not the
                    same as that which operated in the early nineteenth century, or indeed in the
                    early twentieth century. Romanticism was always a retrospective imposition, and
                    the very complexities that make defining it so difficult also provide space for
                    artists and critics to shift and change it, moving its centres of gravity and
                    collectively working to challenge its previous assumptions. Like Walt Whitman,
                    Romanticism can internalize contradictions without collapsing; it is large and
                    can “contain multitudes” (24). If we accept this, we might conceptualize
                    ourselves not as subjugated victims begging for delivery from a unitary
                    Romanticism, but rather as stakeholders who possess Romanticism as a cultural
                    legacy and who can remake it in our own images, censuring and jettisoning
                    qualities and discourses that we find objectionable while drawing on its
                    communicative powers to connect us with our pasts and our contemporaries in old
                    and new forms of mutual understanding.
            </p>
            <p>This brings us to the second question: why Bowie? He is
                    far from the most obviously Romantic of artists, but this makes him peculiarly
                    suitable for addressing both the ubiquity of Romantic forms and the manners in
                    which these must variously be negotiated, resisted, and reconfigured. Previous
                    scholars examining Romantic legacies in popular music have often drawn direct
                    connections between poets and pop stars, looking at how the latter evoke and
                    make use of the former.

                However, Bowie offers an excellent test case for
                    considering a more conflicted model of Romantic inheritance. He is a good
                    presence to think with because of the ways he clashes with Romantic conceptions
                    as well as the manners in which he resonates with them. The essays in this
                    volume differ markedly and—we hope—productively in how they conceptualize this
                    combination of harmony and dissonance. At the beginning of his contribution,
                    Forest Pyle writes that “On the surface, David Bowie is one of the least likely
                    matches that I can imagine for a pairing of pop culture with Romanticism.”
                    Bearing in mind the ease with which our initial conversations about Bowie and
                    Romanticism flowed in Cardiff, I was initially quite surprised when I read this,
                    but it makes complete sense as a position. Bowie’s work is not particularly
                    concerned with the natural world and expresses distrust regarding many kinds of
                    visionary experience. It often takes pleasure in the kinds of artifice with
                    which devotees of Romanticism’s cult of authenticity are distinctly
                    uncomfortable. Regardless of the real nature of William Wordsworth’s
                    interactions with Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals or his poetical predecessors,
                    the ideal of the Wordsworthian poet does not chime neatly with the principles
                    behind cut-ups, pin-ups, or oblique strategies. In these respects, Bowie is
                    deeply un-Romantic, although his being so within a paradigm in which Romanticism
                    still holds considerable sway itself provides a telling commentary on the
                    rarefication and remediation of Romantic-period inheritances.
            </p>
            <p>However, for me, Bowie has always seemed of a kind with
                    Romantic artists in his pursuit of iconicity. Like them, he is a figure who
                    sought to be at the center of debates within and about his time, attempting
                    self-consciously to provide a means for audiences and commentators to position
                    their thoughts, feelings, and selves. If Romanticism carved out a space in which
                    artists can stand as recognized yet peculiar representatives of their age, then
                    Bowie is a true heir both in his grapplings with the zeitgeist and in his
                    insistence on maintaining his individual idiosyncrasies even as he appeals for
                    general applause. In “A Defence of Poetry,” Shelley writes that “Poets are the
                    hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows
                    which futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they
                    understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they
                    inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves” (535). This description of
                    the artist as a sensitive but far-from-omniscient barometer seems to me
                    accurately to describe Bowie, whose influence seems profounder, more widespread,
                    and less expected than that of other rock stars of his age. The main word in
                    Shelley’s statement we would need to amend in Bowie’s case is “unapprehended.”
                    In the seventies in particular, Bowie sought successfully to make both his
                    influences and his staged selves garishly visible, blazing across the mediascape
                    both as a roguish assemblage of half-familiar elements and as something
                    audiences responded to as being radically new. The Bowies of the seventies grab
                    the lion’s share of the attention in this collection, probably because this was
                    the period of his career in which the steps he danced were most obviously in the
                    Romantic line. Before the off-kilter embrace of more conventional forms in the
                    eighties, the avant-gardisms of the nineties, and the rueful, experimental
                    referentiality of his twenty-first-century material, seventies Bowies teetered
                    confidently between outsider and archetype, brashly asserting that art was sexy
                    and scuzzy and fake and cerebral, but, above all, that it had the potential to
                    be achingly, Romantically meaningful.
            </p>
            <p>However, this is not to imply that smaller-scale
                    connections cannot be drawn between Bowie and the discourses and affordances
                    incubated in Romantic works. It seems to me that there’s more than a hint of
                    Byron’s Manfred in the return of the Thin White Duke “throwing darts in lovers’
                    eyes” (Bowie, “Station to Station”). Perhaps there’s also an echo of the lamp
                    that must be replenished but which will still never burn long enough (<emph>Manfred</emph>
                1.1.1–2) in the solitary candle burning in the Villa of
                    Ormen (Bowie, “Blackstar”). This echo might easily be multiplied by working
                    through the incantatory self-assertions and self-fashionings that follow in each
                    case. The eyes of the addressee “at the centre of it all” in “Blackstar” would
                    for Manfred be Astarte’s eyes, around which everything else revolves. The
                    contiguousness of Astarte’s eyes with Manfred’s own—“like to mine”
                    (2.2.107)—resonates with the doublings and collapsings in Bowie’s lyric. Manfred
                    defines himself against and within nature in his speeches on the Jungfrau and to
                    the Witch of the Alps, joying in following “through the night the moving moon /
                    The stars and their development” (2.2.70–1) while feeling “degraded back” and
                    “all clay again” (2.2.78–9) when human frames intrude. Similarly, although
                    perhaps more playfully, the voice that cries out in “Blackstar” desires “eagles
                    in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes” and denies the social roles of film star,
                    pop star, porn star, and gangster while self-consciously assuming a more sublime
                    stellar identity. These affinities chime with those expressed by Manfred when he
                    praises the sun as “representative of the Unknown” (3.2.15) or claims that in
                    “starry shade / Of dim and solitary loveliness, / I learn’d the language of
                    another world” (3.4.5–7). Bowie’s version of this declaration is perhaps more in
                    line with the performative ironies of the later Byron than with Manfred’s
                    solipsistic grieving, but glimpses of the mode linger.
            </p>
            <p>In a similar vein, we might read the experimental
                    fragments and oblique scraps of Berlin Trilogy Bowie as an interesting
                    counterpoint to Coleridge’s proliferating notebook projections: certainties that
                    never fully resolve, floating in anxieties and reversionings. There’s a touch of
                    Shelley’s half-chastened but still-burning utopianism in songs like “Starman,”
                    “Memory of a Free Festival,” and “The Bewlay Brothers,” and a flicker of a
                    maximalist “England in 1819” in “Young Americans.” In imagining the descent of
                    an ambivalent—yet sublime and infinitely compelling—cosmic force into a world
                    with “five years left to cry in,”
                <emph>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy
                Stardust</emph> could be read as projecting an Orc for the 1970s rather than the 1790s: a Blakean creation who both streams back into myth and steps out into the quotidian world as a flawed avatar of the times.</p>
            <p>I could go on for a considerable time, expanding on this
                    list to address the questions that it begs. Why focus on the old-school
                    visionary company? Does Bowie resonate with Anna Laetitia Barbauld, or Felicia
                    Hemans (a similarly generous acknowledger of connections), or (perhaps most
                    plausibly) with Letitia Landon, another artist who felt that she’d come late to
                    the party and needed to negotiate a newly-establishing tradition while making
                    her own voice? Might Bowie be, in certain moods and modes, like Jane Austen, or
                    Sydney Owenson, or Walter Scott? Did the suburban kid from unfashionable Bromley
                    fashion himself in ways that chime with Ayrshire’s “heaven-taught plowman,” or
                    with the Helpston man who began by reflecting on the natural world and who ended
                    up echoing everything? However, to continue would take this piece considerably
                    beyond the compass of an introduction, and would intrude on the work of the
                    essays that follow, which combine considerations of the legacies of the Big Six
                    with larger and more diverse constellations of influence. We have by no means
                    covered everything, and we sincerely hope that this collection will inspire
                    other scholars to explore further Romantic resonances in Bowie and in others.
                    Now, though, it is time to proceed to the starts we have made. Having sketched
                    out models of Romantic inheritance and indicated how Bowie might be used to
                    investigate these, all that remains is briefly to trail the individual
                    contributions before shutting up gracefully and letting them speak for
                    themselves.
            </p>
            <p>In the opening essay, Joanna E. Taylor considers the
                    strong consonances between the manners in which Romantic-period writers located
                    selves through conceptualizing forms of contained space and Bowie’s practices in
                    the sequence of songs featuring Major Tom. Her essay pays particular attention
                    to echoes, which serve both as means of reiterating and as forms that can queer
                    the boundaries between individuals, communities, and environments. After
                    exploring Romantic and post-Romantic modes for locating and challenging
                    individualism using space, Taylor zeroes in on the choral echoes of Coleridge’s
                    “great I AM,” a phrase echoed directly in Bowie’s “Blackstar.” She then tracks
                    the forms that “Blackstar” models back to Bowie’s earliest big hit, “Space
                    Oddity,” which both employs and resists echoes and repetitions to show how Major
                    Tom might “[reject] individualism in order to embrace his own individuality.”
                    Taylor concludes by exploring the ways that Major Tom continues to act as a
                    fading but dynamically unsettling (New) Romantic echo in Bowie’s later
                    works.
            </p>
            <p>While Taylor’s essay shows Bowie extending paradigms influenced by Romanticism, Beatrice Turner’s essay finds him appropriating and revoicing Romantic attitudes regarding childhood innocence while also ironizing these and providing emancipatory alternatives. In her conception, the oft-dismissed “Kooks” provides the key to
                <emph>Hunky Dory</emph>’s visions of generational definition, transmission, and conflict. While “Kooks” appears to be a cutesy celebration, when placed in the wider contexts of the album and of Romantic appropriations of children as symbolic figures, its fissures, contradictions, and silencings become apparent. Crucially, however, Turner reads in Bowie a kind of resistance that recognizes the power and potential value of the paradigm it critiques. While
                <emph>Hunky
                Dory</emph> is ultimately on the side of experience rather than endorsing a restricting imposition of innocence, its cynicism is far from unalloyed, providing, in Turner’s reading, a complex and nuanced exploration of the difficulties of inheritance.</p>
            <p>In her discussion of personal and social identities, Emily
                    Bernhard-Jackson argues that the ways in which Bowie configured his personae and
                    self can helpfully be understood as an expansion and extension of a tradition
                    developed in the writings of John Locke, David Hume, and George Berkeley. In
                    opening, she establishes a chain of indexical transmissions through which Bowie
                    may have encountered these philosophers’ ideas, but more importantly, she
                    demonstrates clearly how reading Bowie alongside Enlightenment philosophy
                    surfaces a kind of artistry prepared to commit where its eighteenth-century
                    precursors caviled. In Bernhard-Jackson’s reading, Bowie is revealed to have
                    made a quintessentially Romantic move by taking ideas about the sequential and
                    fungible nature of identity—which had previously been formulated as relatively
                    abstract conceptions—and bringing these into life through a combination of
                    personal commitment, media manipulation, and skilled artistry.
            </p>
            <p>My own essay picks up on some of these arguments by considering how Bowie engages with Romanticism’s creation of specialized forms of artistic identity. After contending that the invention of the capital-A artist was principally a response to Romantic-period innovations, I argue that Bowie works simultaneously within and against this tradition. His lyrics, personae, and mediated existence all serve to expand the range of what can be represented in society and culture, building on the crucial Romantic-period developments that established art as a space of radical exploration and assembly. However, Bowie is more conflicted about the kinds of powers that should be arrogated to the artist than his early-nineteenth-century predecessors. His lyrics often resist the claims to privileged consciousness that canonical Romantic pronouncements like Keats’s “negative capability” letter, Wordsworth’s
                <emph>Prelude</emph>,
                    and Shelley’s agonizingly self-conscious lyrics seem to advance. Instead,
                    Bowie’s works consistently gesture out towards his audiences, insisting on the
                    liberating faultiness of artistic transmissions and on the crucial role of the
                    listener in making meanings and connections.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Forest Pyle’s essay begins by considering Bowie’s wide range of influences beyond Romanticism, showing his vital engagements with celebrity, modernism, and postmodernity. While he tantalizingly sketches the outlines of a glam Romanticism, the main thrust of Pyle’s essay is concerned with a reconfigured queering Romanticism mediated, among others, by Walter Pater, Oscar Wilde, and Walter Benjamin. His lens for exploring this constellation is Todd Haynes’s 1998 film 
                <emph>Velvet Goldmine</emph>, which does not feature Bowie or include his music in a direct sense, but which is dominated by what Pyle calls the Bowie-Image, a conduit for and avatar of the electric vivacity of art. In Pyle’s reading,
                <emph>Velvet
                Goldmine</emph> is a “site of both nostalgia and ebullience, alternating currents in Romanticism’s transmissions to our future.” In being so, it becomes a place of prospective liberation and of freedom from the need to be redeemed, capturing—albeit with nuance—the image of potential transcendence transmitted through Romantic poetry and through Bowie’s “gift of sound and vision.”
            </p>
            <p>
                When Bowie himself (or one of his personae) imagined what
                    being a “Star” would be like, its potentialities included both the deeply
                    personal or banal (“I could fall asleep at night”) and the nakedly commercial
                    (“I could do with the money”). However, he also invested stardom with the
                    potential for radical change, arguing that he “could play the wild mutation as a
                    rock &amp; roll star.” In this collection, we have experimented with taking
                    Bowie at his word, tracing the ways in which we might see his personae, lyrics,
                    music, and presences as wild mutations of Romantic inheritances. The extent of
                    our success is for you to judge, but it’s been an amazingly fun project to put
                    together. We hope you enjoy this collection as much as we have, and that you
                    find some of the things it has to say useful in your own examinations of
                    Romantic lineages and transformations.
