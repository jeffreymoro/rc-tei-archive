                        Romantic project engaged with spatial understandings that were first embedded in
                        poetic practices in early-nineteenth-century Britain. Building on Samuel Taylor
                        Coleridge’s—fundamentally spatial—concept of the “I AM,” this essay suggests that
                        spatial readings of Bowie’s “Major Tom” series can help us to echolocate innovative
                        forms of (New) Romantic identities. More than this, it argues that reading Bowie’s
                        tracks in light of Romantic concepts might assist in our ongoing project to engage
                        with and respond to earlier works in ways that productively bring modern
                        technological and spatial experiences to bear on historical literatures.</p>

            <div type="section">
            <p>In his sonnet “The Poet,” published in the <emph>North of England Magazine</emph> in February 1842, Hartley Coleridge
                mused that the poet “smit with love of fame” must accept their own vanishing. In a
                sense, Hartley pushed a Keatsian negative capability to its logical conclusion: the
                poet’s inevitable fate is to become, like Ovid’s Echo, “a nothing, save a voice, a
                name, / Which lives, when other voices give it birth” (91). Indeed, according to
                Hartley it is only in this extreme form of containment—a synecdochal reduction from
                body to voice—that the poet can hope for expansive influence. The poet’s very
                identity is expressed in the echo between the poetic self and the wider world, and
                particularly between the poet’s work and repetitions of it.</p>
            <p>How this same relationship between space, echo, and
                identity operates in David Bowie’s corpus—and how it can be better understood when
                read through and as Romanticism—is what I want to explore in this essay. When Bowie
                reflected on his creative relationship with Tony Visconti—the producer with whom he
                worked intermittently from his second album in 1969 until his last in 2016—he
                concluded that what made their collaboration so effective was that they knew
                “between [them], how to landscape a song and give it a real place, an identity and a
                character” (qtd. in Pareles). This landscaping generated lyric and sonic spaces that
                encourage a “collapse” of the boundaries between artist and listener, track and
                text, song world and real world (Cinque, Moore, and Redmond 4). Bowie’s works, in
                short, deployed odd relationships to and in space as complex metaphors through which
                to explore the connection between the self and the wider world.</p>
            <p>To investigate how Bowie deploys spatiality to explore a
                form of (New) Romantic selfhood, I focus on one of his most iconic, and most
                Romantic, characters: Major Tom, the enigmatic spaceman who appears both in Bowie’s
                early music of the late sixties and—paratextually at least—on his last album. By
                tracing Major Tom’s evolution throughout Bowie’s corpus—from “Space Oddity,” through
                “Ashes to Ashes” and “Hallo Spaceboy,” to “Blackstar”—I demonstrate how his
                metamorphosis is registered most strongly in (New) Romantic spatial oddities. In
                tracing these synergies, my aim is to demonstrate how Bowie’s (New) Romanticism
                engaged with spatial understandings that became embedded in poetic practice in early
                nineteenth-century Britain.</p>
            <p>More than this, though, I want to indicate the ways in
                which (re-)reading Bowie in light of Romanticism also asks us to re-assess some of
                our thinking about the Romantics, wherein ‘New Romanticism’ is not simply a
                descendent of Romanticism proper, but offers something of its own back. That is to
                say, considering Bowie’s material as a descendent of Romantic poetry asks us to
                reconsider how we respond to those earlier texts and highlights these earlier works
                as the products of a similarly rich perceptual field to that which inspired Bowie.
                Bowie’s corpus emphasizes a kind of multi-sensory perception that, as Barish Ali and
                Heidi Wallace astutely note, disrupts “the boundaries between author, text, audience
                and culture” (263). The unsettling of these boundaries is a distinctively Romantic
                concern, and returning to Romanticism via Bowie highlights the importance of paying
                attention to embodied creativity. In particular, Bowie emphasises sound’s role in
                negotiating the relationship between the self and the world in ways that have often
                remained underappreciated in Romantic-era works—although this neglect has begun to
                be rectified in recent years.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Angela Leighton’s recent study <emph>Hearing Things: The Work of Sound in Literature</emph> has adeptly explored how sound functions as a
                                literary device from the late Romantics onward, but the importance
                                of sound as a Romantic historical and literary phenomenon has been
                                considered recently by scholars including Matthew Rowney, Michele
                                Speitz and Susan Wolfson (see Works Cited for the relevant
                                publications). I have also written on this topic elsewhere (see
                                “Echoes in the Mountains: The Romantic Lake District’s

                suggest that Bowie drew on the imaginative possibilities of notions about contained
                expansion that emerged in—and, I think, were fundamental for understandings
                of—Romantic literature. The imaginative possibilities of contained space found their
                most powerful expression in the use of the echo as trope and metaphor for the (New)
                Romantic creative self.</p></div>

            <head>Coleridge and Bowie’s “great I Am”</head>
            
            <p>The most strident definition of selfhood in the Romantic
                period depends precisely on the interplay between containment and expansion that
                Hartley Coleridge and David Bowie identify as being core to expressions of
                individual identity. Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s concept of the Imagination depended
                upon motion within a contained space. At its most successful, the Imagination could
                queer the boundaries between subject and object. The wealth of scholarly
                interpretations of Coleridge’s theories of the Imagination and the “I Am”
                notwithstanding, little attention has been paid to the fact that Coleridge conceived
                of the Imagination as an essentially spatial construct.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jonathan Wordsworth offers a helpful overview of the most prescient of interpretations up to the mid-1980s.</note>
                Imagination was a mode that facilitated a self-discovery based upon what Helen
                Vendler terms “lyric intimacy”; it depended for its origins on circumscribed
                boundaries, and it was the transgressing of those borders which revealed
                self-knowledge. The primary Imagination was a form of motion that operated through
                the movement of the “finite mind” within the “infinite I AM”
                (<emph>Biographia</emph> I:304), by which Coleridge
                meant “spirit, self, and self-consciousness”
                (<emph>Biographia</emph> I:273). The primary
                Imagination depended, in other words, upon an interplay between containment in the
                finite and expansion into the infinite.</p>
            <p>The secondary Imagination, meanwhile, was the “echo” of the
                primary: it “dissolves, diffuses, dissipates in order to recreate” (<emph>Biographia</emph> I: 304). Jonathan Wordsworth thinks that this
                phrasing is proof that the secondary Imagination was less important for Coleridge
                than the primary; he finds that the word “echo” suggests a “diminishment” (75). Yet,
                in this instance, the echo’s diffusion does not necessarily render the effect
                weaker; in fact, Coleridge thought that this diffusion caused an erasure of the
                boundary between the self and God, allowing them to blend together. At its most
                successful—the generation of “the absolute I AM”—the Imagination could lead to a
                discovery of the divine in the self, and the self in the divine. And the echo—the
                    “<emph>act of writing itself</emph>,” as Wordsworth interprets it
                (83)—linked this divine self to the rest of Creation; Coleridge concluded his
                “Literary Life” with the thought that the “filial WORD” of “the great I AM” created
                a “choral echo [which] is the universe” (<emph>Biographia</emph> II:
                    247–8). Here, it is not just the poet’s voice that
                lives through other voices; God himself depends for his influence on the echoes
                created by individual voices and texts. As Denis Flannery suggests is the case for
                Bowie’s sounds, the Coleridgean Imagination is a force that can “queer” the limits
                of the self, leading to new understandings of the individual’s sense of identity and
                relationship to the cosmos.</p>
            <p>Bowie’s version of the “I Am” is inherited from Maurice
                Merleau-Ponty, who Coleridge anticipated in believing
                that the “I Am” cannot be
                demarcated. Instead, it “moves outwards” to provide personal, phenomenological
                definition to the physical, moral, and historical worlds (Merleau-Ponty ix). It has
                seemed to a number of Bowie scholars that this move outwards is indicative of a form
                of liminality that translates into a loss of selfhood. Ian Chapman finds that
                liminality indicates Bowie’s perpetual fear about a such a loss (2015), whilst
                Nicholas Greco conceives of Bowie’s liminal space as a kind of labyrinth: Bowie
                “enters into it and is lost,” he thinks (164). But what Greco and Chapman interpret
                as liminality is, in Bowie’s own terms, a “third dimension” (Yentob 1975). It is a
                queer landscape, located between the borders of established spaces, which translates
                a loss of selfhood into something more like an excess of it. Yet—as I want to
                demonstrate in the remainder of this essay—Bowie recalls Coleridge in foregrounding
                the role of the echo in the discovery of the “I Am.” In Bowie’s works, the echo is
                the principal means of communicating this new idea of the “I Am”; it opens out new
                possibilities for the individual to diffuse and diffract into what Shelton Waldrep
                calls “performances of self.”</p></div>

            <head>Echolocation and (New) Romanticism</head>
            <p>When Drew Daniel writes that sound—“<emph>not
                    music</emph>,” he clarifies, “<emph>but sound</emph>”—is uniquely able
                to queer the boundaries between individual, community, and environment, he posits a
                theory of listening that is fundamentally indebted to the kind of Romantic imaginary
                I have been outlining. By its very nature, Daniel argues, sound operates through a
                disruption of the boundaries between inside and outside. Sound can reinforce our
                sense of individuality through its creation of a personal sonic experience, but what
                Daniel calls the “promiscuous open-ness of the ear” means that “[s]ound intrudes
                upon us with the fact of the world.” Listening itself, in this reading, becomes a
                form of contained expansion, whereby intrusion “affords us the possibility of
                forgetting . . . attachments to our subjective particularity and affiliation and
                instead forces us to register the everywhere of an ongoing being, an outside where
                we thought there was no outside.” Sound, meanwhile, becomes a unique way of
                communicating both the tensions and affinities between the individual and a
                “perceptual community” that links us to “the world beyond that community.” In short,
                Daniel concludes, sound “blurs the edges” of the self.</p>
            <p>Daniel believes this process to be specific to sound,
                rather than music—or, at least, recorded music—because the kind of queerness he
                describes relies upon the true experience of what he calls an “immanent occasion”;
                since recording fixes a certain sound in place, it removes the possibility for sonic
                spontaneity that Daniel sees as central to sound’s inherent queerness. But what not
                even recording music can do is to fix the affect it produces in the listener—and, in
                Romantic thinking, it was affect that distinguished music from sound. John Ruskin,
                for instance, drew on the philosophies of Plato and Hesiod when he clarified in <emph>Fors Clavigera</emph> (1875) that “the Greeks only called ‘Music’
                the kind of sound which induced right moral feeling . . . and any other kind of
                sound than that, however beautiful to the ear or scientific in composition, they did
                not call ‘Music’” (261). The recognition of such feelings relied on a listener
                trained in the art of translating a sonic “impulse on the organ” into an
                “observation of the mind.” The physical quality of sound, and the ability to hear
                it, was only part of the point, as Ruskin explained in “The Queen of the Air”
                (1869):
            <quote>It is
                    quite true that the tympanum of the ear vibrates under sound, and that the
                    surface of the water in a ditch vibrates too: but the ditch hears nothing for
                    all that; and my hearing is still to me as blessed a mystery as ever, and the
                    interval between the ditch and me, quite as great. If the trembling sound in my
                    ears was once of the marriage bell which began my happiness, and is now of the
                    passing bell which ends it, the difference between those two sounds to me cannot
                    be counted by the number of concussions. (354)</quote>
            Ruskin acknowledges something that Daniel risks
                overlooking: that both sound and music can mean something different at every
                encounter, a reflection of the influence that social codes and personal
                circumstances have on the act of listening. Ruskin acknowledges the role of feeling
                in listening: he concludes that music is a combination of the soundwave with the
                listener’s affective response to it. In this sense, music becomes sound properly
                interpreted. It is this kind of slippage between sound and music with which Bowie’s
                corpus plays; in seeking to affect his listener’s space as much as to communicate a
                track-specific sonic world, Bowie floats in a most peculiar way between, as Denis
                Flannery observes, “recognition and anonymity, the cohering force of music and the
                dissolving, queering effect of sound” (159). Bowie’s material mediates between
                coherence and dissolution, and between sound and music, in part through the careful
                ways in which it was landscaped to communicate a sense of spatiality through both
                his lyrics and the record’s sonic formation of space. Bowie’s aim was not to induce
                a Ruskinian “right moral feeling”; rather, these tracks created a contained space in
                which feeling—as a changeable, mutable experience—could be explored as the
                centre-point of a form of individualism which acknowledged that individuality need
                not be fixed.</p>
            <p>This is, perhaps, particularly true of “Space Oddity,”
                which self-consciously marks out a form of soundbox, a musicological concept that
                visualises music as a four-dimensional model and attempts, as Ruth Dockwray and
                Allan F. Moore explain, to map the “locations of sound sources in recordings” (182).
                It offers a way of “conceptualizing the textural space that a recording inhabits, by
                enabling us to literally hear recordings taking space” (Moore 30) and creates a
                visualization that allows the analyst to ask where particular sounds appear to be
                coming from (Figure 1). The soundbox is envisaged as a contained space, but there
                are two key ways of enlarging it: reverberation and echo (Moore 46). Peter Doyle has
                written extensively about the generic differences between these two effects but, to
                summarise drastically, he defines reverberation as something that seems to continue
                a sound, whilst an echo repeats it. John Hollander offers a nuance to this
                definition in his study of figurative echoes in poetry after Milton, when he notes
                that the distinction is partly temporal: echoes reach the ear approximately
                one-fifteenth of a second after reverberations thanks to the fact that an echo must
                travel to and from a reflective surface (1). Before sound recording technologies
                were developed in the mid-nineteenth century, echoes—“and,” Hollander writes,
                “perhaps parrots”—were the only real means of perpetuating sound (1–2).</p>

            <p>Doyle thinks that the echo is especially tricky to
                interpret, because it leads us “further into the area of connotation.” In “teasing .
                . . meanings out,” he thinks, “we run the risk of overinterpreting, or of
                misreading” (14). In this reading, the echo might be a key part of a song’s
                transition into a text. By the 1960s, echoes—and their counterpart,
                reverberation—were a standard element of pop music. Doyle shows how music from this
                period—building on the rockabilly, rock n roll, and jazz traditions of the 1940s and
                50s (under the influence of which Bowie grew up)—took advantage of stereo recording,
                and the possibilities for echo and reverb it afforded, to make spatiality “a new
                component in the musical totality” (5). The studio space in which these effects were
                created was particularly suggestive (Doyle 6); it is, perhaps, the ultimate symbol
                from this era of the creative possibilities afforded by enclosure. Phil Spector’s
                “Wall of Sound”—a mode of production that foregrounded the interplay between an
                exaggerated musical texture and the close confinement of the studio—is perhaps the
                best-known use of this new space (Moorefield 11–2). For Doyle, as for Oliver Read
                and Walter Welch, this new sense of sonic spatiality was fundamentally Romantic; it
                was, they think, Romanticism which brought “the listener into the studio or
                auditorium” (377). The echo became an important element in communicating a Romantic
                “world-creating demiurge” (Doyle 58). As a phenomenon entirely dependent on
                containment, the echo was particularly suggestive of a “sublime dreamed world”
                conjured by the artist (Doyle 5).</p>
            <p>The echo is a record—or a “memory,” as Sean Street terms
                it—of sound’s interactions with the environment (3). Formed by soundwaves’
                reflections from a surface, an echo depends for its formation on a degree of
                containment, but its repetitions of a sound event make it a vehicle for a sense—both
                physical and imaginative—of vastness. The echo exaggerates what George Revill
                identifies as the core properties of heard sounds by giving “embodied sensation to
                properties of depth, distance and proximity” (247). Echoes or reverberations—and the
                related concept of resonance—each emphasise an ecological relationship between sound
                and listener, but the echo’s relationship to space makes it distinctive. As
                Hollander explains,</p>
            <p>[i]n modern discourse, the word <emph>echo</emph> is used figuratively to indicate a musical or linguistic
                    repetition, usually of a short utterance or the terminal portion of a longer
                    one, with the additional qualification that the repeated sound is not only
                    contingent upon the first, but in some way a qualified version of it.(3)</p>
            <p>What Hollander does not explicitly acknowledge, though, is
                that these qualifications are both figurative and physical: an echo returns a weaker
                version of the original sound—a kind of “speaking silence,” as Christina Rossetti
                memorably termed it (314). Each repetition of an image or idea alters the original
                in some way that develops or complicates its meaning. An echo also changes the way
                sound is perceived in space, transforming it from a mono-directional entity into a
                multi-directional experience. That makes conceiving of a track’s soundbox more
                difficult; the artist who deploys the echo deliberately complicates what Drew Daniel
                might call the locatability of the sonic experience. By challenging a sound source’s
                identity in these ways, the echo might also effect an ontological shift from music
                back to sound.</p>
            <p>Such performances of unlocatability thus emphasise what
                Daniel calls “the queerness of sound”; since the echo is in itself based on
                dissolution and diffusion, it is in itself a queer—and queering—experience. Daniel
                takes this concept further by suggesting that sound might help us to “echolocate the
                edges of subjection.” This is a powerful metaphor for thinking about the (New)
                Romantic self. Echolocation, a natural cartographic tool that situates the
                individual within their environment, becomes in Daniel’s reading an ecological
                process that both reinforces an individual’s private subjectivity and positions them
                as part of a system that might be local, national or global. But it was in Romantic
                writing that the echo became a particularly potent metaphor for creativity as well
                as a popular means through which to explore new places: Goethe’s and Rousseau’s
                enjoyment of the Venetian gondoliers’ echoing voices was just one instance of the
                echo’s important role in personal understandings of space and spatiality (Agnew
                73–4). By the Victorian period, sound, soundwaves, and echoes were widely enough
                understood concepts to feature prominently in popular advertising campaigns and the
                works of influential authors, not least Charles Dickens, George Eliot (Picker 8–10),
                and—as we have already seen—Hartley Coleridge.</p>
            <p>A century later, when Bowie too was asking “who are we / So
                small in times such as these” (“Slow Burn”), advancements in sound technologies
                offered portals through which to explore tensions between personal space and global
                spatiality. Peter Doyle goes so far as to associate the fascination with space in
                music, witnessed throughout the 1960s, with the new-found portability of what he
                calls “virtual spatiality” that the development of stereo equipment had facilitated
                (6). As Bowie discovered, these technologies meant that sound could be employed both
                metaphorically and literally to explore the individual artist or listener’s
                connection to the world around them. One answer to that question—who are we?—posits
                that, for Bowie(as for Simon and Garfunkel) the “echoes in tenement halls” might
                hold some important answers.</p>
            <p>The possibilities communicated by the physical echo, and
                held open by the imaginative one, are brought together in Bowie’s penultimate
                release, “Blackstar.” “Blackstar” alternates between declaring all the things that
                Bowie is not—a film star, a pop star, a marvel star—and what he is: a Blackstar,
                which Bowie’s vocals confirm when he echoes the mantra. This is a subversive,
                playful echo: the main vocalist repeats the backing vocals, rather than the other
                way around. The interplay between the two marks out a sonic third space, in the
                middle of which is what the lyrics label “the great I Am.” The line is adapted, via
                Merleau-Ponty and Coleridge, from God’s declaration to Moses: “I am who I am”
                (Exodus 3:14). Bowie turns this into a playful declaration of precisely the kind of
                blending between the human and the divine which Coleridge had mused upon. “The great
                I Am,” here, is a rebuttal to the previous line’s summary of his early critics’
                dismissals: “you’re a flash in the pan.” When Bowie responds by declaring himself to
                be “the great I Am,” it is a Coleridgean claim for creative, poetic greatness that
                celebrates the slipperiness of (New) Romantic selfhood: the “Great I Am” can be the
                “I Am” of a great many things.</p>

            <p>The allusions in the “Blackstar” video to a lost spaceman
                link this affirmation of “the great I Am” back to Major Tom. In the video’s opening
                scene, the link between the astronaut and the Blackstar are made explicit through
                the framing of the spacesuit by a ring of black stars. This intertextual echo makes
                clear that Bowie had been considering questions about expansion, containment, and
                their effect on the self since early in his career—and that Major Tom remained the
                key for echolocating Bowie’s (New) Romantic self.</p></div>

            <head>Odd Spatiality in “Space Oddity”</head>
            <p>“Space Oddity” was Bowie’s “antidote to space fever” (qtd.
                in Doggett 53). The dystopian consequences of humanity’s expansion into outer space
                had been starkly imagined in Stanley Kubrick’s
                <emph>2001: A Space Odyssey</emph> (1968). This was
                the film that inspired Bowie’s track, and “Space Oddity” also communicates a
                profound ambivalence towards the space race. The song’s tone appears to have been
                missed by some of its early listeners, though; it was first aired on the BBC,
                apparently without irony, during TV coverage of the moon landing on 20 July 1969
                (Doggett 53). Nevertheless, this event marked “Space Oddity” as the anthem for new
                forms of questioning about earth-bound and extra-terrestrial individualisms. It does
                so by immersing the listener in the dialectics of contained expansion that “Space
                Oddity” both describes and, through its deployment of complex narrative and
                structural echoes, enacts. These echoes foreground the track’s interest in
                spatiality, as well as space, and—in Doyle’s terms, inspired by Gilles Deleuze and
                Félix Guattari—makes its “territorial project fully explicit” (17): this is
                somewhere the “I Am” might be discovered.</p>

            <p>“Space Oddity” imagines the journey of one astronaut, Major
                Tom, into outer space. This endeavour turns Tom into a celebrity—“the papers” become
                desperate to know “whose shirts [he] wear[s]”—but Tom ultimately rejects this
                exaggerated celebration of consumer-centred individualism; he leaves the capsule
                and, bidding farewell to his wife, disconnects from Ground Control to float away
                from both the technologies and peoples that bind him to earth. This journey is
                echoed in the track’s musical structure, which Brad Erickson thinks “models escape
                from terrestrial confinement” (564–5): the way it fades out at the end seems to
                follow Major Tom’s floating away into space. The effect, as Peter Doggett poetically
                puts it, is to “[leave] the listener uncertain where they might touch down” (56).
                For Michael Mooradian Lupro, on the other hand, Major Tom’s disappearance into space
                offers more than a sense of freedom: it indicates the character’s embracing of
                “difference” as he willingly moves into “a place unbound by terrestrial norms of
                comportment and expression” (14). The narrative and structure both reinforce this
                odd sense of the individual’s dissolution into an unknown space.</p>
            <p>But “Space Oddity” does not just mimic the space
                experienced by Major Tom. As Lupro puts it, Major Tom “intertwines with our
                understanding of what it might be like to exist as a real human being in real space”
                (14). The track’s auditory space becomes the listener’s tin can, and it inscribes a
                sonic orbit around the listener that enfolds them into a space that blends the
                fictional song world with their real one. The way the track fades in at the
                beginning and out again at the end positions the listener alongside Tom as the
                centre of its journey. In Ken McLeod’s words, it “mediates our internal space
                (feelings, desires, dreams) with external space (the physical, the experienced)”
                (337). It encourages the listener to make the same discovery as Major Tom: that
                ultimate freedom might arise out of extreme containment.</p>
            <p>This spatiality operates through the technologies the song
                employs as much as those which support Major Tom’s journey: for “Space Oddity,”
                Bowie insisted—against his producer’s advice—on a recording technique that was still
                rare in the late 1960s, and which emphasizes the song’s intent to contain the
                listener in a space of its own. Throughout the track, Bowie’s voice shifts, as Lupro
                explains, “from singular centred to multiple stereo” (20). The effect, Ali and
                Wallace argue, is to transform Bowie’s voice into “both subject and object of its
                own enunciations” (275). When those shifts occur is crucial: the first line is
                spoken by a single voice: that of one person in Ground Control. Bowie’s voice splits
                in the second line; a low-pitched voice sings in the listener’s right ear and is
                doubled by one singing an octave higher in their left. When the countdown begins,
                this higher voice becomes the countdown, leaving its companion to continue
                communicating with the astronaut. The effect is to place the listener alongside
                Major Tom inside the capsule, surrounded by Ground Control’s plural commanding
                voices. This doubling is echoed imperfectly when we first hear from Major Tom; to
                begin with, the voice is singular, but as he steps “through the door” it splits as
                Ground Control’s had done. So far, Major Tom and his controllers are in line with
                each other. But when Major Tom notices how “very different” the stars look from this
                angle, and locates himself in this queer space—“for here am I”—the vocals alter:
                now, the lower-pitched voice comes from the left. For Lupro, these stereo vocals
                resituate Major Tom from a celebrity—an extreme form of individualistic
                selfhood—into “a universal cosmopolitan speaking uneasily for, of, and to,
                multiplicitous positions” (20). This echo indicates a subtle, yet significant, shift
                in Tom’s sense of identity.</p>
            <p>This change occurs as Tom begins to feel the effects of
                anti-gravitational forces; he finds himself “floating in a most peculiar way.” But
                this peculiarity is made ambiguous by Bowie’s mode of singing the line—adding a
                syllable so that it actually sounds like Tom is “floating in a most a-peculiar way.”
                In this way, the line holds the potential both for oddness and normalcy (Flannery
                161; Lupro 20). In either case, Tom finds that his mode of perception is altered:
                “the stars look very different” from this angle. This new form of motion, as
                Flannery perceptively observes, “involves a massive change, either in the world(s)
                around one or in the way in which that world is apprehended, or in a fusion, always
                theatrical, of both” (161).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lupro, by contrast, thinks that floating becomes mundane over the course of the song.</note>
                It holds the possibility for multiple versions of the future. Initially, Tom
                situates himself within an exaggeratedly everyday earthly object in a way that
                highlights his affinity with his home planet: “here am I sitting in a tin can / far
                above the world.” Yet, there is an echo in the line that indicates a subtle shift in
                meaning: “I Am” becomes “am I.” The shift is significant: “am I” contains the
                potential for plurality, in a way that the more definitive “I Am” may not. Just as
                each echo subtly changes the expression of an initial sound, offering multiple
                experiences of the same root source, so do “Space Oddity”’s lyrics encode the
                possibility that Major Tom might encode multiple selves. As soon as Major Tom steps
                through the door, his confident declarations of selfhood invert, and that odd
                formulation indicates a new fluidity in his terrestrial sense of self. An implied
                question—am I?—hovers with Tom around the space ship. The second time the line is
                repeated, Tom provides a different locus for his sense of identity; now, Tom
                expresses ownership over the tin can, and positions himself not in relation to
                earth, but to the moon. The fact that “planet earth is blue / and there’s nothing I
                can do” is no longer, in this second utterance, merely a statement of fact, but an
                acknowledgement of individual impotence in the face of a global
                problem—environmental degradation—and the individualistic human condition.</p>
            <p>It is while he’s floating in this way that Major Tom is
                able to echolocate a mappable point. Doggett thinks that the guitar solo that offers
                an interlude in the interstellar conversation between Tom and Ground Control “seemed
                to be testing out the walls of Major Tom’s prison” (56). Certainly, it is in this
                break that Tom seems to undergo the “sort of transformation” that Niall Boyce
                believes befalls him (528). Tom’s floating has caused him to re-evaluate his
                relationship to Ground Control and the society they represent. When Ground Control
                loses contact with their astronaut, their panic is evident in the high-pitched
                stereo vocals through which they repeatedly ask: “Can you hear me?” This question
                morphs into Major Tom’s declaration that he is “here.” This echo, from “hear” to
                “here,” indicates the discovery of a space in which Bowie can echolocate a new sense
                of identity for Major Tom that is predicated on the relationship between space,
                sound, and listening. His “floating” no longer seems peculiar, but rather allows him
                to affect a reversal of the earlier containment: now, it is he who encircles the
                spaceship. It is at this moment that Tom’s understanding of the “I Am” alters: this
                is when he becomes—to adapt Coleridge’s terms—a finite being moving in infinite
                space. It’s at this moment, too, that the grand-sounding “capsule” becomes nothing
                more than a “tin can,” while Tom stops aligning himself with the terrestrial
                community and begins to consider himself a space oddity.</p>
            <p>Major Tom’s metamorphosis is registered most strongly
                through alterations in this spatial relationship between Tom and the tin can,
                between inside and outside, and between the “I Am” and “I Am Not.” The “unearthly”
                stereo vocals, alongside what McLeod calls the “series of atonal and rhythmically
                irregular tape effects and electronic squelches in combination with an ethereal
                string section” (341), emphasise how queer—or how odd—space itself is in this track.
                It highlights the ways Major Tom feels himself to be different from the people he
                has left behind. Tom’s sense of alienation, resulting in what Lupro believes is a
                “metaphorical <emph>social</emph> suicide” (22),
                seems like the logical extreme of the individualism from which he excludes himself.
                In a sense, Major Tom rejects individualism in order to embrace his own
                individuality. As Tom’s afterlives suggest, however, this kind of anti-social action
                is not considered a virtue by the community on the blue earth.</p></div>

                    Tom</head>
            <p>Bowie’s final performance of the 1970s was of “Space
                Oddity” on
                <emph>Kenny Everett’s New Year’s Eve Show</emph> in
                the UK and <emph>Dick Clarke’s Salute to the Seventies</emph> in the US.
                Doggett reads this moment as the dissembling of a key Bowie myth in the face of a
                new age of Thatcherite social conservatism:
            <quote>The oddity was no longer the individual
                    ostracised from society but, in the Britain of Thatcher’s government, the person
                    who still dared to believe in the power of collective action and the ability of
                    society to care for all of its members, however alienated they might be.
                    (309)</quote>
            The kind of (New) Romantic identity that attempted to
                negotiate the relationship between individual and society seemed to be dead. In its
                place was a philosophy that valorised individualism but suspected individuality.
                Major Tom’s fate was illustrative of the damaging effects of the ostracization to
                which this new age might lead. Bowie’s performance of the track indicated that it
                was no longer only a space-age anthem; it was also a powerful metaphor for a drug
                culture that emphasised what might happen when an individual collided with the
                social order.</p>
            <p>When Bowie performed “Space Oddity” on <emph>Kenny Everett</emph>, his performance indicated a shift in the way that Major
                Tom’s declaration of individuality might be read. The prolonged silence after Ground
                Control sends “God’s love” to Tom allows Bowie to cross the stage from acoustic
                guitar to piano, but also leaves a significant emptiness in which Tom, we imagine,
                lifts off alone. In this version, Tom is disconnected both from Ground Control and,
                when he arrives at his orbit, from space itself: now, Tom tells Ground Control that
                he is simply “floating far above the moon.” He seems, now, not to be actually in
                space, but rather to be experiencing the kind of lonely drug trip with which Bowie’s
                jerky movements, twitching face and anxious posture—moving between sets with his
                arms tightly folded—suggest familiarity. More than this, Bowie performs the song on
                a stage made to look like the padded room of an asylum. The performance suggested an
                alternative fate for Major Tom. He had not, in the manner of Bowie’s other guises,
                been artistically killed off; rather, he metamorphoses yet again from a
                spaceman-turned-alien into an earth-bound, if delusional, junkie who retrospectively
                anticipates the Thin White Duke.</p>
            <p>After this, Major Tom became one of Bowie’s most
                distinctive and long-lasting echoes—but each time he appears, in the true nature of
                an echo, he seems to get weaker. John Hollander calls this characteristic the echo’s
                “decaying dynamics,” and it is an apt metaphor for Major Tom (3). After “Space
                Oddity,” Major Tom’s identity—his sense of the “I Am”—seems to diminish as the
                echoes fade. Doyle might add that this effect renders the echo incapable of
                communicating a solid sense of identity; at some point, the echo is “spread too
                thinly to ‘hold’ the territory” (18). Tom never speaks for himself again after
                “Space Oddity,” but others pass judgement on his mental and physical state. In
                “Ashes to Ashes,” perhaps Major Tom’s most (in)famous subsequent appearance, “we
                know Major Tom’s a junkie.” More than that, Major Tom’s excessive individualism has
                become a threat to social and personal productivity: “to get things done,” the
                narrator is repeatedly told, “you better not mess with Major Tom.” The reference
                might be to Tom himself, or to the cocaine, alcohol, and cigarettes with which Bowie
                himself was by now associated. For Waldrep, this coded reference “nominally recasts
                Major Tom . . . to use him as a stand-in for Bowie himself” (91). Each time these
                lines are repeated, the warning against Major Tom becomes starker, and the line
                between the character and the artist—the boundaries necessary for the (New) Romantic
                “I Am”—are increasingly blurred. Major Tom’s inverted expression of self—“am
                I”—contains increasing tensions throughout each of these echoes; they offer dark
                parodies of individualism that seem, in Major Tom’s case, to have brought about a
                troubling plurality that is reinforced through each of the character’s iterations
                (that is, until “Blackstar”).</p>
            <p> These weakening echoes perhaps reach their apotheosis in
                “Hallo Spaceboy,” from Bowie’s 1995 album <emph>1. Outside</emph>. Waldrep
                thinks that this album is where Bowie’s “presentations of his performative selves”
                reached their peak, and that seems to be true of Major Tom (18). The track plays
                with notions of bounded identities and sexualities—“Do you like girls or boys? /
                It’s confusing these days”—and its almost excessive echoing enacts the sense of
                “chaos” that the lyrics describe. The track’s central tension is between bodily
                constraint and freedom, containment and expansion:<quote><lg type="stanza">
            <l>Spaceboy, you’re sleepy now</l>
            <l>Your silhouette is so
                stationary</l>
            <l>You’re released but your custody
                    calls</l>
            <l>And I wanna to be free</l>
            <l>Don’t you wanna be free?</l></lg></quote>
           This verse, and the chorus that follows, is repeated twice
                throughout the song—and, more than that, an echo shadows almost every word. Bowie’s
                voice reverberating around the song-space reinforces the track’s repetitious nature,
                but emphasises, too, an ongoing attempt to echolocate Major Tom’s (New) Romantic
                individuality. In “Hallo Spaceboy,” the Major Tom figure has become naturalised in
                space; not quite an alien, nor is he any longer straightforwardly human.
                Nevertheless, he remains a companion in the struggle to negotiate individual
                boundaries: although he is “released”—presumably from terrestrial constraints—he is
                not able fully to discard a sense of imprisonment. Freedom seems to exist, here, in
                a third dimension between girls and boys, inside and outside, the “I Am” and the I
                am not.</p>
            <p>Although “Hallo Spaceboy” is preoccupied with saying “bye
                bye” to Major Tom, his death is not confirmed until Bowie’s penultimate video. In
                “Blackstar,” Bowie asserts that he has become a different kind of star, and the song
                plays with the very nature of the echo: this time, Major Tom seems to return more
                strongly than any time since “Space Oddity.” The treatment of Major Tom’s remains
                reinforces that oddity: his bejewelled skull becomes the focus of a ritual at the
                heart of a labyrinthine city, whilst the rest of his skeleton floats, peculiarly,
                away, morphing into the eponymous black star. This is when two of Bowie’s
                identities—his first and his last—collide. That intertextual echo effects an erasure
                of the boundaries between selves that Coleridge described, bringing with it all the
                versions of Major Tom that have accumulated along the way: astronaut, junkie,
                spaceboy, and relic. In the end, as Coleridge also indicated, at this point nothing
                remains but the words, echoing in and through new kinds of spatial and individual
                oddities. But this diffusion is not aesthetically or philosophically a weakness:
                Major Tom himself become a “choral echo,” morphs into the universe and indicates
                Bowie’s own diffusion into “the Great I Am.” The echoes that Bowie wrote, performed,
                and recorded located a (New) Romantic individualism that interrogated its own
                identity both within and without (extra-)terrestrial communities.</p>
