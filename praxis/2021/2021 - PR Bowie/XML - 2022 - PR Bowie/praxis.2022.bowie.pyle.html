            <p class="noCount">Neither David Bowie nor Romanticism are explicitly named in Todd Haynes’s 1998 film,
               <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>; but this essay takes on Haynes’s fictional account of the origins of “glam rock”
               to reflect on Bowie’s Romanticism and Romanticism’s Bowie. The essay approaches the
               topic using what Brian Eno called “oblique strategies” and what Walter Benjamin called
               “constellations”: Percy Shelley and Oscar Wilde, Benjamin and Bowie, Todd Haynes.
               At the center of this “constellation” is the “Bowie-Image,” an image <em>of</em> and <em>about</em> the Romantic image and what Shelley would call its “electric energies” or what might
               be called its “currencies” for Romanticism and for the “sounds and visions” of contemporary
               popular culture.

                  <p>On the surface, David Bowie is one of the least likely matches that I can imagine
                     for a pairing of pop culture with Romanticism, at least in the most agreed upon items
                     in our catalogue of Romantic images, themes, and motivations. To list just a few of
                     these entries: the relationship between an individual subject and the natural world,
                     reflections on or depictions of the beautiful and the sublime, a visionary poetics,
                     the gothic monstrous, the thematics of revolution, and an apostrophizing lyricism
                     that revisits and reanimates the genres of the ode and the ballad. And if many of
                     Bowie’s most compelling songs address or express the experience of solitude or alienation
                     we associate with Romanticism, his is the solitude and even “derangement” of a “space
                     oddity,” the cosmic alien “floating in a most peculiar way.” With Bowie we are very
                     far removed from the project of a Wordsworthian Romanticism as it is presented, for
                     example, in Stanley Cavell’s admirably concise formulation: “the task of bringing
                     the world back, as to life . . . a new creation of our habitat” (Cavell 53).

                     </div> In his most compelling images, Bowie was the “starman waiting in the sky,” at home
                     nowhere, without earthly habitat, concerned more with life on Mars or with how the
                     stars looked today.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>There are certainly many other artists in contemporary Anglo-American pop music from
                     Bowie’s era and after whose relationship to Romanticism, both earthbound and visionary,
                     is far more explicit. Patti Smith comes to mind, of course, not only for her devotion
                     to William Blake but for the experimental play of innocence and experience, naivete
                     and transgression, that animates her cultural projects. Morrissey’s mock anthems,
                     both with the Smiths and in his solo work afterwards, generate an affective irony
                     that turns so many of his songs into magnificent pop melodramas, brilliant camp performances
                     that are unthinkable without the Byron of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>. Thom Yorke’s songs with Radiohead, by turns twitchy, torqued, and exquisite, conjure
                     Percy Shelley’s political sensibility, aesthetic experimentation, and a poetic impulse
                     to learn “how to disappear completely.” Elsewhere, I’ve argued that singer-songwriters
                     as diverse as Kurt Cobain, Nick Drake, Cat Power, Elliott Smith, and Leonard Cohen
                     are affectively and formally marked by what I call “the Keats effects,” more specifically
                     the aura of a “shrine of no prospects” (Pyle 2020). Mary Shelley’s Romanticism established
                     its constitutive relationship with popular culture early enough for her to witness
                     first-hand its beginnings, though that effect is registered in theatre and cinema
                     rather than popular music.

                     </div> The prospect of establishing a vital current that runs from British Romanticism to
                     David Bowie is made even more challenging by the fact that his songs, at least to
                     the best of my knowledge, make no references to Romantic poets, no allusions to Romanticism
                     in form or figure.

                  <p>One might address the challenge of developing a relationship between Bowie and Romanticism
                     by asking how his songs or his personae might change the way we receive or interpret
                     certain Romantic texts. We might, for example, consider how Percy Shelley’s “The Witch
                     of Atlas,” arguably the “glammiest” of Romantic poems, anticipates Bowie, Ziggy Stardust,
                     and their aftermath. From this perspective Shelley’s “witch” is the “glam queen” who
                     commands all images, bestowing beauty upon the world in jeweled forms, the “many-star
                     beams” woven into “a subtle veil,” “a shadow for the splendor of her love” (ll. 149,
                     151–2).

                     </div> From her cosmic perspective, Shelley’s playful “witch” beholds “the constellations
                     reel and dance / Like fire-flies” (ll. 269–70) on a dancefloor. Shelley’s “glam-witch”
                     belongs to “the spirit of the wind,” and “her light feet / Past through the peopled
                     haunts of mankind, / Scattering sweet visions,” bestowing “strange panaceas in a chrystal
                     bowl” “to those she saw most beautiful” and “playing pranks among the cities” (ll.
                     521, 523–4, 594, 593, 665). From the hands of this playful glam-witch “a living Image”
                     “did flow,”—the genderqueer “Hermaphroditus,” a “fair Shape,” blessed with “all the
                     grace of both” sexes and adorned with “heaven-coloured pinions,”—Shelley’s own figural
                     anticipation of the man who fell to earth (ll. 325–6, 331, 393, 404).

                  <p>But as pleasurable as that mode of interpretive exercise might be, I’m not convinced
                     that British Romanticism offers sufficiently glam examples to make it work in a sustained
                     form. It is more immediately plausible to speak of Bowie and his various cultural
                     and musical “personae” as “performing” the catalogue of postmodernism, specifically
                     in the canonical version elaborated by Fredric Jameson: an emphasis on surfaces and
                     the refusal of notions of depth or interiority, the “flattening” out of temporality,
                     a celebration of style for its own sake, the aesthetics of pastiche, and even a song
                     dedicated to “Andy Warhol,” icon of postmodern art. In fact, Jameson’s principal example
                     of the new mode of multiplied sense experience demanded by the logic of postmodernism
                     is David Bowie in the role of Thomas Jerome Newton, the alien “who watches fifty-seven
                     television screens simultaneously” in Nicolas Roeg’s <em>The Man Who Fell to Earth</em> (1976).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Jameson’s account of this moment—and Bowie’s role in it—deserves to be quoted in full:
                              “The postmodernist viewer . . . is called upon to do the impossible, namely to see
                              all the screens at once, in their radical and random difference: such a viewer is
                              asked to follow the evolutionary mutation of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth
                              (who watches fifty-seven television screens simultaneously) and to rise somehow to
                              a level at which the vivid perception of radical difference is in and of itself a
                              new mode of grasping what used to be called relationship: something for which the
                              word collage is…</span></div>
                     </div> Moreover, Jameson identifies <em>David Bowie</em>, the <em>cinematic image</em> and not the <em>character</em> he plays in the film, as the one what has undergone the “evolutionary mutation” that
                     makes possible this new postmodern mode of multiply simultaneous perception. In this
                     version of the “Bowie effect,” he’s as much a symptom as a paradigm.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>If postmodern Bowie is the most obvious for his exemplification of what Jameson calls
                  the “cultural logic of late capitalism,” in terms of “elective affinities,” the critical
                  and theatrical modernisms of Brecht, Weill, Genet, and Brel are far more crucial to
                  Bowie’s own aesthetic project. In 1982, Bowie reprised the title role of <em>Baal</em>, Bertolt Brecht’s first play; Bowie’s version of “Alabama Song” became a staple of
                  his live performances; and the influence of Kurt Weill is audible in many of his songs,
                  perhaps most distinctly in the chorus of “Velvet Goldmine” (1971). “Jean Genie” is
                  a fierce homage to Jean Genet; and Bowie’s versions of Jacques Brel’s “Port of Amsterdam”
                  and “My Death” became signature covers during a long stretch of his live performances.
                  Bowie’s own performative affect and stagings—at least until the disappointing bluesy
                  authenticity of <em>Let’s Dance</em> (1983)—are perhaps the most paradigmatic example in pop music of Modernism’s “alienation
                  effect,” a reiterated thematization of the <em>Verfremdungseffekt.</em> There is certainly nothing comparable for Bowie in British Romanticism to this vital
                  curatorial reclamation of European modernism. From my perspective, discerning Romanticism’s
                  relationship with David Bowie demands something other than a logic of exemplification
                  or aesthetic allusions. It demands an oblique strategy, one that reorients Romanticism
                  according to Oscar Wilde.

                  <p>It is fair to say that for many of the stops on Wilde’s 1882 North American lecture
                     tour he was regarded by his audiences as something of a “space oddity,” his aestheticism
                     serving as a punchline for the accompanying Gilbert and Sullivan musical <em>Patience</em> whose protagonist, Bunthorne, was taken to be a parody of the tall, young Irish dandy,
                     preacher of art and beauty. At the age of twenty-eight, Wilde undertook this lecture
                     tour long before he had written the plays, dialogues, and novel that established his
                     extraordinary position in British culture. On his American Tour, Wilde not only lectured
                     in the cosmopolitan centers of New York, Boston, and San Francisco, but America’s
                     aesthetic hinterlands: Topeka, Dubuque, Leadville, Galveston, Ogden. Newspaper accounts
                     of his visits convey the sense of an alien aesthete preaching his unknown pleasures
                     to these provincial audiences.

                  <p>The tour’s inaugural lecture was delivered in New York and its title—“The English
                     Renaissance of Art”—refers not to the flowering of literature and culture in early
                     modern England but to what Wilde claimed as “our romantic movement,” :an open-ended
                     aestheticist current of Romanticism that dispenses with Wordsworth and Coleridge and
                     runs instead from Keats and Shelley through Walter Pater, Dante Rossetti, and himself.
                     Most importantly, Wilde’s conception of “our romantic movement” does not have a terminus:
                     it is available to any future artists who feel themselves hailed as one of “ours.”
                     Wilde’s Romanticism is not confined to a historical period, nor is it bound to the
                     most prominent themes of the period. For Wilde Romanticism is defined by its “most
                     vital tendencies”: “the two most vital tendencies of the nineteenth century—the democratic
                     and pantheistic tendency and the tendency to value life for the sake of art—found
                     their most complete and perfect utterance in the poetry of Shelley and Keats, who
                     to the blind eyes of their own time, seemed to be as wanderers in the wilderness,
                     preachers of vague or unreal things” (259).

                  <p>For Walter Benjamin, the truth of history was not its chronology or causality but
                     precisely such a set of relays. His most compelling historical model was the stellar
                     constellation, images beheld with connections that are less causal than affective:
                     shared radiances, activated currencies, tokens bestowed. What registers as an <em>event</em> for Benjamin is not the historical occurrence, not the <em>what</em> that happened but the <em>image</em> [<em>bild</em>] projected from the past that may—or may not—be “caught” as it passes through the
                     “sky of history,” most notably when we are presented with shifting constellations
                     in the firmament at night. “The true image of the past flits by,” writes Benjamin
                     in the fifth thesis: “the past can be seized as an image that flashes up at the moment
                     of its recognizability, and is never seen again” (390).

                              like a refrain in his work, and not only as the “true” form of the past’s historicity.
                              See for instance the 1933 fragment “On the Mimetic Faculty”: “The mimetic element
                              in language can, like a flame, manifest itself only through a kind of bearer [Trager].
                              This bearer is the semiotic element. Thus, the nexus of meaning of words or sentences
                              is the bearer through which, like a flash, similarity appears. For its production
                              by man—like its perception by him—is in many cases, and particularly the most important,

                     </div> For Benjamin, the <em>truth</em> of history is its status as an image: fragile, transient, fugitive. The Benjaminian
                     historian is one who “ceases to tell the sequence of events like beads of a rosary”
                     and resists the poverty of historicism’s directive to “establish a causal nexus” among
                     consecutive events and its prescription to tell the past “as it really was” (397).
                     For Benjamin, the truth of history is not its sequential narrative but its composition
                     as images that coalesce in a constellation, connecting cultural phenomena that might
                     be separated by epochs. The task of the cultural historian, according to Benjamin,
                     is to seize those “flitting” images as they “flash” first by recognizing oneself <em>as seized by them</em> and then learning to behold the constellations these images form, often under disparate
                     historical conditions. This is how I hope to position myself in order to seize and
                     release—in other words, to <em>redeem</em>—the Bowie-image for the constellation we call Romanticism.

                     the text I regard as the “alpha star” of this constellation is not a song or performance
                     by Bowie. It is Haynes’s 1998 film which takes its title from a Bowie B-side. <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is an ambitious and delirious film about a fictitious episode in 1970s British glam
                     rock, a film in which Bowie is and is “not there”: never named as such. The singer
                     in his Ziggy days is conjured and “imaged” in the figure of Brian Slade, whose career
                     we follow from the end of the 60s through the glam and glitter period until the “staged”
                     assassination, which results in “the death of glitter,” a hoax which alludes to Bowie’s
                     own faked assassination of his Ziggy Stardust image at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1973.

                              In Oren Moverman’s interview that introduces the published screenplay, Haynes acknowledges

                     “glammiest” band on the west side of the Atlantic. For the Brian Slade songs of his
                     “Maxwell Demon” period, Haynes employed Grant Lee Buffalo and Shudder to Think, a
                     90s indie version of a rock “glam” band, to write several Ziggy-themed songs, which
                     are performed as highly stylized music videos.

                     the jewelry that made it a <em>scene</em> as visual as it was musical, as flamboyant and ironic as it was affectively rich and
                     jubilant. As Mary Ann Doane puts it, “in <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>, the complexity of feeling and intelligence is located in glam rock, music that is

                     </div> This “complexity of feeling and intelligence” extends to the many cinematic genres
                     and styles the film invokes “knowingly” and lovingly without ever quite adopting one
                     predominant mode: moments of fable, examples of music videos, B-movie sci-fi, Busby
                     Berkeley musicals, the <em>Citizen Kane</em> investigation, biopic, documentary, Fassbinder’s melodrama, jittery super-8s, even
                     his own experimental animated bio-film about the life and death of Karen Carpenter.
                     This cinematic kaleidoscope of visual and generic prisms makes it clear that <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is not a film <em>about</em> Bowie or even glam rock as much as it is a cinematic fable of a queer cultural history
                     and the political, sexual, and artistic possibilities opened by the “glittering” eruption
                     of a “glam” spirit and “the electric life”—the “vital tendencies”—of these astonishing
                     songs and performances, this momentary “spirit of the age” in London’s 1970s underground.
                     It is, as I argue elsewhere, “an allegory of cultural history in the vein of Benjamin,
                     Wilde, and Shelley,” which is to say a Romantic cultural history.

                              by the production of image that body forth life, then compromise any return to life
                              itself.” The topic of Romanticism and “life” (or Romantic “vitality”) has been a rich
                              and compelling site of research over the past ten to fifteen years. While my own interest
                              here is in aesthetic life and life’s aestheticization, I want to acknowledge some
                              of the signal studies on the topic that have most influenced my thinking. See Denise

                     </div> But, as Shelley himself asks in the famous prose fragment he composed on the back
                     of notebook in 1819, “What is life?”: this is a question that Shelley, characteristically,
                     doesn’t answer, but “leaves” as “a vacancy” (<em>SPP</em> 506, 507). We are better equipped by the poet to say what Shelleyan “life” is <em>not</em>: it’s not a personal possession or subjective quality; and its truth is not revealed
                     by religion or empiricism or historicism. It’s certainly more Shelleyan to ask what
                     the figure of life <em>does</em>; and one of the best examples of that is one I quoted above in passing: “electric
                     life.” In the final aspirational paragraph of <em>A Defense of Poetry</em>, when Shelley is assessing the “compositions of the most celebrated writers of the
                     present day,” he asserts that “it is impossible to read” them “without being startled
                     with the electric life which burns within their words” (<em>SPP</em> 535). Shelleyan life is <em>poetic</em>, measured by the force of its “electricity,” just as Wilde’s “vital tendency” is
                     the electric current that activates aesthetic expressions, and Benjamin’s “images”
                     flash through a darkness that receives them. Thus, for Shelley and for Wilde, as for
                     Benjamin and Haynes, “life” is delivered in images and measured by its “maximization” <em>and</em> its “compromise.” This describes <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>’s affective oscillation, its “alternating currents”: “<em>Although what you are about to see is a work of fiction</em>,” reads a line drawn across the bottom of the dark screen before the images appear,
                     “<em>it should be played at maximum volume</em>.”

               <p>This work of cinematic fiction orbits around two principal performers of the period,
                  Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), “images that body
                  forth” Bowie and Iggy Pop during their unlikely collaborations in the mid 1970s. In
                  Haynes’s depiction of this relationship, Slade, a long-haired “shirt-lifter from Birmingh’m,”
                  is struggling to make his queer torch-song cabaret act work in an afternoon slot at
                  an outdoor “hippie” rock festival in Southwest England. Dressed in a long purple frock,
                  Slade performs an acoustic version of Steve Harley’s folky “Sebastian” for “rock audiences
                  bred on Creedence Clearwater and the Beatles” who “were not entirely sure what to
                  make of this particular brand of revolt”: “Get the fuck off! Cut the shite! Bugger
                  off, you wooftah!” Following this dismissive reception by a meager but abusive and
                  homophobic audience, Slade angrily storms out of his tent at the moment the festival
                  announcer introduces Curt Wild: “all the way from New York City, lead singer and founder
                  of the greatest garage band known to mankind.” In the next shot, we behold Brian Slade,
                  his back to the camera, suddenly seized by a primal scream onstage, the opening of
                  Wild’s electrifying version of the Stooges’s “T.V. Eye.” Abruptly turning his face
                  to the stage, Slade is arrested by Wild’s eruptive snarling proto-punk vocalization
                  which comes out of the dark and from nowhere, a throaty guttural wail that could only
                  be apprehended as “music” in the context of the fringes of rock and roll.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In Haynes’s cinematic fable, this moment of ecstatic seizure is the unlikely origin
                     of glam rock. I call it unlikely, because “Maxwell Demon”—the “glam” persona Slade
                     fashions in the aftermath of this concert—bears no resemblance to Ewan McGregor’s
                     Curt Wild or his stage representation of that iconic Iggy Pop garage song, just as
                     there was certainly nothing ever “glammy” about Iggy or the Stooges. Wild’s version
                     of “T.V. Eye” has no evident visual or musical connection to anything glam or glitter,
                     other than the can of gold dust he sprinkles over his naked chest and then lewdly

                     a sort of pop music “elective affinity,” one which Haynes makes into an “electric”

                  with tracking shots over the rowdy audience and tight reaction shots of Slade: “<em>when Curt was fourteen, he was discovered by his mother in the family loo, at the
                     ‘service’ of his older brother and promptly shipped off for eighteenth months of electric
                     shock treatment</em>.” In a POV shot, the young Curt, strapped to a gurney and hooked up to electrodes,
                  sees his older brother give him a wink as a nurse bends over to initiate the treatment.
                  “<em>The doctors guaranteed the treatment would fry the fairy clean out of him</em>,” continues the narration, “<em>but all it did was make him bonkers every time he heard electric guitar</em>.” At this point, the film cuts back to flames erupting over the foot of the stage
                  as Wild, in the words of the screenplay, “shrieking defiantly,” dives over them into
                  the audience (<em>Velvet</em> 43). In the final shot of the scene, the camera again cuts to Slade in “rapt attention”
                  as he responds to the leap with a sudden involuntary smile that slowly dissolves into
                  a look of calculating envy.

                  <p>In Haynes’s cinematic version of a queer cultural history, beginnings are always fables,
                     legends, folklore; and when his film asks where images come from, it is never in the
                     service of a straight historicism. If “legend has it” that Wild’s queer excursions
                     with his older brother and the subsequent “electroshock” therapy are merely “legendary,”
                     the “electric current” that forms this piece of folklore seizes Brian Slade at the
                     moment it ignites the stage: the scene establishes the current that runs between the
                     two performers and inaugurates the unlikely beginnings of glam rock. The charge of
                     this beginning is all the more unusual given that the primitive three-chord electric
                     guitar featured in Iggy Pop’s band, the Stooges, and in Curt Wild’s simulacrum band
                     called the “Rats,” is not a feature of any of the musical instrumentations of glam
                     rock.

                     the “shadow” of beauty fall upon him: “I shrieked, and clasped my hands in extacy!”
                     (ll. 55–60). In Haynes’s version of this “conversion,” it is the “shriek”—certainly
                     one of the great inaugurating shrieks in rock history—that falls on Slade and seems,
                     as Francis Bacon might describe the affect, to “come off directly onto the nervous
                     system.”

                     is yoked into spectatorship and suddenly transformed, like a sea-change, into something
                     rich and strange, the feathered angels of David Bowie and Roxy Music.

                     or Arthur Stuart’s (Christian Bale) reaction when he hears Cecil utter the name “Curt
                     Wild.” Whether in the moment of beholding, or its recollection, the film addresses
                     the many forms of aesthetic address and “seizure” that reference the nature of aesthetic
                     identification and the more rarified version of it known as “fandom.”

               <p>In <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>, “glam rock” is not so much a clearly defined musical genre as it is, in the Shelleyan
                  sense, the momentary appearance of a queering spirit that, as Faflak puts it, “bodies
                  forth life” and erupts in its “maximized” form from London’s underground in the 1970’s
                  as a utopian possibility, a fleeting but thrilling moment of affective redemption.
                  When the film flashes forward in time, we find ourselves in “New York in 1984,” a
                  world in which this spirit has been dispatched or “compromised.” This New York is
                  a lifeless Reagan-era urbanscape in which the musical, cultural, and sexual excitement
                  and potentiality of the London’s glam moment has been drained of its color: a grey,
                  washed-out world of cultural regression and political repression. Arthur Stuart is
                  a journalist—“the resident Brit”—for a New York newspaper assigned to write a story
                  on the mysterious disappearance of Brian Slade ten years after. Stuart’s investigation—has
                  Slade re-surfaced as the surgically reconstructed right-wing arena-rock star “Tommy
                  Stone” who proclaims the most reactionary American values?—is really only a lure.
                  Whatever the “real story” of the assassination hoax—one derived from Bowie’s own onstage
                  “killing off” of Ziggy—Brian Slade and the spirit of the Bowie-image have “passed
                  away,” leaving “our state, / This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate” (“Hymn
                  to Intellectual Beauty” ll. 15–7). And though the film’s structural allusion to <em>Citizen Kane</em> is its central narrative conceit, Haynes shifts his principal focus to the “reporter”:
                  unlike <em>Kane’s</em> Jerry Thompson, Bale’s Arthur Stuart, the figure who beheld the glittering eruption
                  of glam rock and lives in the aftermath of its demise, is a prominent object of the
                  film’s narrative attentions. In the guise of journalistic research, Haynes zeroes
                  in on how Stuart’s relationship to a personal past that orbits around a painful adolescent
                  “coming out” that was bound up with the liberating and erotically charged images and
                  music of glam. Stuart revisits this era, one that he seems to have withheld from himself,
                  with a wistful but unspoken nostalgia for what might have been: the memories of his
                  own fandom, his own tortured relationship to his sexual orientation, and his own brush
                  with the stars.

                     takes his point of departure from Marcia Landy’s claim that <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is “predicated on the question ‘what happened?’ . . . and the film’s technique is
                     investigative” (126). This is the decisive question for Landy, whose crisp characterization
                     of the film’s generic instability concludes with a reassertion of this question: “The
                     film is neither an exposé of stardom, a homage to <em>Citizen Kane</em>, a conventional biopic, a diatribe against drugs, nor an ‘explanation’ of what went
                     wrong [with glam rock]; it is an exploration of ‘what happened’ in and to the politics
                     of the 1960s and early 1970s” (126). Amplifying Landy’s account of the Benjaminian
                     allusions to the “Theses on the Concept of History” in the film’s opening scene, Davis
                     argues that <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> does not simply resonate with “Benjamin’s sense of historical crisis, it serially
                     reprises the essay’s signature attitude of looking despondently backward, in tandem
                     with its famous epitome of the Angel of History” (214).

                     </div> For Haynes, the images of the Hollywood “silver screen” punctuate the film like icons
                     of a conjured age. Slade and Wild are treated by their manager as if they belonged
                     to “those vintage years”: “Tracy and Hepburn for the seventies.” Brando, Rooney, Garbo
                     are among the Hollywood stars name-dropped as if it were a Frank O’Hara poem. Early
                     in the film, Haynes has a BBC commentator describe the movement as “glamour, nostalgia,
                     and outrageousness.” And though as Slade’s wife Mandy says, “Brian believed in the
                     future,” we first see him performing Roxy Music’s “2HB” in Kensington’s Sombrero Club
                     in the early 70s. The song and its dedicatory title—“to Humphrey Bogart”—invoke and
                     enact the glamour of cinematic nostalgia, twice-over, by creating a song to a cinematic
                     scene which has long been a scene of nostalgia, one which reprises Hollywood’s most
                     iconic and clichéd utterance: “here’s looking at you, kid.” By deploying and by naming
                     nostalgia as something to be reclaimed, Haynes offers images of the cultural past
                     that are something other than our received ideas of “mere nostalgia”: his is a memory
                     of a past which never existed except in the present tense of the cinematic image,
                     its own sound and vision. When “2HB” appears again later in the film—at the concert
                     called “Death to Glitter”—it comes as a nostalgic good-bye to the genre and its stars,
                     including the departed Brian Slade, who appears as a projected image above the stage
                     and as a shadowy presence off stage. This version of the song is performed by Jack
                     Fairy, Haynes’s fictional “patron saint of the movement,” himself more an image than
                     a character. His performance at the tribute concert positions him as origin and as
                     end of this fleeting episode of cultural history, one which pivots around the figures
                     of nostalgia for this dead star: “Your memory stays / It lingers ever / Fade away
                     never.” Like every invocation of nostalgia in the film, its effects conjure Shelley’s
                     account in his “Hymn” of beauty’s departures from our world, “like hues and harmonies
                     of evening / Like clouds in starlight widely spread, — / Like memory of music fled”
                     (ll. 8–10). The Roxy Music song and Haynes’s cinematic version belongs to this series
                     of “likenesses” and its swirling preface an indication of its removal from our world:
                     “Oh I was moved by a screen dream!” “Your cigarette traces a ladder.”

               <p>How are we to assess this Romantic nostalgia that attends to Haynes’s representation
                  of glam rock, not only in this emblematic song by Roxy Music but in the presentations
                  of the Bowie-Image? To call it a “critical nostalgia” seems oxymoronic enough to drain
                  both terms of their meaning. To call it “ironic nostalgia” cancels its affective force.
                  How, then, do we characterize the form of Romantic nostalgia which “knows” that what
                  it remembers is only an image? What do we call a nostalgia that knows what it evokes
                  in memory was always only an image but that <em>feels</em> that <em>image</em> to be true? The <em>OED</em> defines nostalgia as “severe home-sickness”: a “form of melancholia caused by prolonged
                  absence from one’s home or country;” and it records the earliest uses of the word
                  nostalgia, not surprisingly, in the era we associate with Romanticism. However, when
                  it first appears in English in 1780, it is found not in poetry but in medical discourse:
                  nostalgia is a term coined by Dr. William Cullen for the malady that afflicted soldiers
                  during long military campaigns in foreign lands. In <em>A Complete Dictionary of Music,</em> Rousseau devoted an entry to the particular “<em>mal de Suisse</em>” or “homesickness” produced by the simple but often irregular melodies played and
                  sung by Alpine mountaineers. Rousseau claims one such melody “was forbidden to be
                  played . . . upon pain of death, because it made them burst into tears, desert, or,
                  die, whoever heard it; so great a desire did it excite in them of returning to their
                  country” (266–7).
               </p>
               <p>The status of nostalgia in Rousseau is the principal point of contention in what is
                  perhaps the most important—or at least the most celebrated—theoretical dispute between
                  the two figures most directly associated with deconstruction, Jacques Derrida and
                  Paul de Man. One of the principal objects of Derrida’s painstaking deconstruction
                  in <em>Of Grammatology</em> is Rousseau’s nostalgic “longing for presence” that manifests itself in the phonocentrism
                  of his theory of language. Rousseau’s accounts of the seductions of native songs might
                  appear to reinforce Derrida’s argument that the Swiss philosopher reinscribes the
                  metaphysical privileging of the voice over writing. Derrida’s “interpretation of Rousseau,”
                  famously prompted de Man to respond with “The Rhetoric of Blindness” which claims
                  that Rousseau is not in fact guilty of the nostalgia for presence that Derrida ascribes
                  to the Swiss philosopher. According to de Man, Rousseau’s theory of language doesn’t
                  <em>call for</em> Derrida’s deconstruction, because Rousseau has already performed the dismantling
                  of nostalgia for which Derrida takes credit. “The elegiac tone that is occasionally
                  sounded [in Rousseau] does not express a nostalgia for an original presence,” says
                  de Man, “but is a purely dramatic device, an effect made possible and dictated by
                  a fiction that deprives the nostalgia of all foundation” (133). If we believe that
                  this exchange set in motion two “tracks” of deconstruction—at least in the North American
                  context—then perhaps the exchange pivots on what Gayatri Spivak describes of other
                  such charges of “metaphysics” by sparring philosophers: “perhaps this entire argument
                  hangs on who <em>knew</em> how much of what he was doing” (<em>Grammatology</em> xxxvvviii). I’m less interested here in taking sides in this sparring match as I
                  am in suggesting how significant nostalgia is not only for the sounds and visions
                  of popular culture but for the most adventurous theoretical undertakings. In fact,
                  what de Man says of Rousseau’s nostalgia could be said verbatim about the images of
                  nostalgia in <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>: “The elegiac tone that is occasionally sounded [in Haynes] does not express a nostalgia
                  for an original presence, but is a purely dramatic device, an affect made possible
                  and dictated by a fiction that deprives the nostalgia of all foundation.” To this
                  we might add that for both Rousseau and Haynes, the “purely dramatic device” that
                  “knows” that it is a “fiction” does not “deprive the nostalgia” of all <em>affect</em>.
               </p>
               <p>Derrida’s <em>Of Grammatology</em> undertakes the deconstruction of any and all sources of nostalgia—speech, presence,
                  the origin, etc. Perhaps the underlying target of Derrida’s deconstructive project
                  is the metalepsis of nostalgia as an affect that <em>posits</em> origins and presences that it comes to believe in, after the fact. Early in her translator’s
                  preface, Spivak stresses precisely this affective dimension of Derrida’s turn from
                  the “Rousseauist” orientation of Levi-Strauss to Nietzsche: “Derrida contrasts Rousseau’s
                  melancholy with Nietzsche’s affirmative joy”; and she goes on to quote the passage
                  from “Structure, Sign, and Play” which declares and performs this turn and in the
                  process declares its break from structuralism: “Turned toward the presence, lost or
                  impossible, of the absent origin, [the] structuralist thematic of broken immediateness
                  is thus the sad, <em>negative</em>, nostalgic, guilty Rousseauistic aspect of the thought of play of which the Nietzschean
                  <em>affirmation</em> – the joyous affirmation of the play of the world, . . . The affirmation of a world
                  of signs without fault, without truth, without origin, offered to an active interpretation
                  – would be the other side” (<em>Grammatology</em> xiii). This “Nietzschean affirmation” is made possible by “the gigantic ebullience”
                  of “an <em>active</em> forgetfulness” that Derrida pursues in lieu of what he considers the nostalgia of
                  Rousseau’s melancholy metaphysics of a lost presence. It was Nietzsche, writes Spivak
                  emphatically, who “cracked apart” the metaphysics of presence “and then advocated
                  forgetting that fact! . . . It is difficult to imagine a solution to the problem [of
                  the metaphysical inheritance] that would go beyond Nietzsche’s, to know and then actively
                  to forget, convincingly to offer in his text his own misreading” (<em>Grammatology</em> xxviii). If it is “difficult to imagine a solution to the problem that would go beyond
                  Nietzsche’s,” what might it mean to have both: the “joyous affirmation of the play
                  of the world,” a “gigantic ebullience” <em>oscillating</em> with the melancholy nostalgia of perpetual loss, of the path of beauty’s departure
                  from the world? What happens if we are presented with a movie <em>about</em> this oscillation and its effects and affects, two opposing dispositions in the same
                  text, with their own full range of images and depletions?
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps the most surprising feature of the <em>OED</em>’s etymological record is how recently the meaning of nostalgia as a melancholic affliction
                  for one’s home expanded to a longing for a period or a person or an object. Once the
                  era of technological reproducibility commences, nostalgia’s domain extends further
                  still, to the affective experience evoked by an old photo or recorded song, indeed,
                  by any form of <em>visual</em> or <em>audio</em> image that conjures an emotional relationship to a remembered person or place or
                  period. Giorgio Agamben (who belongs to the constellation of philosophers reflecting
                  on the temporal, epistemological, and affective aspects of nostalgia) invokes a brief
                  note by Roland Barthes as his point of departure to the question that is posed by
                  Agamben’s essay and, I argue, by Haynes’s film: “What Is the Contemporary?” Barthes’s
                  declaration is, as Agamben notes, Nietzschean: “the contemporary is the untimely”
                  (Agamben 40). For Nietzsche, as Barthes and Agamben characterize his <em>Untimely Meditations</em>, “those who are truly contemporary” are not those who <em>reflect</em> or <em>express</em> their time: “those who are truly contemporary,” writes Agamben “are those who neither
                  perfectly coincide with [their time] nor adjust themselves to its demands. They are
                  thus in this sense irrelevant. But precisely because of this condition, precisely
                  through this disconnection and this anachronism, they are more capable than others
                  of perceiving and grasping their own time” (40). This “non-coincidence” is precisely
                  our film’s “condition.” <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is, on the one hand, acutely aware of time and dates and it marks them carefully:
                  1854, “100 years later,” New Year’s night 1969, 1972, 1984, and beyond. And yet the
                  film never feels as if it <em>belongs</em> to any of those moments; and the strongest historical affect the film generates is
                  its disconnection with a past which also appears as the “new,” as in the way that
                  Bowie in those early days looked and dressed more like Lauren Bacall than a rock and
                  roll star.
               </p>
               <p>“Naturally,” writes Agamben, “this noncoincidence, this ‘dys-chrony,’does not mean
                  that the contemporary is a person who lives in another time, a nostalgic who feels
                  more at home in the Athens of Pericles or in the Paris of Robespierre and the marquis
                  de Sade than in the city and time in which he lives” (41). “Naturally” is an odd qualifier
                  to describe this temporal “noncoincidence,” since nostalgia is often claimed to be
                  a “natural” and pre-critical impulse. But this is an index of the difficulty of prying
                  nostalgia loose from its “homesickness”; and ultimately Agamben is working to develop
                  an understanding of the contemporaneous as “<em>that relationship with time that adheres to it through a disjunction and an anachronism</em>” (41). This is Haynes’s “relationship with time” in <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>, a cinematic relationship that releases the images of history from their obligations
                  to reflect or express their moment and then relays those images to possibilities produced
                  by temporal disjunctions. These are Haynes’s own “untimely meditations,” achieved
                  through a new filmic practice of anachronism. <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> accomplishes this not only through the countless flashbacks and flashforwards in
                  this shuffled “flipbook” of narrative time loops, but also because its cinematic depictions
                  of the narrative present tense—extended scenes not prefaced or accompanied by recollecting
                  voice-over—often emit images of pasts and futures: there are visual and auditory references
                  to eras which have receded that are “shot through,” as Benjamin would say, with “now
                  time” [<em>Jetzeit</em>] and there are haunted images of a time to come, one the film will never “know.”
                  If “2HB,” which circulates like the movie’s refrain, is the paradigm for this nostalgic
                  allure of a past captured in the image of the departed film star, there’s another
                  image that addresses this temporal disjunction which lodges itself as a nostalgia
                  for that which has <em>yet to appear</em>. In the film’s late scenes, Haynes lingers over Curt Wild’s uncanny resemblance to
                  Kurt Cobain and deposits a future that the film “images” but does not narrate, a future
                  which resides in the spectator’s past and elicits what Robert Christgau called “an
                  aura of painful regret,” projecting a once future and now lost redemption, its “present”
                  doubly displaced. In the expanding universe of <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>, the emerald broach is passed beyond the narrative frame, generating relays the film
                  “images” without showing, images that bleed into the extra-fictional world of the
                  film, into our own collective image-world of memories and laments. I offer one such
                  memory that registers as a lament on so many levels: in one of the final performances
                  of Cobain’s life, for MTV’s “Nirvana Unplugged,” he covers “a David Bowie song”: “The
                  Man Who Sold the World.”

               <p>“In the firmament that we observe at night,” writes Agamben, “the stars shine brightly,
                  surrounded by a thick darkness.” Agamben is more interested here in the nature of
                  this “thick darkness” that makes the stars shine so brightly in the firmament than
                  he is in those celestial objects themselves. He takes his guide from astrophysics:
                  “In an expanding universe, the most remote galaxies move away from us at a speed so
                  great that their light is never able to reach us. What we perceive as the darkness
                  of the heavens is this light that, though traveling toward us, cannot reach us, since
                  the galaxies from which the light originates move away from us at a velocity greater
                  than the speed of light” (46). The celestial darkness teaches how the stars disappear
                  completely, in a vanishing that makes constellations possible to behold.

                  <p>Likewise, <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> opens not with our star, Brian Slade (“The Bowie-Image”), but with a disorienting
                     POV shot among the stars in the midst of a nighttime constellation with audio samples
                     of old muffled British radio recordings, overlapping transmissions beaming through
                     space from different epochs. Haynes’s published screenplay imagines the temporality
                     of this scene in more granular detail: “the sound of distant waves rises up. Sounds
                     emerge in succession: gunfire, explosions, rinky-tink piano, children at play, bar-room
                     singing, opera . . . each enveloping the other like the sound of time itself passing”
                     (<em>Velvet</em> 3). In the film’s final version, “the sound of time itself passing” is a muffled din
                     which gives way to the magisterial voice of Janet McTeer, our temporary narrator,
                     delivering what sounds like a lost fragment of a thesis from Benjamin’s final meditations
                     on history: “<em>Histories, like ancient ruins, are the fictions of empires. While everything forgotten
                        hangs in dark dreams of the past, ever threatening to return.</em>”

                  <p>From Haynes’s constellation of a nighttime of shooting stars and scattered sound transmissions
                     appears a flying saucer, like an image from B-movie stock, that suddenly swoops towards
                     Earth amid tufts of space clouds, depositing on a storybook Dublin doorstep in 1854
                     a baby swaddled in a blanket pinned with an emerald green broach. Whether bestowed
                     or abandoned, the baby who fell to earth is Oscar Wilde, our first “space oddity,”
                     cosmic nomad. We watch along with the Wildes and their housekeeper as the spaceship
                     suddenly returns to the stars; and the film then cuts to a scene—“100 years later”—featuring
                     a classroom of Irish schoolboys, nine to ten years old, who stand one by one in a
                     tight tracking shot declaring their aspirations before their prim schoolmaster: “I
                     want to be a barrister,” says one; “I want to be a farmer,” and so on, until the final
                     boy, labeled “O. Wilde” and wearing the green broach, rises and declares, “I want
                     to be a pop idol.” And as if to demonstrate how “Benjaminian” constellations are formed,
                     the subsequent scene is separated from Wilde’s arrival by “one hundred years.” The
                     film cuts to a scene of a young boy, Jack Fairy, who—after being beaten by a score
                     of bullying schoolmates—lays face down in the street, his lip bloodied, and discovers
                     in the dirt and grime the emerald broach that had earlier adorned Oscar Wilde. The
                     following scene looks as if it is a hand-drawn page in a children’s picture-book:

                        Jack Fairy knew better</em>.” The narration continues as the film cuts to a series of dark interior shots featuring
                     the head of young Jack Fairy bathed in blue light and poised in three different angles
                     before a mirror we never quite see. “<em>Until one mysterious day when Jack would discover that somewhere there were others
                        quite like him, singled out for a great gift</em>.” Jack Fairy meticulously draws the blood from his wound as if it were lipstick until
                     his eyes flash on his reflection, suddenly smiling directly at the mirror/camera/spectator
                     as the narrator concludes her overture: “<em>and one day the whole stinking world would be theirs</em>.”

                              to call it a redemption of the Lacanian scenario, or at least a redemption fantasy.

                     from this image as if it were <em>caused</em> by it: scores of giddy glitter kids pour across the Waterloo Bridge in 1972 and fill
                     the streets to the jubilant guitars in the opening strains of Brian Eno’s “Needle
                     in a Camel’s Eye” on their way to a Brian Slade concert. These twentieth-century boys
                     and girls appear like Shelley’s “glorious phantoms” who “burst” from the “graves”
                     of “England in 1819” to “illumine our tempestuous day” (13–4).

               </div>
               <p>Perhaps there is no better way to describe Jack Fairy’s virtual presence in the film
                  than as a “glorious phantom”: “singled out for a great gift,” Fairy remains a ghostly
                  if glamorous figure in the story. Haynes calls him the “patron saint” of the scene,
                  the “real thing which is not real,” the “origin” which is not the origin, “erupting
                  spontaneously” (<em>Velvet</em> xvii). Jack Fairy is less a <em>character</em> in the film than an ephemeral image, passing though London’s streets and clubs, the
                  glam <em>flâneur</em>. Fairy performs one song—a highly stylized version of Roxy Music’s “2HB”—in the “Death
                  to Glitter” concert, lip-synching vocals recorded by Thom Yorke. Jack Fairy is just
                  an image, one who conveys a transitory image of transit, the transfer of the emerald
                  broach from the stars to Oscar Wilde and Fairy and on to Curt Wild before it is deposited
                  with Arthur Stuart near the movie’s end. “The pin will keep moving through time,”
                  says Haynes, “and be passed on in many different ways” (<em>Velvet</em> xxviii). The broach is the “true image” in Haynes’s cinematic theses on history,
                  one that bestows “the gift of sound and vision” upon those who wait.
               </p>
               <p>In the Haynes universe of <em>Velvet Goldmine,</em> we encounter a distinctive cinematic account of the image, one that is not only concerned
                  with cinematic image-making but with the perpetual play of vanishing and appearance
                  that is the condition of the image as such. On the one hand, Haynes’s highly self-reflexive
                  filmmaking foregrounds its artifice and its image-making with an awareness shared
                  by the most adventurous or extravagant glam artists, David Bowie and Roxy Music. But
                  Todd Haynes’s <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> universe is also a historical one; and this self-consciousness of image-making relays
                  his film and his world to the images of Oscar Wilde and beyond. In so doing, the film
                  eliminates any sense of “mereness” from the image. Near the film’s end, Arthur approaches
                  Curt sitting alone in a bar. Arthur reveals himself as a journalist to Curt and ask
                  about his “old friend,” Brian Slade. Curt avoids the question by initiating a cryptic
                  dialogue in which the image itself—its movements, its effects, its affects—is at stake.
                  After reflecting, via Wilde, on glam rock’s cultural-political ambitions—<em>change the world! no, change ourselves! okay, but look at the world!—</em>Arthur notices the antique emerald pin on Curt’s leather jacket: 
               </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">

                     <div class="l">Curt: Possibly. It was Oscar Wilde’s. Or so I was told by the person who gave it to
                        me. This friend of mine who kinda . . . disappeared . . . some years back. I forget
                        where we were. On a trip. But he says to me, ‘Curt, a man’s life is his image.’

               <p> At this point Curt passes the pin on to Arthur: “here why don’t you hang to it? I’ve
                  had it too long anyway. Go ahead. For your image. . .” That last phrase—“for your
                  image”—could serve as the film’s dedication or, better, its <em>destination</em>. <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is a film which, via Wilde’s Romanticism, asks us to seek the image in its transit
                  and in its autonomy. What Curt calls “your image” is not the representation of “your”
                  personal identity nor is it the expression of “your” character. “Your image” is the
                  assertion of “your” non-identity, something extractable, fungible, and potentially
                  redeemable. <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> understands the agency and circulation of images as an ideal but historical space
                  in which an antique emerald pin and the Bowie-image circulate in a constellation that
                  posits a new model of cultural history: the “true image.”

                     of images of relays, from the starlit heavens and the relaying of the gift of Oscar
                     Wilde and his bejeweled aestheticism on to what Haynes calls its “designated ancestors,”
                     Jack Fairy, Brian Slade, Curt Wild, Kurt Cobain. In Haynes’s film, something happens
                     through and between them on a plane that does not really belong to the film’s story
                     but exists elsewhere, like a refrain in its images among the stars.

                     popular culture have “few relationships with each other,” at least those we would

               <h2><span class="head">“It was Oscar Wilde’s”</span></h2>
               <p>In Haynes’s version of the “star system” in which his “heavens operate,” the “interstellar
                  conversation” is initiated by Wilde. Haynes’s original dedication for his screenplay—“For
                  Oscar Wilde, posing as a sodomite”—quotes and corrects the spelling of the infamous
                  visiting card left for Wilde by the Marquess of Queensberry, “posing as a somdomite,”
                  thereby redeeming the affront by the father of Wilde’s lover, turning it into a celebration.
                  If for Haynes, Jack Fairy is the film’s version of the “lost originator of the whole
                  glam thing,” Wilde is its “perfect manifestation”: <span class="quote">‘It quickly became clear to me that glam came out of the English tradition of camp
                     and applied counter-philosophies about art and culture, which I saw originating from
                     Oscar Wilde. To me Wilde became the perfect manifestation of the glam era. . . . I
                     think glam rock was the first overt alignment of the notion of the alien with the
                     notion of the homosexual—both of which became this fantastical, galvanizing potential
                     for musical expression, a potential freedom for kids trapped in their dreary lives.
                     The space ship definitely brings in the outsider elements of the period, which I attribute
                     to Wilde and dandyism, but it also refers to feelings of ‘otherness’ confronted at
                     the time of adolescence. (<em>Velvet</em> xii–xiii)’</span> <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is an “alignment” of the Wildean “tradition of camp and applied-counter-philosophies
                  about art and culture” with Benjamin’s impulse to “brush” cultural history “against
                  the grain” in order to tap into what Haynes calls the “galvanizing potential” of “‘otherness’
                  and its “potential freedom.” “It is about pop culture transforming us momentarily,”
                  as Haynes describes it, and becoming in the process an agent of redemption. In so
                  doing, Haynes not only participates in the ongoing redemption of Wilde; he reads Wilde’s
                  work and his image as <em>agent</em> of this redemptive potentiality. If Wilde’s epigrammatic poetics is made to be deployed
                  and its effectivity measured in the delivery of its utterances, I know of no artwork
                  which activates the critical potential and the historical implications of a Wildean
                  poetics more effectively than <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>. Wilde’s extracted words, epigrams, and dialogues, punctuate the film to such an
                  extent that we can say of the movie what Curt says of the emerald broach: “It was
                  Oscar Wilde’s.”
               </p>
               <p>One of the most remarkable features of Wilde’s epigrams is their ability to resist
                  context and avail themselves for extraction. This “extractability” extends to every
                  feature of his work: the epigram is his <em>poesi</em>s, one that Haynes mines from Wilde’s texts and deposits in the mouths of his own
                  characters. Mandy Slade (Toni Collette in the Angie Bowie role): “Beauty reveals everything
                  because it expresses nothing” (“The Critic as Artist”); Brian Slade: “Man is less
                  himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask and he’ll tell you the truth”
                  (“The Happy Prince”); Freddi in the press soiree: “The first duty in life is to assume
                  a pose. What the second duty is no one yet has found out” (“The Critic as Artist”),”
                  etcetera. Though they are spoken as if they were personal declarations of the characters,
                  their delivery marks them as epigrammatic, bookish, and gnomic extractions which address
                  the film’s ethos of artifice and mirrors, in turn the ethos of artifice in the glam
                  and glitter movement. In his final exchange with Arthur, Curt delivers famous lines
                  from <em>Dorian Gray</em> (1890)—“a real artist creates beautiful things and puts nothing of his life into
                  them”—as if they were spontaneously uttered as his deepest convictions, but they register
                  to the viewer as something quoted. Often, as in the lavish mock “press conference,”
                  staged with what Haynes calls “a touch of Louis XIV,” Haynes presents Wilde’s epigrams
                  as “quoted texts,” including one extraordinary passage, presented by a reporter “reading
                  from a large placard” with a “theatrical” delivery, from an article written about
                  Wilde in 1895 for the <em>Daily Star</em>: “The Aesthete Gives Characteristically / cynical Evidence, Replete with Pointed
                  / Epigram and Startling Paradox, while / Explaining his Views on Morality in Art.”
               </p>
               <p>One of the most exquisite moments in the film is a scene which concludes the “press
                  conference,” a long kiss between Slade and Wild (which reproduces the notorious publicity
                  kiss between Bowie and Lou Reed). In a tight closeup, Curt says to Brian: “The world
                  is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite
                  history.” Haynes lifts these two sentences from <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> where they are reported as lines written in a letter late in the novel to Dorian
                  by one of his former lovers. The words he calls “idolatrous” overtake his memory;
                  at this point in the novel, Dorian can no longer hear what the words say: they simply
                  reiterate the madness of his situation and his impulses. But Haynes hears something
                  else, something Wilde must have heard when he wrote these words: the intersection
                  of history with a sculpted and gilded beauty, the possibility and even necessity that
                  aesthetics intervenes historically, and a queer desire might “rewrite history.” What
                  Haynes extracts from Wilde’s aestheticism is not solely the camp theatricality and
                  arch performativity that runs from the queer pose of the dandy aesthete to Bowie’s
                  glam pop supernova, but the historical stakes of this constellation and its “vital
                  tendencies,” which are themselves both extractable and redeemable, in part, as Mandy
                  tells Brian, by “strange people” “chosen through their art.” Or as Bowie would sing
                  after his glam days were gone, as “the man who fell to earth,” “waiting for the gift
                  of sound and vision.”
               </p>
               <p>By way of Benjamin, Haynes also understands that it is the image that connects Wilde
                  to Bowie and that it is the “image” that makes this constellation of philosopher,
                  playwright, singer-performer, and filmmaker an <em>historical</em> one. It’s also what makes this constellation Romantic, at least in the Shelleyan
                  sense of poetry, not “in the more restricted sense” as verse but more expansively
                  as the authors of “music, of the dance and architecture and statuary and painting”
                  (<em>SPP</em> 512). Like Wilde and Benjamin, I believe that we can assert that Haynes’s cinematic
                  vision shares with Shelley the aesthetic investment that poetry has the capacity:
                  <span class="quote">‘to defeat the curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of surrounding
                     impressions. And whether it spreads its own figured curtain or withdraws life’s dark
                     veil from before the scene of things, it equally creates for us a being within our
                     being. It makes us the inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is a chaos.
                     . . . [I]t purges from our inward sight the film of familiarity which obscures from
                     us the wonder of our being. It compels us to feel that which we perceive, and to imagine
                     that which we know. It creates anew the universe after it has been blunted by reiteration.
                     (<em>SPP</em> 533)’</span> This is arguably the most epistemologically ambitious and philosophically acute catalogue
                  of poetic promises that Romanticism has to offer; and each item would be at home in
                  quotable fashion in most any text by Wilde. Each of these promises is plugged into
                  the Bowie-Image, especially when it resists the prosaic “curse which binds us to the
                  accident of surrounding impressions” and looks instead to the stars to “create anew
                  the universe.” In the closing scenes, when Arthur and Curt are making love, Arthur’s
                  voice-over is from ten years later: “looking back,” he says, Curt “patched through
                  my walls and entered my life . . . in waves.” A few scenes later, we return to this
                  little episode, shot in super-8 with voice-over. Arthur says, “He called it a freedom.”
                  “A freedom you can allow yourself. Or not.” The “vital tendency” that I’ve been tracing
                  from Shelley through Wilde and Benjamin to Bowie and Haynes is both redemptive and
                  liberatory: in one form or another each calls it “a freedom.” It’s not a <em>promise</em> of the image’s redemption but a shared and urgent investment in the precious and
                  fragile possibility of that redemption, one that is simultaneously aesthetic and historical.
                  “It compels us to feel what we know”: It compels us to feel that the image, that most
                  transitory and fugitive non-being, will not only be what Bowie calls “the gift of
                  sound and vision” but what Benjamin calls the “secret index of history.”
               </p>
               <p>“<em>Or not</em>.” The catalogue of redemptive promises—for Shelley, for Wilde, for Benjamin—remains
                  only possibilities, for which the missed or failed redemption might well be the rule
                  and not the exception. Nothing in Shelley, Wilde, Benjamin, Haynes, Bowie guarantees
                  the fulfilment of the promised redemption—the liberation of the image and the image
                  as liberation—and perhaps “the vital tendency” offered from Romanticism to our “now-time”
                  or to another futurity will never find its recipient, its “great gift” squandered
                  and lost, merely “floating in a tin can.” Perhaps we invest—with a critical urgency
                  that slides into uncritical desperation—in “constellations of contemporary romanticism,”
                  “Keats and popular culture,” or “Bowie and Romanticism” in order to convince ourselves
                  that Romanticism’s redemptive value has not passed us by—eager as we may have been
                  to receive it and make good on it—when in fact we may only be what Jacques Khalip
                  calls the “misfit,” the “blip,” the “has-been” (<em>Last Things</em> xi). Perhaps when we make our investments in Romanticism’s potentiality, we are more
                  likely to be left with what Shelley calls the “path of its departure.” I want to recall
                  the inaugural declaration of <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>, the one that accompanies the image of Jack Fairy’s triumphant smile, the one that
                  sets the film’s story in motion: “one day the whole stinking world would be theirs!”
                  In the instant that the young queer Jack Fairy flashes his glammy smile and Brian
                  Eno’s song erupts, we <em>feel</em> a jubilation that we can certainly take for redemption, even when we <em>know</em> that the “whole stinking world” remains just that and the beautiful “curve of the
                  lips” doesn’t determine history but remains merely its “blips” or “might-have-beens;”
                  and Shelley’s promised reconciliation between feeling and knowing is never realized.
                  We know that Wilde’s Shelleyan promises of aesthetic redemption in his early lectures
                  on the “English Renaissance in Art”—“Love art for its own sake, and then all things
                  that you need shall be added to you”—turn into the painful realizations of the prison
                  poetry of <em>De Profundis</em>. At the end of his letter to Bosie in “carcere et vinculis,” Wilde acknowledges that
                  “society, as we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to offer.”
               </p>
               <p>But what does <em>redemption</em> mean for Benjamin or Haynes, or for Wilde or Shelley, given that none of them believes
                  that it is a “deliverance from sin and its consequences through Christ’s atonement”
                  (<em>OED</em>)? Though Benjamin uses the theologically charged <em>Erlösung</em> for his notion of historical redemption, Werner Hamacher makes a compelling case
                  that Benjaminian redemption is derived not from “a straight-forwardly Judeo-Christian
                  theology” but is closer to <em>Einlösung</em>, the more prosaic redemption of deposits or vouchers; and if it “points towards a
                  theology,” it’s the “theology of the missed or distorted – hunchbacked – possibilities”
                  (40). “Lower-case redemption” we might call it. The <em>OED</em> offers us the English-language gift of such a definition: if redemption means “deliverance
                  from sin,” it can also mean the “action of freeing a prisoner, captive, or slave by
                  payment or ransom.” This is the mode of redemption on which Wilde reflects “in Her
                  Majesty’s Prison, Reading”: “Religion does not help me,” he writes to Bosie, “when
                  I think about Religion at all, I feel as if I would like to found an order for those
                  who cannot believe: the Confraternity of Fatherless one might call it, where on an
                  altar, on which no taper burned, a priest in whose heart peace had no dwelling, might
                  celebrate with unblessed bread and a chalice empty of wine” (<em>De Profundis</em> 1019). Wilde’s “order,” the “Confraternity of the Fatherless,” seeks redemption not
                  in atonement but in the release from captivity, what Curt Wild also “called a freedom.
                  A freedom you can allow yourself. Or not.” This redemption is not the deliverance
                  of the sinner, but the <em>release</em> of the captive—the misfit, the queer, the alien—from the Judeo-Christian narrative.
                  The model for this mode of redemption—a redemption from Redemption—is located in the
                  notion of the image we’ve traced through this constellation of artists and poets and
                  philosophers, an image which like <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>’s emerald broach, <em>seizes and releases</em>. If it offers an image of freedom, it’s because the freedom belongs to the image
                  itself, its agency and its currency. Benjamin called it “the true image,” the one
                  that escapes the chronologies of history and “flashes up,” but only at the moment
                  of <em>its</em> “recognizability.” I can think of no better name for this image than “the gift of
                  sound and vision,” though the most that those of us in the “Confraternity of the Fatherless”
                  can count on is the “waiting.” But that itself is gift enough, since we all know what
                  we feel: this refrain is the best part of that song.

               In Oren Moverman’s interview that introduces the published screenplay, Haynes acknowledges

               Here I would qualify what is otherwise her laser-like account of the “complexity of
               feeling and intelligence” in the music: while glam rock is saturated with irony, the
               best of it is never <em>musically</em> “cynical.” In a contemporaneous <em>City Pages</em> interview, Haynes delivers the most precise account of the emotional tone of the
               best of the glam records, especially the early adventurous work of Roxy Music: “the
               early Roxy Music records that Eno was a part of, and the few that followed, sum up
               the most interesting dualities between this highly referenced, tongue-in-cheek kind
               of musical presentation and, <em>somehow</em>, this incredibly emotional quality at the same time. That combination still baffles
               me, and it’s something that I tried with all my gumption to bring to the film itself.”

               phrase often enough that it becomes a refrain for his project, one which he describes
               as “a kind of tightrope walk between what is called figurative painting and abstraction.
               It will go right out from abstraction but will really have nothing to do with it.
               It’s an attempt to bring the figurative thing up onto the nervous system more violently
               and more poignantly” (12). Later in this same interview he will describe the relationship
               between narrative and the image with the same refrain: “it’s a very, very close and
               difficult thing to know why some paint comes across directly onto the nervous system
               and other paint tells you the story in a long diatribe through the brain” (18). The
               “Bacon-Universe,” his images as well as his words, form a crucial “node” in Deleuze’s
