            <p>This introduction lays out the predicates of <em>David Bowie and the Legacies of Romanticism</em>, exploring the diversity of Romantic inheritances and considering the ways in which
               David Bowie can be seen as engaging with them. It argues that while the Romantic period’s
               influence is less obvious than that of some other literary epochs, this is in large
               part because Romantic innovations changed so fundamentally the ways in which culture
               conceives of art and identity. Considering how Bowie engages with these changes allows
               us to see how Romanticism survives in a range of dynamic shaping forces, empowering
               later artists through providing both flexible tools to repurpose and overarching systems
               to reconfigure and oppose.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Introduction: David Bowie and Romanticism’s Wild Mutations</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>“Poetry makes nothing happen,” W.H. Auden contends in his elegy “In Memory of W.B.
               Yeats.” However, he goes on to write that nevertheless “it survives, / A way of happening,
               a mouth” (246). This collection is concerned with the ways in which the clusters of
               ideas awkwardly bundled together under the heading of Romanticism survive as ways
               of happening in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, albeit in forms necessarily
               “modified in the guts of the living” (245). Our prisms for examining the ongoing currency
               of Romantic conceptions are the works, performances, and legacies of David Bowie.
               We argue that many of Bowie’s manifestations engage in meaningful creative and critical
               conversations with assumptions that originally crystallized in Romantic-period discourses
               and forms. Specifically, the five essays that follow explore ideas relating to space,
               childhood, identity, artistry, and the image of freedom: all key Romantic concerns
               that continue to resonate in Bowie and his works. In discussing how Bowie’s music,
               personae, and cultural presences engage with late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century
               thoughts and artworlds, this volume traces a variety of different forms of remediation,
               including reflection, diffusion, resistance, amplification, and transfiguration. Bowie
               is far from being straightforwardly a Romantic artist, but the very complexities of
               his relationships with Romanticism make him a more revealing lens through which to
               explore the pervasiveness, richness, and predicaments of our Romantic inheritances.
               As Auden does for poetry, we wish to reject a straightforwardly functional vision
               of Romanticism as a form of action in the present in favour of seeing it as a series
               of modalities that inventive interpreters like Bowie have been able to extend, nuance,
               transform, and—in some circumstances—shuck off. </p>
            <p>This collection, like many good things, owes its existence to connections sparked
               by conference conviviality. Its roots lie in after-dinner discussions between Joanna
               E. Taylor, Beatrice Turner, and myself at the 2015 British Association for Romantic
               Studies (BARS) Conference in Cardiff. The idea of juxtaposing Bowie and Romanticism
               (two great tastes that we hoped would taste great together) swiftly created a compelling
               play of possibilities, and the notion of working these up continued to nag at us long
               after we departed from Wales. Bowie’s subsequent passing—one of the first of 2016’s
               numerous great losses—intensified our desire to see what we could do by examining
               Bowie through the prism of Romanticism and vice versa. On the helpful recommendation
               of Michael Gamer, we asked Emily Bernhard-Jackson—who was already completing new work
               on Bowie and Byron—to join us, and the four of us presented our ideas as a panel at
               the 2017 BARS Conference in York. We were gratified both by the number of people who
               showed up at a relatively early hour on the Sunday morning after the banquet and by
               the enthusiasm expressed in questions and responses. This made us keen to develop
               our thoughts for publication to extend the stimulating conversations we had begun.
               When we submitted a proposal to the Praxis series, Orrin Wang kindly mentioned that
               Forest Pyle had recently been thinking about Bowie in relation to his current projects
               on contemporary Romanticisms. When we subsequently approached him, it swiftly became
               apparent that his perspective would bring something new and distinctive beyond what
               we’d gathered in the original panel, so we were delighted when he agreed to contribute
               a concluding essay to this collection. The completion of this volume is thus a tribute
               to Romantic Studies’ openness and cordiality. We’d like to offer heartfelt thanks
               to all those who’ve listened to, supported, and provided feedback on this research
               as it has developed. </p>
            <p>The framing of this collection begs two related questions: why place such emphasis
               on Romantic legacies, and why use David Bowie to explore these? To begin with the
               first question: we are aware that from certain perspectives, exploring Romantic resonances
               in David Bowie might seem to be a rather tangential—or even quixotic—endeavour. For
               the past three decades, mainstream scholarship in Romantic Studies has been strongly
               invested in recovering historical circumstances, vesting value claims for works in
               their conditions of possibility at the times of their creations. This has led many
               scholars to implicitly favour a stance Tom Mole has called “punctual historicism,”
               which he defines as a tendency to “think the most important context for understanding
               literature is the context of its composition or its first publication” (21). This
               impulse has been the spur for a huge body of significant critical and editorial work
               that has helped immeasurably in getting us to a position where we can more adequately
               claim that we might “read a text like its first readers” (23). However, such scholarship,
               while immensely valuable, should not constitute the whole literary-critical picture.
               The ways that texts happened in the past are hugely important, but texts and the idea
               clusters they spawn are also fascinating for the complex ways that they continue to
               happen in our lives, institutions, minds, and seminar rooms. Clearly, part of our
               role as Romanticists is to try to remember, imagine, and explain how the Romantic
               period was for those who lived through it, but it is also important to be explicit
               that its works and the new affordances of thought and feeling they developed continue
               to live on in our understandings, apprehensions, and misapprehensions. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In recent years, a growing body of work has made significant progress in investigating
                  how Romantic-period artforms and ideologies have played out in the works of successor
                  artists. Interestingly, much of this research has been issued in the form of essay
                  collections; this perhaps indicates a consensus that complex questions regarding legacies
                  are best addressed through providing a series of complementary perspectives, rather
                  than seeking to be singular and definitive.

                           Twentieth Century (2012) have insightfully discussed how a succession of principally
                           canonical poets and novelists have responded to Romantic provocations, providing opportunities
                           to “revisit those Romantic echoes which with ‘keener sounds’ reverberate” (Radford
                           and Sandy 1). In Legacies of Romanticism (2012), Carmen Casaliggi, Paul March-Russell

                  </div> While many essay volumes have dealt principally with high cultural resonances, a number
                  have also explored connections with contemporary popular culture, often with an eye
                  to demystifying Romanticism in the seminar room.

                           artful anachronism has been published on Romantic Circles. We are very glad that our
                           collection will join Laura Mandell and Michael Eberle-Sinatra’s 2002 Praxis volume,Romanticism

                  </div> Such work brings home both the intellectual potential of revivifying Romanticism through
                  analogy and the very real necessity of thinking about how versions and variants of
                  Romanticism might matter now when constructing our syllabi and explaining our passions.</p>
            </div>
            <p>However, while such collections provide both excellent sources and helpful methodological
               toolkits for investigating the longer-term influence of Romantic-period writing—especially
               poetry—there is as yet no strongly established equivalent in Romantic Studies to the
               burgeoning interest in Neo-Victorianism in Victorian Studies. This, I would contend,
               is in large part due to the prevailing nature of Romantic influence. As Ann Heilmann
               and Mark Llewellyn put it, in many respects “‘the Victorian’ has become a homogenized
               identity—even a signifier—in contemporary culture” (2). Neo-Victorianism is largely
               predicated on its subject period being defined (or fossilized) in a series of familiar
               stereotypes. Heilmann and Llewellyn argue that Neo-Victorian texts engage a “self-analytic
               drive” and constitute “fictional re-encounters,” playing off the solidity of the period’s
               cultural presence by subjecting it to parody, remediation, and revaluation (5; 8).
               In doing so, Neo-Victorian works assert—always implicitly, and often very explicitly—that
               we are no longer Victorian: the period is over, done with, and transcended. </p>
            <p>By contrast, the Romantic-period influence on contemporary culture is more nebulous
               but in many ways stronger and more pervasive. In <em>Keywords</em> (1976), Raymond Williams observed that “literature was specialized towards <em>imaginative writing</em> within the basic assumptions of Romanticism” (186). Ideals developed and institutionalized
               in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries remain right at the heart of
               modern disciplines and the social assumptions that empower and constrain them. When
               we talk about art and culture, we use a language that has been fundamentally shaped
               by Romantic assumptions. Despite the efforts of critics like Jerome McGann and Clifford
               Siskin, it remains far harder to get outside Romanticism than it is to get outside
               Victorianism. While the latter is associated most strongly with aesthetics and ideologies
               that can be defined as no longer being our own, the former lingers at the heart of
               many of our most cherished cultural assumptions.</p>
            <p>This is not an unproblematic situation. While Romantic ideologies comprise a powerfully
               suggestive set of modalities for being and for being in the world, it would be deeply
               worrying if the recorded thoughts and feelings of two hundred years ago mapped exactly
               on to our modern ethics and (pre)conceptions. When considered alongside Romanticism’s
               considerable, and potentially disabling, authority as a discourse, such dissonances
               have served to create an influential strand of paranoid criticism that sees the art
               of the Romantic period as exerting an insidious and powerfully negative influence.
               As Simon Swift has convincingly argued, “the fear of being enchanted by Romantic illusions,
               as well as the self-defensive critical mechanisms that aim to guard against it, [are]
               themselves Romantic legacies” (246). Swift’s view of Romanticism has interesting consonances
               with Harold Bloom’s view of influence. We might well trace a version of Bloomian anxiety
               in Alain Baidou’s pronouncements about the “question which weighs upon and threatens
               to exhaust us: can we be delivered, <em>finally</em> delivered, from our subjugation to Romanticism?” (24).</p>
            <p>It is difficult, then, to see how a discourse closely resembling Neo-Victorianism
               can arise while Romanticism is still very much with us. However, the currency of Romanticism
               might well serve to create a space for a different kind of legacy studies that could
               also address some of the objections of those like Baidou who see Romanticism as an
               all-encompassing malign influence. I would contend that while Baidou is right to see
               Romanticism as remaining powerfully operative, the Romanticism that operates now is
               not the same as that which operated in the early nineteenth century, or indeed in
               the early twentieth century. Romanticism was always a retrospective imposition, and
               the very complexities that make defining it so difficult also provide space for artists
               and critics to shift and change it, moving its centres of gravity and collectively
               working to challenge its previous assumptions. Like Walt Whitman, Romanticism can
               internalize contradictions without collapsing; it is large and can “contain multitudes”
               (24). If we accept this, we might conceptualize ourselves not as subjugated victims
               begging for delivery from a unitary Romanticism, but rather as stakeholders who possess
               Romanticism as a cultural legacy and who can remake it in our own images, censuring
               and jettisoning qualities and discourses that we find objectionable while drawing
               on its communicative powers to connect us with our pasts and our contemporaries in
               old and new forms of mutual understanding. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This brings us to the second question: why Bowie? He is far from the most obviously
                  Romantic of artists, but this makes him peculiarly suitable for addressing both the
                  ubiquity of Romantic forms and the manners in which these must variously be negotiated,
                  resisted, and reconfigured. Previous scholars examining Romantic legacies in popular
                  music have often drawn direct connections between poets and pop stars, looking at
                  how the latter evoke and make use of the former. 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> However, Bowie offers an excellent test case for considering a more conflicted model
                  of Romantic inheritance. He is a good presence to think with because of the ways he
                  clashes with Romantic conceptions as well as the manners in which he resonates with
                  them. The essays in this volume differ markedly and—we hope—productively in how they
                  conceptualize this combination of harmony and dissonance. At the beginning of his
                  contribution, Forest Pyle writes that “On the surface, David Bowie is one of the least
                  likely matches that I can imagine for a pairing of pop culture with Romanticism.”
                  Bearing in mind the ease with which our initial conversations about Bowie and Romanticism
                  flowed in Cardiff, I was initially quite surprised when I read this, but it makes
                  complete sense as a position. Bowie’s work is not particularly concerned with the
                  natural world and expresses distrust regarding many kinds of visionary experience.
                  It often takes pleasure in the kinds of artifice with which devotees of Romanticism’s
                  cult of authenticity are distinctly uncomfortable. Regardless of the real nature of
                  William Wordsworth’s interactions with Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals or his poetical
                  predecessors, the ideal of the Wordsworthian poet does not chime neatly with the principles
                  behind cut-ups, pin-ups, or oblique strategies. In these respects, Bowie is deeply
                  un-Romantic, although his being so within a paradigm in which Romanticism still holds
                  considerable sway itself provides a telling commentary on the rarefication and remediation
                  of Romantic-period inheritances.</p>
            </div>
            <p>However, for me, Bowie has always seemed of a kind with Romantic artists in his pursuit
               of iconicity. Like them, he is a figure who sought to be at the center of debates
               within and about his time, attempting self-consciously to provide a means for audiences
               and commentators to position their thoughts, feelings, and selves. If Romanticism
               carved out a space in which artists can stand as recognized yet peculiar representatives
               of their age, then Bowie is a true heir both in his grapplings with the zeitgeist
               and in his insistence on maintaining his individual idiosyncrasies even as he appeals
               for general applause. In “A Defence of Poetry,” Shelley writes that “Poets are the
               hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which
               futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they understand not;
               the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which
               is moved not, but moves” (535). This description of the artist as a sensitive but
               far-from-omniscient barometer seems to me accurately to describe Bowie, whose influence
               seems profounder, more widespread, and less expected than that of other rock stars
               of his age. The main word in Shelley’s statement we would need to amend in Bowie’s
               case is “unapprehended.” In the seventies in particular, Bowie sought successfully
               to make both his influences and his staged selves garishly visible, blazing across
               the mediascape both as a roguish assemblage of half-familiar elements and as something
               audiences responded to as being radically new. The Bowies of the seventies grab the
               lion’s share of the attention in this collection, probably because this was the period
               of his career in which the steps he danced were most obviously in the Romantic line.
               Before the off-kilter embrace of more conventional forms in the eighties, the avant-gardisms
               of the nineties, and the rueful, experimental referentiality of his twenty-first-century
               material, seventies Bowies teetered confidently between outsider and archetype, brashly
               asserting that art was sexy and scuzzy and fake and cerebral, but, above all, that
               it had the potential to be achingly, Romantically meaningful. </p>
            <p>However, this is not to imply that smaller-scale connections cannot be drawn between
               Bowie and the discourses and affordances incubated in Romantic works. It seems to
               me that there’s more than a hint of Byron’s Manfred in the return of the Thin White
               Duke “throwing darts in lovers’ eyes” (Bowie, “Station to Station”). Perhaps there’s
               also an echo of the lamp that must be replenished but which will still never burn
               long enough (<em>Manfred</em> 1.1.1–2) in the solitary candle burning in the Villa of Ormen (Bowie, “Blackstar”).
               This echo might easily be multiplied by working through the incantatory self-assertions
               and self-fashionings that follow in each case. The eyes of the addressee “at the centre
               of it all” in “Blackstar” would for Manfred be Astarte’s eyes, around which everything
               else revolves. The contiguousness of Astarte’s eyes with Manfred’s own—“like to mine”
               (2.2.107)—resonates with the doublings and collapsings in Bowie’s lyric. Manfred defines
               himself against and within nature in his speeches on the Jungfrau and to the Witch
               of the Alps, joying in following “through the night the moving moon / The stars and
               their development” (2.2.70–1) while feeling “degraded back” and “all clay again” (2.2.78–9)
               when human frames intrude. Similarly, although perhaps more playfully, the voice that
               cries out in “Blackstar” desires “eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes” and
               denies the social roles of film star, pop star, porn star, and gangster while self-consciously
               assuming a more sublime stellar identity. These affinities chime with those expressed
               by Manfred when he praises the sun as “representative of the Unknown” (3.2.15) or
               claims that in “starry shade / Of dim and solitary loveliness, / I learn’d the language
               of another world” (3.4.5–7). Bowie’s version of this declaration is perhaps more in
               line with the performative ironies of the later Byron than with Manfred’s solipsistic
               grieving, but glimpses of the mode linger.</p>
            <p>In a similar vein, we might read the experimental fragments and oblique scraps of
               Berlin Trilogy Bowie as an interesting counterpoint to Coleridge’s proliferating notebook
               projections: certainties that never fully resolve, floating in anxieties and reversionings.
               There’s a touch of Shelley’s half-chastened but still-burning utopianism in songs
               like “Starman,” “Memory of a Free Festival,” and “The Bewlay Brothers,” and a flicker
               of a maximalist “England in 1819” in “Young Americans.” In imagining the descent of
               an ambivalent—yet sublime and infinitely compelling—cosmic force into a world with
               “five years left to cry in,” <em>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</em> could be read as projecting an Orc for the 1970s rather than the 1790s: a Blakean
               creation who both streams back into myth and steps out into the quotidian world as
               a flawed avatar of the times.</p>
            <p>I could go on for a considerable time, expanding on this list to address the questions
               that it begs. Why focus on the old-school visionary company? Does Bowie resonate with
               Anna Laetitia Barbauld, or Felicia Hemans (a similarly generous acknowledger of connections),
               or (perhaps most plausibly) with Letitia Landon, another artist who felt that she’d
               come late to the party and needed to negotiate a newly-establishing tradition while
               making her own voice? Might Bowie be, in certain moods and modes, like Jane Austen,
               or Sydney Owenson, or Walter Scott? Did the suburban kid from unfashionable Bromley
               fashion himself in ways that chime with Ayrshire’s “heaven-taught plowman,” or with
               the Helpston man who began by reflecting on the natural world and who ended up echoing
               everything? However, to continue would take this piece considerably beyond the compass
               of an introduction, and would intrude on the work of the essays that follow, which
               combine considerations of the legacies of the Big Six with larger and more diverse
               constellations of influence. We have by no means covered everything, and we sincerely
               hope that this collection will inspire other scholars to explore further Romantic
               resonances in Bowie and in others. Now, though, it is time to proceed to the starts
               we have made. Having sketched out models of Romantic inheritance and indicated how
               Bowie might be used to investigate these, all that remains is briefly to trail the
               individual contributions before shutting up gracefully and letting them speak for
               themselves. </p>
            <p>In the opening essay, Joanna E. Taylor considers the strong consonances between the
               manners in which Romantic-period writers located selves through conceptualizing forms
               of contained space and Bowie’s practices in the sequence of songs featuring Major
               Tom. Her essay pays particular attention to echoes, which serve both as means of reiterating
               and as forms that can queer the boundaries between individuals, communities, and environments.
               After exploring Romantic and post-Romantic modes for locating and challenging individualism
               using space, Taylor zeroes in on the choral echoes of Coleridge’s “great I AM,” a
               phrase echoed directly in Bowie’s “Blackstar.” She then tracks the forms that “Blackstar”
               models back to Bowie’s earliest big hit, “Space Oddity,” which both employs and resists
               echoes and repetitions to show how Major Tom might “[reject] individualism in order
               to embrace his own individuality.” Taylor concludes by exploring the ways that Major
               Tom continues to act as a fading but dynamically unsettling (New) Romantic echo in
               Bowie’s later works. </p>
            <p>While Taylor’s essay shows Bowie extending paradigms influenced by Romanticism, Beatrice
               Turner’s essay finds him appropriating and revoicing Romantic attitudes regarding
               childhood innocence while also ironizing these and providing emancipatory alternatives.
               In her conception, the oft-dismissed “Kooks” provides the key to <em>Hunky Dory</em>’s visions of generational definition, transmission, and conflict. While “Kooks” appears
               to be a cutesy celebration, when placed in the wider contexts of the album and of
               Romantic appropriations of children as symbolic figures, its fissures, contradictions,
               and silencings become apparent. Crucially, however, Turner reads in Bowie a kind of
               resistance that recognizes the power and potential value of the paradigm it critiques.
               While <em>Hunky Dory</em> is ultimately on the side of experience rather than endorsing a restricting imposition
               of innocence, its cynicism is far from unalloyed, providing, in Turner’s reading,
               a complex and nuanced exploration of the difficulties of inheritance.</p>
            <p>In her discussion of personal and social identities, Emily Bernhard-Jackson argues
               that the ways in which Bowie configured his personae and self can helpfully be understood
               as an expansion and extension of a tradition developed in the writings of John Locke,
               David Hume, and George Berkeley. In opening, she establishes a chain of indexical
               transmissions through which Bowie may have encountered these philosophers’ ideas,
               but more importantly, she demonstrates clearly how reading Bowie alongside Enlightenment
               philosophy surfaces a kind of artistry prepared to commit where its eighteenth-century
               precursors caviled. In Bernhard-Jackson’s reading, Bowie is revealed to have made
               a quintessentially Romantic move by taking ideas about the sequential and fungible
               nature of identity—which had previously been formulated as relatively abstract conceptions—and
               bringing these into life through a combination of personal commitment, media manipulation,
               and skilled artistry. </p>
            <p>My own essay picks up on some of these arguments by considering how Bowie engages
               with Romanticism’s creation of specialized forms of artistic identity. After contending
               that the invention of the capital-A artist was principally a response to Romantic-period
               innovations, I argue that Bowie works simultaneously within and against this tradition.
               His lyrics, personae, and mediated existence all serve to expand the range of what
               can be represented in society and culture, building on the crucial Romantic-period
               developments that established art as a space of radical exploration and assembly.
               However, Bowie is more conflicted about the kinds of powers that should be arrogated
               to the artist than his early-nineteenth-century predecessors. His lyrics often resist
               the claims to privileged consciousness that canonical Romantic pronouncements like
               Keats’s “negative capability” letter, Wordsworth’s <em>Prelude</em>, and Shelley’s agonizingly self-conscious lyrics seem to advance. Instead, Bowie’s
               works consistently gesture out towards his audiences, insisting on the liberating
               faultiness of artistic transmissions and on the crucial role of the listener in making
               meanings and connections.</p>
            <p>Finally, Forest Pyle’s essay begins by considering Bowie’s wide range of influences
               beyond Romanticism, showing his vital engagements with celebrity, modernism, and postmodernity.
               While he tantalizingly sketches the outlines of a glam Romanticism, the main thrust
               of Pyle’s essay is concerned with a reconfigured queering Romanticism mediated, among
               others, by Walter Pater, Oscar Wilde, and Walter Benjamin. His lens for exploring
               this constellation is Todd Haynes’s 1998 film <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>, which does not feature Bowie or include his music in a direct sense, but which is
               dominated by what Pyle calls the Bowie-Image, a conduit for and avatar of the electric
               vivacity of art. In Pyle’s reading, <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is a “site of both nostalgia and ebullience, alternating currents in Romanticism’s
               transmissions to our future.” In being so, it becomes a place of prospective liberation
               and of freedom from the need to be redeemed, capturing—albeit with nuance—the image
               of potential transcendence transmitted through Romantic poetry and through Bowie’s
               “gift of sound and vision.”</p>
            <p>When Bowie himself (or one of his personae) imagined what being a “Star” would be
               like, its potentialities included both the deeply personal or banal (“I could fall
               asleep at night”) and the nakedly commercial (“I could do with the money”). However,
               he also invested stardom with the potential for radical change, arguing that he “could
               play the wild mutation as a rock &amp; roll star.” In this collection, we have experimented
               with taking Bowie at his word, tracing the ways in which we might see his personae,
               lyrics, music, and presences as wild mutations of Romantic inheritances. The extent
               of our success is for you to judge, but it’s been an amazingly fun project to put
               together. We hope you enjoy this collection as much as we have, and that you find
               some of the things it has to say useful in your own examinations of Romantic lineages
               and transformations. </p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">A few highlights: the contributors to Andrew Radford and Mark Sandy’s <em>Romantic Echoes in the Victorian Era</em> (2008) and Mark Sandy’s subsequent <em>Romantic Presences in the Twentieth Century</em> (2012) have insightfully discussed how a succession of principally canonical poets
               and novelists have responded to Romantic provocations, providing opportunities to
               “revisit those Romantic echoes which with ‘keener sounds’ reverberate” (Radford and
               Sandy 1). In <em>Legacies of Romanticism</em> (2012), Carmen Casaliggi, Paul March-Russell and their collaborators adroitly explore
               the ways in which “Romanticism has constituted, and been reconstituted by, subsequent
               developments in artistic theory and practice” (8). Jacques Khalip and Forest Pyle’s
               <em>Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism </em> (2016) takes a more explicitly theory-led approach, with contributors examining from
               a range of angles the manners in which modern culture has been drawn to and illuminated
               by Romantic formations. In doing so, they laudably seek, in words developed from Walter
               Benjamin, “to make good on the terms of that [secret] agreement [between previous
               generations and current ones] . . . to conjure something mutually illuminating in
               the two-way street of past and present” (1).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               2002 Praxis volume,<em>Romanticism and Contemporary Culture</em>, whose contributors collaborated “to think about the similarities and differences
               between the fan’s love for pop culture and the academic’s love for literary history”
               (para. 3). Themes from this collection have recently been revisited in D.B. Ruderman
               and Rachel Feder’s 2017 Pedagogies Commons special issue,<em>Teaching Romanticism with the Contemporary</em>, which collects approaches that “wield the contemporary to peel back the cloak of
               canonicity that sometimes obscures Romantic literary experiments, all the while making
               students better readers—indeed, Romanticist readers—of their own literary, cultural,
