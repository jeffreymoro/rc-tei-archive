            <p class="noCount">Although often heralded as a passionate denunciation of the mayhem of the Peninsular
               War, Francisco de Goya’s The Disasters of War (1814-1820) was not published during
               the artist’s lifetime. My wager is to treat Goya’s desistance not as evasive but as
               intrinsic to the Disasters itself, now seen as an artistic practice and an experiment
               in living that takes on ruination without necessarily metabolizing it. Goya releases
               his images by denying them refuge in the visibly social. In what ways are traces of
               this abstention legible in the aquatints themselves? The fact that the prints remained
               uncirculated during Goya’s lifetime threads together life and work, wartime and the
               aesthetic, survival and ruination in ambiguous but mortalizing ways, and puts to us
               that, for a time, for the decade that they took to engrave, and then for the remainder
               of his life, the inventor and then the archivist of the series learned to live alongside
               disaster in a condition that I call “worldlessness.” </p>

                  <p>Recent discussions of the Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes’s <em>assemblage</em> of influential prints that came posthumously to be known as <em>The Disasters of War</em> (c. 1810–1820; published 1863) locate the artist’s unsparing vision of wartime degradation
                     in a necropolitical context in which proliferating sovereign power fuses indistinctly
                     with the unrestrained destruction of others and otherness.

                     in 1808. As Gonzalo Anes describes it: <span class="quote">‘The king, queen, and heirs were in captivity. There was no government. The people,
                        abandoned by the royal family when they left the court to meet Napoleon in Bayonne,
                        claimed sovereignty for themselves . . . There was no constitutional authority that
                        could assume responsibility to “<span class="foreign">arrojar a la nación a una lucha tan desigual</span>” [hurl a nation into such an unequal fight]; there was no organized army, weapons,
                        or money. (xxxv)’</span> A year later, the poet Manuel Jose Quintana noted that “the fatherland” faced nothing
                     less than a “holocaust” (<span class="foreign">en holocausto</span>) (qtd. in Vega 185). Much worse was to come. But what could be worse than a holocaust?
                     In this world—if it is in fact a world, and not the annunciation of the end of the
                     world and of the end of the very concept of a world—targets of opportunity abound
                     without limit: soldiers, insurgents, and civilians; men, women, and children; humans
                     and nonhumans, not to mention the environments, both built and natural, that these
                     fragile creatures inhabit or occupy. A frenzy of violence, shown to be at once unregulated
                     and highly targeted, threatens to obliterate histories, knowledges, obligations, solidarities,
                     futures, and perhaps thinking itself. Art too is destroyed, including work by Goya,

                              were either destroyed or lost during the sieges of the city. See the “Description”

                              me track down the fate of these altar paintings. Amid wartime shortages that included
                              a dearth of materials the artist needed to pursue his work, Goya gave up fine canvas
                              for ban…</span></div>

                     execution, and dismemberment can be hard to look at and harder to understand. And
                     yet, despite—or perhaps because of—their difficulty, Goya’s images have remained impossible
                     to ignore since they were printed and published, long after the artist’s death.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Goya’s focus is prephotographically tight. Jettisoning the convention of depicting
                     the battlefield from a panoptic distance, which presumes that the spectator can and
                     indeed wants to take the measure of war, his images zero in on the toll of combat
                     on individual bodies and small groups of bodies whose agonies and indignities fill
                     and overfill his pages. Some men are castrated; another is impaled on the trunk of
                     a tree. Women join the fight, but they are also hunted down and sexually assaulted.
                     Goya is the first artist to depict the rape of women not as a battlefield aberration,
                     much less as an aesthetically pleasing scene of passionate struggle, but as a weapon
                     of war.

                     </div> The gendered brutality of combat hangs like a pall over the battlefield whose boundaries
                     are no longer visible. Even corpses—as well as living bodies that are treated as already
                     dead—are subjected to desecration that is beyond killing, beyond the point in which
                     violence is imagined to exhaust and resolve itself in fatality, as Steven Miller has
                     recently argued (1–50). In the artist’s disjointed images we observe pervasive war
                     suffering and war deaths, and then something even more appalling, namely, “war after
                     death” (Miller). How then to draw bounding lines and etch images of war whose contours
                     have dissolved into excess and whose authorized self-descriptions no longer apply?
                     What does the human form look like when war extinguishes that form?</p>

                  <p>Perhaps no scene in the <em>Disasters </em>captures the bleak unruliness of war more vividly than plate 39 (Figure 1), <em>Great deeds! With the dead! </em>(<span class="foreign">Grande hazaña! Con muertos!</span>), which I treat in this essay as concentrating in one ghastly place many of the problems,
                     questions, and possibilities with which Goya’s assemblage thrums. Three mutilated
                     corpses are hung in a tree and displayed like trophies or presented as triumphs. Two
                     of the men have been castrated and hung upside down. One of the men has been beheaded
                     and has had his arms severed just below the shoulder. Those arms are bound together
                     at the hands and strung from a branch, the same branch upon which the decapitated
                     head is mounted. We cannot be certain that the body parts are in fact parts of one
                     whole—that is, whether the limbs and head belong to the torsos at hand or to remains
                     elsewhere. The staged nature of the scene puts to us that there are perpetrators for
                     whom violence must not only be done but <em>seen</em> to be done, an imperative that, of course, complexly implicates Goya’s decision to
                     engrave the scene and ours to parse it. Cataloguing the wounds and locating the bodies
                     and the disposition of the body parts, we find ourselves shadowing the artist to whose
                     hand and eye the scene was a horror but also a formal puzzle, a question of arrangement,
                     orientation, spacing, shading, and so forth. We come to see that looking at what Goya
                     unabashedly calls “the worst”.

                     </div> and working closely with formal questions are not mutually exclusive practices and
                     indeed that the form of the engraving, which deliberately invites us to go over it,
                     “part by part, limb by limb,” (Benjamin, <em>The Origin of German Tragic Drama</em> 176) is the particular way that Goya caches the worst. The tree on which these horrors
                     are hung provides an occasion for the remains to be brought together and presented,
                     to be sure, but it is also Goya’s way of reminding us that what we are seeing is the
                     result not of an extraterrestrially malevolent will but of something proximate and
                     imaginable. The fact that the tree to which mutilations are fastened is verdant, showing
                     a stylized sprig of life amid these unnatural deaths, serves as the punctum of a deeply
                     sobering knowledge: the desecration that Goya pictures may be fantastically grim,
                     but it happened, it is happening, in a place on Earth.

                     </div> In this image we see that there <em>are</em> fates worse than death, and part of what makes scenes like this an example of the
                     worst is not that they are sublimely unimaginable but that they are, in fact, all
                     too available to be executed, observed, remembered, imagined, engraved, and thus in
                     some sense both taken in and <em>lived with</em>. What we see is not sublime, unless there is a sublimity of radical desublimation,
                     the dispiriting solidification of the human form into its insensate segments and volumes.
                     By an accident of history, we have eighty-two or so images to consider, but the lack
                     of any persuasive overall narrative in the series, including the total number of prints

                     more images could well have been created. As Georges Didi-Huberman notes, Goya is
                     among a special group of artists who “know . . . that disasters are multipliable to
                     infinity” (124). Goya registers the importance of making and captioning pictures even
                     and especially if that work is without end. What is centrally important to Goya is
                     the insolent fact that dismembering and displaying the corpses of the enemy dead “was
                     thought; it was therefore thinkable,” (Didi-Huberman 25),

                     </div> just as “all-out-war”—where, as Susan Sontag observes, “expenditure is all-out, un-prudent,
                     war being defined as an emergency in which no sacrifice is excessive” (99)—was executable,
                     and it was executed. Goya is quickened by the need to think this executability and
                     to say it in the form of images whose very existence repudiates the desire to look
                     away or not to look, or to look and not to see, or to look and be told that there
                     is nothing to see, or to say that it happened somewhere else, during a “war,” for
                     example, when anything can happen, or that it happened, yes, but not in my experience,
                     not to me or in front of me, or that it struck me in a traumatizing manner that I
                     am not willing or able to imagine or experience. Goya makes the inability to know
                     how to look at the worst a central part of the agon of looking at the images of the
                     worst, an agon, I want to argue, that leaves indelible if subtle traces in the images
                     themselves. The <em>Disasters </em>are not so much the aesthetic site where we imagine Goya to be overcome by the worst
                     or to be working through the worst as they are the occasion for him to put the aesthetic
                     into the service of thinking the worst, and, importantly, courageously, of affirming
                     that the worst <em>can </em>be thought, in the name of ensuring that there is a place in which its iniquity and
                     enormity can pool or eddy amid the grotesque torrent of violence that is wartime Spain.</p>

                  <p>Goya’s assemblage is a fiercely self-contesting text, roiling with difficulties, obscurities,
                     and sudden shifts in visual styles. The refusal of the <em>Disasters </em>to align unproblematically with any of the belligerents that they depict contributes
                     to a dystopian picture of ambient violence in which, as Ian Baucom argues, “there
                     is no party innocent of the most horrific violence, no revolution whose coming . .
                     . betokens the possibility of progress” (182-3). <span class="foreign">Nada. Ello lo dice</span> (<em>Nothing. That is what it says</em>), one of Goya’s most memorable captions announces, an unadorned and guttural assertion,
                     as much a catch in the throat as it is a phrase, evoking both the waste of war and
                     the strange void to which the labor of watching war is consigned when even loss appears
                     to be lost. If Goya grieves, he grieves that grief that can teach him nothing, <span class="foreign">nada</span>, which, far from a condition of emptiness or vacancy, is what survival or living-on
                     looks like without the prospect of flourishing or transformation.

                     Rajan says with regard to Romantic poetry, this is “not a sign of its difference from
                     a history where things happen” (“Keats, Poetry, and ‘The Absence of Work’” 335). “For
                     poetry makes ‘nothing’ happen,” Rajan argues, by “disclosing a negativity that is
                     in history as much as in poetry” (335). After Stephen Whicher’s remarks about Emerson,
                     we can say that the grief that the <em>Disasters </em>cannot grieve is the form that grief takes.

                     </div> Goya grieved the unfathomable losses of the war, of that I have little doubt. But
                     his text also touches <em>on</em> grief, demonstrating by example that there are relationships or perhaps adjacencies
                     to ruination that are sorrowful but irreducible to grieving. And so it is that Goya
                     finds himself in a placeless place in which it is neither possible nor advisable to
                     determine with any confidence whether history is changing or time is passing. The <em>Disasters </em>are a creature of this ambiguous impasse, in which, as Rei Terada observes of Keats’s <em>Hyperion</em> and <em>Fall of Hyperion</em> (poems that are contemporaneous with the creation of Goya’s engravings), “the open-ended
                     intolerability of the present is as impossible not to see as it is to assimilate”
                     (“Looking at the Stars Forever” 280). Not <em>not</em> to see and not to assimilate: this is the condition of creative refusal that characterizes
                     Goya’s relationship with the worst, beginning with what he did and did not do with
                     the assemblage once he had brought it to the threshold of publication—or rather to
                     the threshold of a conventional understanding of publication. What I want to emphasize
                     is this: Goya did not publish the <em>Disasters</em> during his lifetime. He bequeathed a single set of proofs to his friend, the artist
                     and collector Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, and otherwise withheld them from publication
                     (assuming publication was indeed ever Goya’s interest or intent and thus the desideratum
                     from which the <em>Disasters</em> then could be said to have been withheld). Indeed, the assemblage would not be published
                     until 1863, some thirty-five years after Goya’s death and half a century later than
                     the gruesome events that inspired them. To bring engravings to the proof stage and
                     then to halt the process of publication of which the printing of proofs is conventionally
                     the penultimate move is provocative to consider, especially if we treat the interruption
                     as the dynamic culmination rather than the regrettable qualification of the work.
                     I say “dynamic” because for Goya to have set the assemblage aside for thirty-five
                     years meant he did so not once, around 1820, after the wars were said to have ended,
                     but <em>continually</em>, repeatedly deciding or returning to the decision—across shifting circumstances,
                     both biographical and historical—to shelter and affirm their studio rather than social
                     state, even after leaving the proofs and plates for the <em>Disasters</em> behind when he moved to France in 1824 (Gassier and Wilson 220).

                     </div> Over the course of Goya’s life, and then for some time afterward, the publication
                     of the <em>Disasters </em>is interrupted without interruption. To create proofs, hand them to a trusted friend,
                     but not publish the <em>Disasters</em>, and not publish them forever, is itself an artistic practice and irreducibly a part
                     of what the assemblage is and does. It means to publish the <em>Disasters</em> without publishing them, or perhaps to publish them without circulating them, a publication
                     without publicity—this, as a way to demonstrate that publication is irreducible to
                     publicity. What if we were to treat the setting aside of the <em>Disasters</em> in its own right, making the assemblage generically closer to a Romantic fragment
                     and an example of what Balachandra Rajan calls “the form of the unfinished”? As Rajan
                     argues, the Romantic fragment distinguishes itself by no longer being answerable to
                     a normative idea of completion: “It contributes to a whole which is neither beginning
                     nor end but only history,” (249) Rajan writes. “The unfinished, in such a view, carried
                     with it no natural citizenship, no whole from which it was disinherited, or from which
                     its incompleteness has been made to proceed” (Rajan 249). Goya’s abstention from publication
                     remains mysterious to everyone except the historicists, who say that he feared the
                     displeasure of the Spanish monarchy, his long-time patrons (Hughes 303; Gassier and
                     Wilson 218). Since Goya otherwise could sometimes show little concern for the sensibilities
                     of the Bourbons, whose benumbed <em>in</em>sensibility he didn’t hesitate to capture in a famous portrait of the royal family,
                     the reason for his decision not to print the engravings probably lies there, but elsewhere
                     too.

                              his wife after they won the lottery” (qtd. in Licht 127). As Fred Licht notes, “Even
                              if one takes into consideration the fact that Spanish portraiture is often realistic
                              to the point of eccentricity, Goya’s portrait still remains unique in its drastic

                              treated his work as a mode of interrogating and fashioning himself as an other rather
                              than as an artist who painted for others. </span></div>

                     shrewd but “positively,” as intrinsic to the <em>Disasters</em> themselves and as part of their otherwise often forgotten perlocutionary materiality
                     and force. Not doing something with the <em>Disasters </em>is also a way of doing something, traces of which are legible in the composition,
                     content, and captions of the images, as well as in their materiality <em>as </em>images. The fact that the engravings remained uncirculated and without meaning-to-be-circulated
                     during Goya’s lifetime threads together life and work, wartime and the aesthetic,
                     in ambiguous but mortalizing ways, and puts to us that, for a time, for the decade
                     that they took to engrave, and for the remainder of his life, the inventor and then
                     the keeper of the <em>Disasters</em> lived disastrously; that is, he tarried with <em>the worst </em>in a condition of complex asociality, schooling himself, but always also in the company
                     of others (for Goya went on to produce many other works that were prepared for spectators
                     other than the artist to see), to live alone in the void of catastrophe, now, forever,
                     without the ameliorative props that his public persona as fashionable portraitist
                     and principal royal painter had furnished. Goya’s redaction, the lifelong <em>scarcity</em> of the relation of his engravings to public view, attests not only to the intolerability
                     of the war world they depict but also to the intolerability of the violent—because
                     politically frozen—postwar world in which they were finally set aside, the difficulty
                     that Goya discerns in discovering a consequential space in which to see war and to
                     be seen <em>to see</em> war. So Goya releases his images by <em>refusing</em> them a “refuge in visibility” (Lippit 14) and in the visibly social. One could almost
                     say that, under these conditions, when <em>one’s eyes fail</em>, Goya chooses to see the disaster by <em>touching</em> it, feeling its unmistakable force, with all the grimy physicality that comes from
                     laboring with acid and ink, paper and copper, hand and burin. This <em>tact</em> or recessiveness, this unusability about the <em>Disasters</em>, reminds us that the political and the historical are irreducible to the publically
                     declarative. But this negation and abstention is otherwise difficult to discern if
                     your optic is calibrated to the legible and the social, the same optic, as it happens,
                     through which sovereign power arbitrarily parses the difference between who lives,
                     whose lives are worthy of protection and preservation, <em>and</em> those who are made to die—which is to say between those who remain discernible to
                     the law and those who are deemed to be unworthy of discernibility.

               <p>Goya’s captions are very strange: <em>This is the worst</em>; <em>There was nothing to be done and he died</em>; <em>Why?</em>; <em>There is no one to help them</em>; <em>This is what you were born for</em>; <em>I saw it</em>. These and dozens of other declamations, ranging in tone from head-shaking disbelief
                  to helplessness, resignation, bitterness, and dark humor, come across to contemporary
                  ears like hashtags for the end of the world. They follow one another and sometimes
                  communicate laterally with each other, but they track no sustained progress, no phenomenology
                  of spirit. Their pointedly legible—if laconic and agonistic—“voice” ensures that Goya
                  becomes an active figure in his own composite text, at once engraver and inaugural
                  “reader” of the engravings. Their almost strangled brevity, as if Goya were caught
                  between being at a loss for words and compulsively unable to hold his tongue, embodies
                  the crisis that overtakes the artist and that, in effect, becomes his subject matter,
                  namely, the unwillingness to look away coupled with the inability to know how to look
                  at what he is seeing. The captions are often pronounced as if Goya were referring
                  to someone else’s images, the estranging effect being not unlike speaking of himself
                  in the third person. Whether the captions are a gloss that activates, schools, or
                  even preempts viewers or whether they are there to demonstrate a certain self-sufficiency
                  about the assemblage and thus a reticence about the participatory role of spectatorship
                  is not entirely clear. Goya may well be “reading” his images, and “reading” them in
                  such a strong way, in order to signal his ambivalence about the supplement of spectatorial
                  seeing, and doing so at the precise point where—momentarily—we are struck blind to
                  the images because we are reading words. What is evident is how passionately Goya—or
                  the ardent persona who writes in the artist’s unmistakable hand—is in dialogue with
                  his own engravings, his often exclamatory words in striking contrast to the unerringly
                  steady hand of his silent engravings. Yet we might well ask: for whom were the captions
                  written during the long latency period when Goya lived with the unpublished <em>Disasters</em> in his studio, not to mention the more difficult to describe state in which the assemblage
                  found itself after his death and before their publication? It is hard to shake the
                  impression that the captions form one-half of a conversation that Goya is having with
                  himself. The captions generate a dialogue with the images that we do not necessarily
                  “hear” as participants who are presumed to be the primary subjects of the engravings’
                  visual and verbal address but “overhear” as always belated arrivals. In other words,
                  the captions aren’t so much confidential as a means by which to reshape our understanding
                  of the meaning of a public’s participation with art and of art. In them we observe
                  how the <em>Disasters</em> exhibit a care of the self rather than giving itself entirely over to a presumed
                  spectatorship.</p>
               <p>Goya’s <em>Disasters </em>are not privative in the sense of being occult and unrecognizably idiomatic, but they
                  were nonpublic until the historical accident of their being printed and circulated
                  more than three decades after his death. That unexpectant delay ensures that spectatorship
                  and the giving-to-be-seen of images are not givens but questions worthy of consideration.
                  The interaction between the captions and the images, which is between them as much
                  as it is with us, reproduces elements of the relationship that Goya forges with the
                  <em>Disasters </em>while they remained in his custody. That dialogue ensures that when they were eventually
                  published, they remained haunted by their lifelong condition of having-been-set-aside.
                  Goya is hardly alone in this experiment. Rajan describes an analogous practice in
                  the work of British Romantic poets who sheltered texts in various generative ways:
                  written but never completed, completed but sutured into new poems, or completed but
                  never published, as was the case with Goya’s assemblage (“Coleridge, Wordsworth, and
                  the Textual Abject”). British poets early in the nineteenth century experiment with
                  what she calls the “textual abject,” the publically uncirculated text that is not
                  inert or abandoned but the scene of dynamic recreation. As she suggests, the abject
                  “protects . . . a space for another self to emerge” (“Coleridge, Wordsworth, and the
                  Textual Abject” 814). But in Goya’s case, what are the qualities of this “self”? And
                  what is the nature of this “space”? The captions brim with a wit by turns scornful,
                  exhausted, and sorrowful that can be so piercing and acerbic as to constitute a kind
                  of attack on the images that they caption. <em>Great deeds! With the dead! </em>is a case in point. Goya’s exclamation cannot help but form a taunting gibe about
                  the extraordinary feat of his own engraving and, by extension, the project of which
                  it is such a memorable part, as if he were castigating <em>himself</em> for voyeuristically harnessing the worst to the visible or for treating the worst
                  as something that is meant to be seen in a shared place, and indeed to contribute
                  to the orderly formation and management of such a place. Perhaps that is what makes
                  seeing the <em>Disasters </em>in a gallery or paging through them in a classroom so compelling and strange; these
                  contemplative experiences, which of course are not without enormous merit, also help
                  reproduce the two imbricated illusions with which the <em>Disasters </em>have a deeply agonistic relationship: that the worst is elsewhere, and that here and
                  elsewhere are separate spaces in a larger but ultimately continuous “world.” To look
                  at the <em>Disasters</em> and to think with them is to feel the assemblage pushing back against being put to
                  this worlding work, even as it uncontrollably contributes to it in the act of being
                  taking up as published.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When Goya imagines the worst and dwells with it, this is what he can see: a view of
                     humiliation and torture, dismembered bodies strewn about a battlefield, heaped in
                     piles but also hung up, arranged like trophies to be observed, as if in a macabre <span class="foreign">tableau vivant</span>. We are reminded that war is always already its reenactments, a stagy repetition
                     that Goya’s images mimic uncontrollably. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? In
                     what world could these losses be economized? For now, forever, time feels frozen,
                     at a standstill. The presumed scopic pleasure taken by the torturers mixes uncomfortably
                     with the horror or dismay that we are asked to feel. It is tempting to say that the
                     image captures the outer limits of sovereign power over life and death, except Goya’s
                     point would appear to be to register the effects of the complete derangement of the
                     political, not its maximum projection; the desecrated body and the will to sport “playfully”
                     with its remains marks the point at which the political enemy morphs into the enemy
                     of the political, the phantasm who is no longer an adversary against whom one might
                     fight in a “world” or for a “world” but a thing or a thing-like animal (and isn’t
                     one of the barely submerged discomforting features of Goya’s bodies and body parts
                     that they are hung like carcasses in an abattoir?) with which and to which anything
                     is permitted and against which no harm, strictly speaking, can be done. The artist
                     draws attention to the ensuing chaos, and the negatively creative power that flourishes
                     in that pandemonium, where killing becomes overkilling, and when fury is brought to
                     bear on bodies “whose death is no longer what needs to be assured” (Debrix and Barder
                     122). Because this is the work of the bone collectors, we can be sure that there will
                     be more of it, since it is in the nature of collecting not to be able to stop. Beyond
                     the murder of human beings lies the demolition of the human form and the becoming-animal
                     or becoming-thing of the enemy. Spinoza’s question, “What can a body do?,” is overwritten
                     by its cruel correlative, “What can be done to a body?” Where the Dutch philosopher
                     expressed wonder at the anonymous capacities of life, irreducible to volition, the
                     Spanish artist looks on the fate of anonymous dead who are utterly exposed in death,
                     as the dead always are, to another’s volition. Amid the waste of war, Goya’s exclamation
                     of “<em>Great deeds! With the dead!</em>” all but drowns out Spinoza’s cry. The stillness of Goya’s macabre still life puts
                     to us that war destroys not only bodies but also futures, all that a body might have
                     done, all that makes a particular body particular. “We never know how we’re organized
                     and how modes of existence are enveloped in somebody,” Gilles Deleuze argues. For
                     those bent on defiling corpses, not knowing and having no prospect of knowing these
                     particularities, which are extinguished in death, is the source of a murderous rage.
                     Goya depicts an overgoing violence that is driven by a mad desire to tear the secret
                     of embodiment from the body, dead or alive.

                  <p>The Spanish resistance against the French is also the scene of a ferocious civil war,
                     but both are but a prelude to another war altogether, or perhaps an other <em>of </em>war: both war and its unbecoming, war that brings out how it was always already its
                     unbecoming. Or is the more radically sobering point of engraving images of men doing
                     awful things to corpses to demonstrate that custody of the dead always lies entirely
                     and uncontrollably with those who come after, whether for good or for ill, whether
                     to inspire faith or fear? Does the source of the plate’s uncanny power lie in making
                     luridly visible the work of the living others in whose shaping hands the dead find
                     themselves delivered, and delivered not contingently, according to this or that circumstance,
                     but essentially, as if commanded by an irrevocable law that commands the living to
                     follow the dead and to take up the dead without necessarily knowing what this going
                     before the living and this inexistent relation means or knowing ahead of time what
                     form it will take? But who is the enemy when the objective of warfare is not simply
                     to defeat others who are said to be belligerents but, as Jean-François Lyotard says,
                     “to kill their dead” (160)? Goya’s mutilated corpses put to us that even the dead
                     will not be safe if the enemy prevails. <em>Great deeds! With the dead!</em> may well depict the unrestricted violence that the insurgency inflicts on itself,
                     the extrajudicial killings that swept the countryside as suspected collaborators and
                     Enlighteners were executed and dismembered in the field. In other words, the artist
                     denies us the opportunity to determine whether we are looking specifically at a Spanish
                     or a French atrocity, one of several ways in which the image refuses spectatorial
                     desires as well as captivates them. His point is that the nationality of the corpses
                     doesn’t matter anymore, not only because the dead are indifferent to such distinctions
                     but also because, through a macabre form of wartime chiasmus, the living now prove
                     to be insensate to the dignity of the dead; they are dead to the dead. The plate’s
                     bitter caption is shouted into a void where the dismemberment of corpses does not
                     invert heroism, replacing courageous acts with cowardly ones, but, more disturbingly,
                     demolishes the benumbed emptiness of narratives that resort to understanding war in
                     such moralizing terms. In the place where slaughter becomes an end in itself, there
                     is no why.

                  <p><em>Even worse . . . This is worse . . . The worst is to beg . . . This is the worst!</em> With this desperate chain of captions, Goya evokes the impossibility of taking measure
                     of the disasters at hand or of judging them proportionally. Instead, the artist experiences
                     them as intensifying both inexhaustibly <em>and</em> repeatedly. We are here denied the minimal consolation that the worst has taken place
                     because Goya’s captions make it feel as though worsening and the worst are doomed
                     to occur without end and in the absence of any organizing narrative or clarifying
                     perspective. By deciding against publication, Goya refused to let the <em>Disasters </em>form part of that perspective, and thus from becoming a vantage point from which one
                     could say, the disasters were then but this is now. The <em>ad nauseam</em> repetition—<em>worse</em> and <em>worst</em>—marks the brute passage of potentially endless wartime in which, to recall Paulson’s
                     remarks, “one crime simply follows another,” (337) except even to say this is to miss
                     the stranger thing, the more difficult thing to think, namely, that “one [worst] crime
                     follows another” (337). There must be more worsts out there, we imagine, waiting to
                     be seen and unable not to be looked at. With no world, no outside-the-disaster or
                     other-than-the-disaster from which to determine or rank degrees of suffering and cruelty
                     with any confidence, the disasters worsen, and the worst happens in the way that nothing
                     happens in Samuel Beckett’s <em>Waiting for Godot</em>, namely, more than once.

                     </div> Somehow we find ourselves observing the brute seriality of the most atrocious. Goya
                     thereby uses his captions to signal a willingness to tarry with the disasters, but
                     in a fashion that frankly embraces a certain inoperativity of thought—and spectatorship.
                     For what are we looking at if what we are said to see is, recurrently, the worst?
                     If there is no “exterior,” then where do the engravings position themselves vis-à-vis
                     the disasters? As Jan Mieszkowski elegantly argues, the “Napoleonic dilemma of how
                     to tell a war story when there was no longer an outside to the war grew even more
                     vexing as it ceased to be clear whether one could speak of an ‘inside’ to the participants”
                     (152). We could say that the disasters <em>worst </em>Goya, but they do so without blinding or destroying him and, conspicuously, without
                     provoking any attempt to better them or to inscribe them into a recognizable war narrative—except,
                     perhaps, one that turns on itself and is the site of its own disaster. The disasters
                     are the phenomena to whose maximal atrocity Goya is returned again, meaning that the
                     worst is not a singular event that he takes in psychically but, rather, a pandemonium
                     for which he provides accommodation in the form of his unpublished engravings. The
                     insistence on the worst reverses the expectation, perhaps more powerfully felt today
                     than in Goya’s day,

                     the feeling that the horror is a trauma, or that drawing it necessarily lessens it.
                     Maybe the opposite. It isolated it; it specifies it; it gives it the blank of the
                     page to live in” (33).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Goya is not absent to the experience of the disaster but time and again presents himself
                  to its utter ruinousness, as if compelled to look persistently at that which, strictly
                  speaking, can be seen but once, and then only because that vision is framed by the
                  capacity to look away or to have seen otherwise or to have seen less. The <em>Disasters </em>in their entirety constitute an act of looking not in spite but precisely because
                  of what Didi-Huberman calls “our inability to know how to look at them today” (i).
                  To look but not necessarily to know how to look means observing the worst without
                  apprehending ahead of time or in the aftermath what the worst summons from us specifically
                  as observers. Goya says “This is the worst,” but, strictly speaking, he cannot mean
                  what he says because there is always worse and more of the worst in a <span class="foreign">milieu </span>of worldlessness that lacks redemption, orientation, or even the hint of relief that
                  might come with the slackening of atrocity leading up to and falling away from the
                  worst. The whole idea of a regressive worsening and the advent of the worst starts
                  to disintegrate before our eyes, and yet Goya hangs on to it, reproducing the conceit
                  of responding to the disasters in a measured and measuring way, as if art could metabolize
                  or comprehend the horror by putting it into pictures, while also creating images whose
                  captions remind us that we can do nothing to lessen the worsening and the worst—except
                  to cede a “page” to it, one of many, without end. With “the worst,” Goya does not
                  gesture to the end of the disaster, nor does he try to mark its extreme outer limit.
                  For the artist, the worst is that the worst that arrives afresh as if he were to unable
                  and unwilling to do anything but acknowledge its arrival and look at its hideousness.
                  The worst is that he has survived the worst and that he is living with the worst in
                  the moment when he says, “This is the worst,” while knowing that he will need to say
                  this again. The worst is to see the worst more than once and to see it each time as
                  if for the first time and for the last time.</p>

               <p>“For it is not in the name of a better and truer world that thought captures the intolerable
                  in this world,” Gilles Deleuze argues, “but, on the contrary, it is because this world
                  is intolerable that it can no longer think a world or think itself” (qtd. in Terada,
                  “Looking at the Stars” 290). What does no longer being able to “think a world” <em>look</em> like? Plate 69 (Figure 2) of the <em>Disasters </em>may offer a clue because of its commitment to tarrying with a disaster that is so
                  complete and so completely absorbing that <em>nothing</em> appears to escape its gravitational pull. <span class="foreign">Nada</span>, as we have seen, is in fact the title Goya gave the print, as if to bring the viewer
                  into the closest possible proximity with nihilation while also preempting the thought
                  of “a better or truer world.” <span class="foreign">Nada</span> would appear to name the design or desire that the print thoughtlessly has on us,
                  putting us at the scene of the crime, so to speak, but without offering the means
                  or hope that we might make much or for that matter make anything of it. The caption
                  invites us to dwell with the disaster and do <em>nothing</em> more, an almost impossible task, to be sure, but one worth experimenting with in
                  a way analogous to Kant’s notion of an aesthetic judgment that sees as the poets do,
                  that is, attentively wide-eyed but without a thought of assimilation or comprehension.
                  Nothing is what thinking the worst feels like. <span class="foreign">Nada. Ello lo dice</span>, Goya’s caption reads: “<em>Nothing. It says as much</em>” (or “<em>Nothing. It says [nothing]</em>” or “<em>Nothing. That’s what it says</em>”). The mysterious engraving for which this “nothing” is both the caption and a word
                  scrawled into an otherwise blank page in the body of the image calls strenuously for
                  an understanding that it also bluntly refuses. That the handwriting and the writing
                  hand are the same once again makes Goya into a figure in his own text. Without any
                  confidence in the concept of a world, and thus bereft of the assurance that, as Colebrook
                  puts it, “the world is given as this world for us,” (<em>Death of the Posthuman</em> 135) Goya abandons his image to the questionable provenance of a nihilating stutter.
                  A morass of shadings and hatchings dominate the top half of the engraving, some yielding
                  barely discernible if surreally incongruous shapes, including a floating scale and
                  a cluster of faces that fade into uncertain scratchings from which faces might or
                  might not be made. Shapes that were not there at some imagined outset now are there,
                  or scarcely there. Below, a skinned and skeletalized figure, its monstrous features
                  contorted in effort, appears at first either to be sinking into or struggling from
                  an inky grave . . . until we realize that it is the planar surface of the engraving
                  itself in which the figure’s bare shape is most palpably immured. Against a chaotic
                  background we observe fragments of human forms—bodiless heads, half a body stripped
                  of its flesh—trapped between the birth and death of their own emergence as forms.
                  The <span class="foreign">tachiste</span> effect is profoundly estranging, as if the print were flickering between the illusion
                  of a dark depth and the depthlessness of the print as such, as between pictorialism
                  and the materiality of the picture. In this way, plate 69 self-referentially gives
                  us what Goya’s caption says it gives us, <span class="foreign">nada</span>, the strange substanceless thing that the print elementally is, as Timothy Morton
                  might say: “a spectral quasi-object suspended in nothingness, an inconsistent bunch
                  of squiggles that cannot ever know itself as such” (198). <span class="foreign">Nada</span> thus functions as a kind of interdiction, emanating from both within and without
                  the picture frame, pointing in words to what the image has already accomplished, that
                  is, refusing <em>unequivocally</em> to be an image of something other than itself. The nothingness of the nonrepresentational
                  ground of the image stops us in our tracks, as it were, commanding us to stay with
                  the inscriptive surface where we may be less likely to believe that the aesthetic
                  can apprehend the disasters of war, or embody the sublimely negative knowledge that
                  that disastrousness cannot be comprehended. Goya’s assemblage does not appear to have
                  comprehension or appropriation of any sort as its goal. Quite to the contrary, it
                  is more a question of letting rather than making the worst matter, assuming that such
                  a distinction could be imagined, and of staying close to its grim unfurling without
                  necessarily attempting to metabolize its hurtfulness or to create sense out of its
                  senselessness. Not, as Michael Naas, reading Derrida, puts it “to idealize or incorporate
                  the other’s world into my own, not to make of that world <em>a </em>world” (233). But strictly speaking, “to live with the . . . end of the world” (233)
                  would mean living with the end of a world of <em>life</em>, by which I mean a common world normatively given over to the living, to the principles
                  of preservation, progress, and productivity, and thus to the immuno-logic of war.
                  Central to that logic is the sanctification of life that forms an alibi for a homicidal
                  power so hyperbolically enormous that it can seek to kill the dead by mutilating their
                  remains. To live with the end of the world means bearing lifelessness and worldlessness—what
                  I have called “scarcity”— but eschewing, for a moment, the consolations of mourning
                  and the economization or putting-to-work of loss. In Derrida’s words, recalling Celan,
                  “‘the world is far, the world has gone, in the absence or distance of the world, I
                  must, I owe it to myself to carry you, without world, without the foundation or grounding
                  of anything in the world’” (105). This taking-on, he adds importantly, occurs “even
                  <em>before </em>carrying the other in oneself in mourning” (105). In other words, prior to there being
                  “me” and “you” and the picturable world or worlds that we imagine inhabiting, there
                  is a worldless <em>portage. </em>Perhaps to create proofs but abstain forever from publication is a way of acknowledging
                  that before shouldering a burden one has already carried a weight which is nothing
                  less than the weight of the world. Or, to be more precise, a <em>carrying</em>, a giving-over of a blank page, and little else, is the anarchically worldless space
                  in which the burdened subject materializes and finds itself compelled to form and
                  reform a world.</p>

               <p>Among the strangest captions that Goya added to the engravings is perhaps the most
                  ordinary one: <em>I saw it </em>(<span class="foreign">Yo lo vi</span>) (Figure 3). Appending the phrase “I saw it” was in Goya’s time a banally familiar
                  convention in poetry and engraving, meaning not “I saw this with my own eyes” (Goya
                  appears not actually to have seen most of the horrors that he depicts) but instead
                  functioning as a promise of two things: first, this happened, this event really took
                  place, and second, I am a “war spectator,” the one who can “create the illusion of
                  being there when dreadful things happen” (Hughes 272). Mieszkowski would describe
                  this as an example of “Napoleonic war imaginary,” (5–6) but to do so would perhaps
                  understate the curious rhetorical substitution by which Goya’s signature is underwritten.
                  For “I saw it” is a kind of conjuring, the routing of authorship through its citation,
                  and the invention of a seeing and imagining artistic subject that is imposed on the
                  blank anonymity—the “it happened”—of the disastrous event, an event, moreover, that
                  that fictional “I” hails as the spectral ground of its own authority. Put simply,
                  “I saw it” is made to stand as a proxy for that which I did not see, except figuratively,
                  day for night. “I saw it” posits a world available to sight and knowledge, but draws
                  attention to itself as a positing and little more. The insentient operation of rhetoric
                  suggests that Goya is leaving traces of being present to the disaster in ways that
                  are in excess of the imaginary and the phenomenological. Hidden in plain sight, Goya’s
                  citation repurposes an otherwise tired convention to register something new and very
                  hard to say, namely, the permeation of the artist by the worst—which is not quite
                  the same thing as seeing it imaginatively as a spectator or testifying to it as a
                  witness, although Goya was also caught up in the terrible labor of both those practices.
                  In its self-arresting brevity or inhibition, “I saw it” instead recalls something
                  Michael Herr says about the experience of another disastrous war, that is, the disaster
                  before Iraq and Afghanistan, before Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. Herr writes, “A
                  lot of it never made it in at all” (20). “It just stayed stored there in your eyes,”
                  (20) his stressed syllables slowing time down, as if one could have the experience
                  of “it,” an unnamed catastrophe in Southeast Asia, and not so much miss the meaning,
                  as in the case of trauma, as be stuck <em>with</em> it or stuck to <em>it</em>, visually.—To experience or imagine not much more than that, not much more than that
                  happened and “I saw it” . . . and for now, forever, to hold those two things in one
                  place, eyes wide shut. In its bareness or scarcity, “I saw it” is a declaration of
                  adequation and just-enoughness, of a moment of sheer commensurateness with the worst,
                  whatever this coming together might mean or come to mean. “I saw it” thus withholds
                  itself, abstaining from moving too quickly to what we are schooled normatively into
                  wanting to think, namely, “I saw this, but I wish that I saw something else, something
                  better.” When, near the end of his life, Goya left behind the plates and proofs for
                  the <em>Disasters</em> and moved to France, perhaps he acknowledged something that had always been the case,
                  including all the years in which he lived with them in his studio—namely, that the
                  worst remains stuck to the assemblage, and the assemblage stuck to it—with or without
                  the supplement of the “I” who sees.</p>
               <p><span class="foreign">Nada. That’s what it says </span>(<em>Ello lo dice)</em>: Goya’s caption tries to give the engraving over to a kind of anonymous stammering,
                  “it says what it says,” as if it were a nothing forever on the brink of something.
                  Not for nothing did subsequent editors of Goya’s engravings mutilate this inscription
                  most of all, revising it to <em>Nada. We shall see</em> or <em>It will say</em> (<span class="foreign">Ello dirá</span>), the expectation of future meaning, uninsurable as it is, being so much more preferable
                  to the scarcity of the predicament of sheer expectation. That this significant recuperative
                  change in the caption’s meaning could be made by only slightly doctoring the caption’s
                  characters returns us to the materiality of the letter and to the nonphenomenal vision
                  that fragments language into its meaningless parts. What would it mean then to say
                  “I saw it,” and leave it at that, to experiment with the very idea of living that
                  letting be among all the other ways that one lives with others? The indeterminacy
                  of the referent “it” redounds back upon the “I” who is posited as seeing, for it is
                  possible that the pronoun refers to the engraving itself, and so functions as a prosopopoeia,
                  an animating projection on the engraving that “sees” without ever knowing what it
                  sees. What would it mean to see as the engraver or perhaps as the engraving sees,
                  to store the worst for now, forever, to dwell with disaster but in an unknown because
                  asocial, unproductive, untimely, and nondeclarative way? In giving itself to be read
                  rather than seen (writing perhaps being the most vivid instance of a nonmimetic image),
                  “I see it” reminds us that in their mimetic aspect, Goya’s images call for a moral
                  judgment while also allowing for another form of judgment, if judgment is what it
                  is, something closer to what Forest Pyle calls a “blank opening onto futurity” (35).
                  It goes without saying that that futurity includes us, contemplating scenes engraved
                  by Goya’s hands but not sent to us or meant for us, scenes without an addressee and
                  scenes that, were it not for an accident of history, we could just as easily have
                  not seen. What then can it mean to tarry with an image, to see and not to understand,
                  to engrave and not to be printed, taken up, and consumed? One answer to that impossible
                  question comes unbidden from a not entirely unexpected place, that is, from another
                  artist who lives amid perpetual war brimming with the inimicalization of life that
                  the Peninsular Wars modeled, god help us. I am reminded of the novelist David Grossman,
                  who wonders aloud about what it means to occupy the catastrophe of the war between
                  Israel and the Palestinians, the war that saw his son, Uri, killed by an antitank
                  rocket in Lebanon in 2006. Grossman stands still, and that is the unknown way in which
                  he still stands, now, forever: “I touch on grief and loss like one touching electricity
                  with bare hands,” he says, “yet I do not die. I do not understand how this miracle
                  works” (n.p.).</p>

               were either destroyed or lost during the sieges of the city. See the “Description”
               for the “Apparition of Saint Isodoro to Saint King Fernando in front of the walls
               of Seville” (<em>Aparición de San Isidoro al Rey Fernando el Santo ante los muros</em>) from the National Museum of Fine Arts of Argentina. I thank Reva Wolf for graciously
               helping me track down the fate of these altar paintings. Amid wartime shortages that
               included a dearth of materials the artist needed to pursue his work, Goya gave up
               fine canvas for bandages that were badly needed by the townsfolk defending Aragón,
               his birthplace. That gift is made aslant of the wartime economy that otherwise harvested
               the clothes of the battlefield dead to produce paper. See, respectively, Hughes 283
               and St. Clair 178. Mary Favret drew my attention to the use of the clothes of the
               war dead in her book, <em>War at a Distance.</em></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               rather than an identity that is already there to assume. And I do not say “studio
               rather than social <em>life</em>” because it strikes me as important to describe the <em>Disasters </em>as an example of what Claire Colebrook, in “Earth Felt the Wound,” provocatively calls
               “the unlived,” emphasizing the phenomenon—from acts to objects to concepts—for which
               productivity, potentiality, or vitality don’t easily apply. The <em>Disasters </em>do not “reach their potential” on their publication, nor are they “latent,” awaiting
               their public “manifestation,” while they were uncirculated. And yet it is almost impossible
               not to speak of them in these sorts of terms, which says less about the <em>Disasters </em>and more about the pervasiveness of the biopolitical in criticism, the naturalization
               of “the natural” in how we speak about the aesthetic.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               if one takes into consideration the fact that Spanish portraiture is often realistic
               to the point of eccentricity, Goya’s portrait still remains unique in its drastic
               description of human bankruptcy” (128). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               is more likely to be naturalized as the psyche’s experience of the worst, that is,
               the experience of nonexperience? What other modalities of tarrying with the worst,
               or, for that matter, memory and experience, are otherwise screened out by the emphasis

               mournful or melancholic, relationships which are not on the side of <em>work </em>but <em>worklessness</em>? For an extraordinary exploration of these questions, see Terada’s “Living a Ruined
