               <p rend="noCount">This collection thinks the “rights” of the negative against the
                    more common association of the term “rights” with human rights and rights that
                    can be posited. Such rights, despite their seeming liberalism, produce a
                    normative notion of the person which is in the end biopolitical, and moreover,
                    in assuming that rights can always be posited, they assume the primacy of the
                    public sphere. The essays in this collection all resist the current emphasis on
                    the public sphere that has resulted from the absorption of “Romanticism” into
                    the “Nineteenth Century,” and focus instead on Romanticism as a retreat from
                    publication, publicity and consensus. Whether this retreat is absolute negation
                    or a withdrawal that holds something in reserve is a question left open in the
                    spaces between these six essays on Godwin, Charlotte Smith, Coleridge and Goya.

               <div type="section">
                  <p> The impetus for this collection of essays came from a recent conference of the
                    North American Society for the Study of Romanticism on “Romanticism and Rights”
                    that, in evoking discourses of natural and human rights, also raised the
                    question of the right to, or of, the negative. As Jean-Luc Nancy admits, in
                    critiquing rights which have “pragmatic definitions,” the “suppression or
                    suspension” of such rights “opens directly onto the intolerable” (2). But as
                    Lyotard suggests, rights are no simple matter: there are “wrongs” which cannot
                    be remedied through “rights” because they cannot be phrased in a “language
                    common to . . . the other party” (28). Lyotard is more broadly
                    concerned with a <emph>differend</emph> that eludes capture in discourse and
                    that will always persist even if a new discourse and the right to it are
                    established. Since the utopianism of human rights discourse is only one aspect
                    of a larger foreclosure, the bigger question here is of what is left out by the
                    emphasis on the public (or even counter-public) sphere that has come to dominate
                    much writing on Romanticism, and for which rights—juridical or otherwise—are
                    only a metonym. Within a discourse that assumes the sufficiency of the public
                    sphere, there are things that cannot be said or done, because a discourse for
                    them does not, or does not yet, or may not ever exist; there are things that
                    cannot be published, to give an example used by Lyotard (4), which is pertinent
                    to this collection.</p>
                  <p> It is this question of what is foreclosed by the social that has led the
                    biopolitical philosopher Roberto Esposito to argue in <title level="m">Third
                        Person</title> that human rights include only by exclusion, and that this
                    aporia is “the line that passes . . . between rights and the human
                    condition, and in the process rips them apart” (68–69). By this Esposito means,
                    following Hannah Arendt, that “the law allows entrance only to those who fall
                    into some category—citizens, subjects, even slaves—hence, insofar as they fall
                    into a political community” (69–70). Thus it is not so much that rights exclude
                    certain people (who can always be included in a new category),<note place="foot">This is the point made by Luhmann, who sees the public sphere as
                        sufficiently open to accommodate continuous “structural transformation”
                        through an expansion of communicative rationality in which even “improbable
                        communications” of the most “personalized” nature develop a “code” that
                        allows them to become part of the system, as the very existence of a
                        “threshold of improbability” expands the “number of communicable topics”
                        (8–9, 18–20). There is thus no need for anything outside discourse, which
                        also means that what is not yet part of discourse is “understood and
                        practised” not at a “<emph>thematic level</emph>” but at the level of its
                            “<emph>codification</emph>” (20-1).</note> as that this very inclusion
                    excludes a <emph>differend</emph> concealed in these individuals: for instance
                    Caleb Williams in Adam Sneed’s essay, who is never quite inside the category he
                    fills, that of the person who seeks truth and justice. At the heart of this
                    aporia that traverses the notion of rights, according to Esposito, is the
                    distortion imposed by the term “person,” introduced to bridge the gap between
                    “the concept of human being and that of citizen” (3). In the discourse of rights
                    only a life “that can provide the credentials of personhood” is “qualitatively
                    significant” (2). With the delimitation of human being in terms of personhood,
                    and with the definition of a person as the condition of possibility for a
                    citizen, or in Giorgio Agamben’s terminology, with the absorption of
                        <emph>zoe</emph> into <emph>bios,</emph> comes a set of normalizing values
                    that enfranchise not just some forms of psychological life but also certain
                    modes of thinking at the cost of others.</p>
                  <p> The essays in this collection are not necessarily concerned with rights in a
                    juridical sense, though not surprisingly the issue does come up in the two
                    pieces on Godwin. Indeed, the right of the negative inevitably entails a use of
                    that word that is more metaphoric and elusive than any positive right. We speak
                    here of the “right” of the negative because the plural might imply a range of
                    rights that can be specified, but it is also necessary to think in terms of
                    “rights” because the effects of this right, and indeed what an effect is, are
                    far from clear. And we speak of a right “of” rather than “to” the negative
                    because the right not to be or do something, as in civil disobedience, risks
                    being a determinate negation that is simply an antithetical form of positivity.
                    These essays, by contrast, explore a certain insistence of the negative that
                    cannot always be encompassed in the right not to do or be something: an
                    insistence that traverses a subject such as Christabel without exactly being
                    something that she “has” or of which she, or even Coleridge, is fully conscious.
                    Christabel’s odd passivity, explored in Marc Mazur’s essay, makes her no more
                    than a channel for a negativity that cannot be easily located. But we must also
                    speak of a right “to” the negative, as a way of conveying the force that the
                    negative can have, for instance in my own essay on Godwin’s <title level="m">Mandeville</title>, whose protagonist, even as a
                        “<foreign>non-ens</foreign>” (439), insists on his right to be in the mode
                    of not being. Hegel explores this retreat from the collectivity, which is more
                    perverse, more difficult of access, than non-conformity, when he describes a
                    self that is “turned against its structure” so that “the negative thing is the
                    structure itself.” In Hegel’s words, “the organism is then in the opposed forms
                    of <emph>being</emph> and <emph>self;</emph> and the <emph>self</emph> is
                    precisely <emph>that</emph> for which the negative of itself <emph>is</emph>,”
                    that which “relates itself to itself as a negative” (428).</p>
                  <p> Our first essay on Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> is the
                    closest to engaging with the judicial system as an arena in which to think the
                    right of the negative. In “Caleb’s Unreasonable Doubt” Adam Sneed takes up the
                    concept of reasonable doubt in legal epistemology, which he relates not to
                    Humean skepticism but to a seventeenth- and eighteenth-century tradition of
                    “constructive skepticism” in which the entertaining of doubt is meant to
                    establish relative certainty. Against this containment of doubt, Sneed finds
                    that the reasonable doubt which Collins’ story of Falkland’s innocence elicits
                    in Caleb generates a further dissatisfaction with Caleb’s own unreasonable
                    desire for certainty, thus resulting in a spiraling doubt that goes beyond
                    skepticism, which is still a kind of position. For the affective excesses of the
                    narrative—Caleb’s excessive curiosity, his seemingly unwarranted sense of guilt,
                    and his peculiar elective affinity with Falkland—all function as remainders that
                    prevent us from reading the text straightforwardly as positing something, for
                    instance a critique of the <foreign>ancien régime</foreign>. Paradoxically, in
                    all the cases where Caleb doubts Collins or where his own credibility is called
                    in question, Caleb is in the right. Yet being right casts him into a life that
                    is somehow wrong, a life that cannot be vindicated, as the novel unfolds along
                    the fragile line between rights and human being. And here, we might add,
                    Esposito’s analysis of the troubling relation between rights and citizenship has
                    much to say about Godwin’s novel. For the right Caleb asserts to uncover and
                    publish the truth about Falkland, and indeed his very curiosity, are intimately
                    linked to the claim of Godwin’s “humble,” upwardly mobile protagonist to
                    personhood and citizenship (Godwin, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> 59).
                    So by the end of this profoundly deconstructive narrative, Caleb has “no
                    character to vindicate” (434) as he reverts to being a third person, the voice
                    in which Godwin began the novel, and which for Esposito is the voice of writing:
                    “to write has always meant to ‘pass from the first to the third person’” and to
                    a “relation of self nonidentification” (130–31).<note place="foot">Esposito is
                        quoting Maurice Blanchot’s <title level="m">The Space of Literature</title>.
                        In his 1832 Preface to <title level="m">Fleetwood</title> Godwin says that
                        he began <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> “in the third person,” but
                        then made “the hero of [the] tale his own historian”; in “this mode I
                        persisted in all my subsequent . . . fiction” (448). The point
                        would be inconsequential, except that Caleb casts doubt on his own first
                        person narrative when he oddly decides to convey Collins’ third person
                        narrative in the first person (<title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> 66),
                        thus producing a continuous “aphonia of the narrative voice” (Esposito 131).

                  <p> If the aleatory doubt that becomes the very structure of the novel comes from
                    Godwin’s emphasis on “the right of private judgment” (<title level="m">Enquiry</title> 1: 170), our next essay moves to a genre more traditionally
                    allied with a retreat from the public, namely the lyric. Readings by Abrams and
                    Wasserman that saw the Romantic lyric as conjoining self and nature, inside and
                    outside, or subject and object, have long since ceased to be the norm, given
                    that critics after de Man have seen the greater Romantic lyric as invoking this
                    paradigm only in the mode of compensation. But in his essay on Charlotte Smith’s
                        <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets,</title> Samuel Rowe questions the
                    marginalization of Smith as a sentimental poetess, and makes a bold claim for
                    Smith (rather than Coleridge) as having initiated a tradition of lyric
                    negativity. The negative turn in her sonnets (referring to a thematic but also a
                    formal turn at the sestet or couplet) is particularly radical because while the
                    poems are about loss, Smith will not divulge what has been lost. The containment
                    of elegy within the sonnet’s tightness rather than the more sprawling forms of
                        <title level="m">Lycidas</title> or <title level="m">In Memoriam
                    </title>contributes to this reserve, which refuses any return from object loss
                    through “normal” mourning. Thus unlike Adorno in “Lyric Poetry and Society,”
                    Smith thinks the lyric outside of a correlationism in which withdrawal from the
                    social sustains “the integrity of a coercive reality precisely by refusing to
                    align with it” (Rowe par.17). In thus protecting the Real of loss, Smith does
                    claim a right “to” the negative, a right “not to communicate” (par. 25), but
                    this claim, by declining all phenomenal content, produces an “empty”
                    subjectification that holds “subjectivity in a contentless void” (pars. 5,19). </p>
                  <p> Like Rowe, David Collings in his essay “Positive Negation” focuses on the lyric,
                    or more precisely the short poem, since Coleridge’s “Limbo,” “Ne Plus Ultra,”
                    “Human Life” and his late poems generally, are less easily categorizable than
                    Smith’s sonnets. Using these fundamentally metaphysical poems to theorize
                    negativity, Collings raises the philosophical problem of how the negative can
                    have “rights.” How can it make a demand, when it has not been named and “given
                    specific powers within a discourse or practice” (par. 2)? Whereas Smith’s right
                    not to communicate does exist within a discursive practice and so is still a
                    right exercised by a subject, for Collings the idea that what cannot be posited
                    has rights is metaphysically an oxymoron. And yet non-being, even as absolute
                    nullity, somehow <emph>is</emph>: a problem also faced in <title level="m">Ages
                        of the World</title> by Schelling, who comes up both in this essay and my
                    own. For Schelling the negative is not simply privative. Not only is negation
                    originary, because the positive can have being “only by repressing the negating
                    force in itself”; a being also “cannot negate itself as actual without at the
                    same time positing itself as the actualizing potency that begets itself”
                    (17–18). To describe the presence of absence, or how that which has no being,
                    can assume a “face, voice, or agency” through a “<emph>trope</emph> of direct
                    embodiment” (par. 2; emphasis mine), Collings borrows the term “positive
                    Negation” from Coleridge’s “Limbo.” Milton’s Death, invoked by Coleridge,
                    provides a first “template” (par. 14) for this right of the negative to be
                    posited as that which (it) is not: a claim for which Coleridge’s own “positive
                    Negation” is also a catachresis. </p>
                  <p> The difficulty of thinking this catachresis may be why Coleridge did not publish
                    these poems for many years, and then too only as anomalies. This withholding
                    surfaces repeatedly in Romanticism, in work referred to in several essays—for
                    instance, Smith’s right not to communicate, Schelling’s unpublished <title level="m">Weltalter</title> project, and Goya’s <title level="m">Disasters
                        of War</title> in David Clark’s essay, which were never exhibited. It is the
                    explicit concern of the next article by Marc Mazur, which explores Coleridge’s
                    delay in publishing “Christabel” even as he circulated it privately, and the
                    continuing “retreat into self” (Schelling 6) that characterizes the published
                    versions. Mazur begins by theorizing two versions of this retreat based on work
                    by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy and by Catherine Malabou. In the
                    former’s <title level="m">Retreating the Political</title> (as in Adorno’s
                    “Lyric Poetry and Society”), what is involved is a withdrawal that re-treats the
                    political. Such withdrawal, as we have already seen, risks being caught in a
                    correlationism that reconfirms what it retreats from. But for Malabou the
                    retreat is not voluntary, not political; it does not assume the intentionality
                    of a fully constituted subject, and so is not even readable. What Mazur notes as
                    the “indifference” that attends the narration in the unpublished versions of
                        <title level="m">Christabel</title> (par.18) allows for this unreadability;
                    we can think of these versions as written in the third person, <foreign>le
                        neutre</foreign> in Blanchot’s term, which Esposito sees as resisting any
                    interpellation into civic personhood. But in the “Conclusion to Part the
                    Second,” added in 1816, the Symbolic Order is reestablished through the pact
                    between Geraldine and Sir Leoline, even as Christabel herself retreats from the
                    empty place of this reconstitution of the social. Coleridge tries to take
                    control of the poem as narrator, intervening into a narration whose earlier
                    indifference had cathected the trauma or unassimilable effraction traced by
                    Malabou in <title level="m">Ontology of the Accident</title> (par. 4). And yet
                    in finally publishing the poem, Coleridge does not so much complete it as
                    himself retreat from it by handing it over to a public about which he remains
                    deeply ambivalent: an ambivalence mirrored in the ineffectuality of Bard Bracy,
                    as the poem “turns over and over again around an insoluble secret which retreats
                    from the author” (par. 8).</p>
                  <p> Retreat is also at the center of my own essay on Godwin’s <title level="m">Mandeville</title> (1817), a historical novel whose protagonist never
                    enters history as he progressively retreats into the closet of his psychic
                    history. The novel, which has many resonances with Godwin’s own time, is set in
                    the <foreign>interregnum</foreign>, the only period when Britain had no King,
                    and is bookended by two rebellions: the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and Mandeville’s
                    private attack on his unimpeachably good classmate Clifford, who is about to
                    marry Mandeville’s sister in a domestic simulation of the impending Restoration.
                    By way of the protagonist’s “eternal war” on Clifford, the novel engages in an
                    almost pathological deconstruction of the beautiful, the good, and the true. It
                    ends shockingly with his accidental defacement by Clifford, an effraction that
                    dis-figures all schemes of restoration. Against readers who find the climax hard
                    to absorb and feel that Godwin meant to “complete” the novel otherwise, I argue
                    that he deliberately stages a psychoanalysis of “taste” and indeed of aesthetics
                    itself, as what Baumgarten calls the art of thinking beautifully (533). Godwin
                    wrote the novel after a long retreat of his own following the failure of 1790s
                    radicalism, during which he struggled with how to write history negatively, or
                    how to write the negative as history, as positive Negation. In this history, the
                    fanaticism of the seventeenth century and its later secularization as the
                    misanthropy that so fascinated him are tropes that must be turned round and back
                    in on themselves, so as to discern within them “something not yet made good”
                    that “pushes its essence forward” (Habermas 78). Yet in the context of the
                    novel, this potential remains “contracted and self-negated” (Schelling 18),
                    withheld in an absolute reserve. </p>
                  <p> Godwin went on to write a <title level="m">History of the Commonwealth of
                        England</title> (1824–28): a more sober and concrete sequel to <title level="m">Political Justice</title>. If <title level="m">Mandeville</title>
                    is knotted into a negative dialectic with the <title level="m">History</title>,
                    as <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> was with <title level="m">Political
                        Justice</title>, its conclusion suspends any dialectic over a black hole.
                    There is no such ambiguity in David Clark’s essay on Goya’s <title level="m">Disasters of War</title>, the eighty two images of tortured and mangled
                    bodies from the Peninsular War of 1808–14 that are the backside of Goya’s long
                    career as a court painter. Clark’s essay has much in common with my own: both
                    deal with texts from the second decade of the nineteenth century that are set
                    against the backdrop of war, and both deal with texts that are brutally
                    unaesthetic. But there is no “tropology” of the negative here, in which the
                    negative too is not what it is; there is no future, only bare life. Unlike the
                    essays by Rowe and Collings, Clark’s essay also bears directly on the public
                    sphere, but there are no persons in the images, no citizens, as the figures are
                    anonymous and lacking in what Heidegger calls “world.” Goya printed early proofs
                    of many of the plates in the <title level="m">Disasters,</title> but he never
                    published them: not an accident, but “an artistic practice” (par. 5) that we
                    have seen in other figures discussed in this collection. By keeping the images
                    in a “studio rather than social state” (par. 5), Goya refuses them any refuge in
                    the social. It is surely curious that in a Romanticism now configured around the
                    Regency, and thus around a public sphere of consensus rather than
                        dissensus,<note place="foot">I explore the consequences of the current
                        critical reconfiguration of the Romantic period around the Regency rather
                        than the French Revolution in my article, “The Prose of the World:
                        Romanticism, the Nineteenth Century, and the Reorganization of Knowledge.”
                    </note> there are so many instances of this refusal: not just in England, but
                    also in Germany and Spain. Rather than arguing that Romanticism invented the
                    depoliticized category of “literature” as the delayed completion of Britain’s
                    “bloodless Revolution” (Jarrells 7–14, 17–19), we should perhaps think
                    Romanticism within this withdrawal into the rights of the negative, with all the
                    differences about the negative that emerge in the spaces between these
                    essays.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">This essay considers the doubt and its relation to desire as
                    explored in William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794). It
                    argues that the novel’s interest in doubt, and particularly its interest in how
                    doubt organizes legal inquiry, should be read in dialogue with a form of legal
                    doubt adopted within eighteenth-century legal epistemology as a response to
                    problem of legal judgment under uncertainty and now crystallized in the “beyond
                    reasonable doubt” evidentiary standard that continues to organize legal proof in
                    Anglophone law. The essay considers how the novel’s insistence on the ways
                    desire conditions doubt subverts the claims to “disinterestedness” and
                    “reasonableness” that recommend “reasonable doubt” as legitimate and adequate
                    response to the risks posed by judgment under uncertainty. The novel’s ironic
                    treatment of “reasonable doubt” exposes how reasonable doubt is itself
                    conditioned by an “unreasonable” desire to preserve the possibility of legal
                    judgment despite these risks and how this unreasonable, conservative desire
                    ultimately compromises its ability to assess and respond to uncertainty. Through
                    Caleb’s “unreasonable doubt” and the reader’s “doubt-as-suspense,” the novel
                    pursues doubt as raw, affective excess -- doubt as it exists “before” it is
                    disciplined or conditioned by skepticism -- in an attempt to expose the basis of
                    doubt in unreasonable, inaccessible desire and, thus, to call into question its
                    legitimacy as a ground for legal judgment. The essay’s coda considers how the
                    doubt “before skepticism” pursued by <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                    might be generalized as a form of “Romantic doubt” and, further, how this
                    “Romantic doubt” allows us to reimagine the relation of Romanticism and
                    skepticism. </p>

                  <p> In this essay I want to consider doubt and its relation to desire as
                        explored in William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams </title>(1794),
                        by which I mean not only how doubt could be said to produce or be attended
                        by different forms of desire (for instance, the desire to resolve doubt into
                        certainty), but also how different forms of desire condition different forms
                        of doubt, and, even more strikingly, how doubt itself constitutes a form of
                        desire in the novel. Since the novel’s exploration of doubt also focuses on
                        how doubt organizes legal inquiry (for example, into Tyrrel’s murder or
                        Falkland’s guilt), I also want to consider how the novel’s treatment of
                        doubt is in conversation with a form of legal doubt that, by the late
                        eighteenth century, had emerged as a central strategy within legal
                        epistemology for addressing the problem of legal judgment in the face of
                        imperfect evidence. Indeed, that rational, procedural form of doubt remains
                        crystallized in the familiar “beyond reasonable doubt” evidentiary standard,
                        which first emerged in common law practice in the late eighteenth-century
                        and which continues to organize legal proof in American criminal law. Much
                        has already been written about the novel’s explicit thematization of legal
                        judgment as well as its incorporation of various legal frameworks—for
                        instance, the frameworks of testimony and trial—within its narrative
                            form.<note place="foot">AUTHOR’S NOTE: I would like to extend my
                            sincerest thanks to Tilottama Rajan, Orrin Wang, Marjorie Levinson,
                            Gregg Crane, and Julia Hansen for reading and responding to earlier
                            versions of this essay. For recent treatments of <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams </title>in relation to eighteenth-century legal theory and
                            practice, see Marshall 27–64, Grossman 37–38, and Hoeveler and Jenkins
                            327. Although the following reading will concern itself more with the
                            novel’s engagement with legal epistemology rather than common law
                            practice, its argument has affinities with Marshall’s claim that the
                            novel’s legal preoccupations can be “traced to contemporary anxieties
                            about the nature of justice and to specific legal challenges in the
                            evolving Common Law system” (Marshall 2).</note> Given the central role
                        of doubt in the legal theory of the period, the novel’s emphasis on the role
                        of doubt in assessing Falkland’s case could be regarded as part and parcel
                        of its appropriation of this broader legal framework. However, in this essay
                        I intend to concentrate on how the novel’s insistence on the relation of
                        doubt and desire ultimately works to subvert this form of legal doubt by
                        exposing the desires that condition it and thus upending assumptions
                        regarding its disinterested and reasonable character.</p>
                  <p>To begin to develop these claims, we might turn to Godwin’s suggestive remark
                        in his 1831 advertisement to <title level="m">St. Leon</title> that it was,
                        in part, “the state of doubt in which the reader might for a time be as to
                        the truth of [Caleb’s] charges” against Falkland that made <title level="m">Caleb Williams </title>“a narrative of no uncommon interest” (<title level="m">St. Leon </title>v). It is a remark that testifies as much to
                        the centrality of the trial framework to the novel’s form as it does to the
                        centrality of procedural doubt within that legal framework. And yet Godwin
                        does not assume the reader’s state of doubt to reflect the kind of
                        disinterestedness we might expect or even demand from a judge or jury member
                        reviewing Falkland’s case. Rather, it is a sign of the reader’s
                        “uncommon”—that is, extraordinary or even excessive—interest in Falkland’s
                        case. This is doubt as suspense, not suspension. It heats up rather than
                        cools down judgment. In this sense, the character of the reader’s doubt
                        could be said to have a closer affinity with Caleb’s doubts and suspicions
                        about Falkland; it reproduces Caleb’s doubt-as-suspense.<note place="foot">Uphaus similarly observes that Caleb’s curiosity “excites” and
                            “expresses the desires of the reader’s curiosity” (281) and functions as
                            “a psychological attribute by which the reader is lured into reenacting
                            Caleb’s processes of mind” (282). </note> At the same time, however, the
                        reader’s doubt also appears to constitute a negative recoil from Caleb’s
                        suspicions. Here again Godwin’s retrospective remark is suggestive since
                        Godwin assumes the reader’s doubt to center on the “truth of [the] charges”
                        put forward by Caleb rather than directly on the facts of Falkland’s
                        case—or, in Godwin’s terms from the same advertisement, not on Falkland’s
                        “atrocious crime” itself but on the “annoyance [Falkland] suffers from the
                        immeasurable and ever-wakeful curiosity of a raw youth” (v). In other words,
                        it is a question of the merit or grounds of Caleb’s suspicion, a question
                        that includes but also exceeds the question of Falkland’s actual guilt.
                        Although Godwin seems to assume that the reader’s doubts only exist “for a
                        time” (presumably until Falkland confesses), the novel’s ethical difficulty
                        and sophistication would seem to hinge on the fact that the reader’s doubts
                        about the “truth” of Caleb’s charges – again, in this sense of their
                        warrant, of the legitimacy of Caleb’s grounds for making them – remain long
                        after the factual certainty of Falkland’s guilt is established. The reader’s
                        doubt does not ultimately register a dispute about the facts of Falkland’s
                        case but rather a dissatisfaction with the moral ambivalence of Caleb’s
                        doubt. On one hand, it seems evident that Caleb’s doubt about Falkland’s
                        innocence is hardly grounded in a disinterested desire for legal justice.
                        Instead, his doubt seems grounded in an excessive, indeterminate form of
                        desire. On the other hand, Caleb’s doubt, however compromised by desire,
                        somehow succeeds in discovering Falkland’s guilt where the supposedly
                        disinterested procedural doubt of the legal system fails. In this sense, the
                        reader’s dissatisfaction with Caleb’s doubt is compounded by an equal
                        dissatisfaction with the legal system, whose form of legal doubt appears no
                        less compromised. To complicate matters even further, the affinities between
                        the reader’s and Caleb’s doubt make it so that any dissatisfaction the
                        reader may have with Caleb’s doubt also amounts to a negative recoil from
                        her own doubt-as-suspense, a recognition of how this affective excess
                        similarly compromises any claim the reader has to disinterested judgment.
                        This compounding dissatisfaction should be seen as an emergent effect and
                        instrument of the novel’s negativity, one which turns doubt upon itself to
                        interrogate a certain faith in doubt’s reliability as a disinterested ground
                        for judgment under uncertainty.</p>

                  <head>Constructive Skepticism and Reasonable Doubt</head>
                  <p>While the novel’s pursuit of doubt as desire engages most directly with the
                        legal form of “reasonable doubt” I have described above, it should also be
                        seen as engaging with and commenting on a more widespread embrace of
                        rational skeptical procedures as a viable response to the problem of
                        judgment under uncertainty in the period. As Barbara Shapiro notes in her
                        discussion of eighteenth-century legal theory, because legal theorists
                        assumed a fundamental similarity between legal and everyday reasoning,
                        eighteenth-century legal epistemology should not be understood as distinct
                        from the general epistemology of the period. Rather it should be viewed
                        largely as an attempt to apply the most current epistemological theory to
                        specific legal problems (Shapiro, <title level="m">Beyond Reasonable Doubt
                        </title>19, 38). As Shapiro observes, long before the phrase “reasonable
                        doubt” emerged in the common law court, it formed the cornerstone of a broad
                        epistemological program that united philosophers and divines of various
                        stripes around the premise that, despite epistemological uncertainty,
                        “reasonable men, employing their senses and rational faculties, could derive
                        truths that they would have no reason to doubt” (<title level="m">Beyond
                            Reasonable Doubt </title>7). In this essay I will refer to this broader
                        philosophical program as “constructive skepticism” following Henry van
                        Leeuwen and Jamie Ferreira who have examined its origins in the
                        probabilistic epistemologies of the late-seventeenth century philosophers
                        John Tillotson, John Wilkins, and to some extent, John Locke.<note place="foot">See Van Leeuwen, <title level="m">The Problem of Certainty
                                in English Thought, 1630–1690 </title>and Ferreira, <title level="m">Scepticism and Reasonable Doubt.</title>
                     </note> The program is
                        “skeptical” in the sense that it acknowledges the fact of epistemological
                        uncertainty and “constructive” in the sense that it rejects that this basic
                        fact should have any radical implications regarding our ability to arrive at
                        degrees of “moral certainty” sufficient to justify practical action and
                        judgment (Ferreira 2–4). Put another way, while constructive skepticism
                        accepts the skeptical premise that we are unable to attain certain knowledge
                        about matters of fact, it also accepts that the careful application of
                        skeptical and rational procedures constitutes a sufficient response to the
                        problem of uncertainty and, further, a viable method for “constructing”
                        actionable, if still uncertain, knowledge about the world. In this sense,
                        constructive skepticism can be further glossed as a “therapeutic” and
                        “conservative” form of skepticism since it retains a fundamental faith in
                        the ability of a procedural, rational skepticism to address and alleviate,
                        if not resolve entirely, the epistemic problem of uncertainty that
                        skepticism in general identifies. </p>
                  <p>It is specifically this conservative character of constructive skepticism and
                        how it conditions the character of legal doubt adopted within
                        eighteenth-century legal theory that I want to examine in this section as a
                        necessary philosophical background for understanding the novel’s approach to
                        doubt. This conservatism is inscribed in the demand that legal doubt must be
                        “reasonable” doubt. It is a qualification that reflects constructive
                        skepticism’s organizing assumption regarding the qualified value of rational
                        skepticism as a response to judgment under uncertainty. On one hand, the
                        “beyond reasonable doubt” standard reflects the recognition that an actively
                        skeptical posture helps reduce the risks of factual error and wrongful
                        conviction in legal judgment. On the other hand, the standard reflects the
                        recognition that, since legal facts are always subject to some degree of
                        uncertainty, at a certain point doubt must lose its instrumental value and
                        become an impediment to legal judgment. Allowing some doubt helps reduce the
                        risk of wrongful conviction; allowing <emph>any</emph> doubt makes it
                        impossible to convict at all. As such, the “beyond reasonable doubt”
                        standard attempts to strike a balance between, on the one hand, a desire to
                        reduce the risks of uncertainty and, on the other, a desire to preserve the
                        possibility of legal judgment despite the risks that inevitably attend
                        uncertainty. It achieves this balance by positing a distinction between
                        legitimate and illegitimate forms of doubt, between “reasonable” doubts that
                        are recognized within the legal process and “unreasonable” doubts that, for
                        various reasons, fail to qualify. The distinction aims to separate
                        “plausible” from “merely possible” doubt, “reasonable” doubt from “any doubt
                        at all,” and, most importantly for our purposes, “private” or “interested”
                        forms of doubt from “public” or “disinterested” forms of doubt.</p>
                  <p>Though these distinctions appear largely normative in retrospect, they were
                        regarded as descriptive in the period and, along with constructive skeptical
                        arguments for the sufficiency for “moral certainty,” depended more
                        fundamentally on a descriptive epistemological distinction between two kinds
                        of knowledge, “probable” and “demonstrative.” “Demonstrative knowledge”
                        entailed propositions that could be proved by logical demonstration and,
                        thus, produced an “absolute” or “demonstrative” certainty that necessitated
                        assent. Since probable knowledge could never admit of this level of
                        demonstrative certainty, the evidentiary standards for proof in probable
                        knowledge had to be adjusted to reflect the intuition that one could gain
                        sufficient, if incomplete, degrees of certainty to justify practical action
                        by ascending a graduated scale of belief based on degrees of “moral
                        evidence.” In this sense, degrees of evidence could be correlated to
                        relative degrees of belief ranging from absolute doubt or disbelief up to
                        opinion and, finally, to full confidence and conviction. “Moral certainty”
                        existed at the top of this evidentiary hierarchy and was assumed to provide
                        a functional equivalent to demonstrative certainty in the realm of
                        contingent fact. It was reserved for propositions that would be
                        “unreasonable” to doubt despite any theoretical level of uncertainty.</p>
                  <p> Intuitions about the sufficiency of moral certainty were developed with
                        reference to widely-observed and fairly uncontroversial natural regularities
                        (e.g., the rising and setting of the sun or the ebb and flow of the tides)
                        or to widely attested historical or geographical facts (e.g., that there was
                        a historical figure named Julius Caesar or that a city called Rome existed).
                        But the eighteenth-century legal theorist had little reservations about
                        applying the label of moral certainty to less regular, more controversial
                        legal facts. Eighteenth-century legal treatises readily adopted the basic
                        epistemological distinction between moral and demonstrative knowledge to
                        develop a normative account of evidentiary standards. Treatise writers
                        approached the epistemological distinctions as if addressing an audience
                        that would be either unfamiliar with the nature of moral evidence or somehow
                        reluctant to accept the sufficiency of moral certainty relative to
                        demonstrative certainty. Similarly, treatise writers tended to treat
                        orientations towards uncertainty that challenged the sufficiency of moral
                        certainty as irrational and pathological. Such orientations reflected an
                        excessive and unreasonable desire for certainty that failed to grasp the
                        very nature of probable knowledge, much less the exigency and necessity of
                        practical action under uncertainty. They fixated on doubts that were
                        theoretical instead of practical, scrupulous instead of significant, matters
                        of private rather than public concern. </p>
                  <p>To enjoin readers to accept the sufficiency of moral certainty, treatise
                        writers could depict the relation between demonstrative and moral certainty
                        in various ways and to various effects. In <title level="m">Essay Upon the
                            Law of Evidence </title>(1789), for instance, the jurist John Morgan
                        stresses the functional equivalence of moral and demonstrative certainty to
                        the point of identity, asking readers to accept the truth of legal testimony
                        under oath with the same confidence as if it had been demonstratively
                        proven. For Morgan, even though “human testimony, i.e. evidence given by one
                        man to another, can never produce certainty,” nonetheless, in matters where
                        a witness is under oath “[a mind] must acquiesce [to a witness’s testimony]
                        therein as from a knowledge by demonstration, because, according to the
                        nature of things, it ought not any longer to doubt, but to be nearly, if not
                        as perfectly well satisfied, as if we of ourselves knew the fact” (5).
                        Treatise writers could also stress the categorical difference of
                        demonstrative and moral certainty in an effort to reinforce the concept of
                        sufficient though incomplete evidence. This latter strategy generally
                        necessitated pathologizing the inability to perceive this difference as
                        unreasonable and irrational. Although not a legal treatise in itself, James
                        Gambier’s popular textbook on moral evidence, <title level="m">Introduction
                            to the Study of Moral Evidence</title>(1806), provides a clear and
                        representative account of how the epistemological distinction between moral
                        and demonstrative knowledge was effectively wielded to justify the normative
                        distinction between reasonable and unreasonable doubt within legal
                        epistemology and more broadly. </p>
                  <p>Gambier considers how a matter of fact can be assumed to “rise so high as to
                        exclude all reasonable doubt” while “fall[ing] short of absolute certainty”
                        (5). While he concedes that “we are often apt to expect stronger evidence,
                        than the nature of the thing [i.e. probable knowledge] admits; and, thence,
                        to feel dissatisfied, though the point be fairly proved,” he urges that we
                        should nonetheless “accustom ourselves to yield our assent” if “such
                        evidence be produced in a sufficient degree to counterbalance all that can
                        be fairly urged against it” (Gambier 93). He continues:<quote>
                            . . . [I]f in studying the evidence on any question of fact,
                            we employ ourselves in examining whether there be not a possibility that
                            it may be false, instead of considering whether there be not a
                            sufficient probability that it is true, we shall certainly raise strong
                            doubts in our minds. But, then, we should not study the subject
                            rationally. Demonstration is the only species of reasoning, which, if
                            even conducted correctly, can exclude the possibility of error. But
                            facts do not admit of demonstration. They admit of moral evidence alone.
                            The examining, therefore, into the possibility of error is inconsistent
                            with the nature of the subject, and an absurd practice. (93–94)</quote>
                        Gambier’s assertion regarding the “irrationality,” “inconsistency,” and
                        “absurdity” of fixating on the “possibility of error” with respect to moral
                        evidence was a common refrain within eighteenth-century legal epistemology.
                        The desire to attain degrees of certainty thought to exceed “reasonable
                        doubt” was generally treated in this manner as an epistemic category error,
                        a refusal to accept the basic epistemic conditions governing the evaluation
                        of matters of fact—what Gambier refers to as the “nature of the
                        thing”—rather than, say, a legitimate concern or anxiety about the limits of
                        practical judgment established by uncertainty. Indeed, it would be possible
                        to show that similar epistemological distinctions continue to organize the
                        concept of “reasonable doubt” in legal theory. For instance, in the 1850
                        case Commonwealth v. Webster still regarded by many legal theorists as the
                        most lucid attempt to define the “beyond reasonable doubt” standard,
                        Massachusetts Supreme Court Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw characterizes
                        reasonable doubt as “. . . not mere possible doubt; because every
                        thing [sic] relating to human affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is
                        open to some possible or imaginary doubt” (qtd. in Shealy 234 n. 40).</p>
                  <p>If Gambier’s account reflects a pathology of doubt developed in response to
                        the threat posed to legal judgment within rational skepticism itself, then
                        William Paley’s reflections on legal doubt in <title level="m">The
                            Principles of Political and Moral Philosophy </title> (1785) present an
                        alternative skeptical pathology developed in response to a separate
                        tradition of theological skepticism which perceived doubt as a sign of
                        uneasy conscience and, as such, recommended withholding judgment in the face
                        of any uncertainty. Unlike the rationalist pathology sketched above, which
                        focuses on reasonable expectations of certainty as informed by epistemology,
                        this alternative pathology focuses on how private concerns of conscience
                        unreasonably interfere with public and civic duties to uphold and execute
                        the law. This pathology was characterized as the “scrupulous conscience”
                        which, as Shapiro explains, was regarded as “a troubled or diseased
                        condition” of an individual “reluctant to act even after doubts had been
                        resolved” (“Changing Language” 267). Thus, Paley laments the civil
                        disservice performed by a jury member paralyzed by “an over-strained
                        scrupulousness, or weak timidity” which “holds it the part of a safe
                        conscience not to condemn any man, whilst there exists the minutest
                        possibility of his innocence” (391). For Paley, such private reservations
                        threatened the very efficacy of the legal system itself, where that efficacy
                        was conceived largely in terms of its ability to root out and convict
                        criminals despite uncertainty: “[W]hen certain rules of adjudication must be
                        persued [sic], when certain degrees of credibility must be accepted, in
                        order to reach the crimes with which the public are infested; courts of
                        justice should not be deterred from the application of these rules, by every
                        suspicion or danger, or by the mere possibility of confounding the innocent
                        with the guilty” (393). Indeed, in his 2008 study of the origins of the
                        “beyond reasonable doubt” standard, James Q. Whitman draws on this figure of
                        the “scrupulous conscience” to support his revisionist argument that the
                        standard was developed—at least at first—not to promote sound evidentiary
                        proof practices but rather to provide “moral comfort” for jury members
                        anxious about the eternal consequences of an error in uncertain, temporal
                        judgment. For Whitman, the reasonable doubt standard was “originally a
                        theological doctrine” which responded to “religiously motivated reluctance
                        to convict” (4) by “reassur[ing] jurors that they could convict the
                        defendant without risking their own salvation, so long as their doubts about
                        guilt were not ‘reasonable’” (3). In this sense, Whitman argues, the
                        standard was “not originally designed to make it more difficult for jurors
                        to convict”—as we assume it to be today—but “to make conviction easier”
                        (4).</p>
                  <p> These alternative pathologies should sufficiently demonstrate how the
                        concept of “reasonable doubt”—though ostensibly formulated as a means of
                        alleviating the problems of uncertainty—is also informed more fundamentally
                        by a conservative desire to preserve the possibility of legal judgment under
                        uncertainty against the threats posed by more radical forms of skepticism,
                        whether those threats are perceived as coming from within the rational
                        tradition itself or from outside that tradition in the form of
                        theologically-inflected skepticism. These pathologies should also illustrate
                        how the concept of “reasonable doubt” responds to this threat by normalizing
                        a circumscribed form of “reasonable” doubt that reflects these conservative
                        assumptions and, in turn, pathologizing other orientations towards
                        uncertainty that do not reflect these conservative assumptions as excessive
                        and illegitimate. With these observations, we are now in a position to
                        consider how the novel’s exploration of doubt and desire—and, more
                        precisely, doubt-as-desire –responds to this conservatism informing
                        “reasonable doubt.”</p>

                  <head>Before Skepticism: <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> and
                        Unreasonable Doubt</head>
                  <p>The novel’s insistence on the relation of doubt and desire can be read as an
                        attempt to expose how the desire to preserve the possibility of legal
                        judgment against uncertainty conditions the form of procedural, rational
                        doubt adopted by the legal system and, ultimately, circumscribes the kinds
                        of inquiry it can perform. The novel’s pessimistic depiction of the
                        inability of the legal process to, if not convict Falkland for Tyrrel’s
                        murder, at least save the Hawkinses from wrongful conviction seems
                        constructed to raise doubts about the ability of procedural doubt to
                        identify and assess risks associated with factual uncertainty or, more
                        provocatively, to achieve anything more than preserve the appearance of the
                        legitimacy of the legal process itself. In this sense, the novel asks
                        whether legal doubt is grounded, as it professes, in a desire to assess and
                        respond to the risks of uncertainty or, instead, grounded in a more basic
                        desire to preserve the possibility of legal judgment under uncertainty
                        itself. Further, the novel seems particularly invested in exposing how the
                        normative distinction between “reasonable” and “unreasonable” forms of doubt
                        does not necessarily reflect a legitimate response to the risks of
                        uncertainty but rather functions as a technique for rationalizing the legal
                        status quo. It is as if the novel’s subversive treatment of the distinction
                        between “legitimate” and “illegitimate” doubt aims to recast that
                        distinction as one between “legitimating” and “delegitimating” forms of
                        doubt. “Legitimate” doubts are “legitimating” in the sense that they operate
                        within the legal system to strengthen and legitimize the claim that it is
                        not only possible but reasonable to perform legal judgments despite
                        uncertainty, whereas “illegitimate” doubts are “delegitimating” in that they
                        threaten to undermine this claim. In this context, the desire of the legal
                        system to represent such doubts as illegitimate “in themselves” rather than
                        in relation to the organizing assumptions of the legal system becomes an
                        essential strategy for preserving and reinforcing the authority of the legal
                        system itself. The normative distinction between reasonable and unreasonable
                        forms of doubt relies, primarily, on the assumption that “unreasonable”
                        doubts threaten the legal system on account of their origins in illegitimate
                        forms of desire. But while the distinction purports to preserve the legal
                        process from the pernicious influence of desire, the novel explores the
                        chilling possibility that this distinction not only effectively
                            <emph>inscribes</emph> such unreasonable desires in the legal process
                        but also surreptitiously obscures or conceals this fact by directing
                        critical attention towards a specter of unreasonable doubt.</p>
                  <p> We can draw out these interests in the novel by considering the brief and
                        seemingly irrelevant appearance of a group of skeptics in the midst of
                        Collins’s narrative: <quote>. . . Hawkins and his son were tried,
                            condemned, and afterwards executed. In the interval between the sentence
                            and execution Hawkins confessed his guilt with many marks of
                            compunction; though there are persons by whom this is denied; but I have
                            taken some pains to enquire into the fact, and am persuaded that their
                            disbelief is precipitate and groundless. (Godwin, <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams </title>174)</quote> The passage is one of the few times
                        Collins breaks from his task of narrating the events surrounding Tyrrel’s
                        murder to perform the task of validating his narrative. It is significant
                        that this task of validation takes the specific form of a procedural
                        skeptical inquiry. Collins doubles back to review and confirm the evidence
                        for Hawkins’s confession in the face of skeptical objections, in a manner
                        that, though technically extralegal, seems intended to mirror and extend the
                        careful legal procedures performed to absolve Falkland of any involvement in
                        Tyrrel’s murder. Despite their minor presence, these skeptics function as an
                        essential feature of Collins’s skeptical investigation. They enable Collins
                        to demonstrate what Caleb calls the “uncommonly judicious” (166) nature of
                        Collins’s investigation by situating his procedural application of
                        reasonable doubt in productive contrast with a doubt that is marked,
                        explicitly by Collins and implicitly in other respects, as unreasonable. The
                        episode illustrates Collins’s willingness to entertain doubt as well as his
                        willingness to assess and dismiss it on rational grounds: Collins does not
                        dismiss the disbelievers reflexively but only after he has “taken some pains
                        to enquire into the fact” and is “persuaded” that their doubts are
                        “precipitate and groundless.” The figure capitalizes further on the
                        suggestive contrast established between Collins’s dynamic performance of a
                        procedural doubt and the skeptics’ static doubt and, likewise, between
                        Collins’s singularity and the skeptics’ collectivity. It is not just
                        Collins’s independent inquiry but his very independence of mind that is set
                        in relief with the mob-like collective judgment of the skeptics. This is
                        true even as Collins’s performance of intellectual autonomy manages to
                        disable the reader’s own critical capacities by omitting any specific
                        content that readers might use to perform their own assessments of these
                        skeptical doubts. The skeptics, along with the nature of their reservations,
                        remain unnamed (do they deny that Hawkins ever confessed or that he was ever
                        guilty, or both?). They are a stage prop in Collins’s performance of
                        reasonableness, a rhetorical <emph>aporia </emph> that allows Collins to
                        acknowledge and then authoritatively dismiss any doubt about the legitimacy
                        of Hawkins’s execution.</p>
                  <p>The episode should sufficiently illustrate the novel’s explicit interest in
                        what I will refer to as the “rhetoric of reasonableness” deployed by
                        constructive skepticism. And, similarly, observing the interpretive
                        instability of this episode as the novel progresses should illustrate how
                        the novel wields irony to undermine the authority of this rhetoric. Of
                        course, whatever authority the reader grants Collins will be largely
                        undermined by his later revelation that his judgment of the case had been
                        influenced by his fear of retribution from Falkland and, more to the point,
                        his desire to preserve the moral distinctions that the uncertainties of the
                        case threaten to disrupt. “If you could change all my ideas, and show me
                        that there was no criterion by which vice might be prevented from being
                        mistaken for virtue,” he asks Caleb, “what benefit would arise from that?”
                        (Godwin, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>16). The question could be
                        taken as the novel’s most concentrated expression of the conservative
                        impulse I have been examining, and it affords a suggestive glimpse into how
                        the desire to preserve the possibility of legal judgment under uncertainty
                        is suffused with an anxiety about the consequences of its impossibility. In
                        this light, legal doubt emerges as a form of suspense that anxiously
                        anticipates its ability not to account for uncertainty but to overcome it. </p>
                  <p>But, Collins’s revelation aside, it is also true that his rhetorical
                        deployment of the skeptics never quite behaves the way he intends. And the
                        unruliness of the rhetorical figure itself suggests how, in the final
                        analysis, the real instabilities and risks that attend uncertainty defy the
                        efforts of constructive skepticism to contain them. Collins’s effort to
                        validate his narrative raises suspicions about why it must be validated in
                        the first place. Collins introduces the skeptics as a way of closing down
                        the question of Hawkins’s confession, but they eventually mark the very
                        rupture in Collins’s narrative Caleb will fixate on when formulating his own
                        doubts about Hawkins’s guilt and Falkland’s innocence. Collins presumably
                        omits the skeptics’ specific objections from his narrative because he
                        believes they have no rational basis. Yet, in the light of Hawkins’s
                        innocence, this omission seems to demand that readers acknowledge the
                        ethical merit of the skeptics’ doubts <emph>prior to </emph>and even
                            <emph>despite </emph> any consideration of their rational basis.
                        Similarly, the skeptics’ plurality, which at first appeared to be a sign of
                        their intellectual slavishness, becomes a sign of their intellectual and
                        moral resolve—especially once we take into account that they are essentially
                        the only collective body figured in the novel not under the absolute sway
                            of<emph> some social </emph>superior. All told, by the novel’s end, the
                        figure’s rhetorical function seems to shift from <emph>aporia </emph>to
                            <emph>exempla</emph>, in what amounts to an ironic inversion of that
                        religious genre’s tendency to introduce skeptics as counterexamples whose
                        disbelief and its miserable consequences are meant to redouble the faith of
                        both reader and author. In this inversion, “unreasonable” doubt as it is
                        defined by constructive skepticism stands out as the only reasonable and
                        ethical response to the risks of uncertainty.</p>
                  <p>The critique I have developed from Collins’s episode with the skeptics should
                        clarify the novel’s deep skepticism regarding the legal concept of
                        reasonable doubt, the rhetoric of reasonableness it deploys, and the
                        conservative desires that inform it. Yet, as much as Collins’s episode with
                        the skeptics clarifies about the novel’s interest in “unreasonable” doubt as
                        a negative response to “reasonable doubt,” it risks giving the false
                        impression that this response can be neatly, clearly, or completely
                        articulated by this critique. On the contrary, this critique seems to be
                        only a side effect of a much more disruptive form of negativity pursued by
                        the novel, one which ultimately muddies whatever critical or ethical clarity
                        I have drawn from the ironies above. In fact, it is arguably even misleading
                        to characterize the effects of the novel’s negativity as “critique,” since
                        the procedure of rational critique we have inherited from the eighteenth
                        century is animated by the very same spirit of constructive skepticism the
                        novel calls into question. To see this, simply consider that Kant’s critical
                        project, although typically framed as an idealist response to Hume’s
                        skeptical empiricism, is no less a variety of skepticism itself, one that is
                        distinctively conservative and therapeutic.<note place="foot">After all,
                            Kant’s aim is to reassure us that we can remain confident in our ability
                            to employ our rational faculties to attain reliable knowledge about the
                            phenomenal world of appearances as long as we accept our inability to
                            know the world beyond appearances, in itself, as noumena. The formal
                            parallels between Kant’s distinction between phenomena and noumena and
                            the constructive skeptical distinction between moral and demonstrative
                            certainty should be evident, as should be Kant’s parallel use of this
                            distinction to justify judgment under uncertainty. Even the very
                            tendency to contrast Kant’s critical project against Hume’s “radical”
                            project reproduces precisely the same rhetoric I have identified with
                            constructive skepticism above. And even though the exploratory and
                            experimental nature of Hume’s skeptical philosophy affords many
                            productive loose ends that may be pursued to more radical skeptical
                            conclusions, Hume’s systematic project appears no less informed by
                            constructive skepticism than Kant’s. Indeed, if we accept at face value
                            Hume’s rejection of absolute or “academic” skepticism and his acceptance
                            of a category of uncertain but indisputable knowledge (what Hume calls
                            “proofs” as opposed to certain “demonstrations” or disputable
                            “probabilities”), it seems plausible to suggest that no philosophical
                            critique endemic to the eighteenth century remains untouched by the
                            spirit of constructive skepticism.</note>This is an observation I will
                        return to at the essay’s conclusion when I consider how the negativity
                            <title level="m">Caleb Williams </title> pursues suggests a much
                        different understanding of Romanticism’s relation to skepticism than the one
                        proposed by Stanley Cavell in his well-known account of Romanticism as a
                        “response” to Kant’s settlement with epistemological skepticism.</p>
                  <p>If it is misleading to characterize the novel’s negativity as critique, it is
                        similarly misleading to characterize it as a form of skepticism itself, even
                        as the novel’s negativity takes doubt both as its central instrument and
                        object of inquiry. This is because the force of novel’s negativity seems to
                        originate in its exploration of doubt as it exists <emph>before </emph>it
                        hardens or stabilizes into skepticism. Indeed, the novel seems to resist any
                        conflation of skepticism and doubt in an effort to preserve the unruly
                        aspects of doubt that get lost once doubt is disciplined by skepticism. That
                        is, if skepticism can be characterized as a directed, instrumental
                        application of doubt to specific intellectual or epistemic problems, then I
                        would argue that the novel <emph>pursues</emph> a form of doubt that lacks
                        this instrumentality or directedness: a form of doubt that is inchoate,
                        marked by affective excess rather than intellectual restraint, hot rather
                        than cold.<note place="foot">Indeed, in his essayistic treatments of belief
                            and doubt, Godwin does attempt to inject desire into rational
                            skepticism, and briefly surveying the problems he encounters should
                            illustrate how rational skepticism cannot accommodate the examination of
                            doubt and desire the novel pursues. In “Essay of Skepticism,” for
                            instance, Godwin works against the common assumption that skepticism
                            must be “necessarily allied to coldness of character” and insists
                            instead that skeptical inquiry must be imbued with an “ardour and
                            animation” located between cold “indifference” and overheated
                            “enthusiasm” (308). Even as the skeptic must be “careful not to suffer a
                            predilection for one side of a question” (302) he is nonetheless “by no
                            means inclined to hold himself in a state of equal indifference to all
                            opinions” (304). Yet, Godwin seems well aware of problems of asserting
                            the influence of interest or passion into rational skepticism in this
                            way, a fact which comes through in his more downbeat essay, “On Belief.”
                            There, the disinterested procedure posed as an ideal by skepticism seems
                            to be inevitably thwarted by an insidious will to believe. For while
                            Godwin insists that “we must be, at all times, and to the last hour of
                            our existence, accessible to conviction built upon new evidence” (247)
                            he also admits that when considering any consequential issue there
                            appears to be “ever a secret influence urging me earnestly to desire to
                            find one side of the question right and the other wrong” (249) and that
                            “[t]hat which we wish to believe, we are already greatly in progress to
                            embrace” (249).</note> In the episode above, Collins refers to the
                        skeptics’ doubt as “groundless” in the sense of lacking rational grounds,
                        but it is better to characterize the doubt I am describing as the affective
                        ground from which skeptical doubt draws its critical energies, the raw
                        doubt-as-desire that skepticism refines and harnesses. Here it should be
                        clear that I have effectively described the character of Caleb’s doubt. It
                        should also be evident that the destabilizing effects achieved by the novel
                        will emanate from the unreasonableness of Caleb’s doubt-as-desire. In any
                        case, these effects seem too ambivalent to constitute anything like a
                        skeptical program. They faithfully reproduce the doubt and uncertainty from
                        which they originate.</p>
                  <p>These negative definitions of the novel’s negativity should provide a
                            <emph>sense of just </emph>how far the novel must depart from our usual
                        understanding of the forms negativity can take so that it may arrive in
                        uncharted waters or, as Godwin famously declared, “launch [readers] upon a
                        sea of moral and political inquiry” (<title level="m">Caleb Williams
                        </title>451). However, we can begin to sketch out a positive account of the
                        novel’s negativity by first identifying the ways that Caleb’s doubt does
                        appear to accord with the critique of “reasonable doubt” I have developed
                        from the passage above. Once we have pursued this accord to its limit, we
                        can then consider how the unreasonableness of Caleb’s doubt necessarily
                        points beyond this critique. </p>
                  <p>In light of the legal epistemology I have sketched, we might argue that
                        Caleb’s tendency to understand his doubt primarily as a form of
                        curiosity—one that is excessive, unproductive, and idiosyncratic or, in
                        Caleb’s terms, “ungoverned,” “infantine,” and “unreasonable” (Godwin, <title level="m">Caleb Williams </title>212, 224)—reflects the extent to which
                        Caleb has internalized the normative distinction between reasonable and
                        unreasonable doubt as means for assessing the ethical merit (or lack
                        thereof) of his doubt. Indeed, Caleb consistently weighs his skeptical
                        disposition against an internalized sense of what a reasonable person would
                        or would not doubt. He continually seeks—and fails—to find what he would
                        consider to be rational grounds to justify his dissatisfaction with
                        Collins’s narrative. Caleb doubts Hawkins’s guilt even as Hawkins’s alleged
                        confession makes him feel “there was no longer a possibility of doubting”
                        (180); he pursues his suspicions about Falkland even as “could find nothing
                        that [he] could consider as justifying [him] in persisting in the shadow of
                        a doubt” (198) about Falkland’s innocence. In this way, Caleb anxiously
                        observes the distance between his doubt as it is and his sense of what it
                        should be.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Caleb’s internalization of these norms helps explain, to some
                        extent, his inability to attribute <emph>any</emph> ethical value to his
                        doubt, despite the many opportunities he has to reassess or qualify its
                        value in light of new evidence. Falkland confesses his guilt, Collins
                        reveals his narrative to have been compromised by political and practical
                        concerns, but Caleb only grows more certain of the unethical and
                        pathological nature of his own doubt. In his retrospective attempt to
                        “divid[e] . . . the offensive [and] defensive” (212) parts of his
                        actions, he ends up condemning all his behavior leading up to Falkland’s
                        confession. By the novel’s conclusion, Caleb has even rejected this division
                        and remains saddled with a sense of guilt many critics have found to be,
                        like his curiosity, excessive and inexplicable. Yet, on this reading, any
                        dissatisfaction a reader might have with Caleb’s inability to recover any
                        ethical merit in his actions or with the excessive sense of guilt that
                        results from this inability should ultimately resolve into a dissatisfaction
                        with the normative assumptions that enable Caleb to misread his doubt in
                        this way. Caleb’s conversations later in the novel with Collins and
                        Laura—both of whom reinforce this misreading—seem designed in part to
                        exacerbate this sense of dissatisfaction. And, in this way, the novel
                        recovers the ethical potential of Caleb’s doubt while also sowing discontent
                        with institutional efforts to obscure or discredit that ethical potential. </p>
                  <p>Approaching Caleb’s doubt in this recuperative manner illustrates how the
                        novel’s negativity carries forward the deconstructive project Godwin pursues
                        against political institutions in <title level="m">An Enquiry to Political
                            Justice </title>(1793). In that work we find Godwin similarly invested
                        in exposing the various techniques political institutions deploy to
                        condition private acts of judgment so they reflect and reinforce the
                        organizing assumptions of the institutions themselves. Caleb’s mistaken
                        dismissal of his doubt as idiosyncratic and his consequent inability to
                        perceive its ethical and political potential exemplifies the pernicious
                        effects of what Godwin attacks in the <title level="m">Enquiry </title>as
                        the attempt to distinguish between public and private spheres of judgment,
                        or, in Godwin’s terms, between “conduct in civil concerns” in which positive
                        institutions “may properly interfere” and “matters of conscience” in which
                        “positive institutions ought to leave me personally free” (<title level="m">Political Justice </title>75). For Godwin, while such distinctions
                        might appear to establish an autonomous sphere where ethical considerations
                        preside independently from political interests, their ultimate effect is to
                        consolidate institutional power against the disruptive ethical and political
                        potential of conscience. And it is notable that, for Godwin, the tension an
                        individual feels between the responsibilities dictated by private judgment
                        and those dictated by institutions often manifests as doubt: an individual’s
                        desire to “believe what is dictated to them” by institutions is frustrated
                        by the absence of “that in which belief consists, evidence and conviction”
                        (368), resulting in “a perpetual dissatisfaction” (368) which speaks to the
                        “execrable tyranny” (368) of any attempt to coerce private judgment.<note place="foot">Moreover, Godwin’s specific critique of legal institutions
                            in the <title level="m">Enquiry </title>involves recovering and
                            elaborating the radical ethical implications of the “imperfection” or
                            “uncertainty” of evidence (Godwin <title level="m">Political Justice
                            </title>381, 401). For Godwin, since “[n]o principles of evidence have
                            yet been laid down that are infallible” (78), the “veracity” and
                            “competence” of witnesses as accurate and just observers must be subject
                            to “continual doubt” (381). </note> Caleb’s doubt thus has the effect of
                        both exemplifying this dissatisfaction for and generating this
                        dissatisfaction within the reader.</p>
                  <p>Although the novel’s negative project aligns with the deconstructive project
                        of the <title level="m">Enquiry </title> in this general sense, the novel’s
                        insistence that the procedural skepticism adopted within rational inquiry
                        itself constitutes a form of institutionality that compromises private
                        judgment illustrates how the novel manages to extend the <title level="m">Enquiry</title>’s project beyond the limits imposed by its own
                        commitment to rationalism. To be sure, throughout the <title level="m">Enquiry </title> Godwin is concerned with preserving the autonomy of
                        private judgment against the impositions of institutional norms. Yet Godwin
                        also places great faith in the assumption that reason always functions in
                        accord with individual conscience, as an instrument and not an impediment to
                        the unbiased exercise of private judgment. It is a faith that originates in
                        Godwin’s appreciation for the dynamic and progressive nature of rational
                        inquiry, which he characteristically contrasts to the stagnancy of custom
                        and dogma. “Refer [people] to reading, to conversation, to meditation,”
                        Godwin writes, “but teach them neither creeds nor catechisms, either moral
                        or political” (352). Indeed, it is in this spirit that Godwin deploys a
                        rhetoric of reasonableness throughout the <title level="m">Enquiry</title>
                        to punctuate his own exercises in private, rational judgment. But this
                        assumption regarding the natural alignment of reason and conscience also
                        blinds the <title level="m">Enquiry</title> to how a rhetoric of
                        reasonableness might be deployed <emph>against</emph> conscience as it
                        manifests in “private” doubt or how such a rhetoric might be wielded to
                        close down, rather than open up, rational inquiry. Yet, this is precisely
                        how Collins (or Paley) deploys such rhetoric. Likewise, these are the
                        rhetorical and ideological effects that Caleb must resist to pursue his own
                        unreasonable doubt. In this respect, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                        could be said to turn the <title level="m">Enquiry</title>’s deconstructive
                        project on the latent threat of dogmatism posed by the rhetoric of
                        reasonableness that treatise employs.</p>
                  <p> So far I have approached Caleb’s unreasonable doubt with the assumption that
                        it aligns with and reinforces the critique of reasonable doubt I have teased
                        out of the novel’s ironic treatment of Collins’s rhetoric of reasonableness.
                        On this assumption, the novel would appear to stage a coordinated critique
                        of the legal system that mobilizes doubt and irony to undermine the
                        legitimacy of the circumscribed form of doubt that system normalizes in an
                        effort to preserve its own legitimacy. From this perspective, the novel’s
                        critique of reasonable doubt also appears to align with—and extend in
                        striking and productive ways—the deconstructive project pursued in Godwin’s
                            <title level="m">Enquiry</title>. This is a satisfying and neat
                        interpretation of the novel’s interest in unreasonable doubt. But it also
                        helps clarify why Caleb’s doubt <emph>cannot </emph>be perceived as
                        ethically viable and must instead be regarded as “unreasonable” in ways that
                        exceed the ideological distortions created by the normative account of
                        reasonable doubt. For, on this reading, Caleb’s doubt, although wrongly
                        dismissed by the legal system and even by Caleb itself on the basis of its
                        private and pathological nature, nonetheless appears to emerge as a viable
                        ethical orientation to the problem of judgment under uncertainty. Yet, the
                        novel’s interest in unreasonable doubt does not seem to be how unreasonable
                        doubt might <emph>replace</emph> the circumscribed form of “reasonable
                        doubt” adopted within legal theory as, say, a more adequate response to the
                        risks of judgment under uncertainty. Rather, the novel’s interest lies in
                        how Caleb’s unreasonable doubt reveals the fundamental interestedness of all
                        doubt—that is, how all doubt is grounded in desire—in a way that calls into
                        question the viability of doubt as a disinterested ground for legal
                        judgment. This point is succinctly captured in a central ethical paradox
                        that frustrates any recuperative reading of Caleb’s doubt: as readers, we
                        have no way of knowing that Caleb’s doubts about Falkland are justified
                        until he confirms this fact through evidently unjustifiable means. Any
                        attempt to assert the ethical viability of Caleb’s doubt requires condoning
                        the perverse psychological torture he performs on Falkland to confirm his
                        suspicions. Caleb may not be as guilty as he believes, but he is hardly
                        innocent. Further, this ambivalence gestures towards the insufficiency of
                        the categories of guilt and innocence to capture Caleb’s moral predicament. </p>
                  <p>While many critics have been puzzled by Caleb’s excessive sense of guilt at
                        the novel’s end, there has been little debate that Caleb’s suspicions
                        towards Falkland at the beginning of the novel are ethically problematic in
                        ways that the reading of Caleb’s doubt I have pursued above cannot
                        adequately address. For where I have read Caleb’s tendency to understand his
                        doubt as curiosity to be, in some respect, an ideological mechanism that
                        misrepresents an ethical response as a pathological one, other critics have
                        persuasively interpreted Caleb’s curiosity to be a symptom of other inchoate
                        forms of desire. Some critics, for instance, have argued that Caleb’s
                        curiosity masks a political desire to wield the knowledge of Falkland’s
                        secret crimes against him as a means to achieve political power and
                            equality.<note place="foot">See, for instance, Handwerk 951–53, which
                            also persuasively argues that Caleb’s guilt reflects Caleb’s inability
                            to recontextualize, and thus rationalize, his own actions within an
                            ideological framework in the same way he can Falkland’s at the end of
                            the published version of the novel.</note> Others have seen Caleb’s
                        compulsive curiosity as a symptom of his unspeakable homosocial desire for
                            Falkland.<note place="foot"> See Gold, “It’s Only Love;” Corber,
                            “Representing the ‘Unspeakable;’” and Sedgwick 116–17. </note> Caleb
                        himself at one point proposes the compelling explanation that his excessive,
                        suspicious reading of Falkland’s behavior amounts to a symptom of his early
                        habit of reading romances, in what amounts to a suggestive gesture towards
                        the relation between paranoia and the experience of plottedness that several
                        critics have since explored in other contexts (<title level="m">Caleb
                            Williams </title>60).<note place="foot">For instance, see Jesse
                            Molesworth’s recent discussion in <title level="m">Chance and the
                                Eighteenth-Century Novel </title>of the novel as a “weapon against
                            Enlightenment” that fosters the illogical and excessive expectations
                            about the causal and teleological shape of everyday experience
                            (Molesworth 6–7).</note> On one hand, the viability and mutual
                        compatibility of these different interpretations should attest to the
                        overdetermined nature of Caleb’s doubt; this interpretative excess could be
                        said to simply reproduce the affective excesses that condition Caleb’s
                        doubt. On the other hand, although this interpretative excess appears to
                        present several competing or complementary desires “motivating” Caleb’s
                        doubt, it also attests more fundamentally to the indeterminate nature of
                        Caleb’s doubt—that is, its lack of clear motive, interest, or aim. It is as
                        if Caleb’s doubt radiates interestedness even as it does not display
                        interestedness in any of its recognizable forms. The fact that no single
                        interpretation of his curiosity feels any more viable than the other
                        confirms this indeterminacy. And this observation lends some credence to
                        Caleb’s tendency to characterize his curiosity as immature and inexplicable
                        instead of sinister or malicious. Indeed, even as critics have perceived
                        something much more sinister behind his treatment of Falkland than
                        “curiosity” can address, they have rarely suggested that Caleb is conscious
                        of or consciously concealing the desires that motivate his curiosity.
                        Instead, it is much more common to read Caleb as a victim of his repressed
                        desires or other ideological mechanisms.<note place="foot">For instance,
                            Gold and Handwerk pursue their ideological readings explicitly against
                            the assumption that Caleb’s behavior can be attributed to personal
                            idiosyncrasy or pathology. Even Uphaus, who objects to reading Caleb’s
                            behavior in terms of the “corrupting influences of social and political
                            institutions” (279), nonetheless mitigates Caleb’s agency by asserting
                            that “Caleb’s curiosity is not entirely governed by conscious control:
                            his instincts exceed his control and always drive him forward” (282).
                        </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Rather than attempting to ascribe some specific motive or desire to Caleb’s
                        doubt, it seems more productive to consider how the indeterminate nature of
                        Caleb’s desire itself generates an irresistible but problematic urge in the
                        reader to doubt his motivations even as Caleb’s desires remain inaccessible.
                        Of course, as I have already suggested, this lingering dissatisfaction with
                        Caleb’s doubt is important in itself for the way that it disrupts any moral
                        or ethical certainties that might potentially be inferred from Caleb’s act
                        of discovering Falkland’s guilt. Even though, against the background of the
                        ineffective and compromised procedural doubt of the legal institution,
                        Caleb’s doubt somehow emerges as a <emph>more</emph> ethical response to
                        judgment under uncertainty, the reader’s sense that Caleb’s doubt is
                        grounded in illegitimate desire—which remains even after Falkland
                        confesses—makes it difficult to attribute any ethical or legal value to his
                        discovery. The ethical dilemma manages to exceed the mutually exclusive
                        logic of ethical judgment in a way that evacuates it of its meaning. In this
                        context it seems possible to say that Caleb’s doubt is somehow unethical yet
                        ethical, but to say this is to say nothing at all about Caleb’s doubt.
                        Instead, it is to demonstrate the insufficiency of these categories
                        themselves to respond to the complexity introduced by uncertainty. But it
                        seems equally important that this dissatisfaction—that is, the reader’s
                        conviction that Caleb’s doubt is somehow motivated by illegitimate
                        desire—remains even as the reader has no means of resolving the
                        indeterminacy surrounding Caleb’s doubt-as-desire, no means of confirming
                        this suspicion. It reflects the extent to which the reader’s doubt is itself
                        unreasonable, propelled but also compromised by the desire to judge Caleb’s
                        actions finally as ethical or unethical, interested or disinterested. In
                        this way, the novel embraces the ethical dilemma presented by Caleb’s doubt
                        as a productive site of negativity and exploits it to sow a more fundamental
                        doubt about the legitimacy of ethical judgments, one captured in Caleb’s own
                        progressive dissatisfaction with his former belief that innocence and guilt
                        were “things in the whole world most opposite to each other” (243) as he
                        discovers that such a belief is “impossible . . . to hold” once
                        one is “conversant with the passions and institutions of men” (404).</p>

                  <head>Coda: Romantic Doubt</head>
                  <p> While the striking deconstruction of eighteenth-century constructive
                        skepticism <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> performs seems to be only
                        a by-product of the novel’s more ambitious pursuit of the destabilizing
                        excesses of negativity, the presence and precision of that critique suggest
                        the potential for reading the form of doubt the novel recovers—what I have
                        characterized as doubt “before skepticism”—as a specifically “Romantic” form
                        of doubt that constitutes, to some extent, a Romantic reaction to the
                        conservative and constructive character of eighteenth-century rational
                        skepticism. By characterizing this Romantic doubt as a “reaction” to
                        skepticism in this way, I expect readers to hear echoes of Stanley Cavell’s
                        interpretation of Romanticism as a response to Kant’s “settlement” with
                        skepticism. But, by recalling Cavell, my aim is also to demonstrate how this
                        form of Romantic doubt offers a significant challenge to Cavell’s thesis
                        and, further, reveals Cavell’s own conservative tendencies. </p>
                  <p> To draw out this challenge, I want to focus on the way that Cavell
                        constricts or limits the possible forms that any Romantic “reaction” to—and,
                        particularly, <emph>against</emph>—Kant’s settlement with skepticism might
                        take. Cavell imagines the Romantic response to Kant’s settlement to have two
                        faces. One face, which Cavell calls “avoidance,” registers a fundamental
                        dissatisfaction with the limits Kant places on our ability to access the
                        thing-in-itself, while the other, which Cavell calls “acknowledgment,”
                        accepts the validity of and stability afforded by Kant’s limits on
                        knowledge. In one sense, Cavell sees these twin reactions as dynamically
                        constructed and mutually reinforcing: the Romantic “simultaneously craves
                        [the] comfort [of Kant’s idea of limitation] and crave[s] escape from its
                        comfort . . . as if the one stance produced the wish for the
                        other” (32). But, in another, Cavell sees them as a two-phase progression
                        that amounts to a maturation. While Cavell empathizes with the Romantic
                        response of “avoidance” (“You don’t—do you?—have to be a romantic to feel
                        sometimes about that settlement: Thanks for nothing” [31]), it is evident
                        that Cavell regards “acknowledgement” as the more productive, mature, and
                        theoretically interesting response. For whereas the strategy of avoidance
                        entails for Cavell pursuing the idle Romantic fantasies of animism and
                        solitude, the strategy of acknowledgement sets to the responsible tasks of
                        accepting and adjusting to the hard limits established by language as a
                        social form and, further, of working within these confines to remake and
                        contribute to (ordinary) language so that it reflects common interests and
                        desires. </p>
                  <p>Cavell’s preferred project of acknowledgement and adjustment continues to
                        influence approaches to Romanticism in ways that testify to its critical
                        sophistication and potential. <note place="foot">For a recent study informed
                            by Cavell’s project of acknowledgment and adjustment, see Nersessian,
                                <title level="m">Utopia, Limited: Romanticism and
                            Adjustment</title>.</note> But one issue with Cavell’s interpretation is
                        that, because he ultimately accepts the philosophical authority of Kant’s
                        settlement—he refers to it as “the most stable philosophical settlement in
                        the modern period” (31)—Cavell has a fairly limited conception of what
                        rejecting Kant’s settlement might entail. And he assumes, ultimately, that
                        Kant’s settlement sets the conditions for any response to it. Cavell’s
                        strategy of avoidance may have the Romantic reject the terms of Kant’s
                        settlement, but only after she has accepted Kant’s characterization of the
                        problem of knowledge as valid and authoritative (if only to overcome it on
                        his terms). Yet, the negativity I have explored in this essay points us to
                        an alternative form the Romantic rejection of Kant’s settlement might take.
                        In this form, the Romantic’s dissatisfaction with Kant lies not with the
                        ways Kant’s limit cordons off certain knowledge or denies transcendence but
                        in the way that Kant’s settlement misrepresents the nature or extent of the
                        threat to judgment posed by uncertainty. Romantic doubt, as informed by
                        negativity, does not reject Kant’s limits themselves but rather rejects the
                        false comfort with uncertainty and false confidence in our ability to
                        overcome its threat that those limits promote. Instead, Romantic doubt would
                        cultivate a discomfort with the risks uncertainty poses and sow doubt about
                        our ability to overcome or even know them. Romantic doubt is the “awful
                        doubt” (Shelley 77) of Shelley’s “Mont Blanc” that an unflinching view of
                        Nature as mystery recommends: a sense of doubt that is informed by an awe of
                        uncertainty, that stands in opposition to the mild “faith” in our ability to
                        reconcile ourselves with uncertainty through positive means, and that “but
                        for such faith” would achieve this (negative) reconciliation and likewise
                        “. . . repeal / Large codes of fraud and woe” (80–81). The
                        discontent with “moral certainty” Romantic doubt names clarifies the
                        political and ethical charge of Keats’s formulation of negative capability
                        as “being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
                        reaching after fact and reason” (492). From the perspective of Romantic
                        doubt, Keats’s negative capability does not recommend relinquishing our
                        desire for absolute certainty or cultivating an ease with uncertainty.
                        Rather, it cautions against the “irritable,” false comfort that follows from
                        believing that we can conquer uncertainty through constructions of fact and
                        reason. It is a reminder that even to reach for fact or reason is to
                        underestimate the threat of uncertainty since our desire to overcome that
                        threat always threatens to persuade us we already have.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay proposes a reinterpretation of Charlotte Smith’s role
                    in the romantic sonnet revival. It argues, against the predominant trend in
                    Smith criticism, that <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> is a
                    counter-sentimental work. Smith’s primary innovation in the sonnet form was a
                    particular way of using its “turn” function to dissociate the lyric subject from
                    an unsatisfying reality. This gesture—the “negative turn”—occurs throughout the
                    many editions of <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>. Emphasizing this
                    aspect of Smith’s sonnets prepares the ground for a hypothesis about her
                    influence on subsequent generations of poets: similar rhetorical devices can be
                    found in works by Cowper, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats. The
                    phenomenological efficacy of the “negative turn,” in Smith and other poets, can
                    be usefully described via D. W. Winnicott’s psychoanalytic argument for a “right
                    not to communicate.” Smith’s sonnets invoke this right, and provide a crucial
                    poetic technique for dissociating from the coercive facticity of an unsatisfying
                    reality. </p>

                  <p>In the brief essay on the sonnet included in his 1797 <title level="m">Poems</title>, Samuel Taylor Coleridge nods to William Bowles and
                        Charlotte Smith as “they who first made [the sonnet] popular.” Coleridge
                        offers a brief genre-theory of the sonnet, beginning by describing it as “a
                        small poem, in which some lonely feeling is developed” (<title level="m">Poems </title>71). As any reader of Smith’s sonnets would attest, so
                        far so good. Coleridge elaborates: <quote>In a Sonnet then we require a
                            development of some lonely feeling, by whatever cause it may have been
                            excited; but those Sonnets appear to me the most exquisite, in which
                            moral Sentiments, Affections, or Feelings, are deduced from, and
                            associated with, the scenery of Nature. Such compositions generate a
                            habit of thought highly favourable to delicacy of character. They create
                            a sweet and indissoluble union between the intellectual and material
                            world. (<title level="m">Poems </title>72)</quote> I want to argue that
                        it is precisely this “sweet and indissoluble union” between inner and outer
                        worlds that that Smith’s sonnets fail to achieve—or, perhaps,
                        programmatically evade. Coleridge, famously, championed Bowles rather than
                        Smith, despite the latter’s arguably greater prominence in the 1790s. The
                        impulses that Coleridge derived from Bowles, as W. K. Wimsatt and M. H.
                        Abrams both seminally argued, allowed him to develop an intricate form of
                        lyric coordination between the inner and the outer. The best of Smith’s
                        sonnets, in stark contrast, use the form to maintain subjectivity as an
                        unarticulated space that withdraws from lived experience, in a kind of
                        refusal of the dialectical imperative to integrate mind with nature.
                        Coleridge’s preference for Bowles over Smith, then, may be historically
                        significant in ways that we have not fully appreciated. In fact, criticism
                        since Abrams has given us ample reason to regard this preference as a
                        defensive one. That is, it has led us to suspect that Coleridgean lyrics,
                        and Romantic lyrics in general, are not able to effect the “sweet and
                        indissoluble union” between mind and world that they aim at.<note place="foot">This post-Abramsian development might be divided, for
                            heuristic purposes, into at least three strains: a De Manian line
                            (positing that the Romantic lyric’s very materials, language and image,
                            irrevocably alienate it from the reality it seeks to attune itself to)
                            as in the work of Tilottama Rajan (204–59); a
                            phenomenologically-inflected line (positing the abyssal intractability
                            of the inner world that lyric tries to align with the outer), as in the
                            work of Geoffrey Hartman; and a historicist line (positing that lyric
                            attains subjective-objective closure only by excluding historical
                            processes), as in the work of Marjorie Levinson and Jerome McGann
                                (<title level="m">Romantic Ideology</title>). Each of these lines
                            was in place well before scholars began to seriously read Smith, and she
                            therefore is largely or entirely absent from the seminal
                            arguments.</note> While criticism has demonstrated the intricate
                        varieties of failure, dissociation, and loss in Smith’s successors, Smith
                        herself has largely remained confined, within literary historiography, to a
                        late eighteenth-century tradition of sentimental women’s writing. What
                        follows is an attempt to dispute this classification, and to claim Smith for
                        a Romantic tradition of lyric negativity.<note place="foot">Throughout this
                            paper, I assume, along with Coleridge, that there is a recognizable form
                            of poetry that concerns itself with procedures of “deduction” and
                            “association” “between the intellectual and material world,” of
                            attunement between subjectivity and its external objects. The consensus
                            that this form of poetry self-evidently exists and is called “lyric” has
                            recently been shaken (Jackson; Culler). While I am unable to address
                            this important and productive controversy in this paper, it does seem to
                            me that retaining “lyric subjectivity” as a plausible analytic category
                            allows one to describe currents in Smith’s poetry that a historicist
                            approach might miss. In Smith’s particular case, I find the (solid)
                            historicist conclusion that Smith’s work can be understood within the
                            late eighteenth-century “culture of sensibility” to be inadequate, for
                            reasons I will try to describe below.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> In recent decades, Smith’s place within the Romantic canon has seemed
                        increasingly secure. This security has been afforded, in large part, by an
                        emerging understanding of her singularly influential role in the Romantic
                        sonnet revival. My aim here is to contribute to this consensus, but also to
                        argue that we have yet to fully grasp the nature of Smith’s innovations in
                        the form. Smith’s recuperation of the sonnet, I will argue, should be
                        understood as motivated by her discovery of a certain way of using the
                        resources of the form to articulate a gesture of affective dissociation and
                        phenomenal withdrawal from the world. I will call this gesture the “negative
                        turn.” The negative turn invests Smith’s <title level="m">Elegiac
                            Sonnets</title> (1784) with a certain silence or reserve that is central
                        to the affective contours of the poetry. It is a phenomenological gesture,
                        but also first and foremost a technical procedure, a certain way of using
                        the sonnet’s “turn” or <foreign>volta</foreign> function. The most
                        technically accomplished and interesting of Smith’s sonnets utilize this
                        device to construct a mode of address that disarticulates the subject from
                        its environment. They stabilize subjectivity in relation to a world that is
                        hostile, demanding, or bewildering, and do so not by a gesture of mastery,
                        but of disengagement. This distinctively Smithean<note place="foot">
                            Throughout, I use the term “Smithean” to refer to Charlotte and not, as
                            is customary, Adam. It may come to seem ironic that the most
                            accomplished theorist of interpersonal sentimental transaction shares an
                            adjective with the inventor of the negative turn.</note> gesture of
                        phenomenal withdrawal, I want to suggest, casts a longer shadow over Smith’s

                        has often been assumed, and sometimes argued, that she was something called
                        a Sentimental Poetess.<note place="foot">Virginia Jackson and Yopie Prins
                            helpfully describe the importance of this figure (the Poetess) in the
                            “lyricization” of Romantic and Victorian poetry. Without necessarily
                            concurring with their claims for the historical specificity of the lyric
                            mode, I share their dissatisfaction with the way in which the figure of
                            the Poetess has been adopted in our reception of women’s writing, very
                            especially in the case of Smith.</note> Her work has been pointed to,
                        accordingly, as a substantiation of the link between high Romanticism and
                        the eighteenth-century culture of sensibility (McGann, <title level="m">Poetics of Sensibility</title>; Nagle; Özdemir).<note place="foot"> A
                            subtle and interesting variant of this argument can be found in both
                            Adela Pinch and Jacqueline Labbe’s work on Smith. While both scholars
                            essentially situate Smith within a tradition of sentimental women’s
                            writing, they also argue for the essential artificiality or
                            impersonality of sentimental conventions (Pinch; Labbe, <title level="m">Charlotte Smith</title>).</note> If we read Smith’s sonnets for
                        their diction and rhetoric, there is a great deal to be said for this claim.
                        If we turn to the underlying lyric structure of the sonnets, however,
                        something deeply counter-sentimental in Smith’s writing emerges—which is to
                        say, something predicated on a lack of sensibility and responsiveness to
                        social and natural worlds. Many critics of the sonnets notice a curious lack
                        of specificity in Smith’s laments (McGann, <title level="m">Poetics of
                            Sensibility</title> 157; Labbe, <title level="m">Charlotte Smith
                        </title>75–76; Weisman 25). With only a few exceptions, the sonnets maintain
                        a stony silence on the cause of their despondency. This fact is all the more
                        remarkable given what we know about Smith’s life, which furnished her with
                        ample cause for lament.<note place="foot"> For a brief overview of Smith’s
                            early, unhappy marriage and lifelong financial and legal problems, see
                            Stuart Curran’s helpful introduction to his edition of Smith’s poetry
                            (Smith xix–xxviii).</note> Nor can the sonnets’ taciturnity be plausibly
                        attributed to feminine modesty: Smith was not at all reticent about
                        discussing her grievances in correspondence, and publicly alluded to them at
                        length in the 1797 preface to the second volume of her <title level="m">Poems</title>.</p>
                  <p>Michael Hansen has helpfully situated Smith (and the sonnet revival writ
                        large) within a different tradition, that of the eighteenth-century elegy.
                        As Hansen argues, the word “elegiac” in the book’s title should be taken as
                        a generic affiliation, not just a modal description. This generic
                        redescription of the <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> (as elegies
                        written as sonnets rather than sonnets that happen to be elegies) is crucial
                        to understanding Smith’s pedigree: according to Hansen’s lineage, she
                        descends as much from the Graveyard Poets as from sentimental writing. Yet
                        to describe the sonnets as elegiac we must have recourse to a strange
                        concept: that of the object-less elegy. With the exception of a set of
                        sonnets spoken by fictional characters and another set that allude to
                        Smith’s deceased daughter Anna (and even here footnotes may be necessary to
                        catch the reference), these elegies consistently decline to say what there
                        is to elegize. Nor do they seem particularly concerned with extricating
                        themselves from the impasses in which they dwell. The lyric function of the
                        elegy, it seems safe to say, is generally to designate a lost object, and
                        then to propose a means of recuperating that loss. The majority of Smith’s
                        sonnets are notable for taking neither of these steps.</p>
                  <p> We have accrued a number of rich and precise ways of talking about
                        dissatisfaction and loss in Romantic poetry. If I venture to coin a new
                        phrase to describe the gesture that recurs in Smith’s sonnets, it is because
                        it does not seem to me to be perfectly described by any existing paradigm.
                        Rei Terada describes phenomenophilia as a therapeutic retreat from the
                        coercive pressure of ontology into the domain of pure phenomenal appearing.
                        Yet Smith’s dissatisfaction consistently fails to find any appearance that
                        it might attach to as recuperative. Jerome McGann makes an incisive
                        distinction between two different forms of elegy with different economic
                        characters: compensatory (Wordsworth; replacement and remuneration) and
                        ecstatic (Blake and Byron; pure expenditure and loss) (<title level="m">Poetics of Sensibility </title>150–73). McGann situates Smith’s sonnets
                        in the latter category, yet the poems fit the label awkwardly: they tend to
                        end neither apocalyptically nor orgasmically, but with a demurral. Laura
                        Quinney locates Smith within the genealogy of the “poetics of
                        disappointment,” a tradition of writing that tracks the fall from
                        narcissistic self-validation into the raw, formless flux of mere life.
                        (28-30) Despite their references to the lost plenitude of childhood
                        experience, however, Smith’s sonnets are notable for their refusal to have
                        much to say about the lived affective present that has replaced that
                        plenitude, other than that it is painful. Perhaps closest to the Smithean
                        gesture is the state that Anne-Lise François has described as “recessive
                        action”: a withdrawal from the imperative to action into a state of modest,
                        anticipatory attention. Yet the theoretical force of François’ thought is to
                        show that recession can count as a kind of action, while the force of
                        Smith’s sonnets derives from a more stringent form of stasis, from the feat
                        of engineering closure out of impasse itself. The negative turn, a procedure
                        Smith seems to have discovered within the formal resources of the sonnet,
                        finds a stable ground for subjectivity in the fact of dissatisfaction, the
                        inability of the mind to wholly endorse the world in which it finds itself.
                        This kind of subjectification, in its purest form, is essentially empty,
                        declining all phenomenal content except that of quiet demurral from the
                        world it is offered. Supported by the negative turn, the lyric subject
                        withdraws into the shadow cast by the plenitude of the phenomenal world.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>A crisp example can be found in <ref target="#sXXXI">
                        <anchor xml:id="mXXXI"/>sonnet XXXI</ref>, “Written in Farm Wood, South Downs, in May 1784.”
                        As with many or most of Smith’s sonnets, this one adopts formal elements of
                        both the Shakespearean and Petrarchan variants. Most crucial, however, is
                        the strong rhetorical break before the concluding couplet—a feature that
                        marks it, arguably, as more English than Italian. For three quatrains, we
                        are comfortably situated somewhere in between the pastoral and georgic
                        traditions, alternating between personified or agential natural features
                        (“Spring,” “slow-descending showers”) and typified human agents (the
                        “shepherd” and the “hind,” the prototypical inhabitants, respectively, or
                        pastoral and georgic space). The sentiment expressed here fits comfortably
                        enough within William Empson’s classic description of the pastoral: as
                        articulating class difference via a vision of the simple, if melancholically
                        finite, life. Yet, upon reaching the couplet, we enter a very different
                        rhetorical space: the appearance of first-person pronouns shifts the
                        sensorial organization of the poem from pastoral/georgic to lyric,
                        retrospectively inflecting the entire scene described in the quatrains
                        around the failure of the lyric subject to take pleasure in it. In fact, the
                        relationship between quatrains and couplet is almost paratactic, as if
                        rigorously separating the lyric subject from its world, rather than trying
                        to rearticulate a relation between them. The turn into the couplet, then, is
                        also a turn into elegiac subjectification. It registers the presence of a
                        mind that hovers on the edge of its world without engaging it.</p>
                  <p> One of the most rhetorically virtuosic instances of the negative turn
                        appears in a late sonnet, “To the sun” (<ref target="#sLXXXIX">
                        <anchor xml:id="mLXXXIX"/>LXXXIX</ref>). Among the rare sonnets that
                        articulate an object of loss (Smith’s daughter Anna), this poem unfolds as a
                        single sentence. Two quatrains organized by conjoined “whether” clauses
                        follow the sun’s diurnal course: morning in the first quatrain and, with
                        accelerating rhythm, noon and sundown in the second. With the apostrophe to
                        the sun as “celestial lamp” at the beginning of line 9, the subject of the
                        sentence (the word “influence”) is announced, and appears to initiate an
                        episode of paint-by-numbers apostrophic praise. Though the sonnet is
                        quasi-Petrarchan in form, its actual turn occurs at line 11, with the
                        appearance of predicate and object: “shines not for me.” Across the enjambed
                        line break, what appeared to be a formulaic paean to the sun has collapsed
                        into something quite different. The appearance of the first-person pronoun
                        opens up an inner space of non-participation in the sun’s universal
                        illumination. While the first two thirds of the sonnet sing the praises of
                        the sun’s illuminating powers, the last third posits an un-illuminable inner
                        world. The sonnet, characteristically, is disinterested in mediating between
                        these two worlds. Its form functions to sustain subjectivity as a kind of
                        negative space that emerges against the background of lived experience. This
                        space is articulated by a gesture of misrecognition and non-participation in
                        just the kind of reliable natural process that is generally held to support
                        a common world. The lyric subject here sets herself up as an exception to
                        the famous designation of universality in Ecclesiastes: “everything under
                        the sun.”</p>
                  <p> The complexity and rigor of Smith’s negative turn is perhaps nowhere more
                        striking than in her most famous sonnet, “Written in the church-yard at
                        Middleton in Sussex” (<ref target="#sXLIV">
                        <anchor xml:id="mXLIV"/>XLIV</ref>). The scene described here is hardly one of pastoral
                        contentment or sunny illumination, and one might think that Smith had
                        finally found an external scene with which she could express sympathy or
                        identification. The poem systematically develops the familiar Romantic theme
                        of mutability, interweaving concentric cycles of flux: astronomical,
                        geological, maritime, and human. A fitting tableau, it would seem, for a
                        writer so concerned with loss. Yet the poem’s culminating gesture,
                        accomplished in the couplet, is one of disaffiliation with the dead, and
                        rigorous separation of inner and outer storms. Rather than immersing itself
                        in the grim scene it witnesses, the lyric subject articulates itself as an
                        excluded remainder. The contrast between the pronoun “they” in line 12 and
                        the “I” line 13 is characteristic: the lyric “I” sets itself up by demurring
                        from a given world, by refusing to recognize itself therein. This is
                        certainly not, within the canonical Romantic theory of lyric expressivity,
                        how lyric subjectivity is supposed to work. In this sense, the sonnet is a
                        much stranger and more radical poem than the more canonical contributions on
                        the same subject (mutability) by Wordsworth and Shelley: it is as if the
                        inevitable disintegration of human worlds within the flux of natural change
                        were not, taken on its own, tragic enough.</p>
                  <p>The structure I’ve tried to outline appears persistently throughout the
                            <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>, from the slender first edition
                        to the full, two-volume version of 1800.<note place="foot"> Further striking
                            examples include sonnets III, VIII, LV, LXVII, LXXI, and XCII.</note> By
                        my count, thirty-nine of the sonnets display the dissociative structure of
                        feeling I have tried to describe, in which the lyric subject articulates its
                        experience of dissatisfaction against a world that fails to reflect that
                        experience. Of these, twenty-six use the turn function of the sonnet form to
                        articulate the affective disjunction between subject and world. (This
                        sometimes occurs in the traditional locations of lines 9 or 13, and is
                        sometimes slightly displaced, as in “To the sun.”) In the formal resources
                        of the sonnet, Smith found a support for a phenomenological procedure of
                        disarticulation between dissatisfied self and indifferent world. The
                        sonnet’s renowned turn function, in her poetry, becomes a turn into
                        subjectification, into the detection of the self as a kind of vacant space
                        of disavowal of the exterior world. The type of Romantic practiced in the
                        sonnets, then, is quite different from that stipulated by a critic like
                        Abrams, who acknowledges the Romantic interest in dissatisfaction and
                        misrecognition, but emphasizes the ultimate re-coordination of inner and
                        outer worlds as fundamental to the structure of Romantic lyric. Subsequent
                        criticism has, again, been more skeptical about the possibility of this
                        re-coordination. Yet it has largely continued to assume that lyrics seek
                        mind-world closure, even if unable to achieve it. In their rigorous
                        avoidance of such closure, Smith’s collection of dissociative sonnets was
                        perhaps never quite equaled in the decades following the 1780s. If one reads
                        Smith’s successors with one’s ears cocked, however, traces of Smithean
                        dissociation remain audible.</p>

                  <p>The Smithean negative turn has a sporadic but persistent presence in the next
                        three decades of canonical poetry. The most pristine example, after <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>, is probably found in William Cowper’s
                        “The Cast-away.” The poem’s famous final gesture has become so familiar that
                        we may need to refresh ourselves as to its strangeness:<quote>

                        construct a correspondence between two forms of woe, that of the drowning
                        sailor and that of the poet. The latter, though completely undescribed in
                        the poem, is presented as its true subject, the former as an extended
                        simile. As Cowper explains: “mis’ry still delights to trace / Its semblance
                        in another’s case” (ll. 59–60). This analogic argument is completed in the
                        final lines with a compact statement of symmetry: “We perish’d, each alone.”
                        The abyssal experiences of sailor and poet may be incommunicable, but they
                        are nevertheless mutually intelligible as two cases of a general condition
                        of incommunicability. This is a grim recuperative gesture, but basically a
                        stable one. Yet, with an unmistakably Smithean use of the first-person
                        pronoun, the final couplet punctures this closure, shifting from an analogic
                        argument to a comparative one. This “I,” which has been tacitly present
                        throughout the poem as the occluded referent of the maritime simile, quietly
                        withdraws from the analogic closure that has supported it. The final
                        couplet—recognizably sonnet-like in its economy—is a gesture of the utmost
                        rigor: it withdraws subjectivity from the most minimal form of content or
                        correspondence with an external object.<note place="foot"> “The Castaway”
                            can be usefully compared with Smith’s narrative poem “The peasant of the
                            Alps,” which concludes with a negative turn that proposes a
                            correspondence between two forms of suffering, only to qualify the
                            equivalence: “A fate too similar is mine, / But I—in lingering pain
                            repine, / And still my lost felicity deplore!” (Smith 91; ll. 49–51).
                            Cowper and Smith corresponded briefly in 1793, after Smith’s dedication
                            of <title level="m">The Emigrants </title>to the former.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several striking examples of the negative turn appear in Wordsworth’s early
                        poetry. The fragment “A Night-Piece” recounts the passage of the moon
                        through a gap in the clouds. Upon the completion of this “solemn scene,” the
                        poem enters a new rhetorical space: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>At length the vision closes, and the mind</l>
                           <l>Not undisturbed by the deep joy it feels,</l>
                           <l>Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,</l>
                           <l>Is left to muse upon the solemn scene. (Wordsworth 45; ll.
                                    20–23)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> It is only with the closure of the “vision” that the
                        envisioning mind becomes sensible. Mind exists as an after-resonance of
                        vision, yet is stringently partitioned off from it. A similar gesture occurs
                        in “An Evening Walk,” a poem in which the evidence of Wordsworth’s early
                        admiration of Smith is well-documented.<note place="foot">The poem contains
                            what appear to be several direct allusions to <title level="m">Elegiac

                            fashion, in scare quotes, but never explicitly attributed. Wordsworth
                            and Smith had spent an afternoon together, according to Smith’s
                            correspondence, in 1791, after the composition but before the
                            publication of “An Evening Walk” (Labbe, <title level="m">Writing

                        </lg>
                     </quote> The diction and rhetoric here seem akin to that of <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>, but a more striking correspondence
                        can be found in the apparent redundancy of the final couplet. The passage’s
                        argument seems complete without it: twilight steals over the heart in
                        sympathy with the corresponding external phenomenon, and the “sadly-pleasing
                        visions” it produces are in danger of fading from view in sympathy with the
                        environment that engendered them. “Yet,” something of the “tender gloom”
                        remains: a certain coldness and shuddering. This “yet,” and the apparent
                        excrescence of the couplet it initiates, marks the turn into elegiac
                        subjectification, the detachment of phenomenal experience from its objects.
                        The “shuddering tear” may be melodramatic, but it should not be mistaken for
                        sentimental: the tear here serves a highly unusual function, articulating
                        the element in experience that fails to enter sympathetic resonance with the
                            world.<note place="foot"> This Smithean current in Wordsworth can
                            arguably be followed to the first two stanzas of the “Immortality”

                  </p>
                  <p>Coleridge’s “Dejection” ode (1802) offers a striking and well-known negative turn:<quote>

                           <l>And still I gaze—and with how blank an eye! </l>

                     </quote> By the eye’s “blankness,” Coleridge turns out to mean a
                        disjunction between seeing and feeling, a failure of objects in the
                        sensorium to find internal correspondents. In this gap between seeing and
                        feeling, subjectivity detects itself as precisely what fails to appear in
                        the phenomenal field. As Tilottama Rajan argues, this “failure of communion
                        . . . radically calls into question the vision of life eddying
                        ‘from pole to pole’ (l. 135) projected in the concluding benediction,” in
                        which Coleridge attempts to vicariously recuperate his own dejection via an
                        address to Sara Hutchinson (232).</p>
                  <p> Nearly two decades later, several similar negative turns would occur in
                        Shelley’s late, dejected lyrics. “Stanzas Written in Dejection, Near Naples”
                        offers two full stanzas of luscious maritime description before breaking off
                        into affective dissociation: “How sweet! did any heart now share in my
                        emotion” (Shelley 136, ll. 27). “To Jane. The Recollection” concludes with a
                        long description of the pines and sky outside Naples reflected in a
                        motionless pool of water, only to conclude with a reassertion of “Shelley’s mind”:<quote>

                                        Shelley’s troubled thought appears to be initiated by a
                                        breeze that disturbs the tranquil image in the pool. Yet

                                        turmoil remains, the meteorological phenomenon in question
                                        is very quickly displaced by its mental counterpart: “Until

                     </quote> “Shelley’s mind” is here understood as that which remains
                        unassimilated to the world’s basic quality of habitability (the perpetual
                        kindness of Jane and greenness of forests). The mind here has a purely
                        negative phenomenal profile, articulating subjectivity as that which is
                        subtracted from the world. It is registered through the detection of turmoil
                        where the world offers none. <title level="m">The Triumph of Life

                        elaboration of the same procedure Smith undertakes in her sonnet “To the
                        sun.” As the sun rises and the “mask / Of darkness [falls] from the awakened
                        Earth,” (ll. 3–4) a universal sympathetic motion occurs among things illuminated:<quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Yet, as in Smith’s sonnet, however, this sweeping
                        designation of solar universality has at least one exception: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>But I, whom thoughts which must remain untold </l>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> The introduction of the first-person pronoun into the poem
                        is accomplished via a negative conjunction: not “and,” “but.”
                        Subjectification is introduced into mere sensation via the quiet failure of
                        the “I” to align with what it senses. The poem designates the mental
                        phenomena that resist absorption into universality as Shelley’s “thoughts
                        that must remain untold.” This can be read in two ways: thoughts that
                        Shelley declines to communicate (of which more below), or thoughts
                        implicitly incommunicable because contentless, composed of the mere demurral
                        comprised by phenomenal dissatisfaction with a given world.</p>
                  <p>There is thus reason to speculate that the possibilities Smith discovered in
                        the sonnet were disseminated among a variety of verse forms. To return to
                        the Romantic sonnet tradition, however, we can consider an unusual, delicate
                        Wordsworth sonnet of 1802, <ref target="#sWords">
                        <anchor xml:id="mWords"/>“Composed after a Journey across the Hamilton Hills.”</ref> Up through
                        the first three lines of the sestet, this poem offers a micro-elegy resolved
                        by a modest compensation: Wordsworth and his travelling companions arrive
                        too late to enjoy the view of Yorkshire from the Hambleton hills, but are
                        treated instead to a magnificent prospect of the sky at dusk. McGann’s
                        distinction between compensatory and ecstatic elegies is useful here: the
                        language of compensation in the sonnet is explicitly economic (“sights that
                        might well repay all disappointment”), setting up a logic in which a lost
                        pleasure is, in the manner of double-entry book-keeping, balanced out by an
                        unexpected one. Yet a subtle negative turn, occurring in the middle of line
                        12, seems to articulate an exterior to this compensatory logic: the
                        replacement of one prospect by another occurs, it turns out, within an
                        inexorable condition of forgetfulness, the loss that always occurs when
                        human minds attempt to register the unearthly. The delight that the eye
                        takes in the aerial prospect, prior to the turn, is wholly unironic, almost
                        embarrassingly Wordsworthian. The negative turn, however, retroactively
                        registers a contrast: “the eye may be delighted, but as for me
                        . . . .” This gesture is, in a quiet way, quite strange: it causes
                        the compensatory closure established above to unravel, as well as abruptly
                        cancelling the equation of things of the sky (clouds) and things of the
                        earth (buildings) that the second quatrain works so hard to achieve. Marked
                        by an inscrutable affective timbre, the final two and a half lines end the
                        poem with a retreat backward into the void of subjectification, a
                        content-less dissatisfaction with lived experience that seems,
                        retrospectively, to have been resonating under the poem all along.</p>
                  <p> Perhaps the single most striking example of the negative turn in
                        post-Smithean Romanticism is found in one of Keats’ best-known sonnets, <ref target="#sKeats">
                        <anchor xml:id="mKeats"/>“When I have fears that I may
                            cease to be.”</ref> As in Smith’s sonnet to the sun, a parallel
                        grammatical structure organizes this sonnet’s quatrains as antecedents of
                        the conclusion reached in the final couplet. Three objects of loss—inner and
                        outer poetic objects and a woman that Keats had glimpsed at Vauxhall gardens
                        years earlier—are proposed in each of the quatrains, setting up a proleptic
                        elegiac structure in which the couplet, we might expect, will play a
                        compensatory role. A famous Shakespearean procedure, for example, might use
                        the couplet to find a kind of durability and immortality within the poem
                        itself: “So long as men can breathe and eyes can see / So long lives this,
                        and this gives life to thee.” The compensation that this sonnet’s turn
                        offers, however, is quite ambivalent and subtle:<quote>

                     </quote> The sonnet might appear to be imperfectly Shakespearean in
                        form in that it enjambs the line preceding the couplet. However, a
                        fundamental disjunction—the disjunction I have been calling the negative
                        turn—occurs between the situation described at the end of line 12 and that
                        of lines 13 and 14. Prior to the enjambment, we are presented with the
                        prospect—a highly Smithean one, as it happens—of standing despondently on
                        the shore. Once we enter the rhetorical space of the couplet, however, we
                        encounter a much stranger idea: “standing on the shore of the world.” This
                        form of elegiac subjectivity involves not the replacement of lost objects,
                        but the fact of their “sinking” into “nothingness,” falling away into a
                        void. Standing on the shore of the world propels the lyric subject into an
                        infinite inner distance from which the objects of the world approach
                        inconsequentiality. Keats’ sonnet thus offers an austere account of
                        melancholia: the death of an outer object world and the retreat into an
                        inner replacement.</p>

                  <p> If the literary genealogy hypothesized here is plausible, we can suggest
                        that the primary historical importance of Smith’s <title level="m">Elegiac
                            Sonnets</title> lies not in their popularization of sentimental topoi,
                        but in their discovery of a new lyric technique for detachment from the
                        world. The originality of this procedure is all the more striking if we
                        recall that Shakespeare’s sonnets, with their aphoristic, rhetorical use of
                        the turn function, had yet to undergo critical recuperation in the 1780s and
                            90s.<note place="foot"> There is no reason to think that Smith had read
                            Shakespeare’s sonnets: her poetry alludes in several places to the
                            plays, but nowhere to the sonnets, nor are the latter referred to in her
                            correspondence.</note> Nor do the other scattered collections of sonnets
                        produced in the late eighteenth century (by Thomas Warton and Smith’s patron
                        William Hayley, for example) provide much precedent for the Smithean
                        negative turn.<note place="foot">For partial exceptions, see Thomas Gray’s
                            “Sonnet on the Death of Mr. Richard West” and Warton’s Sonnet I (Warton
                            75). Both poems, however, are isolated within their respective oeuvres,
                            nor do they contain all the elements I have tried to describe as
                            pertaining to the negative turn.</note> Ever since Stuart Curran’s
                        recovery of Smith’s poetry in the 1990s, critics have noted the remarkable
                        energy with which <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> resuscitated a
                        dormant genre. I wish to add the suggestion that the formal and
                        phenomenological impulse I have been calling the negative turn was the motor
                        of this astonishing revival.</p>
                  <p> Different ethical and political interpretations of the negative turn might
                        be imagined. Mark Seltzer fortuitously settles on a related term (the turn
                        away, the “turn turn”) to describe the process through which persons create
                        inner spaces “away” (Erving Goffman) from the “official world.” The official
                        world is understood, in a Luhmannian, systems-theoretical idiom, as the
                        collection of self-generating systems that sustain ordinary life. To turn
                        away from the official world, for Seltzer, merely articulates the system’s
                        function of exo-reference that defines and stabilizes its operations.
                        Turned-away subjectivity thus feels, phenomenally, exterior to the official
                        world, but remains enmeshed in its capture. (Seltzer’s systems-theoretical
                        approach is marked by that intellectual tradition’s characteristic affect:
                        gentle paranoia.) The lyric negative turn, following this line of argument,
                        can be viewed as sustaining the integrity of a coercive reality precisely by
                        inwardly refusing to align with it.</p>
                  <p>Jonathan Flatley offers the materials for a different interpretation when he
                        theorizes a connection between melancholic inner distance and “affective
                        mapping.” The latter is a process of attunement to the correspondences
                        between inner affective space and outer political space. Such
                        correspondences, for Flatley, are most likely to come into view when
                        affective life is approached in a depressive mode—the movement into the
                        depressive position being, in a Kleinian idiom, a gesture that makes the
                        world whole by falling out of it. Melancholic detachment thus provides the
                        opening for new mappings of affective and political space. In Smith’s case,
                        we might think of the fact that she expanded her technical range, starting
                        in the 1790s, to include political verse as well as the elegiac sonnet.
                        (While continuing to compose and publish sonnets, Smith went on to write
                        first “The Emigrants” [1798], a poem that curiously blends elegiac
                        subjectivity with political commentary, and then “Beachy Head” [1807],
                        which, as Kevis Goodman has shown, is concerned with the mapping of
                        political space and time from within a georgic sensorium.)</p>
                  <p> The problem that comes into view, then, is whether phenomenal detachment
                        from a dissatisfying world should be viewed as buttressing or eroding the
                        normative facticity of that world. This dilemma, as Terada has shown, stems
                        from the phenomenological intractability of the fact-value problem, the
                        tendency of reliable experiences to gain normative gravity.<note place="foot"> Again, Smith’s sonnets model on a very different response
                            to fact-value conflation than the one Terada finds in Coleridge and
                            other phenomenophiles.</note> Smith began writing sonnets in the shadow
                        of an Enlightenment tradition of optimism about the fact-value problem
                        (Hume’s firm is/ought distinction, Bentham’s counter-normative theory of
                        legislation) and before the consolidation of conservative counterarguments
                        affirming the ethical weight of established custom (Burke’s <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France </title>[1790]). In these two
                        currents, dissatisfaction with what is demands either the construction of an
                        account of what ought to be or a stance of principled resignation to the
                        identity of is and ought. Smith’s sonnets chart a third course, detaching
                        rigorously from what is while declining to articulate a corresponding ought.
                        As I have argued, the negative turn holds subjectivity in a contentless void
                        at the edge of lived experience. In doing so, it fully acknowledges the
                        facticity of an unsatisfying reality, yet leaves unspoken the reality that
                        the subject wished to find instead. </p>
                  <p>In this way, Smith’s sonnets stage acts of non-communication in a very
                        precise sense, that offered by D. W. Winnicott in a paper titled
                        “Communicating and not communicating leading to a study of certain
                        opposites” (1996). In Winnicottian clinical theory, healthy adult psychic
                        organization involves the splitting of experience into “true” and “false”
                        selves. The former is composed by object-relating with internal, subjective,
                        unreal (and therefore real-feeling) phenomenon; the latter by compliance
                        with external, objective, real (and therefore unreal-feeling) facts. It is
                        crucial for the subject to remain in communication with her internal objects
                        to maintain this organization, yet this enterprise is attended by the danger
                        that the true self might become fully communicable and thus be exhausted.
                        Such danger explains “the frightening fantasy of being infinitely exploited
                        . . . the fantasy of being eaten or swallowed up . . .
                            <emph>the fantasy of being found</emph>” (179; Winnicott’s italics).
                        Thus the curiously elliptical forms of communication practiced by certain
                        people, for example artists, in whom “one can detect an inherent dilemma,
                        which belongs to the co-existence of two trends, the urgent need to
                        communicate and the still more urgent need not to be found” (185).</p>
                  <p> In Winnicottian terms, the feat accomplished by the Smithean negative turn
                        is a quiet refusal of compliance. It communicates nothing other than the
                        possibility that there might be something to communicate other than an
                        assent to external facticity. Such a non-communication by no means
                        guarantees the existence of some particular, revelatory secret, but does
                        reserve a place for such secrets. The Winnicottian name for this place is
                        the “true self,” or the “non-communicating central self, for ever immune
                        from the reality principle, and for ever silent” (192). This silent void of
                        inner unreality is both elided and indicated by the negative turn.<note place="foot">Mary Jacobus helpfully explicates Winnicott’s paper at
                            length. She also points out passages remarkably resonant with this
                            theory in Book III of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> (152–59). It
                            is worth mentioning that Smith would have been fresh in Wordsworth’s
                            memory when he arrived at Cambridge, as he had been lent a copy of
                                <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> by his schoolmaster only a
                            few years earlier.</note> Winnicott, reading his paper to the San
                        Francisco Psychoanalytic Society in 1963, finds himself surprised that his
                        thought has led him “to staking a claim . . . to the right not to
                        communicate” (179). A clinician rather than an ethicist, he does not develop
                        this idea. However, it should not be confused with, for example, the
                        Foucauldian polemic against the repressive hypothesis, which holds that
                        individuals should be free to pursue artificial self-fashioning rather than
                        unfold the innermost truths of their being. Rather, the Winnicottian right
                        not to communicate designates a right to dissociation, a right to demur from
                        the facticity of a commonly-held world. It describes the cultivation of
                        inner distance from the real as something that persons must respect in one
                        another. </p>
                  <p> As critics of Smith (especially Adela Pinch) have long pointed out, the
                        language Smith speaks in the sonnets is often not her own: Smith frequently
                        borrowed and repurposed lines from other poems, and her diction relies
                        heavily on the tropes of eighteenth-century sentimentalism, elegy, and
                        georgic. Thus, even more than self-consciously innovative poets, a writer
                        like Smith works in the communal medium of linguistic exchange and
                        circulation. This lexical bricolage has made it easy to misread Smith as a
                        Sentimental Poetess—that is, a writer who facilitates the circulation of
                        affects and sentiments among persons. Yet the <title level="m">Elegiac
                            Sonnets</title> shape their borrowed linguistic material into a lyric
                        structure designed precisely to afford dissociation from the commonly-held
                        world mediated in language. Oren Izenberg, in the context of
                        twentieth-century American poetry, has argued that one significant strain of
                        poetic experimentalism seeks to replace poems with persons, or to use poetry
                        as a technique for discovering accounts of personhood that might serve as a
                        ground for the social. The Smithean negative turn functions in a related but
                        inverted fashion: it utilizes poetic form (in the most literal-minded sense
                        of the term) to allow persons to withdraw themselves from the ground of
                        social being. It permits the lyric subject, even as she is immersed in the
                        linguistic material of communal life, to remain silent.</p>
                  <p> Not communicating is thus, for Smith as for Winnicott, a way of dissociating
                        from the facticity of a commonly-held world. In psychoanalytic thought, the
                        concept of facticity or reality has tended to be attached, in one way or
                        another, to the experience of dissatisfaction. That is, the fact of having
                        an experience to which one cannot fully assent serves, for Freud and his
                        students, as a guarantee that that experience bears a relation to external
                            reality.<note place="foot"> Variations on this theme occur, for example,
                            in Freud’s account of the inhibitory function of the “reality
                            principle,” Klein’s argument that the ego can integrate its objects only
                            by (depressively) acknowledging the fact of their separateness, Lacan’s
                            account of anxiety as a signal of the Real, and Winnicott’s theory of
                            transitional objects. </note> This tradition of Freudian epistemology
                        places in a new light the question that Seltzer and Flatley identify:
                        whether subjective dissociation from the factical world has the capacity to
                        change anything about that world. This is, as in Seltzer and Flatley, a
                        problem that pertains to the relation of the individual to the social
                        aggregate, but also, as in the broader Freudian tradition, a problem that
                        grounds subjectivity. In Winnicott, the splitting of the ego into “true” and
                        “false” components is a result of “compliance” with the intractable
                        facticity of the external world. The self cannot afford, most of the time,
                        not to comply with the real, but it is rarely fully prepared to do so. In a
                        crucial sense, compliance is thus always false compliance, and the splitting
                        of the self allows external compliance to coincide with internal demurral.
                        Smith’s innovations in the sonnet-form are, I hypothesize, the result of one
                        mind’s negotiation with this problem. The negative turn provides the means
                        of addressing reality from across a gulf of inner distance. It thereby
                        preserves the silent reservoir of inner unreality that makes this distance
                        bearable.</p>
                  <p>In one of the late sonnets, “To the invisible moon” (<ref target="#sLXXX">
                        <anchor xml:id="mLXXX"/>LXXX</ref>) we find Smith more or less
                        explicitly invoking her right not to communicate. This epistle to the moon,
                        written in the apostrophic second person, communicates an intention not to
                        communicate. Smith would like the moon to know that she is hidden from it,
                        but this is not the same as wanting to be found. The italicized “I”—here, as
                        always in Smith, the signal of negative subjectification—expresses a clear
                        preference: not to transact with the commonly-held world that might be
                        supported by affective or meteorological phenomena. The “I” counts itself as
                        an exception to the gentle, melancholic agency of moonlight, which might
                        sooth others, but does not sooth <emph>me</emph>. </p>
                  <p>However, it should be made clear that this sonnet does not offer a pristine
                        specimen of the negative turn, and indeed is rather unusual for Smith. It
                        permits us to cross over from the negated, moonlit world of commonality into
                        the unilluminated inner void that this negation preserves. “But <emph>I
                            . . .</emph>”: generally, Smith uses this disjunctive
                        conjunction to absent herself from the phenomenal world. Here, however, the
                        dissociative “I” takes on a verb of affirmation: “prefer.” This preferring
                        marks an exit from the pure impotentiality—as with Bartleby—of preferring
                        not to or preferring nothing.<note place="foot"> See Giorgio Agamben’s
                            Aristotelian reading of Melville’s story (243–71).</note> That is, it
                        constitutes a lapse in Smith’s rigorous object-less-ness. On the dark side
                        of the earth, we encounter Smith’s unreal, introjected objects: Mars, the
                        “red comet,” the “fire-ting’d waves.”<note place="foot">The sonnet, of
                            course, does seem to describe an actual landscape. If, however, this
                            landscape supports Smith’s inner object-relating, the fact that it
                            happens to exist by no means cancels its unreality (Winnicott,
                            “Transitional Objects”).</note> By reporting the gleaming and flashing
                        of these quasi-hallucinatory phenomena, Smith suspends, for a moment, the
                        silence that underlies the most ostensibly melodramatic of the sonnets. This
                        communication is brought to a close by the couplet, which returns to an “I”
                        that can only be articulated by negative comparison (“beings less accurst
                        than I”). Yet in allowing this dilation and closure of a hallucinatory inner
                        space, Smith waives, ever so briefly, her right not to communicate. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">Romantic literature at times features instances of positive
                    negation, that trope whereby a literary text gives a body, face, visible form,
                    or effective agency to negativity. In doing so, it anticipates similar features
                    in modernist critical theory, such as Heidegger’s notion of the possibility of
                    the impossibility of existence, or Bataille’s rendition of the presence of the
                    absence of God. Such figures appear in the late poetry of Samuel Taylor
                    Coleridge, especially “Human Life, On the Denial of Immortality,” which reveal a
                    counterside to his late theological reflections. That poem’s deployment of what
                    Coleridge elsewhere considers to be the “positive state” of “Eternal Death”
                    proposes that without the immortality of the soul, the best instance of positive
                    negation is the living human being, who (in an echo of Milton’s Death)
                    personifies the nothingness she or he must face. Such a figure, the poem
                    suggests, can neither mount a suitable emotion in relation to its nothingness
                    nor make its nothingness meaningful; nevertheless, as something crafted by
                    nature’s “restless hands unconsciously,” the mortal becomes a figure of excess,
                    of what interrupts mere blankness, exemplifying not a dialectical rendition of
                    death but a second-order nullity, and thus can be defined through a Lacanian
                    enigmatic signifier, even if one deprived of any code in which it may make
                    sense. The poem thus anticipates certain a/theological features of recent
                    thought, mapping the human as a site for the assertion of negativity. </p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p> In taking up the theme of the “rights of the negative,” one might reasonably ask
                    how the negative has rights, how it might assert its rights, indeed how it might
                    make a demand of any kind. The negative, one might argue, is
                        <emph>negative</emph>, operating over against the domain of positive
                    institutions, assertions, and demands. Yet one might reasonably argue that by
                    virtue of that fact, nothing asserts itself so insistently as the negative, that
                    any positive instance necessarily operates in relation to a negativity that
                    never ceases to make itself felt.</p>
                  <p> Such reflections, however, rely on the prior fact that something like “the
                    negative” or one of its analogues has been isolated, named, and given specific
                    powers within a discourse or practice. But this minimal figure, which makes of
                    negativity a moment within the domain of the apparently positive, may at times
                    adopt a more radical form through the trope of direct embodiment—that is, a
                    face, voice, or agency, a capacity to challenge the subject explicitly. Within
                    canonic Romantic literature, one might find several examples of this trope,
                    including the metafictional ghost that appears in <title level="m">The
                        Monk</title>, the “unfathered vapour” in Wordsworth’s crossing of the Alps,
                    the creature in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, and the figure of deathly
                    negation in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. All of these
                    instances, as well as many others, no doubt allude on some level to the most
                    notorious instance of the figure, that darkness visible, Milton’s Death. These
                    versions of the negative appear in order to assert themselves, to make
                    implacable demands, and thus in some degree to horrify and alter those who
                    encounter them. Various renditions of positive negation emerge in other forms of
                    articulation in the Romantic era as well: one might think of the “empty place of
                    power” that according to Claude Lefort emerges over the course of the French
                    Revolution to become a constitutive aspect of modern democracies (27), or
                    alternatively of the formative role of natural disaster, war, and famine in
                    Malthusian demography. Some might argue that the Kantian analytic of the
                    sublime, Schelling’s notion of the rotary motion of antithetical principles in
                    his <title level="m">Ages of the World</title>, or Hegel’s account of Absolute
                    Knowledge belong within this field as well. If one glances ahead to later
                    moments in the philosophical tradition, one might think of Heidegger’s
                    discussion of the “possibility of the measureless impossibility of existence” in
                        <title level="m">Being and Time</title> (307) and of what Denis Hollier,
                    capturing the sense of Georges Bataille’s notion of the sacred, describes not as
                    the “<title level="m">absence of</title> [God’s] <emph>presence</emph>” but the
                        “<emph>presence of</emph> [his] <emph>absence</emph>” (133). Even nearer to
                    us is the Lacanian Real, which takes a logic or process that perpetually
                    undermines the symbolic and imaginary orders and treats it as an entity, an
                    uncanny Thing.</p>
                  <p> Within this broad ensemble, certain moments in Coleridge’s late poems may seem
                    inconsequential, for they do not seem to be motivated by any ambitious poetic or
                    philosophical project. Indeed, in some cases the key articulations take place in
                    poems he did not at first intend to publish. Yet it is well worth reading those
                    moments carefully with a view toward the broader questions raised by Romanticism
                    and its heirs, for they make visible the counterseams in the texture of
                    Coleridge’s overall theological and philosophical thought, and articulate, with
                    unusual brevity and precision, some of the continuing stakes of positive
                    negation.</p>
                  <p> These preoccupations first appear explicitly in a tangle of incipient poems
                    written in an 1811 <title level="m">Notebook</title> entry, especially the two
                    poems eventually published in 1834 under the titles of “Limbo” and “Ne Plus
                    Ultra” (<title level="m">Notebooks</title> 4073–74; <title level="m">Complete
                        Poems</title> 357–59). The poem “Limbo” initially outlines the limbo-zone of
                    “half-being,” which is “Wall’d round” to secure it from a more fearful state,
                    “the mere horror of blank Naught-at-all” (4, 23). In its final lines it moves
                    beyond the “Purgatory curse” of “dull Privation” to contemplate a darker
                    alternative: “Hell knows a fear far worse / A fear—a future state;—‘tis positive
                    Negation!” (26–28). In settling on this final phrase, Coleridge departs from an
                    earlier line in the notebook draft where he writes of “aye-unepithetable
                    Negation” (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title> 584; <title level="m">Notebooks </title>4073), in effect hinting that “unepithetable” is itself
                    an epithet—and that the notion of a positive negation only makes sharper the
                    idea of an unmodifiable one. As Morton Paley points out, these lines allude to a
                    notion in the third sermon of John Donne, an author central to the entire
                    notebook entry, that hell is the privation of God (Paley 202). But by shifting
                    from privation to negation, Coleridge suggests in effect that hell is nothing
                    other than a certain negation itself, or what in a later annotation to the
                    anonymous book <title level="m">Eternal Punishment Proved to Be Not Suffering,
                        but Privation</title> (1817), he calls the “positive State” of “Eternal
                    Death” (<title level="m">Marginalia</title> 559). Through the notion of
                    “positive Negation,” Coleridge does not simply write an oxymoron but invokes a
                    fully considered concept, one we could describe not merely as absence, but more
                    fundamentally as the presence of absence, the possibility of impossibility.</p>
                  <p> That poem’s intervention is so brief, however, that it only broaches the theme.
                    Thus it is not surprising that Coleridge extends its musings in nearby notebook
                    lines, published under the title “Ne Plus Ultra,” where a speaker initially
                    addresses nothingness as the “Sole Positive of Night!” (1). Here that
                    nothingness is given a much broader force, for the speaker goes on to suggest
                    that it is “The one permitted opposite of God!,” the “sole despair / Of both th’
                    eternities in Heaven!” (4, 14–15). The poem seems to rest on the notion that
                    only nothingness is permitted to oppose God, insofar as God has no true
                    opposite. But if there is a <emph>positive</emph> negation, then its
                    antithetical persistence can indeed generate astonishment. Rather than
                    representing Hell, a domain presumably subject to divine control, or a blank
                    naught-at-all of death, which only those alive may fear, here it has power to
                    interdict the activity of God and the angels. The negative has become a threat
                    to the most assertive sway of the positive itself. </p>
                  <p> But the import of this poem’s stance remains unclear: <emph>how</emph> might
                    sheer nothingness have the capacity to interdict God’s actions? Is Coleridge
                    riffing on his trope here, as if in the spirit of his version of Donne, or is he
                    beginning to conceive of a negativity like those that appear in Hegel or
                    Schelling? The final lines of the notebook entry speak of his ambivalence in
                    this regard, where he writes, “A Specimen of the Sublime dashed to pieces by
                    cutting too close with her fiery Four in Hand round the corner of Non-sense”
                        (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title> 584; <title level="m">Notebooks
                    </title>4073). </p>
                  <p> Yet Coleridge does not abandon the themes broached in these lines, for he
                    explores them more fully soon thereafter in a poem published in 1817, “Human
                    Life, On the Denial of Immortality” (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title>
                    362)—a continuity made even more evident by Coleridge’s remark in a marginal
                    annotation that this poem, too, was written “in purposed imitation of Donne”
                        (<title level="m">Poetical Works </title>1101). Here he takes up the
                    possibility, already broached in “Limbo,” that human beings may enter the
                    “future state” of nonexistence, but for now considers the implications of that
                    possibility for the significance of human life as it is lived. If human beings
                    face a blank nothingness after death, the poem suggests, then the value of life
                    itself is cancelled. Accordingly, in this poem positive negation is neither what
                    the living fear nor an agency that interdicts God’s activity but an absence that
                    transforms the positive itself into a nullity, into a “Blank accident” (14). If
                    human life is mortal, the poem suggests, then the exemplary figure of “positive
                    Negation” is the human being, who ultimately personifies the nothingness that
                    she must face, as if to instance in another way what is visible in Milton’s
                    Death. Yet here that trope uniquely appears not as a ghost, monster, allegorical
                    construction, structural principle, or demographic driver, but as the living
                    human being. </p>
                  <p> In that respect, Coleridge’s nullified subject comes into close proximity with
                    the subject of Hegel’s <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>.<note place="foot">In the Preface to that work, Hegel crucially places his account of
                        “tarrying with the negative” in the context of the demand to confront death;
                        for him, Spirit “wins its truth only when, in utter dismemberment, it finds
                        itself.” Moreover, in his depiction of this tarrying, Hegel gives death’s
                        negativity a certain positive force, a face: “Spirit is this power only by
                        looking the negative in the face, and tarrying with it.” In this key
                        passage, Hegel arguably places a version of positive negation (negation
                        given a face, voice, or agency) at the heart of his project. See Hegel
                        19.</note> Indeed, one can trace in this poem certain features of a
                    dialectical shift: the transformation of an external or future nullity—death, a
                    future state of nonexistence—into an internal or present one. Here the subject
                    is placed in dialectical relation with death, except that in this case, no
                    negation of the negation takes place, no sublation of the subject’s mortality.
                    Here one arrives at “positive” negation not through a dialectical reversal of
                    the negative but through its intensification, its emergence as an even more
                    clearly delineated instance of the negative, one that leads to nothing other
                    than itself. This poem thus anticipates those who refuse the turn whereby Hegel
                    transforms the negative into the starting point of the subject’s becoming (cf.
                    Bataille); instead, it transforms nullity into a higher version of nullity, into
                    a subjectivity nearly indistinguishable from its own future inexistence. Where
                    Hegel affirms and dialectically transposes the subject’s mortality, Coleridge
                    refuses to accept it; for him, a subject characterized by its negation becomes
                    the very emblem of absurdity and inexistence, of a life lived under the shadow
                    of what Tilottama Rajan has in another context called “unusable negativity”
                    (46). </p>
                  <p> Of course, the poem is meant in part to explore a <title level="m">reductio ad
                        absurdum</title>, to conceive of the ludicrous implications of what its
                    title marks as the “denial” of the immortality of the soul. As several scholars
                    have suggested, the fact that the poem is written in the conditional mode—“If
                    dead, we cease to be” (1)—signals that it takes up a contrary-to-fact scenario,
                    a possibility excluded by the theology Coleridge articulates in many of his late
                    writings (Kessler 69–80; Vaz-Hooper).<note place="foot">Insofar as the poem
                        pursues this approach, it deploys a strategy characteristic of the late
                        theological writings. A key passage of the <title level="m">Opus
                            Maximum</title>, for example, maintains that “[w]e affirm” that work’s
                        central postulate “&lt;not&gt; because we . . . comprehend the
                        affirmation, but because we clearly comprehend the absurdity of the denial”
                        (221). On negative proofs in that work, see Evans 17, 36–38, 59,
                        105–117.</note> But such is not its entire purpose, for it also takes up the
                    concern with hopelessness or loss which informs a half-dozen lyrics he composed
                    after 1805, from “Constancy to an Ideal Object” through “Love’s Apparition and
                    Evanishment,” and thus exemplifies what Eric Wilson has described as the poet’s
                    “double vision,” his ability to linger with opposed possibilities (xiii).<note place="foot">The most significant poems in this group (apart from several
                        notebook fragments) include “Constancy to an Ideal Object,” “The Blossoming
                        of the Solitary Date-Tree. A Lament,” “The Visionary Hope,” “Limbo,” “Ne
                        Plus Ultra,” “Human Life, On the Denial of Immortality,” “Work Without
                        Hope,” “The Pang More Sharp Than All: An Allegory,” “Phantom or Fact?,” and
                        “Love’s Apparition and Evanishment: An Allegoric Romance.” The fact that
                        Coleridge wrote so many poems of such ambition on these themes suggests that
                        together they constitute a key dimension of his corpus, an important—if less
                        discussed—dimension of his authorship.</note> This lyric, in short, balances
                    itself between the scorn for disbelief and the lyrical evocation of a negated
                    state; it explores nonsense seriously, articulating the nearly inexplicable
                    logic of the theological uncanny.</p>
                  <p> Initially it charts its concerns by suggesting that a purely mortal life, in
                    finding no realization after death, consists of nothing but biological life,
                    nothing but “sound,” “motion,” or “breath” (4, 5)—not so much bare life as
                        <emph>wasted</emph> life. In a later passage, the poem extends this thought
                    by suggesting that such a life’s “laughter and tears / Mean but themselves”
                    (17–18)—in effect, that even nonverbal expressions cease to find their place in
                    any code. The reflexive consciousness of this state is equally futile; as the
                    poem later suggests, it would be just as useless to mourn the passing of such a
                    life as to attempt <emph>not</emph> to mourn it. To react to it in
                        <emph>any</emph> fashion, it suggests, would be vacuous: “Yet what and
                    whence thy gain, if thou withhold / These costless shadows of thy shadowy self?
                    / Be sad, be glad, be neither! seek, or shun!” (25–26). Moreover, it contends
                    that the defeat of signification also defeats affect itself, making “dreams” and
                    “hopes and fears” equally weightless (16–17). The poem thus expresses a longing
                    for the <emph>gap</emph> between sign and signified, between nonverbal
                    expression and code; the absence of that gap, it seems, cancels significance,
                    emotion, and purpose alike, as if in its absence existence remains so
                    insistently literal that it cannot even attain to the minimal, impoverished
                    status of the pure signifier. In the poem’s account, only a possible immortality
                    can ground meaning; without that immortality, human life has an uncanny status,
                    for having only “phantom purposes,” it becomes merely an “Image of image, ghost
                    of ghostly elf” (9, 23)—a ghostly “gust[]” and no more (3).<note place="foot">My
                        thanks to Brian McGrath for the suggestion that “gust” resonates with the
                        theme of the ghost and phantom throughout the poem.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> But if it is merely an image <emph>of</emph> image, ghost <emph>of</emph>
                    ghostly elf, then it replicates a nonexistence it shares with the nonhuman
                    world; what precedes and generates it is a phantom like itself. The absence of
                    substance in human life implies in retrospect the absence of substance in nature
                    as well. The poem thus begins to outline a logic of nullity’s perpetual
                    replication, whereby the absence of immortality undoes the substance of human
                    being, which in turn demonstrates the absence of being in nature.</p>
                  <p> Although it often relies on this repetition of futility across several
                    registers, and thus on a sort of flat “hauntology” (Bryant 245–90; Derrida 10),
                    in a key passage it interrupts that prospect as it depicts the moment in which
                    nature produces humankind: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l> O Man! thou vessel purposeless, unmeant,</l>

                           <l> Surplus of nature’s dread activity, </l>
                           <l> Which, as she gazed on some nigh-finished vase,</l>
                           <l> Retreating slow, with meditative pause,</l>
                           <l> She formed with restless hands unconsciously!</l>
                           <l> Blank accident! nothing’s anomaly! (8–14)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> At first a reader might think that in these lines apostrophe,
                    which may be taken as a trope that typically animates or gives life, instead
                        <emph>dis</emph>animates “Man.”<note place="foot">For a key intertext here
                        see the passage in which Sara Guyer follows Barbara Johnson’s discussion of
                        lyric animation, apostrophe, prososopeia, and abortion (11–20). “Human Life”
                        for a moment deploys similar tropes to figure what one might call an
                        animated instance of nonlife (or abortive creation), but it eventually
                        resorts to a slightly different set of tropes as discussed below.</note> But
                    rather than being reducible to flat nothingness, human life soon attains the
                    status of “surplus” or “anomaly,” terms that retain the sense of the purposeless
                    or unintended but that also hint that human life <emph>exceeds</emph> mere
                    blankness. Indeed, if nature—herself an instance of personified nullity, of
                    positive negation—could interrupt herself and create humankind with “restless
                    hands unconsciously,” then humankind is the surplus of an unconscious act, a
                    slip of the hand, something unmeant—but still exceptional and potentially
                    significant in the way that the father’s “unmeant” words in the Conclusion to
                    Part II of <title level="m">Christabel</title>, for example, still retain an
                    unconscious import (cf. Mileur 63–66).<note place="foot">The prospect of
                        interpreting nature as a nullity with restless hands would, of course,
                        ordinarily vex Coleridge, but such a rendition of nature is not entirely
                        outside the realm of his thought; on his difficulty in establishing a firm
                        interpretation of nature within the context of natural religion, see
                        Brice.</note> A phantom, it seems, is not merely nothing; insofar as it
                    instantiates an impulse that caused an artist meditatively to interrupt her task
                    of shaping a “nigh-unfinished vase,” it reveals a <emph>telling</emph>
                    nothingness, one that would intrude into the activity of positive creation to
                    produce the anomalous signifier. In this respect, it enacts an agency quite
                    similar to the interruptive power we encountered in “Ne Plus Ultra,” the sort
                    capable of interdicting the activity of a god; after all, if nature here is in
                    the midst of producing an artifact such as a vase, she may be informed by the
                    capacity for creative intention, however dreadful her activity may be. In that
                    case, however, humanity remains distinctive as the product of an
                        <emph>unconscious</emph> act, a cryptic intention. Since the poem regards
                    humanity as “nothing’s anomaly,” as if nature here is synonymous with the
                    nothing, perhaps it suggests that <emph>nullity, through its power to interrupt
                        itself, can produce something distinctive, something irreducible to bare
                        absence</emph>. Of course, the poem almost simultaneously suggests that the
                    significance of that accidental surplus must remain “blank,” that the unmeant
                    can never attain positive meaning. Yet the anomalous blankness to which it
                    points suggests that human life is a meaningfully meaningless interruption, a
                    significant insignificance, a distinctive sort of nonsense—in effect a semiotic
                    and ontological phantom. </p>
                  <p> In the absence of a gap between affect and meaning appears another gap: that
                    between nothingness and its surplus. This second gap enables human life to
                    become more than merely literal, for its status as unconsciously generated
                    surplus makes it an enigmatic signifier, even if one deprived of any code in
                    which it can make sense. That development, however, suggests as well that the
                    negative has not merely replicated itself across registers, for by interrupting
                    itself it gives the further version of nullity a distinctive import. As if to
                    confirm these suggestions, in its final line—which, as Onita Vaz-Hooper points
                    out, as a twenty-ninth line, constitutes a surplus within a poem that otherwise
                    consists of two complete sonnets (536–37)—the poem does not claim that human
                    life lacks being; on the contrary, it broaches the possibility that the human
                    “being’s being” is contradiction, suggesting that one finds contradiction in the
                    being <emph>of </emph>human being, the difficult shift from one level to
                    another. In some measure, then, that line registers the deadlock inherent in the
                    status of being nothing’s anomaly and, through its very status as surplus,
                    insists on the haunting quality of that useless excess.</p>
                  <p> These possibilities may return us as well to the invocation of Milton as a
                    highly conventional emblem of theological, political, poetic, and personal
                    immortality (7). On one level, this passage invites us to consider and repudiate
                    the apparently absurd possibility that such a figure could “know death,” could
                    indeed cease to be. Yet until his correction to the poem’s proofs, Coleridge had
                    written, “And <emph>when</emph> a soul like Milton’s can know death” (<title level="m">Poetical Works</title> 1101), gesturing toward the possibility,
                    which still lingers in the published version of the poem, that perhaps so great
                    a soul as Milton’s could do that difficult thing and <emph>know</emph> death,
                    could contend with the impossible task of grasping it—or that so great a poet as
                    Milton, through his figure of Death, could create the template for later
                    attempts, indeed for Coleridge’s own effort in this poem.<note place="foot">For
                        a contrasting reading of the revision of this line consistent with her
                        overall account, see Vaz-Hooper, 538–39.</note> By suggesting, even in such
                    a cryptic manner, that such an act might be done, and to some extent attempting
                    to carry it out in its own right, the poem hints that attempting to know a final
                    death could be its most urgent, if undeclared business, as if it could set
                    itself the task of exploring the possibility of a certain impossibility, the
                    presence of a certain absence.</p>
                  <p> Thus this poem in certain moments articulates a distinctive rendition of
                    negativity, conceiving of a broadly Gothic a/theology or hauntology that refuses
                    the dialectical process visible in Hegel in favor of a proto-psychoanalytic
                    account. Indeed, Coleridge’s most direct interlocutor may be Lacan, whose sense
                    that the subject is an enigmatic signifier that ultimately lacks an Other in
                    which that signifier would attain a secure meaning (cf. Žižek 110–128) and which
                    can perhaps best encounter itself anamorphically in the image of a skull (Lacan
                    79–90) matches well with the indications in this poem. But the poem may
                    anticipate Lacan in these ways precisely by making explicit those elements of
                    Romanticism on which psychoanalysis eventually draws, taking its place within
                    the long genealogy of a certain rendition of human inexistence.</p>
                  <p> In doing so, the poem also entangles that genealogy with other important
                    strands. In his recent book, <title level="m">Minding the Modern</title> (2013),
                    Thomas Pfau lucidly designates the Coleridge of the <title level="m">Opus
                        Maximum </title>as his chief exemplar of one who, living in the midst of
                    modernity, nevertheless sustains and advocates those concepts of person,
                    relationship, and normative framework, inherited from Aristotle, Augustine,
                    Aquinas, and others, that modernity has forsaken (Pfau). But one might well take
                    up a question Pfau does not consider: whether Coleridge’s positive theology
                    might be shadowed by another discourse, not by a concession to modernity
                        <emph>per se</emph>, but rather by the counterside of theological certainty
                    itself, a poetics that finds in that contrary domain the distinctive
                    possibilities of positive negation. Such a poetics might anticipate as well
                    certain a/theological features of recent thought, not least in Lacan, where
                    negativity continues to assert its rights, even over against the apparent
                    nullity of the human condition.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This article takes up the act of retreating or withdrawal as a way
                    of reading the unpublished and published versions of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's
                    "Christabel." Although Coleridge intended to publish "Christabel" in the second
                    edition of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in 1800, the poem was
                    withheld from publication until 1816 and further revised by Coleridge until
                    1834. Rather than reading revision as clarifying authorial intention, or seeing
                    less revision as creating more indeterminacy, I see Coleridge's revisions to
                    "Christabel" as representing revision in a third sense: considerable revision
                    that appears insignificant but instead compounds the indeterminacy of the text's
                    writing. Taking up Coleridge's addition of <title level="m">The Conclusion to
                        Part the Second</title> as well as the modifications to the primary scene of
                    unreadability between Geraldine and Christabel, I argue that Coleridge's
                    repeated retreating and returning to these scenes are symptomatic of a traumatic
                    relation that cannot be read in terms of authorial intention, but rather, in the
                    words of Catherine Malabou, as an involuntary retreat that "the psyche cannot
                    stage . . . for itself" (Malabou 9). </p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p> The idea for this essay emerged because of an article by Catherine Malabou
                        in the journal <title level="m">Public</title> entitled “Is Retreat a
                        Metaphor?” (2014). Retreat, it is true, is an act, but a negative one that
                        negates even the decision to retreat, because “there can be no retreat,” in
                        Malabou’s words, “without a retreat of the retreat itself, no retreat
                        without a re-doubling, to the extent that the only gesture or move
                        retreating can perform is to perform nothing, that is, to retreat”
                        (“Retreat” 35). For Malabou, the retreat cannot be economized. Retreating
                        does not, then, perform the move of withdrawing, as in the negative ebb to
                        the positive flow of the ocean, and neither is it a remove from the
                        profanity of the world towards some posited purity in absolute privacy. In
                        contrast, the retreat demonstrates effectively “what it is not, that is
                        . . . [not] a form of presence, be it God, substance, or reality”
                        (“Retreat” 35). Much like what Derrida says of literature, there is in the
                        retreat, “a chance of saying everything without touching upon the secret” of
                        the retreat, for in the act of retreating, the retreat itself remains
                        perpetually barred (“Retreat” 29). </p>
                  <p> Though not mentioned in Malabou’s article, Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe
                        Lacoue-Labarthe had earlier theorized an alternative version of the retreat
                        in <title level="m">Le Retrait du Politique</title> (1997). Their position
                        remains tentatively hopeful, for the “retreat,” according to Nancy and
                        Lacoue-Labarthe, “makes something appear or sets something free,” not
                        “according to the rule of a nostalgic lamentation for what would have drawn
                        back . . . but according to the hypothesis that this retreat must
                        allow, or even impose, the tracing anew of the stakes of the political”
                        (131). Rather than take a position, they argue for a
                            “<emph>de</emph>-<emph>position</emph>” as a sort of
                            <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign> that thinks the limits of the political and
                        the philosophical while still holding both in reserve for something yet to
                        come (94). The hopefulness that is sketched out by this idea of the retreat
                        relies on the possibility of retracing a new ground for the political, as
                        both theorists argue in another essay, “The Jewish People Do Not Dream”:
                        “[t]o draw back [<foreign>se retirer</foreign>] is not to disappear, and
                            <emph>is</emph> not, strictly speaking, any mode of being. . .
                        . [T]he <foreign>retrait</foreign> is the action of disappearing appearing,”
                        which means that one does not merely “appear <emph>in </emph>disappearing,”
                        but rather one “appear[s] <emph>as</emph> disappearance” (qtd. in Sparks x). </p>
                  <p> In her own way, Malabou recognizes Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe by means of
                        Derrida, as she mentions that Derrida notes, in “The Retreat of Metaphor,”
                        that the limits that separate authenticity and inauthenticity have become
                        “absolutely porous” (Malabou, “Retreat” 37). Malabou continues that this
                        results in an “aporia [that] does not equate [to] an impossibility,” but
                        rather allows for the possibility to “still invent a new meaning for a
                        retreat, . . . open a new possibility of withdrawing
                        . . . [for] something yet to come,” or as Nancy and
                        Lacoue-Labarthe would say, clear the ground for a new encounter at “the
                        incision” of the retreat (Malabou “Retreat” 37, Nancy &amp; Lacoue-Labarthe
                        133). However, Malabou herself withdraws performatively, as her text moves
                        from the conditional tense of the “I would have liked to dwell” towards, as
                        she says, an other Catherine, one enveloped involuntarily that “suddenly
                        become[s] motionless and speechless, “ one that “would lie in bed often with
                        her eyes open but with a blank facial expression,” only to return again to
                        the anxious hopefulness of the conditional tense (“Retreat” 36). If
                        Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy wish to retreat as a means towards de-positioning,
                        Malabou’s performance demonstrates the fragility that underscores
                        de-position’s purposelessness; the retreat cannot be intentional, according
                        to Malabou, for from where would one have the authority to withdraw, to
                        retreat from the political in order to re-treat it? </p>
                  <p> While Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe are concerned with re-treating the
                        political––which Malabou categorizes along the lines of several voluntary
                        and intentional retreats of past figures such as Maurice Blanchot, Alexander
                        Grothendiek, and Thomas Bernhard––Malabou’s concern is with the retreat as
                        something that is accidental, making retreat impossible as a result of its
                        traumatic immediacy. For Malabou, the retreat, then, is not something chosen
                        because the subject is indifferent to the retreat. She writes that
                        “indifference” is “undecided, unvoluntary, non-chosen,” while its “rhetoric
                        comprises figures of interruption, pauses, caesuras––the blank spaces that
                        emerge when the network of connections is shredded or when the circulation
                        of energy is paralyzed” (“Retreat” 41). She further elaborates this position
                        of indifference in <title level="m">Ontology of the Accident</title> (2012),
                        where she distinguishes indifference from sorrow: indifference “is the
                        suffering caused by an absence of suffering,” a suffering in which pain
                        “manifests as indifference to pain, impassivity, forgetting, the loss of
                        symbolic reference points” (Malabou, <title level="m">Ontology </title>18).
                        Finally, in <title level="m">The New Wounded</title> (2012), the retreat’s
                        affective mode of indifference is linked to the indifference that arises
                        after neuronal trauma or the trauma of the accident, as distinct from the
                        definition of trauma offered by traditional psychoanalysis. Trauma, which is
                        associated with “permanent or temporary behaviors of <emph>indifference
                        </emph>or <emph>disaffection</emph>,” “thus designates the wound that
                        results from an effraction––an ‘effraction’ that can be physical (a ‘patent’
                        wound) or psychical. In either case, trauma names a shock that forces open
                        or pierces a protective barrier” (Malabou, <title level="m">New Wounded
                        </title>10, 6). Whereas Freud may emphasize that trauma is endogenous to the
                        psyche, Malabou expands on Freud’s analysis by including the exogenous
                        causes of trauma by integrating recent studies in neurology. In this sense,
                        Malabou’s definition of trauma recognizes that the alterations to the ego
                        that are caused by external trauma have the potential to “manifest
                        themselves as an <emph>unprecedented metamorphosis </emph>of the patient’s
                        identity,” effectively creating a new person that is cut off from their past
                        selves (<title level="m">New Wounded </title>15). Trauma, then, becomes
                        something “the psyche cannot stage . . . for itself” (Malabou,
                            <title level="m">New Wounded </title>9). Because of this change that
                        results in an indifference or disaffection, any agency linking the subject
                        to the retreat has been shattered, so that there is no longer any
                        possibility for re-treating the political. In the case of the traumatic
                        event that is exogenous to the psyche, one cannot speak of the intentional
                        retreat; rather, one can only identify the involuntary retreat that is seen
                        in the destructive negativity and unproductivity of trauma, which nullifies
                        the circulation of desire.</p>
                  <p>Because Coleridge withheld “Christabel” from publication for seventeen years,
                        it is not only necessary to re-analyze the act of withholding as a retreat
                        of a voluntary kind, but also to consider the retreat as that which is
                        indifferent with regard to the imperative towards productivity implied by
                        the act of publication. The non-publication of “Christabel” poses a problem
                        because it begs the question: what was Coleridge trying to preserve by
                        withholding “Christabel,” and from what was he retreating? Furthermore, it
                        leads us to ask: can we even read the decision to withhold a text from
                        publication? And if so, how can we read the negativity of that which appears
                        only by not appearing, that is the immaterial, which is and is not there?
                        And yet, because we cannot read that which is not there, I intend to read
                        the different versions of “Christabel” before and after publication as a way
                        of developing the concept of the retreat; for, if Derrida is correct to
                        state that the line between the public and the private is absolutely porous,
                        the unpublished versions that come before the first published edition in
                        1816 mark a way of reading Coleridge’s retreat from publication in the sense
                        of Malabou’s failure of the retreat more than Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe’s
                        re-treating the political. </p>

                  <head>A Practical and Theoretical Approach to Revision</head>
                  <p>Before turning to an analysis of “Christabel,” it is necessary to outline its
                        textual history. Thanks to the work of Jack Stillinger, whose <title level="m">Coleridge and Textual Instability</title> (1994) lays the
                        groundwork for all further studies on the versions of “Christabel,” we have
                        available the most well-composed textual and compositional history of the
                        poem. Stillinger outlines the poem’s textual history from its earliest
                        stages all the way to the final versions that Coleridge was involved in
                        revising: <quote> For “Christabel,” which Coleridge began writing in 1798,
                            expanded in 1800, and then tinkered with, but never completed, all the
                            rest of his life, we have or can reconstruct some eighteen versions, but
                            almost certainly there once existed several more than that in sources
                            now lost. To begin with, we know of nine manuscript versions (or partial
                            versions earlier than the first printed text of 1816: a holograph fair
                            copy of the equivalent of 1–655 (that is, part 1, the conclusion to part
                            1, and part 2) at Victoria College, Toronto (CoS 52); transcripts of the
                            same span, 1–655, by Dorothy Wordsworth and Mary Hutchinson among the
                            Wordsworth papers at Dove Cottage, Grasmere (CoS 51), Sara Hutchinson
                            (at Yale, CoS 53), Sara Fricker Coleridge, the poet’s wife (at the
                            University of Texas, Collection, CoS 55 and 58), and an unidentified
                            copyist (at the Bodleian Library, CoS 59); readings from a now-lost
                            holograph reported by John Payne Collier in his preface to Coleridge’s
                                <title level="m">Seven Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton
                            </title>(1856); and the quotation of 656–77, which later became the
                            conclusion to part 2, in Coleridge’s letter to Southey of 6 May 1801
                                (<title level="m">CL</title>, 2:278). The first printed text, in the
                                <title level="m">Christabel</title> volume issued by Byron’s
                            publisher, John Murrary, in May 1816 (<title level="m">1816</title>),
                            can count as the tenth version. There are at least five subsequent
                            versions constituted by changes and additions that Coleridge and others
                            entered by hand in copies of 1816 [(CoS 60, CoS 61, CoS 62, CoS 63, CoS
                            64)]. The last three versions are the texts in <title level="m">1828</title>, <title level="m">1829</title>, and <title level="m">1834</title>. (<title level="m">Coleridge</title> 79)</quote>
                        Stillinger’s position regarding the versions is two-fold. First, because
                        Coleridge revised his texts so many times throughout his life, Stillinger
                        argues that “the longstanding practice of identifying definitiveness with
                        ‘final authorial intention’ is no longer defensible” (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>10). Second, Stillinger suggests that a practical
                        theory of versions should adopt an approach of “textual pluralism,” which
                        would make “every separate version” have the right to “its [own] separate
                        legitimacy,” so that “all authoritative versions [would be] equally
                        authoritative” (<title level="m">Coleridge</title> 121). This position,
                        similar to those propounded by “James Thorpe in the 1960s and then developed
                        and championed . . . in Germany by Hans Zeller, in the United
                        States by Jerome McGann, Donald Reiman, [and] Peter Shillingsburg,” would
                        thus displace final authorial intention, and finally take into account the
                        fact that authors revise (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>121).</p>
                  <p>Revision, therefore, becomes a sign that allows one to read the differences
                        in versions as not better or worse, because these versions are legitimate,
                        discrete authoritative works in themselves. Stillinger compares writers who
                        revise—such as Coleridge—to writers who revise very little, for example John
                        Keats. What is most remarkable about the latter is “Keats’s facility in
                        drafting upon, or for, an occasion” all at once, and the fact that “there is
                        practically no evidence that he wrote his longer or more ambitious poems in
                        any other way” (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>102–03). On the other
                        hand, Coleridge’s revisionary practice is a way for Stillinger, according to
                        his “Old Critical and . . . New Textual point of view,” to read
                        authorial intention into the revisions Coleridge made to his texts (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>100). The spontaneity with which Keats wrote
                        his poems stands in contrast, for Stillinger, to Coleridge’s inveterate
                        revising. For instance, Stillinger quotes a letter Coleridge wrote to Joseph
                        Cottle on February 1797: “‘I torture the poem, and myself, with corrections;
                        and what I write in an hour, I sometimes take two or three days in
                        correcting,’ such as is the case with ‘The Religious Musings, [which] I have
                        altered monstrously’ (<title level="m">CIL</title>, 1: 309)” (qtd. in
                        Stillinger <title level="m">Coleridge </title>104). In this sense,
                        Coleridge’s mode of composition required of him to become both “critic<emph>
                            and interpreter</emph> of what he had initially created without a plan,
                        and now, in these subsequent stages of writing, <emph>added authorial
                            intention</emph> that was not consciously present in the original
                        composition” (Stillinger, <title level="m">Coleridge </title>107). In order
                        to account for revision while still maintaining authorial intention,
                        Stillinger thus states that one can read revision as adding in authorial
                        intention to a text that seemingly showed an unclear authorial intention at
                        the outset of composition.</p>
                  <p>That Coleridge revised “Christabel” many times is clear from the many
                        versions before and after publication. And yet, the revisions Coleridge made
                        to “Christabel” were so minimal, changing a word here, a comma there,<note place="foot">In fact, Coleridge’s modifications only become more
                            aggressive after publication, after the text is given over to the
                            public. In this sense, Coleridge’s withholding shows a markedly
                            different form of revision that attempts to maintain a personal
                            connection in the unpublished versions that is separate from and yet
                            still attempts to maintain a connection with the symbolic order. The
                            effect of publication shows revisionary practices that are more
                            concerned with impersonal pronouns, and increasingly shifts towards a
                            more mediated and generic gothic poem that attempts to retreat from the
                            destructive limits the poem transgresses before publication.</note> that
                        they lead Stillinger to revise his own thesis in <title level="m">Coleridge
                            and Textual Instability</title> (1994) about Coleridge’s revisionary
                        practices. This is made clear in a footnote that Stillinger adds as he
                        theorizes the revisions Coleridge made to “Christabel” and “Kubla Khan”:
                            <quote> If there is a causal relationship––in Coleridge’s not rewriting
                            the two poems [“Christabel” and “Kubla Khan”] to add authorial intention
                            in the way I have described––then perhaps a tentative generalization is
                            in order: the more revision in a Coleridge poem, the greater the
                            likelihood of receiving determinate (authorial) meanings––and,
                            conversely, the less revision, the greater the indeterminacy. (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>246)</quote> However, the differences
                        and repetitions involved in returning, retracing, or re-treating
                        “Christabel” show that there is something that perhaps gripped Coleridge in
                        a third sense that even Stillinger, despite the modification he makes to his
                        own argument, has not yet taken into account. For if the quantity of
                        revision in a Coleridge poem should indicate more determinate authorial
                        intention, and if less revision indicates a more indeterminate intention,
                        Stillinger does not account for the fact that in “Christabel” there is
                        considerable revision that appears <emph>insignificant </emph>but still
                        compounds the indeterminacy of the text’s meaning. If we invert Stillinger’s
                        argument, this third sense of revision is defined by changes whose
                        negativity turns over and over again around an insoluble secret which
                        retreats from the author, thereby substituting the fetish of revision for
                        clarification. Despite his claiming that he had a clear intention in his
                        mind, “Christabel” appeared to have a libidinal hold on Coleridge that he
                        could not quite shake, as can be seen in his inability to truly revise the
                        poem, that is, not until his first attempt to relinquish it by giving it
                        over to the public by means of its publication in 1816. In this manner, the
                        endless revisions delayed ever having to end the poem, and thus prolonged
                        Coleridge’s libidinal relation to the text, since, in the words of Žižek in
                            <title level="m">Looking Awry</title> (1991), desire “does not consist
                        in its being ‘fulfilled,’‘fully satisfied,’” but “coincides rather with the
                        reproduction of desire as such, with its circular movement” (7). </p>

                  <p> Coleridge, as many know, had at best an ambivalent relationship with the
                        public sphere in England. “The word ‘public,’ he claimed, was ‘of pernicious
                        effect by habituating every Reader to consider himself as the Judge &amp;
                        therefore Superior of the Writer,’” and Coleridge believed, in the words of
                        Lucy Newlyn, that “readers were . . . appealed to as an infallible
                        judge: he dismissed them himself, sweepingly, as ‘the half-instructed Many’”
                        (qtd. in Newlyn 52). Coleridge’s general dismissal of the growing reading

                            “Christabel” from publication can be read more generally in terms of
                            Romanticism and its relation to “publics” and “counter-publics.” For
                            instance, the intentional act of withholding a work from publication
                            shows that the unpublished is at times dialectically related to the
                            published in the same way that spheres of the counter-public attempt to
                            respond to the hegemony of the public sphere. Andrew Franta’s argument
                            in <title level="m">Romanticism and the Rise of the Mass Public</title>
                            (2007), “that the regime of publicity could be employed to manipulate
                            the very notion of representation—not by transforming debate into
                            consumption but by bypassing debate altogether,” signals that
                            Coleridge’s anxiety over the public’s power to bypass interpretation
                            altogether was an all too common concern (33). For more research

                        seemingly be read as a dismissal of his early communitarian ideals such as
                        his scheme with Robert Southey to establish a Pantisocracy; this dismissal,
                        it would seem, is further reinforced by his later desire for the
                        establishment of the “clerisy” class in <title level="m">On the Constitution
                            of Church and State</title> (1829). As Jon Klancher notes in <title level="m">The Making of English Reading Audiences</title> (1980),
                        Coleridge’s “clerics were meant to be . . . masters of
                        interpretation,” that is, they were meant to take possession of what could
                        be read, “to rule in and rule out the possible readings of social and
                        cultural discourse,” effectively mirroring Coleridge’s relationship with his
                        own texts as simultaneous critic and interpreter (5, 136). However, as
                        Newlyn argues, “[i]f Coleridge’s ideas about literary ownership reflected
                        his political ambivalence, more generally, towards the idea of property,
                        they can also be read as paradigmatic of the transitional status of the
                        author at the time <title level="m">Biographia </title>was published” (69).
                        What Newlyn shows is that Coleridge’s anxiety over the reader is not merely
                        an anxiety concerning his work’s reception by the public sphere; his anxiety
                        was both internal and external. The unpublishability of “Christabel”
                        directly threatens Coleridge’s idea of a class of readers that have the
                        ability to judge and interpret texts, and, therefore, represents a danger to
                        himself and to the very community of the clerisy that he envisions.
                        Coleridge’s retreat can then be read as symptomatic of his growing anxiety
                        over the poet’s failure to critically engage with and direct the
                        constitution of that public sphere, because “Christabel” is as much about a
                        neurotic obsession over an unconstitutable negativity as it is a repression
                        of that negativity, confronting its readers with a poem that remains
                        consumed with an anxiety regarding its own publishability. Taken this way,
                        Coleridge’s decision to finally publish the poem in 1816 may be read not
                        only as a historical fact, but can be read through the lens of Lacanian
                        anxiety, as Žižek argues, because “it is not the lack of the object that
                        gives rise to anxiety but, on the contrary, the danger of our getting too
                        close to the object and thus losing the lack itself”; taken this way,
                        Coleridge’s anxious revisions provide insight into the complex relation that
                        anxiety has to desire at the level of publication, as “[a]nxiety is brought
                        on by the disappearance of desire” (8).</p>
                  <p>Through withholding a work from publication, the negative right to retreat
                        not only disturbs the notion of work as a material object, but also
                        deconstructs the insistence of public sphere theorists––such as Jürgen
                        Habermas and Clifford Siskin––that literature must be interpreted as a work
                        of writing under a discourse of the professionalization of the author. Even
                        in its early conception, “Christabel” was defined by its own
                        unpublishability. The poem was originally planned for the second volume of
                        the 1800 version of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, but
                        instead was replaced with Wordsworth’s “Michael,” which Wordsworth quickly
                        finished off in order to fill in the gap. The reason for the replacement is
                        not known, but we do know that Wordsworth, in a letter to his publishers,
                        Longman and Rees, stated, “upon mature deliberation I found that the Style
                        of this Poem was so discordant from my own that it could not be printed
                        along with my poems with any propriety” (qtd. in Gamer and Porter 31). After
                        1800, Coleridge circulated and performed versions of “Christabel” for
                        friends and family, and, as Christopher Laxer notes, the poem gained
                        popularity among the British reading public due to the fact that Coleridge
                        “controlled all access to his poem and could frame the perception of it in
                        any way he liked” (169). However, while Laxer argues that Coleridge held on
                        to “Christabel” because “publication itself shines a destructive and
                        leveling sort of light” (176), one could argue that Coleridge began to lose
                        control over “Christabel” well before its publication, at both the level of
                        writing as well as at the level of performance. Indeed, Walter Scott did not
                        hear it first from Coleridge, but from Sarah Stoddart in 1802, showing that
                        well before its publication the poem had already begun to circulate outside
                        of Coleridge’s immediate control. Furthermore, the impression that
                        “Christabel” left on Scott was seen not only in its metrical resonances in
                            <title level="m">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title>, but also in
                        Scott’s recitation of the poem, which, it turns out, was how Lord Byron had
                        “first heard the poem . . . at his publisher Murray’s house on
                        Albermale street,” which in turn is the reason for Byron’s involvement in
                        putting Coleridge in touch with Murray, who later published the poem in 1816
                        (Laxer 170). Indeed, Coleridge, when he first wrote the <title level="m">Preface</title> to “Christabel” for its initial publication, “feared
                        his own work would appear derivative of precisely those poems and poetic
                        identities that it had helped to shape” (28), as Tilar Mazzeo notes in
                            <title level="m">Plagiarism and Literary Property in the Romantic
                            Period</title> (2007). Mazzeo continues, “Christabel” “had been widely
                        circulated in manuscript among the literary coterie, and, as Coleridge knew,
                        the poem had influenced the compositions of some of his more celebrated
                        contemporaries, including Lord Byron and Walter Scott” (27). For this
                        reason, Coleridge ends his preface to “Christabel” with a “doggerel version
                        of two monkish Latin hexameters”:<quote>

                     </quote> From one perspective, Coleridge’s decision to
                        withhold “Christabel” from publication can be read as an attempt to preserve
                        a relationship between author and text. But every time Coleridge returns to
                        the text, it signals a further loss of authority. It is important to note
                        that the decision to remove the poem from <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> arose out of an agreement between Coleridge and
                        Wordsworth, allowing us to read this decision to quarantine the poem not
                        only as a means to preserve Wordsworth’s style, but also to preserve
                        Coleridge’s own. While “Wordsworth’s exclusion” of the poem, argues Jerome
                        Christensen, “registers the threat that [“Christabel”] represented as
                            <emph>text</emph> (and, in the character of Geraldine as performative
                        theory of the rhetorical power of texts) to the <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> as book,” the non-publication of “Christabel” was also
                        extended to Coleridge’s other publications, when Coleridge did not include
                        the poem in the quarto volume containing “Fears in Solitude” (217). And when
                        “Christabel” was finally published alongside “Kubla Khan” and “The Pains of
                        Sleep,” it is telling that Coleridge did not try to publish the poems as a
                        book, but rather, as Stillinger has called it in <title level="m">Romantic
                            Complexity</title>, “a pamphlet,” a medium of print that, ever since the
                        sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, because of the influence of Calvin and
                        Luther, was overwhelmingly political (<title level="m">Romantic Complexity
                        </title>163). The pamphlet, as Laurel Brake argues, is profoundly dialogic
                        and in “dialogue with other agents of print and speech,” and to quote Orwell
                        in Brake’s essay, “it is written because there is something that one wants
                        to say now . . . in essence it is always a protest” (3). </p>
                  <p>And yet, the pamphlet is also closer to the fragment<note place="foot">Because Romanticists have long approached “Christabel” as a fragment
                            poem, it is important to mention some of the most important work on the
                            Romantic fragment, such as Marjorie Levinson’s <title level="m">The
                                Romantic Fragment Poem: A Critique of a Form</title> (1978) and

                            intentional form, I argue that “Christabel” evokes the externally
                            unintended, unanticipated, and traumatic sense of Malabou’s use of the
                            term “effraction,” which requires a shift of focus away from the
                            fragment as an unfinished project towards something more akin to the
                            project’s disintegration, which is radically more negative.</note> or
                        even the manuscript than to the serialized publication or the book, since
                        pamphlets were “normally unbound . . . [and] not always aimed at
                        public, or <emph>wide circulation</emph>” (Brake 8). Indeed, as is shown in
                        a letter Coleridge wrote to Sarah Stoddart in 1803, Coleridge’s intention to
                        publish “Christabel” remained always in flux. Insofar as he considered
                        publishing it, his plan was at least never to put it in a “guinea volume,”
                        as Karen Swann notes: Coleridge “[refused] Sotheby and the ten gentlemen
                        [that accompanied him], [so that] Coleridge [stood] on his literary
                        principles” and would rather have “Christabel” published on Ballad paper
                        (397). Thus on the one hand, the pamphlet, like the ballad sheet, is still
                        aligned with the publicity of print and is categorically different from the
                        private circulation of manuscript culture. But, on the other hand, if the
                        pamphlet remains a medium of print that is devoted to protest, it also
                        troubles the Habermasian conception of the public sphere, which, as Lee
                        Morrissey argues, is based on the false “presumption of a mutually
                        reinforcing relationship between literary criticism and democracy” (2).
                        Instead, the publication of “Christabel” in the form of a pamphlet
                        participates in and simultaneously questions the very form in which the
                        public sphere is constituted, inasmuch as Coleridge attempts to publish a
                        text that thematizes its own retreat from the circulation of a symbolic
                        order. The medium of the pamphlet invites readers to consider the
                        relationship between literature and the public sphere as one that is not
                        mutually reinforcing, but rather unstable and even antagonistic, since the
                        pamphlet’s engagement with the political does not have the transparency of a
                        Habermasian communicative rationality. Much like de Man’s conception of
                        language, which “combines a logical side, which it is possible to decode,
                        and a ‘tropological’ or metaphorical side, which stays as a ‘residue of
                        indetermination’ after a decoding of the grammar has occurred,” Morrissey
                        argues that literature opens the political to that which is left unread,
                        which results in the paradox: “the avoidance of one side of the meaning is
                        unavoidable” (9). As opposed to Coleridge’s hope that the clerisy would be
                        able to become critic and interpreter for the public sphere, the revisions
                        he made to “Christabel” before and after publication thus commit him to a
                        different conception of the political and the public sphere that remains
                        under erasure. Because of the act of revision, as well as the choice of
                        publishing in the form of the pamphlet, the boundary between the published
                        and the unpublished, or the public sphere and the (un)public sphere remains
                        in question, leaving open the indeterminacy that ungrounds them both.</p>

                            to the work of Jean Bellemin-Noël, “the totality of the material written
                            for any project that was first made public” (31), so that any return to
                            those pieces that remained unpublished represents an attempt to read the
                            collection of manuscripts, notebooks, and other texts in the space
                            surrounding a published text psychoanalytically rather than for
                            continuity. The concept of the <emph>avant-texte</emph> is related more
                            generally to the field of genetic criticism, a mode of textual studies
                            and textual history that moves the study of manuscripts away from merely
                            establishing a fair or accurate copy of a text. Reading genetically
                            moves one away from reading for the “final” text, and provides readers a
                            way of dialectically relating the <emph>avant-texte</emph> to the
                            published or public text in order to re-construct the writing
                            process.</note> so as to “reconstruct the configurations of unconscious
                        desires that [allow] themselves to be seen” in “Christabel,” which opens the
                        possibility to reconstruct the “unconscious discourse [that] slips into
                        conscious discourse” (6). While it has been noted that Coleridge rarely
                        changed “Christabel” in significant ways, the one major revision comes in
                        the form of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>,
                        which was originally from a letter addressed to Robert Southey dated May
                        6th, 1801, and which was later transposed into the first published version
                        in 1816. <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> of
                        “Christabel” is so strangely placed that it somehow appears out of place.
                        Indeed, if we compare the 1816 version of the poem with its prior versions,
                        there is no Conclusion of any kind, so that the
                            <foreign>avant-texte</foreign> provides us with a more formally
                        fragmentary and unstable poem; even the first of two transcripts by Sarah
                        Stoddart ends with the words, “A fragment” (Stillinger, <title level="m">Coleridge</title> 214). In a poem so obscurely uncertain of itself, the
                            <title level="m">Conclusion</title> appears as yet another failed
                        attempt made by Coleridge to close off the poem and make it ready for the
                        public. And yet, this crossing-out or repression of the poem’s fragmentary
                        condition indicates an attempt at “a mechanism of production” (Bellemin-Noël
                        6), because “[negation],” as Freud has noted, “is a way of taking cognizance
                        of what is repressed; indeed it is already a lifting of the repression,
                        though not, of course, an acceptance of what is repressed” (235–36). Because
                        the transcripts leave the reader with Sir Leoline leading forth Geraldine,
                        and because the narrator of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title> appears unwilling to admit the psychological trauma that
                        is central to the text yet exceeds the limits that <title level="m">The
                            Conclusion </title>attempts to impose, Christabel seems more abjected in
                        the first published version of 1816 than in the various earlier versions.
                        Rather than concluding the poem, then, <title level="m">The Conclusion to
                            Part the Second </title>disfigures the very possibility of completion,
                        for it replaces the thematic of the mother and daughter relationship found
                        in <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the First</title> and substitutes
                        the Wandering Mother for the Name of the Father. When Christabel confronts
                        Sir Leoline, entreating him to send Geraldine away, we do not see a
                        resolution, but instead the Baron is revolted by his own daughter, as the
                        narrator explains, “[i]f thoughts, like these, had any share, / They only
                        swell’d his rage and pain, / And did but work confusion there” (“Christabel”
                        625–27). This rage Sir Leoline feels is fueled by Christabel’s perceived
                        incongruity with the symbolic order, which the father wishes to establish by
                        means of exchanging Geraldine for the renewed friendship of Lord Roland de
                        Vaux of Tryermaine, a friendship long lost that left a hole in both men’s
                        hearts “[l]ike cliffs which had been rent asunder” (“Christabel” 410). Since
                        “never either found another / [t]o free the hollow heart from paining”
                        (“Christabel” 407–08), Geraldine functions as a means of re-establishing
                        discourse between the two men, and thereby restoring the homosocial bond
                        with Lord Roland by means of the feminine signifier. As Kristeva says of the
                        father’s relation to the abject in <title level="m">Powers of Horror</title>
                        (1982), “a representative of the paternal function takes the place of the
                        good maternal object that is wanting,” resulting in discourse “being
                        substituted for maternal care” (45). What <title level="m">The Conclusion to
                            Part the Second</title> effectively represses is not merely Christabel,
                        but the conflict that is staged at the end of <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title>, that is the conflict between speech and the unspeakable.
                        Taken this way, the repression of Christabel’s inability to speak results in
                        the text’s missed opportunity to engage with the retreating retreat, which
                        then haunts the poem in Coleridge’s repeated attempts to revise the
                        poem.</p>
                  <p> Arguably the narrator of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title> is “Coleridge,” inserting himself to limit the poem by
                        means of form and genre, and is separate from the narration that is present
                        throughout <title level="m">Part the First</title>, <title level="m">The
                            Conclusion to Part the First</title>, and <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title>. While both narrators are characterized by a tendency to
                        repress that which they cannot accept, the first narrator appears at least
                        willing to show but not tell, while the second narrator appears to downplay
                        the experience of Christabel altogether, and instead shifts the perspective
                        to the experience of the father as a kind of substitute for the authority of
                        the writer. That <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>
                        also originates from a letter Coleridge wrote to Southey is yet another
                        indication of Coleridge’s new presence at the end of the poem. Much like the
                        way <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> focuses on
                        the role of the father as a means of further shifting focus away from
                        “Christabel”’s unfinished ending, the fact that Coleridge replaces the more
                        descriptive narration of the first narrator with a theorization on the
                        “words of unmeant bitterness” (“Christabel” 652) indicates a retreat away
                        from the unconscious of the text; for even in <title level="m">The
                            Conclusion to Part the First</title>, the narrator appears unwilling to
                        tell but still knows of the “sorrow and shame” (“Christabel” 296) that had
                        taken place between Christabel and Geraldine. Even in the <title level="m">Biographia</title>, Coleridge attempts to downplay the spectral
                        presence of the unknown in “Christabel”, describing it rather as a “work . .
                        . that pretended to be nothing more than a common Faery Tale” (238). <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> also presents
                        Coleridge explicitly attempting to impose the generic form of the fairy tale
                        to “Christabel,”<quote>

                     </quote> But what is it that Christabel finds? On the contrary, is
                        she not seeking something at the beginning of the poem? One can see the
                        split in the narration between that which comes before and after <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>, as the first
                        narrator even admits his confusion as to why Christabel is seeking something
                        that “makes her in the wood so late, / A furlong from the castle gate”
                        (“Christabel” 25–26), while the second narrator, “Coleridge,” seems to have
                        a slightly sadistic relation to Christabel’s desolation, as can be gleaned
                        from the assertion that it is “tender too and pretty / [a]t each wild word
                        to feel within / A sweet recoil of love and pity” (“Christabel” 672–74). But
                        while the narrators of the poem fail to recognize that Christabel seeks
                        recognition––which she finds in the figure of Geraldine, though
                        negatively––they, along with Geraldine as “A sight to dream of, not to
                        tell!” (“Christabel” 248), and the Wandering Mother that only Geraldine
                        seems capable of seeing and interacting with, are symptoms of Coleridge’s
                        repression of the absence that the text does not or cannot speak. For the
                        first narrator describes the traumatic encounter but does not seem to
                        realize that it has taken place, whereas the second narrator attempts to
                        sentimentalize the poem as a means of containing the trauma that comes
                        through at the level of writing; for the second narrator is not willing to
                        give voice to the trauma of the text, though it is recognized negatively by
                        means of the addition of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title>, which represses the ending of <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title> . This traumatic absence comes through, and “even
                        contrives,” to quote J.C.C. Mays, “to become a metrical event” in the tale,
                        so “that the true subject of the poem is only part-contained in words” (72).
                        For instance, the em-dash that occurs when Christabel first hears the moan
                        on the other side of the old oak tree, “It moan’d as near, as near can be, /
                        But what it is, she cannot tell,—” (“Christabel” 41–42) the break in
                        narration at line 42 implies the unknown known of the text, that is, in the
                        words of Joel Faflak, the “de-humanizing generation of affect that resists
                        intellectual or textual containment” (145). </p>
                  <p> Whereas Coleridge’s non-publication of “Christabel” could be read as a
                        voluntary retreat, a decision to withhold the poem from the public as a
                        means to contain its fragmentary condition, the publication of the poem
                        presents the reading public with the involuntary retreat of Christabel as
                        subject. This involuntary retreat clashes with the assumed Romantic retreat
                        of the poet from the world of politics into nature, as Christabel does not
                        retreat as a placeholder or reserve to re-treat the political “world of
                        death” (Coleridge 321). Christabel’s withdrawal signals a way of reading the
                        retreat at a further remove from historicist narratives that read
                        Romanticism as an intentional retreat away from the public, because
                        “Christabel” as text and Christabel as character both present specifically
                        involuntary examples of the retreat that do not conform to preconceived
                        Romantic shelters in the natural or the transcendental, thus forcing us to
                        re-think these issues more generally. Consequently, the difference between
                        the voluntary and involuntary here shows that the initial retreat of
                        non-publication still implies a will to power, a hope for completion, and
                        for an end to the infinite project of writing that is implied in Coleridge’s
                            <title level="m">Preface</title> to the poem. There, he writes,
                            <quote>But as, in my very first conception of the tale, I had the whole
                            present to my mind, with the wholeness, no less than with the liveliness

                            parts yet to come, in the course of the present year. (<title level="m">Preface</title> 161)</quote> It is telling that by the last version

                        included in the text’s <title level="m">Preface</title>. Instead, what we
                        are left with is Christabel’s involuntary withdrawal from language “in the
                        touch” of Geraldine’s “bosom” that becomes the “lord of [Christabel’s]
                        utterance” (“Christabel” 255–56). </p>
                  <p> This scene has its parallel with Hegel’s description of the master-slave
                        dialectic in <title level="m">The Phenomenology of Spirit</title> (1807).
                        There, Hegel argues that once the difference between master and slave is
                        achieved, the dialectic gives way to a new moment when “servitude in its
                        consummation will really turn into the opposite of what it immediately is;
                        [because] as a consciousness forced back into itself, it will withdraw into
                        itself and be transformed by independent consciousness” (117). It is then
                        that the difference is negated once again, resulting in a negation of the
                        previous negation, which is meant to provide the grounds for liberated
                        consciousness. Christabel’s withdrawal, on the other hand, appears to show
                        that the involuntariness of that retreat presents itself as an effraction
                        that results in disaffection, neutrality, and the inevitability of
                        abjection. Instead of the liberation of consciousness Hegel describes,
                        Geraldine is not present for her, because she is rather another symptom of
                        absence, so that Christabel’s encounter with Geraldine eliminates and voids
                        recognition as evidenced by the effect of Geraldine’s “serpent’s eye” upon Christabel.<quote>

                        that Hegel expects, Christabel internalizes Geraldine’s absence, because
                        Geraldine represents in the text an absence in the form of the Lacanian

                        Geraldine could no longer be the “lord of thy utterance” and the mechanism
                        by which language continues to circulate and thus perpetuate the symbolic

                        far as she goes, is successful”; but the success, the achievement that is
                        Geraldine, stands in contrast to Coleridge’s failure to complete the three
                        parts yet to come. <quote> [T]he reason for my not finishing Christabel is

                            409–10)</quote> The missing parts to “Christabel” have become a kind of
                        trope at the level of composition for reading the poem as a failure, partly
                        due to Coleridge’s habit of constantly telling people that he had “the whole
                        present to [his] mind, with the wholeness, no less than with the liveliness
                        of a vision” (<title level="m">Preface </title>161). But the publication of
                        “Christabel” alongside “Kubla Khan” and “The Pains of Sleep” indicates a
                        thematic ambivalence with respect to making known the unknown that these
                        texts seem to communicate at the level of affect. For instance, the affect
                        in “Kubla Khan” is nostalgic, as the narrative voice asks itself if it is
                        possible to accomplish its desire, the narrator questioning, “[c]ould I
                        revive within me / Her symphony and song / . . . I would build
                        that dome in air” (“Kubla Khan” 42–43, 46); and, in “The Pains of Sleep,”
                        what is communicated is the affective anxiety that comes from desiring to
                        withdraw from “[d]eeds to be hid which were not hid, / Which all confused I
                        could not know, / Whether I suffered, or I did” (“The Pains of Sleep”
                        27–29). Until the pamphlet’s first printing, one could read the retreat from
                        publication as a desire to withhold—to be with and to hold on to—these
                        poems, both out of a desire for completion and because of Coleridge’s
                        fascination with the poem, for Coleridge was in many ways compelled to
                        recite “Christabel” “in societies of the most different kinds” (<title level="m">Biographia</title> 238). And yet the act of publication, if we
                        take the verb “to publish” literally in its meaning “to make something
                        public” or “to make something known,” can be read as Coleridge’s attempt to
                        retreat from his relation to the poem, as he literally gives over
                        “Christabel” to the public, which would be in line with Peter Melville’s
                        approach to reading Coleridge’s poetics “through the fort-da mechanism”
                        (107). If the figure of Geraldine is the success of “Christabel,” perhaps
                        the failure to write the next three parts is due to the effect of
                        representing that “witchery by daylight,” resulting in a text that is
                        mesmerized by but can never actually speak its desire. As <foreign>objet
                            petit a</foreign>, Geraldine stands for the absolute negativity of the
                        Real, but, by the same token, remains a part of the text so as to generate
                        desire in all its manifestations. In this sense, Geraldine guarantees the
                        libidinal economy of the text, but one that, as Kristeva argues, “maintains
                        the symbolic order through exclusion” (Kristeva 10). Coleridge’s pleasure in
                        reading aloud can then be read against the grain as the pleasurable pain of
                            <foreign>jouissance</foreign>, as he even remarks in the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> concerning the experience of the
                        “enkindling Reciter,” that it “is equally possible” that “a reader left to
                        himself should sink below the poem, as that the poem left to itself should
                        flag beneath the feelings of the reader” (<title level="m">Biographia
                        </title>239–40). As Coleridge was well aware, it was possible for a reader
                        to be enlivened by the performance of a poem, but the affective potential of
                        a poem may be too overwhelming in solitude; as such, Coleridge’s decision to
                        publish comes from the need for the distance of publication, of
                        relinquishing the text to a public, to preserve the desire for completion by
                        retreating from the poem itself, in the same way that he discusses the
                        possibility of pleasurable pain at the end of the poem: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> However, the act of publication does not rid Coleridge of
                        his relation to “Christabel,” as is shown in the revisions that he makes in
                        the versions after publication, specifically those found in the five marked
                        copies of the 1816 version, and furthermore from the eleventh version to the
                        eighteenth version. For none of these additions clarify the text.
                        Significantly, the prose glosses, like those added to “The Rime of the
                        Ancient Mariner” (1798), further obscure and contribute to the fantastic
                        elements of the text: for instance, the annotations that Coleridge made to
                        lines 249–55 in 1824, “As soon as the wicked Bosom, with the mysterious sign
                        of Evil stamped thereby, touches Christabel, she is deprived of the power of
                        disclosing what has occurred” (169). Indeed, Coleridge’s lifelong revision
                        of the poem exemplifies a relationship to the text that is emblematic of
                        what Tilottama Rajan calls the “textual abject” (45). In her article, “Mary
                        Shelley’s ‘Mathilda’: Melancholy and the Political Economy of Romanticism”
                        (1994), Rajan distinguishes the “textual abject” from Kristeva’s concept of
                        the abject, thereby transposing it into a means of reading Romanticism’s
                        tendency to re-cover, “both in the sense of redeeming and of covering up,
                        the abject by absorbing its affect into narrative and explanatory
                        structures” (45). The textual abject, as opposed to the Kristevan abject, is
                        introjected instead of being cast out, because the relation becomes internal
                        to the subject in contrast to the way that Christabel at the end of the poem
                        is left abjected from the text’s libidinal economy. Indeed, the text itself
                        retreats from the abject by casting it out in so many unreadable moments,
                        and repeats Coleridge’s lifelong return and rejection of the poem, whose
                        traumatic core he cannot confront except by retreating from the facticity of
                        Christabel’s final abjection. </p>
                  <p> While the primary scene of unreadability wherein Geraldine reveals herself
                        to Christabel has been “read” many times as a lesbian fantasy or as a
                        demonic enchantment which threatens Christabel’s purity and innocence, these
                        prurient readings arguably remain under the same fantasy that Coleridge
                        himself perpetuates by re-turning and re-treating the text so as to re-cover
                        a relationship to the symbolic order, to quote Žižek once again, which
                        spares him “the encounter with the real of [his] desire” (60). Prior to
                        publication, Coleridge never changed the scene, but neither could he narrate
                        Geraldine’s body. Instead, he leaves us with a fragmented body, “Behold! her
                        bosom and half her side—” (“Christabel” 246), but somehow this body should
                        be “full in view” (“Christabel” 245). Another em-dash gives rise to the
                        narrator’s decision to cover over the encounter, so that this is a “sight to
                        dream of, not to tell” although one that “is to sleep by Christabel”
                        (“Christabel” 247–48). It is here, after the publication of the 1816
                        version, that Coleridge makes one of the most substantive changes to the
                        poem, as is shown in marginal and interlinear annotations in copies of the
                        1816 version of the text, where he replaces on “And she is to sleep by
                        Christabel” with “O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!” (Stillinger <title level="m">Coleridge</title> 85). In later additions<note place="foot">

                        </lg>
                     </quote> The most common interpretation of these changes is that
                        they result from a public outcry against the poem; however, if we read the
                        published text against its<foreign> avant-texte</foreign>, the dramatic
                        interruption of the narrator, “shield sweet Christabel,” covers over the
                        indifference present in the punctuation of earlier versions in the lines
                        such as “And she is to sleep by Christabel,” as well as “And lay down by the
                        maiden’s side” (“Christabel” 248, 250). In contrast to the earlier versions,
                        the later versions intimate a much more dramatic and anxious narration, the
                        lines cut vertically with multiple exclamation marks, which constantly
                        interrupt the text. However, the exclamation marks interrupt in a way that
                        is different from the horizontal em-dashes, which present moments of
                        unspeakable silence, in much the same way that Derrida describes the secret
                        as that which “is without content, without a content separable from its
                        performative experience” (24). Reading the versions genetically from the
                        earliest versions before publication to those after publication allows
                        readers to see the changes Coleridge makes to the passage as not merely with
                        a view to the public’s reception of the poem. Rather, the revisions
                        themselves stand in for Coleridge’s failed attempts at solving the problem
                        that arises from keeping the encounter of Christabel and Geraldine in
                        reserve. This foreclosure that prevents Coleridge from disclosing this
                        moment of the text is thus performative of the economy of the text, an
                        economy ungrounded by its own recourse to negativity, and which retreats
                        from that thing which cannot be re-invested in the economy: the secret as
                        absolute reserve.</p>
                  <p> This absolute reserve remains a “sight to dream of, not to tell” and thus
                        arrests Coleridge in such a way that he spends most of the second part of
                        the poem trying to de-mystify the foreclosed disclosure. Unlike Christabel
                        and Bard Bracy, where the former can see but cannot tell while the latter
                        can tell but cannot see Geraldine for what she is not, Sir Leoline sees
                        “this Geraldine,” and deems “her sure a thing divine” (“Christabel” 463–64).
                        For the Baron, Geraldine becomes the empty signifier upon which he can
                        re-constitute a relation to the public sphere with Lord Roland, and forget
                        the loss of his wife and a present life that he calls explicitly, “a world
                        of death” (“Christabel” 321). Whereas Coleridge, in <title level="m">On the
                            Constitution of Church and State</title> (1829), outlines the balance of
                        the State by means of three estates, specifically the Barons (the
                        land-owners), the merchants (the distributive class), and the clerics (those
                        in charge of the cultivation of civilization), “Christabel” offers a
                        narrative that shows the limits of reason in the prose text, showing a much
                        more affective and repressive imbalance foregrounded in the later political
                        text. In <title level="m">Church and State</title>, Coleridge argues that
                        the state relies on the “balance of the two great correspondent, at once
                        supporting and counterpoising, interests of the state, its
                            <emph>permanence</emph> and its <emph>progression</emph>” (<title level="m">Church and State </title>21; my emphasis). For Coleridge, this
                        harmony plays itself out between the two houses, “the first consisting
                        wholly of barons or landholders, permanent and hereditary senators” and “the
                        second comprising the merchants, the manufacturers, free artizans, and the
                        distributive class” (<title level="m">Church and State </title>21, 33). The
                        copula that ties these two together, according to Coleridge, is the clergy
                        or clerisy. The national clerisy are to be made up of people who are to
                        “remain at the fountain heads of the humanities, in cultivating and
                        enlarging the knowledge they already possessed, and in watching over the
                        interests of physical and moral science,” and this community is to be
                        distributed throughout the country, as was previously stated above (<title level="m">Church and State </title>34). </p>
                  <p> If we use Coleridge’s schemata from <title level="m">Church and
                            State</title> as an optic for the characters of “Christabel,” we can see
                        corresponding figures of permanence and clerisy in Sir Leoline and Bard
                        Bracy respectively. Indeed, Bard Bracy’s position in the text is to
                        interpret in the same way Coleridge describes the objectives of the clerisy:
                        “to preserve the stores, to guard the treasures, of past civilization, and
                        thus to bind the present with the past; to perfect and add to the same, and
                        thus to connect the present with the future” (<title level="m">Church and
                            State</title> 34). In contrast with the “custom and law” (“Christabel”
                        326) that Sir Leoline represents, Bard Bracy’s interpretation of his dreams
                        positions him as a proto-analyst of the internal state of the psyche, but at
                        the same time, his role seems to extend towards the external as well, as is
                        evident in his desire to delay Sir Leoline’s order to seek out Lord Roland
                        so as to go out and investigate the woods. As Bracy states, “[t]his day my
                        journey should not be,” (“Christabel” 528) because the dream is a sign that
                        there is something wrong with the world. <quote>

                     </quote> When Sir Leoline only “Half-listening hear[s]”
                        (“Christabel” 553) Bard Bracy’s dream interpretation, his indifference to
                        the Bard’s request represses the role of the clerisy as analyst of the mind
                        and of the world, and, in fact, goes further by mistaking Bracy’s
                        interpretation to mean that Geraldine was “Lord Roland’s beauteous dove,”
                        and vows “With arms more strong than harp or song, / Thy sire and I will
                        crush the snake” (“Christabel” 557–59), the snake being his actual daughter,
                        Christabel. As opposed to the ideal of the clerisy Coleridge sets out in
                            <title level="m">Church and State</title>, “The bard obey[s]”
                        (“Christabel” 640) the orders of Sir Leoline, and thus represses the role
                        that balances the order of permanence with that of progress, which leaves a
                        world out of balance and Christabel alone and silent at the end of the text.
                        That Bracy is able to interpret the dream but fails to intervene in the
                        world demonstrates that the clerisy and the poet alike assume a politics of
                        the future like that of the narrator of the poem, “That saints will aid if
                        men will call: / For the blue sky bends over all” (“Christabel” 318–19).
                        However, if it is a prayer, it is one that does not inspire hope, but that
                        echoes out into a poem characterized by what Malabou calls the theatre of
                        absence, “the privileged expression of affective impoverishment and
                        destructive metamorphosis” (“Retreat” 41). The invocation of the social at
                        the end of “Christabel” reveals, on the one hand, an incapacity to move
                        beyond the fantasy that relies on a future-oriented return to a public
                        sphere, and on the other hand, it shows that this attachment requires a
                        sacrifice to the future that Christabel represents as the abject that must
                        be excluded. But, like the prayer that echoes out into nowhere, Coleridge’s
                        three parts yet to come fail to materialize because “Christabel” returns
                        Coleridge back to the point of abjection, and provokes his return to the
                        unspeakable moment at the end of <title level="m">Part the First</title>
                        instead of proceeding further into the fantasy of the social. This
                        unspeakable moment, the trauma from which Christabel withdraws, enacts
                        Coleridge’s desire to go back into the past of the text rather than keep
                        moving forward, for indifference destroys the possibility of fantasy, as a
                        result of the deep effraction, the wound from which Christabel suffers but
                        cannot communicate. It is perhaps, for this reason, that so many readers
                        return to “Christabel” because, in the words of Bard Bracy, it “would not
                        pass away––” and “seems to live upon [the] eye” (“Christabel” 546–47).</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">This paper takes up Godwin’s fourth major novel, <title level="m">Mandeville</title> (1817), and explores its extreme negativity as a
                    recursive space for the stalled revolutionary energies of what Godwin saw as the
                    only period in British history worthy of “genuine and independent man”: the
                    period of the Civil Wars and the “English Revolution,” which had many resonances
                    with his own time. The novel, which begins with the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and
                    ends on the eve of the Restoration, is a catachresis: a historical novel whose
                    protagonist never enters history as he progressively retreats into the closet of
                    his psychic history. At its center is the misanthropic protagonist’s “eternal
                    war” on his rival and future brother-in-law Clifford, who prvides an alibi for
                    an almost pathological deconstruction of normativity. The story ends shockingly
                    with Mandeville’s accidental defacement by Clifford, an effraction that
                    dis-figures all schemes of restoration. But the novel is by no means the
                    “domestic story” that Godwin’s publisher wanted to make it, as Mandeville’s
                    damaged life is a symptom, “imprinted by history and the process of history’s
                    destruction of the body” (Foucault). Approaching the text within the political
                    unconscious of seventeenth-century religious politics, I see the fanaticism that
                    provides the text’s historical backdrop and its later secularization as
                    misanthropy as tropes that must be turned back and in on themselves to discern
                    whether history is absolute negation or the site of a <emph>dissensus</emph>
                    whose potential comes forth warped and convoluted by a culture that represses
                    its underlying contradictions. </p>

                  <p>The year 1817 in England was a period of new dissident activity that witnessed a
                    renewed series of Gagging Acts.<note place="foot">Godwin began writing <title level="m">Mandeville</title> in 1816 and completed the first volume in
                        January 1817; he received the proofs of the second volume back on May 16th
                        and completed the novel in October 1817. The Seditious Meetings Act and the
                        Treason Act were both passed in March, 1817. These were renewals of the
                        similarly named acts of 1795 which were due to expire because of a sunset
                        clause, and about which Godwin had written, quite temperately, in
                        “Considerations on Lord Grenville’s and Mr. Pitt’s Bills.” A <title level="m">Habeas Corpus</title> Suspension Act was also passed in 1817;
                        there had been similar acts in 1798 and 1799.</note> In December of that
                    year, Godwin published <title level="m">Mandeville: A Tale of the Seventeenth
                        Century in England</title>, a novel of stalled revolution and psychic war,
                    the writing of which had been particularly slow by his standards. The novel
                    follows a hiatus of twelve years after the appearance of his third major novel
                        <title level="m">Fleetwood</title> (1805), a space of withdrawal and
                    negation—or a retreat in the sense theorized elsewhere in this collection by
                    Marc Mazur—that is by no means insignificant.</p>
                  <p> After <title level="m">Caleb Williams </title>(1795), Godwin had begun to write
                    a world history in bits and pieces, which, like the figure of the burrow that
                    Deleuze and Guattari use to describe “minor literature” (3), has many entrances
                    and rules of usage that Godwin probes through Greece, Renaissance Europe,
                    seventeenth-century and Restoration England, and through genres as different as
                    biography, children’s books, actual histories, novels, and interventions in
                    current affairs such as his extension of the population debate to the global
                    implications of the Irish situation.<note place="foot">In a contribution to
                            <title level="m">The Morning Chronicle</title> on “Ireland” (1821),
                        Godwin attributes the burgeoning population of Ireland to poverty, and sees
                        Britain’s miserable treatment of this minor country as a global problem that
                        could well reopen the tenuous and false “peace” achieved by Britain’s
                        victory at Waterloo (473).</note> Godwin was always interested in minor
                    history, which, to adapt Deleuze and Guattari on “minor literature,” occupies a
                    minor position within a major culture, and therefore has a “high coefficient of
                    deterritorialization” (16). Just before <title level="m">Mandeville</title> he
                    had published the <title level="m">Lives of Edward and John Philips, Nephews and
                        Pupils of Milton</title> (1815), which sidesteps the major figure of Milton
                    and takes up his relatively obscure nephews. Through this skew, Godwin avoids
                    being bound into any number of simplifying narratives that might present Milton
                    as a canonical or hagiographical figure, might positivize the indeterminacies
                    and disavowals in his Republicanism, or might reify his disillusioned retreat
                    from history. The seventeenth century held Godwin’s attention for thirteen
                    years, as he published the <title level="m">Lives</title>, then <title level="m">Mandeville, </title>and finally his <title level="m">History of the
                        Commonwealth of England</title> (1824–28). The period of the Civil Wars and
                    the dissipation of their energies after the Restoration thus has a unique place
                    in Godwin’s historiography, and <title level="m">Mandeville</title>, in dialogue
                    with his <title level="m">History of the Commonwealth</title>, casts the
                    latter’s enlightenment into the black hole of a negative dialectic. Indeed in
                    oblique ways <title level="m">Mandeville</title> is also knotted into a similar
                    dialectic with the unprocessed and silenced revolutionary energies of the 1790s.
                    For it forms a pair with the more soberly utopian <title level="m">History of
                        the Commonwealth</title> that takes us back to the systole and diastole
                    between <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> and the <title level="m">Enquiry
                        Concerning Political Justice</title> (1793/1798), which Godwin still
                    described as his “favourite work” nearly four decades later (“Preface” 7).<note place="foot">For further discussion of the significance of the hiatus
                        between <title level="m">Fleetwood</title> and <title level="m">Mandeville</title>, see my “Introduction” to <title level="m">Mandeville</title> (11–18). For further discussion of how Godwin was
                        writing a more global history in bits and pieces, see my article “Between
                        Individual and General History” (115–19). The present article draws on both
                        of the above. I am grateful to Broadview Press and <title level="m">Nineteenth-Century Prose</title> for allowing me to do so. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p> The novel is a historical novel about a minor Royalist, Charles Mandeville, who
                    never enters history because he never leaves the closet of his psychic history:
                    his “eternal war” on his intolerably “good” classmate Clifford (<title level="m">Mandeville</title> 210), who marries Mandeville’s sister Henrietta. Yet
                    Godwin resisted the suggestion of his publisher, Archibald Constable, that he
                    call <title level="m">Mandeville</title> a “domestic story,” and instead
                    insisted on subtitling it a “Tale of the Seventeenth Century <title level="m">in
                        England</title>” (italics mine).<note place="foot">. Godwin’s publisher
                        Constable wanted him to remove the words “in England” and replace them with
                        “domestic story,” which he did for purposes of an Advertisement, but would
                        not do on the title-page itself. See in Garside: the letters of September
                        27th, 1816 (where Godwin is already using the final subtitle) and October
                        7th, 1816 (where he accedes to a substitution). On April 16th, 1817, when he
                        had either finished Vol. 2 or was close to doing so (he received proofs back
                        on May 16th), Godwin strongly insisted on the original title, adding, “In
                        civility to your objection I made a verbal alteration in this phrase; but I
                        am grown less modest and pliant now . . . and I request that the
                        first and more significant title may be restored” (Constable 88).</note>
                    This is to say that both the reviewers who saw the historical framework as
                    irrelevant and the imitators who reduced the novel to a domestic story missed
                    its larger point.<note place="foot">. Criticizing Godwin on numerous points of
                        historical accuracy, <title level="m">The British Review</title> claims that
                        “the historical part and the fictitious have no close connection with each
                        other” and the “historical passages appear as awkward appendages.” The
                        reviewer goes so far as to say that if the entire section on the Irish
                        massacre were “expunged, the story would lose nothing” (11–20). Even more
                        sympathetic reviewers concentrate only on Mandeville himself and not on the
                        dialectic with the historical background. The parodic “fourth” volume bound
                        with Godwin’s novel in a British Library copy and entitled <title level="m">Mandeville: Last Words of a Maniac!</title> also dehistoricizes the
                        text. Finally, “Miserrimus,” printed privately by Frederick Reynolds, an
                        admirer of Godwin and editor of <title level="m">The Keepsake</title>, has
                        many parallels to Godwin’s novel, and also reduces the story to a love
                        triangle. </note> For Godwin sees Mandeville as both an individual and a
                    symptom, as what Foucault calls “the inscribed surface of events . . .
                    totally imprinted by history and the process of history’s destruction of the
                    body” (148). It is with this symptomology in mind that Godwin says he “would
                    rather follow [a man] into his closet” than “observe” him “upon the public
                    stage” of “Universal History” (“History and Romance” 294).</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Mandeville</title> is set in the only period when Britain was
                    kingless, the time that saw the beheading of Charles I, the “English
                    Revolution,” and the Protectorate—but it is book-ended by two uprisings
                    ex-centric to its setting “in England.” The first is the Ulster Rebellion of
                    1641, where Mandeville’s parents are killed in the massacre of Protestant
                    settlers. The child is saved by his Catholic nurse, but taken from her by the
                    severe Hilkiah Bradford, chaplain of the garrison set up to protect the English
                    “plantations” in Ireland. Hilkiah tutors him in the forlorn castle of
                    Mandeville’s uncle Audley, until the Puritanical preceptor dies and the boy is
                    sent to school at Winchester. The second uprising is the rag-tag assault that
                    Mandeville himself leads on the marriage coach bearing Henrietta and Clifford.
                    Clifford is unharmed, but Mandeville is severely disfigured. The novel ends as
                    Mandeville triumphantly contemplates his face in a mirror, on the eve of a
                    Restoration he has refused in dis-figuring the union figured in the marriage.
                    For this marriage of Henrietta, a Presbyterian brought up as an Anglican, to
                    Clifford, an Episcopalian who turns Catholic so that he can inherit from a
                    relative, is the very symbol of the settlements and expediencies of the
                    Restoration.</p>
                  <p> The novel has many resonances with Godwin’s own time. They include the return of
                    the Ulster Rebellion in the Irish Uprising of 1798, and the parallel between the
                    1790s pamphlet wars and the schoolboy incident of the cartoons. In this
                    incident, Mandeville is falsely condemned by the staunchly Royalist prefects at
                    Winchester when a book of anti-monarchist cartoons is found in his room, and his
                    Presbyterian origins play a significant role in this judgment (158). The book
                    had been abandoned there by his friend, the cowardly Waller (also a
                    Presbyterian), who lets Mandeville take the rap for him. The judgment is its own
                    form of gagging act, and dogs Mandeville throughout his life, impeding his
                    entrance into history. Most importantly, the similarities between the time of
                    the novel and Godwin’s own period also include the parallel politics of the
                    Restoration and Regency as simulations of settlement, and a stunning final
                    paragraph where Mandeville anachronistically compares his disfigurement by
                    Clifford to the “brand[ing]” of negro slaves (448), in a conflation of Irish and
                    black plantations, the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
                  <p> Most readers pathologize Mandeville, nor would one want to have him as a friend
                    in real life. As he says, in a typically military metaphor, “I dug a broad and a
                    deep foss, and threw up an intrenchment, to cut me off from creatures wearing
                    the human form” (171). Mandeville’s hatred of Clifford is unreasonable, almost a
                    fetish, and makes sense only insofar as Clifford is an alibi for the
                    deconstruction of a society normatively structured around virtue and
                    cheerfulness. Henrietta, for her part, does everything possible to support her
                    brother, but from an enlightened perspective that misses the trauma of this
                    period before the Enlightenment. Indeed the “Arcadian” Henrietta (240), who has
                    been separated from her brother and sent to stay with friends of her parents to
                    shield her from the war in Ireland, is carefully set up by Godwin as an
                    Enlightenment character. Godwin has her give a long speech, part of which is
                    drawn from Shaftesbury (243), not the seventeenth-century politician who figures
                    in the narrative, but his grandson, the author of <title level="m">Characteristics</title>; moreover, Godwin draws attention to this
                    anachronism (310). Henrietta is watched over by the Montagus, an aristocratic
                    family who facilitate her marriage to Clifford, and who did not live at their
                    aptly named country seat of Beaulieu until the eighteenth century (147n.2). And
                    true to her Enlightenment character, when Mandeville is confined in a
                    “receptacle for lunatics” at Cowley (233), Henrietta watches over him, oblivious
                    to the “violence” and “blows” used to restrain him (234), which he describes in
                    language that recalls the traumatic scenes of his childhood in Ireland (110).
                    These scenes, which Mandeville recalls as “visionary,” in contrast to his
                    “eventless” life in his uncle’s house (109–10), testify to a certain energizing
                    power of the negative, even as abjection. For as Godwin’s contemporary Friedrich
                    Schelling writes in his unpublished <title level="m">Ages of the World
                    </title>(1815), if we strip the veil from what has been “covered up and from the
                    outside has adopted peaceful qualities,” “forces” are unconcealed that were
                    previously “held down by the magic of life.” These “forces appear” when “an
                    organic being becomes sick,” and are not simply diseased but mark the ferment of
                    an “inner life that incessantly gives birth to itself and again consumes itself”
                    (20, 48).</p>
                  <p> It is all too easy to identify with Henrietta and Clifford because we ought to.
                    But like all Godwin’s novels, the first-person narration induces what I have
                    called a “perverse identification” with the main character (<title level="m">Romantic Narrative</title>, 89, 136–38), in which we must turn against our
                    own <emph>habitus</emph> in ways that disclose its tropological structuring.
                    Freud describes the transgression of our own normality required for this
                    transference, which does not work if the character is too removed from
                    normality. To shake up an initial repression in the reader, Freud says, we must
                    “follow the development of the illness along with the sufferer” (308–10). Hence
                    Godwin builds a powerful case for Mandeville’s growing paranoia, which includes
                    the Irish massacre, the cartoon episode, and the Royalist Penruddock insurgency
                    against Cromwell where Mandeville wants to show his loyalty to the King but
                    Clifford is preferred for the secretaryship because of the cartoon incident and
                    Mandeville’s Presbyterian family. The case for Mandeville also includes the
                    abuse consequently heaped on him at Oxford by his friend Lisle who sees him as a
                    turncoat. As a result Mandeville has a psychotic break that leads to his
                    confinement at Cowley. Henrietta’s tender care may beguile us into seeing this
                    madhouse in terms of the later “humane psychiatry” associated with Philippe
                    Pinel and the York Retreat. However, this is less a reality in the time of the
                    Great Confinement than a way of unsettling our own enlightenment, by disclosing
                    the “world of terrors” that a “benevolent hand seems to cover up from us,” as
                    Schelling writes (49). And finally, because Mandeville is deemed insane, his
                    former schoolmate Mallison and Mallison’s uncle, the lawyer Holloway, worm their
                    way into the dying Audley’s affections and almost cheat Mandeville of his
                    inheritance.</p>
                  <p> At the same time, underlaid in Mandeville’s narration is a later voice that
                    comments on religio-political history, women’s exclusion from education, and,
                    untypically for a Royalist, Cromwell’s achievements (153–54, 192). The
                    interweaving of these voices means that the narrative is not so much told as
                        <emph>received</emph> in the first person, such that we may not literally
                    identify with Mandeville, but have a responsibility to hear him. For as
                    Schelling puts it, “humans show a natural predilection for the affirmative,” for
                    what is outgoing and “self-giving” like Clifford, “just as much as they turn
                    away from the negative,” from what is “inhibiting” and “conflicting,
                    . . . that which, so to speak, should not be and yet is, nay, must
                    be. . . . [this] No that resists the Yes, this darkening that resists
                    the light, this obliquity that resists the straight, this left that resists the
                    right, and however else one has attempted to express this eternal antithesis in
                    images” (6).</p>
                  <p> From this perspective, Mandeville’s “causeless aversion” (Lockhart 271) for
                    Clifford is the site of the novel’s political unconscious,<note place="foot">.
                        Aversion, as turning away, is itself a form of emotional trope.
                        Interestingly the word occurs seventeen times in the novel, most of them
                        significant (e.g. 60, 107, 109, 116, 129, 132, 216, 248, 297, 365, 369, 389,
                        406).</note> an alibi for the deconstruction of a damaged society that
                    Godwin conducts through Mandeville. For as Theodor Adorno argues, if a
                    “psycho-analysis” of our culture were possible, it would “show the sickness” of
                    our time “to consist in normality.” The “achievements demanded” of someone
                    “healthy in body and mind,” someone cheerful and able to adapt to the
                    inevitable, are “performed only at the cost of the profoundest mutilation”
                    (Adorno 58–59). Through Mandeville’s damaged life, we are forced to know what
                    the “goodness” of Clifford and Henrietta excludes, the supreme condescension
                    even of its attempts to be understanding, and its violence as a form of
                    normalization. Or as Schelling puts it, “Conceptually, that which has being is
                    always that in which the affirming principle is active and outwardly manifest.”
                    But “it does not always follow that what has being in accord with” the
                    normativity of “the concept . . . really has being.” For
                    “level-headedness, and organization” can “just as well” be seen as that which
                    “does not have being,” since “the affirming principle . . . has being
                    . . . only by repressing the negating force in itself” (Schelling 15,
                    18).</p>
                  <p> In what follows I approach the right of the negative through Mandeville’s
                    Presbyterian affiliation as the cipher of a position, and then through the
                    fanaticism that traverses the period as the vehicle for a <emph>dissensus</emph>
                    that resurfaces in his misanthropy, the tropological structure of which is
                    crystallized in the last chapter as a deliberate staging of trope and
                    dis-figuration. In the sectarian geography of a period in which political
                    government was being renegotiated through church government, there were three
                    broad divisions. The Episcopalians placed bishops under the Archbishop,
                    analogically guaranteeing monarchy. The Congregationalists gave each
                    congregation the right to run its affairs, providing a basis for the “right of
                    private judgment” that Godwin theorized as a form of rational dissent in his
                        <title level="m">Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</title> (1: 170), but
                    also a basis for various fanaticisms. The Presbyterians were in between,
                    devolving authority to elders or presbyters, but not to individual
                    congregations. The religious and political did not always synchronize, and their
                    shifting, approximate, or expedient alignments are too complex to describe here.
                    But they combined and decombined in ways which, though confusing, created a
                    margin of error that both stalled history and drove it forward.</p>
                  <p> Mandeville’s place in this religio-political web is complex and registers what
                    is shut out from normalizing histories, whether they are Tory, Whig, or radical.
                    Mandeville comes from an unaligned Presbyterian family, but in a perverse
                    contortion of himself he becomes more staunchly Royalist after the cartoon
                    episode. Unlike the religious Presbyterians in Scotland, the parliamentary
                    Presbyterians in England followed what Godwin in the novel calls “a middle and
                    temperate course” (157). At first their structures of church government made
                    them question absolute monarchy. But they grew alarmed at the mix of radical
                    democracy and religious sub-sects they had unleashed, and regrouped behind the
                    King. While one could thus see the Presbyterians as precursors of the
                    constitutional monarchy that simulated democracy after the Glorious Revolution,
                    Godwin also saw them as progressive. That Mandeville is a Royalist but a
                    Presbyterian is thus significant. On the one hand, against the grain of his own
                    sympathies, Godwin writes a story with no Republican characters, a one-sidedness
                    that gives the novel its claustrophobic shape. Is this because a Republican
                    history, such as Godwin’s own <title level="m">History of the
                        Commonwealth</title>, is itself flawed in ways that can only be felt within
                    what he calls an “individual” history, as opposed to a “general” history that
                    glosses over particularities by focusing on recurrent patterns that are
                    inevitably normative?<note place="foot">These are terms Godwin uses in his essay
                        “Of History and Romance,” to distinguish an individual history that follows
                        a man “into his closet” from a general history that looks for universal
                        patterns and is therefore a form of what he would call “institution.”
                        Individual history is a source of transformative, or in the case of <title level="m">Mandeville,</title> traumatic particulars with which the
                        reader interacts as in a magnetic field of (dis)affinities (291–94).</note>
                    After all, the interregnum saw the continuation of colonialism in Ireland and
                    Barbados, while Parliament did more to oppress the Irish than did the King. So
                    in the negative dialectic that forms his sense of history, which is always other
                    to itself, Godwin can only (dis)figure his opposition to things as they are in
                    the “damaged life” of someone from the other side. On the other hand, Mandeville
                    is a Presbyterian Royalist, and proudly notes that the Presbyterians were “the
                    original stirrers of the war between the king and the parliament” (156). This
                    odd comment, coming from a Royalist, registers his difference from the
                    Episcopalian Royalism of Clifford, aligning Mandeville with what he opposes,
                    creating a space for what has not yet come to consciousness. </p>
                  <p> By a similar troping or twisting, Mandeville is also subtextually aligned with
                    Ireland. In a lurid figure he describes the “inter-destructiveness” that binds
                    him and Clifford as conjoined twins: <quote>Mezentius, the famous tyrant of
                        antiquity, tied a living body to a dead one, and caused the one to take in,
                        and gradually become a partner of, the putrescence of the other. I have read
                        of twin children, whose bodies were so united in their birth, that they
                        could never after be separated, while one carried with him, wherever he
                        went, an intolerable load, and of whom, when one died, it involved the
                        necessary destruction of the other. (230)</quote> Much earlier, in 1786, in
                    his letter “To the People of Ireland” urging them not to be seduced by economic
                    arguments into a union with England, Godwin had used the same image: <quote>few
                        objects [are] more calamitous or more unnatural, than the union of two
                        countries circumstanced as I have described. It is like that refined piece
                        of cruelty, scarcely to be named by the tongue . . . of tying a
                        living body [Ireland] to a dead one [England], and causing them to putrify
                        and perish together. (301)</quote> The repetition of this image subtextually
                    aligns Mandeville, as a living body, with Ireland as a victim of oppression, an
                    alignment again hinted at in the novel’s last paragraph, where Clifford’s
                    wounding of Mandeville is compared to the branding of negro slaves by
                    “tyrannical planters” (448), in a reference back to the plantations in Ireland
                    with which the novel begins. <title level="m">Prima facie</title> Mandeville
                    should have no sympathy with the country where his parents were massacred. And
                    yet in a perverse twisting of his psyche, he identifies with the victims of the
                    English planters whom his father’s garrison was supposed to protect. In the
                    circumstances it is not unreasonable to see in the struggle of Mandeville
                    against Clifford a displaced version of what Godwin describes as the “grand
                    contest” that animated the Stuart period (“History and Romance” 297): that of
                    Parliament and King, or of the anonymous against those born to the royal manner
                    and “brought up in reverential ideas of kingship and prerogative,” like Clifford
                        (<title level="m">Mandeville</title> 173). Hence the paradox that Mandeville
                    finds the “visionary scenes” of “flight” and “murder” that followed the Ulster
                    Rebellion more exhilarating than his “monotonous” and “eventless” life in his
                    uncle’s house (109–10), as he finds the hiding-places of power in half-memories
                    of his infancy in Ireland: the place of his psychic birth as a subject of
                    injustice, a body in bits and pieces, like the body politic of Britain
                    itself.</p>
                  <p> This hermeneutic skew whereby the positive is inverted into the negative also
                    helps explain the role of fanaticism in the novel. In his early essay “Of
                    History and Romance” (1797), written for a second edition of <title level="m">The Enquirer</title> but not published, Godwin singles out the period of
                    the Stuarts “as the only portion of our history interesting to the heart of
                    man.” He dismisses the “servile courtiers” of the preceding Elizabethan period,
                    and the triviality of history after 1688: “From the moment that the grand
                    contest excited under the Stuarts was quieted by the [Glorious] Revolution, our
                    history assumes its most insipid and insufferable form. It is the history of
                    negotiations and tricks.” But he sees the potential of the Stuart period for
                    generating a “history of genuine, independent man” as “obscured by the vile
                    jargon of fanaticism” (296–97). Yet in the novel, fanaticism is more complex: an
                    environment for the energies unleashed by the English Revolution that
                    Christopher Hill describes as “a third culture” which exceeds the struggle of
                    King and parliament. This “popular, heretical culture” emphasized the Bible as
                    “interpreted by individual conscience,” but its views came “jumbled up with
                    magical and prophetical ideas” (69–79). The novel is peppered with these sects
                    mentioned by Hilkiah or Mandeville himself, not all of which are fundamentalist.
                    For they include fanatical and apocalyptic sects like the Fifth Monarchists, who
                    existed only from 1649–61, who were obsessed with the apocalyptic number 666 as
                    a year close at hand, and who took their name from a prophecy in the Book of
                    Daniel that four monarchies would precede the fifth monarchy or new spiritual
                    kingdom of Christ. But the sects mentioned in <title level="m">Mandeville</title> also include enthusiasts such as the Quakers and the
                    Diggers or “True Levellers,” radical democrats some of whose ideas lie at the
                    origins of Godwin’s own Rational Dissent and his views on property. Such sects
                    are absent from the more rational <title level="m">History of the
                        Commonwealth</title>, as is the broader environment of Catholic-Protestant
                    fanaticism introduced into the novel at the very beginning by the Irish
                    massacre. The suppression of these sects after the Restoration, and particularly
                    the Glorious Revolution, is one reason why subsequent British history is
                    “insipid” (Godwin, “History and Romance” 297), as Lee Morrissey recognizes in
                    opposing a seventeenth-century public sphere of <emph>dissensus</emph> to the
                    Habermasian consensual public sphere of the next century (1–53). </p>
                  <p> As a channel for this third culture, and the very embodiment of fanaticism,
                    Hilkiah injects a dark urgency into the novel. Hilkiah is the animus and
                    animating principle that separates Mandeville’s non-conformity from that of
                    Audley, who stands beyond his nephew as a “celestial spirit” (304), but sinks
                    “without power of resistance” under “any hostility” (87). Yet Hilkiah’s bigotry
                    indicates how the legacy of <emph>dissensus</emph> comes forth warped and
                    convoluted by what that has not yet been set right in a culture that represses
                    its underlying contradictions. Hilkiah’s influence works itself “deeply into the
                    substance” of Mandeville’s character (123), in the misanthropy that structures
                    his psyche as the negative of itself. Yet Mandeville is not positively attached
                    to Hilkiah and indeed feels a “rooted aversion of heart” from his preceptor
                    (129). Though he speaks Hilkiah’s Biblical and stilted language, he has no stake
                    in the religious controversies of the time. Hence fanaticism is secularized and
                    troped into misanthropy, as Mandeville lives on into the Restoration, though
                    obscurely, as the figure for “something not yet made good that pushes its
                    essence forward” in the trauma of the seventeenth century.</p>
                  <p> The phrase is used by Habermas in an unusual essay in which he links Ernst Bloch
                    to Schelling so as to submit what Schelling calls the “darkening that resists
                    the light” (6)—or the “matter” that stalls “history”—to a “utopian treatment.”
                    (Habermas, “Ernst Bloch” 71). <note place="foot">Although Habermas’ work
                        subsequently went in a very different direction, his dissertation was on
                        Schelling. Referring to Schelling’s philosophy of nature and <title level="m">Ages of the World,</title> Habermas’ comments on Bloch and
                        Schelling in this essay and in another essay on “The German Idealism of the
                        Jewish Philosophers” (cf. 39–40) are brief and evocative rather than
                        documentary in bringing Schelling into a tradition of Marxist negative
                        dialectics, in which we might be more used to seeing Hegel. For a
                        “Schellingian” reading of <title level="m">Mandeville</title> see my
                        article, “The Disfiguration of Enlightenment” (175, 182–87).</note> What
                    Bloch finds in Schelling’s rotary movement between the affirmative and negative
                    drives is a “primordial hunger” in which the “knot of the world presses toward
                    resolution,” making the negative “the elemental energy of hope” (Habermas,
                    “Ernst Bloch” 63, 69–71). Fanaticism is this dark knot, which Alberto Toscano
                    has recently analyzed as more than simply “the encroachment of religion into a
                    supposedly secularized public sphere.” What separates the fanatic from a madman
                    in his refusal to compromise is the “universality” at which he aims (Toscano
                    xi–xii). Interestingly Toscano reads fanaticism through Bloch’s principle of
                    synchronicity and non-synchronicity, in which Bloch, writing during the Nazi
                    period, tries to “forge a theory of fascism that would . . . confront
                    head-on the affective purchase of distinctly millenarian ideas” that were a
                    “perversion of the anti-clerical and egalitarian heresies which find their
                    source” in the twelfth century (52–53). For Bloch, who does not believe that the
                    “archaic” will be subsumed by “progress,” there is always a non-synchronicity
                    between the present and “the incomplete pasts that teem in its interstices”
                    (Toscano 53–55). Hill’s third culture is precisely a collection of such “modes
                    of organization and belief” which are “out of joint with a politically and
                    economically defined (and enforced) present” (Toscano 52). This anachronism is
                    throughout the novel, and penetrates Mandeville’s Latinate and Biblical diction,
                    not to mention the non-synchronicity of Godwin’s writing a novel about the
                    seventeenth century in the nineteenth century, and our reading of the novel in
                    the twenty-first century.</p>
                  <p> To be sure, Godwin is not a fanatic: hence his decision to respond moderately to
                    the Gagging Acts in his “Considerations on Lord Grenville’s and Mr. Pitt’s
                    Bills,” a decision that offended his more radical colleague, John Thelwall. But
                    in the years between the 1790s and 1817 something had changed, and in writing a
                    novel that allows us to trace the misanthropy that so fascinated him back to
                    fanaticism, Godwin probes the question raised by Toscano, as to whether there
                    can be a “history” without fanaticism (xxiii). The next text in the historical
                    series that Godwin wrote out of sequence is his <title level="m">Lives of Edward
                        and John Philips</title>, set partly in the Restoration, and the further
                    ones are <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> and <title level="m">Fleetwood</title>.<note place="foot">Edward Philips lived from 1630 to
                        circa 1696, and John lived from 1631–1706. The nephews’ lives span the
                        seventeenth century but John, in particular, is a Restoration character. On
                        the <title level="m">Lives</title>, see my essay “Uncertain Futures.”
                    </note> The misanthropy probed in these novels is more brooding and
                    inward-directed than the “hatred” which Mandeville, who also describes himself
                    as a misanthrope, calls his “ruling passion” (305, 343). We can approach
                    misanthropy through what Hegel, drawing on the physiology of his time but giving
                    it a more psychological coloring, calls “irritability.” Irritability is a
                    “reaction of self-maintenance” against the other “with which it is in relation”
                    (Hegel 358–59), a dis-ease in which the self is “restricted to itself” as “the
                    negative of itself” (Hegel 438), such that the “negative thing is the structure
                    itself” (Hegel 429). But whereas Hegelian negativity has a certain propulsive
                    force, which also drives fanaticism, the negativity of <title level="m">Fleetwood</title>, as irritability, remains unfocused, more at the level of
                    drive than desire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Fleetwood</title> is subtitled “the new man of feeling” in an
                    allusion to the novel of sensibility. In the etiology of a damaged society
                    traced through Godwin’s novels, misanthropy as irritability is thus more
                    (re)active than sensibility, but is nevertheless a domestication of fanaticism.
                    This is to say that in retrospect we can read <title level="m">Fleetwood</title>’s status as a “domestic story” symptomatically. After the
                    Restoration and the Enlightenment, as we see in the de-generation of Milton
                    through his nephews, the “civic apathy and depoliticization” characteristic of
                    an age of commerce (Toscano 23) are the order of the day. Audley’s “apathy and
                    neutrality” (<title level="m">Mandeville</title> 236), which are not
                    indifference but the radical passivity of pure retreat, make him
                    transcendentally “unequal to contention” (87). But <title level="m">Fleetwood</title>’s misanthropy is a purely private trope for the
                        <emph>dissensus</emph> that showed itself more openly during the
                        <foreign>interregnum</foreign>, and that dissipates itself in
                        <foreign>ennui</foreign> after the Enlightenment. “Born from a prior
                    failure” (Toscano xxiv), fanaticism, of course, is also deeply tropological,
                    doubly negative: a negation of what it hates and a negation of itself. And yet
                    it is invested in history, which misanthropy is not. </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m"> Mandeville</title> ends shockingly with the hero looking at his
                    disfigured face in a glass darkly. Though he may be fifty-two when he writes his
                        story,<note place="foot">Since Mandeville, who is born in 1638, refers to
                        Dryden’s dedication of his play <title level="m">Amphitryon</title> (1690)
                        to Leveson Gower (228), he must be at least fifty two at the time he writes
                        his memoir.</note> he breaks it off when he is just short of twenty-one.
                    Some readers find this ending difficult to absorb, speculating that Godwin meant
                    to continue the novel. Yet despite casual remarks about doing so and about
                    ending with the Titus Oates conspiracy when Mandeville would have been
                    thirty-nine, in his correspondence with Constable Godwin speaks only of three
                    volumes (71), following the three-act structure of a play. One can also see the
                    end as premature because of two references to writing from a wiser perspective
                    (191, 220). But these are in Volume 2, and in a period before the use of the
                    speed-press, authors handed over their work in parts rather than as a completed
                    manuscript to which we can attribute “final authorial intention”—a practice with
                    which Godwin expressed repeated discomfort, as he emphasized that he was
                    constantly revising, did not want to surrender the manuscript in parts, and was
                    anxious at having a printer at the distance of Edinburgh.<note place="foot">.
                        See Letter of February 3rd, 1817 (Garside), and also Constable (72, 80–82,
                        85).</note> The passages in question, like the concession to having
                    Constable advertise the novel as a domestic story (see note 3), may be holdovers
                    from an earlier stage of conception or genuflections to taste. By the eighteenth
                    century, “taste” and “aesthetics” had become powerful tools for closing down an
                    earlier public sphere that was characterized by <emph>dissensus</emph>. Indeed,
                    Godwin is interested in the seventeenth century “in England” precisely because
                    it was a more open, violent and contentious time, and the schoolboy episode of
                    the cartoons refers in miniature to the pamphlet wars of the seventeenth
                    century, which once again threatened to crack open the immunitary mechanisms of
                    the public sphere in the 1790s. Correspondingly, there is scant evidence in
                        <title level="m">Mandeville</title> of any mandatory maturity, and the novel
                    actively resists the institution of taste.</p>
                  <p> I therefore suggest a different hypothesis: that Godwin meant to conclude with
                    Volume 3, but hit on the mirror stage as the most effective finale only at the
                    end. From his correspondence and diary, it seems that he started revising the
                    last volume, briefly interrupted his revisions on the death of his friend, the
                    Irish patriot John Philpot Curran, to whom he dedicates the novel, but then also
                    stopped for three days to write six more pages, before he returned to revising
                    the whole.<note place="foot">See my “Introduction” for discussion of the
                        philological reasons for my conclusions here (41–42).</note> Much like what
                    happened with <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>, we can thus see Godwin as
                    having written two endings, first finishing with Chapter XVI, and then adding
                    what is now the last chapter. These “endings” could not be more different.</p>
                  <p> Chapter XVI ends bitterly, “Aye; my story is arrived at a festival” (441). Had
                    the text concluded with this hysterical rant on Henrietta’s betrayal, it would
                    be worthy of the anonymous parody which is bound with <title level="m">Mandeville</title> in the British Library copy, and which was written as a
                    fourth volume and subtitled “last words of a maniac!” But the further chapter
                    adds two things: the assault on the marriage coach which replaces the Oates
                    conspiracy, and the shift from Henrietta to Mandeville himself, whose tone is
                    now tightly controlled. Unlike Chapter XVI, which brings Mandeville’s psychic
                    disintegration to a head, in this ending he gathers himself together as a
                    subject. But this is a subject who survives as bare life, one who has exchanged
                    his position as the son of parents allied with the planters in Ireland for that
                    of a negro slave in a later plantation, and whose very facelessness is the face
                    of anonymous history: <quote>I had received a deep and perilous gash, the broad

                        of these lexicographers is happily suited to my case, and the mark I for
                        ever carry about with me. The reader may recollect the descriptions I have
                        occasionally been obliged to give, of the beauty of my person and
                        countenance. . . . When I first looked in my glass, and saw my
                        face, once more stripped of its tedious dressings, I thought I never saw
                        anything so monstrous. . . . The sword of my enemy had given a
                        perpetual grimace, a sort of preternatural and unvarying distorted smile, or
                        deadly grin, to my countenance. . . . Every time my eye
                        accidentally caught my mirror, I saw Clifford, and the cruel heart of
                        Clifford, branded into me. My situation was not like what it had hitherto
                        been. Before, to think of Clifford was an act of the mind . . .
                        now I bore Clifford and his injuries perpetually about with me. Even as
                        certain tyrannical planters in the West Indies have set a brand with a red
                        hot iron upon the negroes they have purchased, to denote that they are
                        irremediably a property, so Clifford had set his mark upon me, as a token
                        that I was his for ever. (447–48)</quote> The identity Mandeville claims
                    here is defiantly traumatic, stubbornly attached to the imprints of his
                    subjection, as the imprints of multiple texts on a body which he bequeaths to
                    his reader as, precisely, a text. Yet the tone is also triumphant, because
                    master and slave, Clifford and Mandeville, are finally equals. Now Clifford is
                    indeed tied to Mandeville, as the dead body of England to a living body. Or
                    perhaps we should not describe it as a living body but as one that lives on, in
                    Derrida’s particular sense of <foreign>sur-vivre</foreign> as “non-closure,” and
                    “the endurance of that which cannot exist” (Guyer 251–52). Because Clifford has
                    hurt Mandeville, he is at last guilty; the figure of the “good” has been ruined,
                    disfigured.</p>
                  <p> One commentator, responding in <title level="m">Blackwood’s Edinburgh
                        Magazine</title> to the more sympathetic review by John Gibson Lockhart, and
                    noting the novel’s excessively metaphoric style, criticized this passage for its
                        “<emph>surgically</emph> technical” language (405–08). But its pedantry is
                    the very cicatrix of which it speaks, a tightening and drying of the skin over a
                    wound. If metaphor, as Ortega y Gasset says, “substitutes one thing for
                    another—from an urge not so much to get at the first as to get rid of the
                    second” (31), the cicatrix as the scar of this euphemism, this turning away, is
                    the laying bare of the substitutions that inform even the barest facts and the
                    wounds they cover over. It is a laying bare that is in turn its own form of
                    covering and shelter. </p>
                  <p> The tone of this passage is at once masochistic and exhilarating. We cannot just
                    dismiss Mandeville as disturbed because we find the scene disturbing. Like trope
                    itself as a turning, like the twisting of perverse identification, the passage
                    must be turned back on itself. It must be read and re-read not just for
                    Mandeville’s resistances but for our own resistances to what does not agree with
                    traditional criteria of “beauty” that lead us to turn away from a face that is
                    too hard to face. For in its reference to criteria of beauty, the scene holds
                    the mirror up to aesthetics as the art of thinking beautifully (Baumgarten 533),
                    and also to the making of figures and the evasions of reading that make
                    literature conform to taste instead of being the place of the “absolute secret”
                    (Derrida 28–29). In fact, Mandeville only speaks once of the comely figure he
                    once cut, and this is in connection with the uncommon beauty of <emph>his
                        horse</emph> (344). It is, rather, the vocabulary of disease and wounds that
                    has been throughout the text, but “secret” psychic wounds (209, 231, 251, 317,
                    331, 336, 365). Now, however, the wound is finally external, allowing him to
                    speak as a survivor of war, so that Godwin can remove the “tedious bandages”
                    from myths of Restoration and settlement. Yet if we now see the unvarnished
                    truth behind the symbolic veneer, even that truth can be grasped only
                    tropologically through lexicographers, as the passage foregrounds the
                    substitutions of language, turning from French to Latin to Italian, as if to
                    emphasize something esoteric, something that remains withheld, a dark energy
                    that has yet to be deciphered.</p>
                  <p> The metapsychology of the novel’s doubly retreating negativity is well described
                    by Schelling, who never published the <title level="m">Ages</title>, and may
                    never have emerged from grappling with its negativity. Schelling tries to redeem
                    the negative in terms of the “inverted position” of “life forces” (18).
                    Referring to the two potencies which he had initially described as the affirming
                    or “outpouring” force and the “force of selfhood, of retreat into self” (6),
                    Schelling writes of their interimplication: “What in the preceding potency was
                    the exterior, contracting, and negating, is itself, in the successive potency,
                    the inner, contracted, and self-negated. And conversely, what was there
                    inhibited, is what is here free” (18). </p>
                  <p> The thrust of this passage is a theory of “involution” (Schelling 83), wherein
                    the two forces, similar to <foreign>eros</foreign> and
                        <foreign>thanatos</foreign>, are both “far from each other and infinitely
                    near. Far, because what is affirmed and manifest in one of them, is posited in
                    the other as negated and in the dark. Near, because it only requires an
                    inversion, a turning out of what was concealed . . . to transpose, and
                    so to speak, transform, the one into the other” (18). The “turning out” of each
                    into the other and the syntactic balance of this phrasing imply a coming
                    together of opposites, and this inversion/conversion are what permit us to find
                    in Schelling a certain utopianism, as Bloch also did. In the longer view allowed
                    by Godwin’s history in bits and pieces, it is not wrong to see in <title level="m">Mandeville</title> as well this utopianism of something “not yet
                    made good that pushes its essence forward.” But unlike Shelley’s hope in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, which “creates / From its own wreck
                    the thing it contemplates” (4: 573–74), it is far from clear in <title level="m">Mandeville</title> what we hope <emph>for</emph>. Similarly in the passage
                    from Schelling, there is really no positive; there is the mere trace of a
                    promise in the phrase “it only requires.” The first “potency” exists only as
                    “contracting and negating,” as, for example, in the “intrenchment” by which
                    Mandeville cuts himself off from the human race (Godwin, <title level="m">Mandeville</title> 171), while in the sequel it is “contracted and
                        <emph>self-negated</emph>” rather than “<emph>negating</emph>” (emphases
                    mine). What can be the difference between these negations except that by virtue
                    of turning in on itself to negate itself, as in Mandeville’s exhilaration over
                    his defacement, what has been restrained is now “free” and is no longer
                    “exterior” to itself, so that what was “negated and in the dark” has become
                    “manifest” (Schelling 18).</p>
                  <p> The story, as we have said, ends when Mandeville is just short of the age of
                    majority, and this is because Godwin cannot see his way to the narrative of
                    historical maturation told by Burke and Scott in which Britain, unlike France,
                    went through its revolution and regicide before the Enlightenment. It is because
                    the period before the Glorious Revolution remains, even now, in the moment of
                    our reading, an open wound like the “perilous gash” across Mandeville’s face.
                    But after this turning out of what was concealed, the figure or “mark” that
                    Mandeville makes (447) again retreats, as he lives on anonymously, for some
                    thirty years, into the Restoration. And yet even as he remains “in the dark” and
                    “self-negated” the concluding reference to slavery also brings the novel full
                    circle into the present. Returning to the plantations in Ireland with which the
                    novel began, it links them to the racism and imperialism of Godwin’s own time in
                    a circle of political injustice. This circle enfolds Mandeville’s personal
                    wounds in a complex tropology with secret recesses, in which Mandeville must
                    invert himself into the victim of the “tyrannical planters” with whom his family
                    was aligned, exposing the self-confuting logic of a “United Kingdom” of Great
                    Britain and projecting a damaged self that exists only as its negation, like a
                    negative that remains to be developed.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">Although often heralded as a passionate denunciation of the mayhem
                    of the Peninsular War, Francisco de Goya’s The Disasters of War (1814-1820) was
                    not published during the artist’s lifetime. My wager is to treat Goya’s
                    desistance not as evasive but as intrinsic to the Disasters itself, now seen as
                    an artistic practice and an experiment in living that takes on ruination without
                    necessarily metabolizing it. Goya releases his images by denying them refuge in
                    the visibly social. In what ways are traces of this abstention legible in the
                    aquatints themselves? The fact that the prints remained uncirculated during
                    Goya’s lifetime threads together life and work, wartime and the aesthetic,
                    survival and ruination in ambiguous but mortalizing ways, and puts to us that,
                    for a time, for the decade that they took to engrave, and then for the remainder
                    of his life, the inventor and then the archivist of the series learned to live
                    alongside disaster in a condition that I call “worldlessness.” </p>

                     <note place="foot">See Baucom as well as Miller for
                        insightful work on this topic. Both studies have had a tremendous impact on
                        my thinking here.</note> The genesis of the text lies in the singular
                    circumstances in which Spain found itself in 1808. As Gonzalo Anes describes it:
                        <quote>The king, queen, and heirs were in captivity. There was no
                        government. The people, abandoned by the royal family when they left the
                        court to meet Napoleon in Bayonne, claimed sovereignty for themselves
                        . . . There was no constitutional authority that could assume
                        responsibility to “<foreign>arrojar a la nación a una lucha tan
                            desigual</foreign>” [hurl a nation into such an unequal fight]; there
                        was no organized army, weapons, or money. (xxxv)</quote> A year later, the
                    poet Manuel Jose Quintana noted that “the fatherland” faced nothing less than a
                    “holocaust” (<foreign>en holocausto</foreign>) (qtd. in Vega 185). Much worse
                    was to come. But what could be worse than a holocaust? In this world—if it is in
                    fact a world, and not the annunciation of the end of the world and of the end of
                    the very concept of a world—targets of opportunity abound without limit:
                    soldiers, insurgents, and civilians; men, women, and children; humans and
                    nonhumans, not to mention the environments, both built and natural, that these
                    fragile creatures inhabit or occupy. A frenzy of violence, shown to be at once
                    unregulated and highly targeted, threatens to obliterate histories, knowledges,
                    obligations, solidarities, futures, and perhaps thinking itself. Art too is
                    destroyed, including work by Goya,<note place="foot">Three large altar paintings
                        for the San Fernando de Monte Torrero church in Zaragoza were either
                        destroyed or lost during the sieges of the city. See the “Description” for
                        the “Apparition of Saint Isodoro to Saint King Fernando in front of the
                        walls of Seville” (<title level="m">Aparición de San Isidoro al Rey Fernando
                            el Santo ante los muros</title>) from the National Museum of Fine Arts
                        of Argentina. I thank Reva Wolf for graciously helping me track down the
                        fate of these altar paintings. Amid wartime shortages that included a dearth
                        of materials the artist needed to pursue his work, Goya gave up fine canvas
                        for bandages that were badly needed by the townsfolk defending Aragón, his
                        birthplace. That gift is made aslant of the wartime economy that otherwise
                        harvested the clothes of the battlefield dead to produce paper. See,
                        respectively, Hughes 283 and St. Clair 178. Mary Favret drew my attention to
                        the use of the clothes of the war dead in her book, <title level="m">War at
                            a Distance.</title>
                     </note> whose vividly realized scenes of combat,
                    starvation, torture, humiliation, menace, execution, and dismemberment can be
                    hard to look at and harder to understand. And yet, despite—or perhaps because
                    of—their difficulty, Goya’s images have remained impossible to ignore since they
                    were printed and published, long after the artist’s death. </p>
                  <p>Goya’s focus is prephotographically tight. Jettisoning the convention of
                    depicting the battlefield from a panoptic distance, which presumes that the
                    spectator can and indeed wants to take the measure of war, his images zero in on
                    the toll of combat on individual bodies and small groups of bodies whose agonies
                    and indignities fill and overfill his pages. Some men are castrated; another is
                    impaled on the trunk of a tree. Women join the fight, but they are also hunted
                    down and sexually assaulted. Goya is the first artist to depict the rape of
                    women not as a battlefield aberration, much less as an aesthetically pleasing
                    scene of passionate struggle, but as a weapon of war.<note place="foot">For a
                        discussion of the question of Goya, war, and sexual violence, see
                        Sliwinski’s <title level="m">Human Rights in Camera</title> (50–53) and her
                        “Sexuality in the Time of War: Or, How Rape Became a Crime against
                        Humanity.”</note> The gendered brutality of combat hangs like a pall over
                    the battlefield whose boundaries are no longer visible. Even corpses—as well as
                    living bodies that are treated as already dead—are subjected to desecration that
                    is beyond killing, beyond the point in which violence is imagined to exhaust and
                    resolve itself in fatality, as Steven Miller has recently argued (1–50). In the
                    artist’s disjointed images we observe pervasive war suffering and war deaths,
                    and then something even more appalling, namely, “war after death” (Miller). How
                    then to draw bounding lines and etch images of war whose contours have dissolved
                    into excess and whose authorized self-descriptions no longer apply? What does
                    the human form look like when war extinguishes that form? </p>

                    treat in this essay as concentrating in one ghastly place many of the problems,
                    questions, and possibilities with which Goya’s assemblage thrums. Three
                    mutilated corpses are hung in a tree and displayed like trophies or presented as
                    triumphs. Two of the men have been castrated and hung upside down. One of the
                    men has been beheaded and has had his arms severed just below the shoulder.
                    Those arms are bound together at the hands and strung from a branch, the same
                    branch upon which the decapitated head is mounted. We cannot be certain that the
                    body parts are in fact parts of one whole—that is, whether the limbs and head
                    belong to the torsos at hand or to remains elsewhere. The staged nature of the
                    scene puts to us that there are perpetrators for whom violence must not only be
                    done but <emph>seen</emph> to be done, an imperative that, of course, complexly
                    implicates Goya’s decision to engrave the scene and ours to parse it.
                    Cataloguing the wounds and locating the bodies and the disposition of the body
                    parts, we find ourselves shadowing the artist to whose hand and eye the scene
                    was a horror but also a formal puzzle, a question of arrangement, orientation,
                    spacing, shading, and so forth. We come to see that looking at what Goya
                    unabashedly calls “the worst”.<note place="foot">The caption for plate 55 is
                            <emph>“The worst is to beg”</emph> (<foreign>Lo peor es
                        pedir</foreign>). As we shall see, Goya’s captions repeatedly return to what
                        is “worse” and “the worst.”</note> and working closely with formal questions
                    are not mutually exclusive practices and indeed that the form of the engraving,
                    which deliberately invites us to go over it, “part by part, limb by limb,”
                    (Benjamin, <title level="m">The Origin of German Tragic Drama</title> 176) is
                    the particular way that Goya caches the worst. The tree on which these horrors
                    are hung provides an occasion for the remains to be brought together and
                    presented, to be sure, but it is also Goya’s way of reminding us that what we
                    are seeing is the result not of an extraterrestrially malevolent will but of
                    something proximate and imaginable. The fact that the tree to which mutilations
                    are fastened is verdant, showing a stylized sprig of life amid these unnatural
                    deaths, serves as the punctum of a deeply sobering knowledge: the desecration
                    that Goya pictures may be fantastically grim, but it happened, it is happening,
                    in a place on Earth.<note place="foot">I am recalling Wieseltier, who speaks of
                        the effect of viewing color—rather than black-and-white—images associated
                        with the Holocaust: “You realize, almost as you never realized it before,
                        that the Jews were murdered in a place on earth” (90).</note> In this image
                    we see that there <emph>are</emph> fates worse than death, and part of what
                    makes scenes like this an example of the worst is not that they are sublimely
                    unimaginable but that they are, in fact, all too available to be executed,
                    observed, remembered, imagined, engraved, and thus in some sense both taken in
                    and <emph>lived with</emph>. What we see is not sublime, unless there is a
                    sublimity of radical desublimation, the dispiriting solidification of the human
                    form into its insensate segments and volumes. By an accident of history, we have
                    eighty-two or so images to consider, but the lack of any persuasive overall
                    narrative in the series, including the total number of prints making up the
                        assemblage,<note place="foot">Goya appends three etchings depicting the
                        torture of prisoners as an appendix to the volume of proofs for the <title level="m">Disasters</title>, thereby complicating the idea that the
                        assemblage comes to a definitive end at plate 82, “<emph>This is the
                            truth”</emph> (<foreign>Esto es lo verdadero</foreign>). For a brief
                        discussion of the prisoner images, see Sánchez and Sayre 210–11.</note>
                    suggests both that the series comes to an end but does not conclude and that
                    many more images could well have been created. As Georges Didi-Huberman notes,
                    Goya is among a special group of artists who “know . . . that
                    disasters are multipliable to infinity” (124). Goya registers the importance of
                    making and captioning pictures even and especially if that work is without end.
                    What is centrally important to Goya is the insolent fact that dismembering and
                    displaying the corpses of the enemy dead “was thought; it was therefore
                    thinkable,” (Didi-Huberman 25),<note place="foot">In this passage Didi-Huberman,
                        citing the French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet, notes that “[the genocide]
                        was thought, it was therefore thinkable” (25).</note> just as
                    “all-out-war”—where, as Susan Sontag observes, “expenditure is all-out,
                    un-prudent, war being defined as an emergency in which no sacrifice is
                    excessive” (99)—was executable, and it was executed. Goya is quickened by the
                    need to think this executability and to say it in the form of images whose very
                    existence repudiates the desire to look away or not to look, or to look and not
                    to see, or to look and be told that there is nothing to see, or to say that it
                    happened somewhere else, during a “war,” for example, when anything can happen,
                    or that it happened, yes, but not in my experience, not to me or in front of me,
                    or that it struck me in a traumatizing manner that I am not willing or able to
                    imagine or experience. Goya makes the inability to know how to look at the worst
                    a central part of the agon of looking at the images of the worst, an agon, I
                    want to argue, that leaves indelible if subtle traces in the images themselves.
                    The <title level="m">Disasters </title>are not so much the aesthetic site where
                    we imagine Goya to be overcome by the worst or to be working through the worst
                    as they are the occasion for him to put the aesthetic into the service of
                    thinking the worst, and, importantly, courageously, of affirming that the worst
                        <emph>can </emph>be thought, in the name of ensuring that there is a place
                    in which its iniquity and enormity can pool or eddy amid the grotesque torrent
                    of violence that is wartime Spain.</p>
                  <p>Goya’s assemblage is a fiercely self-contesting text, roiling with difficulties,
                    obscurities, and sudden shifts in visual styles. The refusal of the <title level="m">Disasters </title>to align unproblematically with any of the
                    belligerents that they depict contributes to a dystopian picture of ambient
                    violence in which, as Ian Baucom argues, “there is no party innocent of the most
                    horrific violence, no revolution whose coming . . . betokens the possibility of
                    progress” (182-3). <foreign>Nada. Ello lo dice</foreign> (<emph>Nothing. That is
                        what it says</emph>), one of Goya’s most memorable captions announces, an
                    unadorned and guttural assertion, as much a catch in the throat as it is a
                    phrase, evoking both the waste of war and the strange void to which the labor of
                    watching war is consigned when even loss appears to be lost. If Goya grieves, he
                    grieves that grief that can teach him nothing, <foreign>nada</foreign>, which,
                    far from a condition of emptiness or vacancy, is what survival or living-on
                    looks like without the prospect of flourishing or transformation.<note place="foot">I recall Ralph Waldo Emerson’s observation, in the wake of his
                        son’s death, that “I grieve that grief that can teach me nothing” (472).
                    </note> By preserving the <title level="m">Disasters </title>in their
                    unpublished state, after all, the artist makes nothing happen. But as Tilottama
                    Rajan says with regard to Romantic poetry, this is “not a sign of its difference
                    from a history where things happen” (“Keats, Poetry, and ‘The Absence of Work’”
                    335). “For poetry makes ‘nothing’ happen,” Rajan argues, by “disclosing a
                    negativity that is in history as much as in poetry” (335). After Stephen
                    Whicher’s remarks about Emerson, we can say that the grief that the <title level="m">Disasters </title>cannot grieve is the form that grief takes.<note place="foot">Stephen Whicher writes, “The grief that he cannot grieve is for
                        Emerson the form grief takes” (491). </note> Goya grieved the unfathomable
                    losses of the war, of that I have little doubt. But his text also touches
                        <emph>on</emph> grief, demonstrating by example that there are relationships
                    or perhaps adjacencies to ruination that are sorrowful but irreducible to
                    grieving. And so it is that Goya finds himself in a placeless place in which it
                    is neither possible nor advisable to determine with any confidence whether
                    history is changing or time is passing. The <title level="m">Disasters
                    </title>are a creature of this ambiguous impasse, in which, as Rei Terada
                    observes of Keats’s <title level="m">Hyperion</title> and <title level="m">Fall
                        of Hyperion</title> (poems that are contemporaneous with the creation of
                    Goya’s engravings), “the open-ended intolerability of the present is as
                    impossible not to see as it is to assimilate” (“Looking at the Stars Forever”
                    280). Not <emph>not</emph> to see and not to assimilate: this is the condition
                    of creative refusal that characterizes Goya’s relationship with the worst,
                    beginning with what he did and did not do with the assemblage once he had
                    brought it to the threshold of publication—or rather to the threshold of a
                    conventional understanding of publication. What I want to emphasize is this:
                    Goya did not publish the <title level="m">Disasters</title> during his lifetime.
                    He bequeathed a single set of proofs to his friend, the artist and collector
                    Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, and otherwise withheld them from publication
                    (assuming publication was indeed ever Goya’s interest or intent and thus the
                    desideratum from which the <title level="m">Disasters</title> then could be said
                    to have been withheld). Indeed, the assemblage would not be published until
                    1863, some thirty-five years after Goya’s death and half a century later than
                    the gruesome events that inspired them. To bring engravings to the proof stage
                    and then to halt the process of publication of which the printing of proofs is
                    conventionally the penultimate move is provocative to consider, especially if we
                    treat the interruption as the dynamic culmination rather than the regrettable
                    qualification of the work. I say “dynamic” because for Goya to have set the
                    assemblage aside for thirty-five years meant he did so not once, around 1820,
                    after the wars were said to have ended, but <emph>continually</emph>, repeatedly
                    deciding or returning to the decision—across shifting circumstances, both
                    biographical and historical—to shelter and affirm their studio rather than
                    social state, even after leaving the proofs and plates for the <title level="m">Disasters</title> behind when he moved to France in 1824 (Gassier and
                    Wilson 220).<note place="foot"> I use “state” as William Blake does, that is, as
                        a condition through which to pass rather than an identity that is already
                        there to assume. And I do not say “studio rather than social
                            <emph>life</emph>” because it strikes me as important to describe the
                            <title level="m">Disasters </title>as an example of what Claire
                        Colebrook, in “Earth Felt the Wound,” provocatively calls “the unlived,”
                        emphasizing the phenomenon—from acts to objects to concepts—for which
                        productivity, potentiality, or vitality don’t easily apply. The <title level="m">Disasters </title>do not “reach their potential” on their
                        publication, nor are they “latent,” awaiting their public “manifestation,”
                        while they were uncirculated. And yet it is almost impossible not to speak
                        of them in these sorts of terms, which says less about the <title level="m">Disasters </title>and more about the pervasiveness of the biopolitical
                        in criticism, the naturalization of “the natural” in how we speak about the
                        aesthetic. </note> Over the course of Goya’s life, and then for some time
                    afterward, the publication of the <title level="m">Disasters </title>is
                    interrupted without interruption. To create proofs, hand them to a trusted
                    friend, but not publish the <title level="m">Disasters</title>, and not publish
                    them forever, is itself an artistic practice and irreducibly a part of what the
                    assemblage is and does. It means to publish the <title level="m">Disasters</title> without publishing them, or perhaps to publish them
                    without circulating them, a publication without publicity—this, as a way to
                    demonstrate that publication is irreducible to publicity. What if we were to
                    treat the setting aside of the <title level="m">Disasters</title> in its own
                    right, making the assemblage generically closer to a Romantic fragment and an
                    example of what Balachandra Rajan calls “the form of the unfinished”? As Rajan
                    argues, the Romantic fragment distinguishes itself by no longer being answerable
                    to a normative idea of completion: “It contributes to a whole which is neither
                    beginning nor end but only history,” (249) Rajan writes. “The unfinished, in
                    such a view, carried with it no natural citizenship, no whole from which it was
                    disinherited, or from which its incompleteness has been made to proceed” (Rajan
                    249). Goya’s abstention from publication remains mysterious to everyone except
                    the historicists, who say that he feared the displeasure of the Spanish
                    monarchy, his long-time patrons (Hughes 303; Gassier and Wilson 218). Since Goya
                    otherwise could sometimes show little concern for the sensibilities of the
                    Bourbons, whose benumbed <emph>in</emph>sensibility he didn’t hesitate to
                    capture in a famous portrait of the royal family, the reason for his decision
                    not to print the engravings probably lies there, but elsewhere too.<note place="foot">The nineteenth-century poet and critic Pierre Jules Théophile
                        Gautier described the members of the royal family in Goya’s portrait as
                        looking like “the corner baker and his wife after they won the lottery”
                        (qtd. in Licht 127). As Fred Licht notes, “Even if one takes into
                        consideration the fact that Spanish portraiture is often realistic to the
                        point of eccentricity, Goya’s portrait still remains unique in its drastic
                        description of human bankruptcy” (128). </note> With the <title level="m">Disasters</title>, Goya makes himself <emph>scarce</emph>, certainly not
                    the only time his practice as an art took such a turn.<note place="foot">As
                        Gassier and Wilson put it: we have the extraordinary example of the “many
                        important works which Goya painted for himself and kept in his house” (214).
                        Sometimes Goya treated his work as a mode of interrogating and fashioning
                        himself as an other rather than as an artist who painted for others. </note>
                    My wager is to treat Goya’s desistance not as merely politically evasive or
                    professionally shrewd but “positively,” as intrinsic to the <title level="m">Disasters</title> themselves and as part of their otherwise often forgotten
                    perlocutionary materiality and force. Not doing something with the <title level="m">Disasters </title>is also a way of doing something, traces of
                    which are legible in the composition, content, and captions of the images, as
                    well as in their materiality <emph>as </emph>images. The fact that the
                    engravings remained uncirculated and without meaning-to-be-circulated during
                    Goya’s lifetime threads together life and work, wartime and the aesthetic, in
                    ambiguous but mortalizing ways, and puts to us that, for a time, for the decade
                    that they took to engrave, and for the remainder of his life, the inventor and
                    then the keeper of the <title level="m">Disasters</title> lived disastrously;
                    that is, he tarried with <emph>the worst </emph>in a condition of complex
                    asociality, schooling himself, but always also in the company of others (for
                    Goya went on to produce many other works that were prepared for spectators other
                    than the artist to see), to live alone in the void of catastrophe, now, forever,
                    without the ameliorative props that his public persona as fashionable
                    portraitist and principal royal painter had furnished. Goya’s redaction, the
                    lifelong <emph>scarcity</emph> of the relation of his engravings to public view,
                    attests not only to the intolerability of the war world they depict but also to
                    the intolerability of the violent—because politically frozen—postwar world in
                    which they were finally set aside, the difficulty that Goya discerns in
                    discovering a consequential space in which to see war and to be seen <emph>to
                        see</emph> war. So Goya releases his images by <emph>refusing</emph> them a
                    “refuge in visibility” (Lippit 14) and in the visibly social. One could almost
                    say that, under these conditions, when <emph>one’s eyes fail</emph>, Goya
                    chooses to see the disaster by <emph>touching</emph> it, feeling its
                    unmistakable force, with all the grimy physicality that comes from laboring with
                    acid and ink, paper and copper, hand and burin. This <emph>tact</emph> or
                    recessiveness, this unusability about the <title level="m">Disasters</title>,
                    reminds us that the political and the historical are irreducible to the
                    publically declarative. But this negation and abstention is otherwise difficult
                    to discern if your optic is calibrated to the legible and the social, the same
                    optic, as it happens, through which sovereign power arbitrarily parses the
                    difference between who lives, whose lives are worthy of protection and
                    preservation, <emph>and</emph> those who are made to die—which is to say between
                    those who remain discernible to the law and those who are deemed to be unworthy
                    of discernibility.<note place="foot">For an elegant and powerful critique of

                  <p>Goya’s captions are very strange: <emph>This is the worst</emph>; <emph>There
                        was nothing to be done and he died</emph>; <emph>Why?</emph>; <emph>There is
                        no one to help them</emph>; <emph>This is what you were born for</emph>;
                        <emph>I saw it</emph>. These and dozens of other declamations, ranging in
                    tone from head-shaking disbelief to helplessness, resignation, bitterness, and
                    dark humor, come across to contemporary ears like hashtags for the end of the
                    world. They follow one another and sometimes communicate laterally with each
                    other, but they track no sustained progress, no phenomenology of spirit. Their
                    pointedly legible—if laconic and agonistic—“voice” ensures that Goya becomes an
                    active figure in his own composite text, at once engraver and inaugural “reader”
                    of the engravings. Their almost strangled brevity, as if Goya were caught
                    between being at a loss for words and compulsively unable to hold his tongue,
                    embodies the crisis that overtakes the artist and that, in effect, becomes his
                    subject matter, namely, the unwillingness to look away coupled with the
                    inability to know how to look at what he is seeing. The captions are often
                    pronounced as if Goya were referring to someone else’s images, the estranging
                    effect being not unlike speaking of himself in the third person. Whether the
                    captions are a gloss that activates, schools, or even preempts viewers or
                    whether they are there to demonstrate a certain self-sufficiency about the
                    assemblage and thus a reticence about the participatory role of spectatorship is
                    not entirely clear. Goya may well be “reading” his images, and “reading” them in
                    such a strong way, in order to signal his ambivalence about the supplement of
                    spectatorial seeing, and doing so at the precise point where—momentarily—we are
                    struck blind to the images because we are reading words. What is evident is how
                    passionately Goya—or the ardent persona who writes in the artist’s unmistakable
                    hand—is in dialogue with his own engravings, his often exclamatory words in
                    striking contrast to the unerringly steady hand of his silent engravings. Yet we
                    might well ask: for whom were the captions written during the long latency
                    period when Goya lived with the unpublished <title level="m">Disasters</title>
                    in his studio, not to mention the more difficult to describe state in which the
                    assemblage found itself after his death and before their publication? It is hard
                    to shake the impression that the captions form one-half of a conversation that
                    Goya is having with himself. The captions generate a dialogue with the images
                    that we do not necessarily “hear” as participants who are presumed to be the
                    primary subjects of the engravings’ visual and verbal address but “overhear” as
                    always belated arrivals. In other words, the captions aren’t so much
                    confidential as a means by which to reshape our understanding of the meaning of
                    a public’s participation with art and of art. In them we observe how the <title level="m">Disasters</title> exhibit a care of the self rather than giving
                    itself entirely over to a presumed spectatorship.</p>
                  <p>Goya’s <title level="m">Disasters </title>are not privative in the sense of being
                    occult and unrecognizably idiomatic, but they were nonpublic until the
                    historical accident of their being printed and circulated more than three
                    decades after his death. That unexpectant delay ensures that spectatorship and
                    the giving-to-be-seen of images are not givens but questions worthy of
                    consideration. The interaction between the captions and the images, which is
                    between them as much as it is with us, reproduces elements of the relationship
                    that Goya forges with the <title level="m">Disasters </title>while they remained
                    in his custody. That dialogue ensures that when they were eventually published,
                    they remained haunted by their lifelong condition of having-been-set-aside. Goya
                    is hardly alone in this experiment. Rajan describes an analogous practice in the
                    work of British Romantic poets who sheltered texts in various generative ways:
                    written but never completed, completed but sutured into new poems, or completed
                    but never published, as was the case with Goya’s assemblage (“Coleridge,
                    Wordsworth, and the Textual Abject”). British poets early in the nineteenth
                    century experiment with what she calls the “textual abject,” the publically
                    uncirculated text that is not inert or abandoned but the scene of dynamic
                    recreation. As she suggests, the abject “protects . . . a space for
                    another self to emerge” (“Coleridge, Wordsworth, and the Textual Abject” 814).
                    But in Goya’s case, what are the qualities of this “self”? And what is the
                    nature of this “space”? The captions brim with a wit by turns scornful,
                    exhausted, and sorrowful that can be so piercing and acerbic as to constitute a
                    kind of attack on the images that they caption. <emph>Great deeds! With the
                        dead! </emph>is a case in point. Goya’s exclamation cannot help but form a
                    taunting gibe about the extraordinary feat of his own engraving and, by
                    extension, the project of which it is such a memorable part, as if he were
                    castigating <emph>himself</emph> for voyeuristically harnessing the worst to the
                    visible or for treating the worst as something that is meant to be seen in a
                    shared place, and indeed to contribute to the orderly formation and management
                    of such a place. Perhaps that is what makes seeing the <title level="m">Disasters </title>in a gallery or paging through them in a classroom so
                    compelling and strange; these contemplative experiences, which of course are not
                    without enormous merit, also help reproduce the two imbricated illusions with
                    which the <title level="m">Disasters </title>have a deeply agonistic
                    relationship: that the worst is elsewhere, and that here and elsewhere are
                    separate spaces in a larger but ultimately continuous “world.” To look at the
                        <title level="m">Disasters</title> and to think with them is to feel the
                    assemblage pushing back against being put to this worlding work, even as it
                    uncontrollably contributes to it in the act of being taking up as published. </p>
                  <p>When Goya imagines the worst and dwells with it, this is what he can see: a view
                    of humiliation and torture, dismembered bodies strewn about a battlefield,
                    heaped in piles but also hung up, arranged like trophies to be observed, as if
                    in a macabre <foreign>tableau vivant</foreign>. We are reminded that war is
                    always already its reenactments, a stagy repetition that Goya’s images mimic
                    uncontrollably. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? In what world could
                    these losses be economized? For now, forever, time feels frozen, at a
                    standstill. The presumed scopic pleasure taken by the torturers mixes
                    uncomfortably with the horror or dismay that we are asked to feel. It is
                    tempting to say that the image captures the outer limits of sovereign power over
                    life and death, except Goya’s point would appear to be to register the effects
                    of the complete derangement of the political, not its maximum projection; the
                    desecrated body and the will to sport “playfully” with its remains marks the
                    point at which the political enemy morphs into the enemy of the political, the
                    phantasm who is no longer an adversary against whom one might fight in a “world”
                    or for a “world” but a thing or a thing-like animal (and isn’t one of the barely
                    submerged discomforting features of Goya’s bodies and body parts that they are
                    hung like carcasses in an abattoir?) with which and to which anything is
                    permitted and against which no harm, strictly speaking, can be done. The artist
                    draws attention to the ensuing chaos, and the negatively creative power that
                    flourishes in that pandemonium, where killing becomes overkilling, and when fury
                    is brought to bear on bodies “whose death is no longer what needs to be assured”
                    (Debrix and Barder 122). Because this is the work of the bone collectors, we can
                    be sure that there will be more of it, since it is in the nature of collecting
                    not to be able to stop. Beyond the murder of human beings lies the demolition of
                    the human form and the becoming-animal or becoming-thing of the enemy. Spinoza’s
                    question, “What can a body do?,” is overwritten by its cruel correlative, “What
                    can be done to a body?” Where the Dutch philosopher expressed wonder at the
                    anonymous capacities of life, irreducible to volition, the Spanish artist looks
                    on the fate of anonymous dead who are utterly exposed in death, as the dead
                    always are, to another’s volition. Amid the waste of war, Goya’s exclamation of
                        “<emph>Great deeds! With the dead!</emph>” all but drowns out Spinoza’s cry.
                    The stillness of Goya’s macabre still life puts to us that war destroys not only
                    bodies but also futures, all that a body might have done, all that makes a
                    particular body particular. “We never know how we’re organized and how modes of
                    existence are enveloped in somebody,” Gilles Deleuze argues. For those bent on
                    defiling corpses, not knowing and having no prospect of knowing these
                    particularities, which are extinguished in death, is the source of a murderous
                    rage. Goya depicts an overgoing violence that is driven by a mad desire to tear
                    the secret of embodiment from the body, dead or alive.<note place="foot">I am
                        recalling Gilles Deleuze’s extraordinary remarks about Spinoza: “The point
                        of view of an ethics is: of what are you capable, what can you do? Hence a
                        return to this sort of cry of Spinoza’s: what can a body do? We never know
                        in advance what a body can do. We never know how we’re organized and how the
                        modes of existence are enveloped in somebody” (par. 149). </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spanish resistance against the French is also the scene of a ferocious civil
                    war, but both are but a prelude to another war altogether, or perhaps an other
                        <emph>of </emph>war: both war and its unbecoming, war that brings out how it
                    was always already its unbecoming. Or is the more radically sobering point of
                    engraving images of men doing awful things to corpses to demonstrate that
                    custody of the dead always lies entirely and uncontrollably with those who come
                    after, whether for good or for ill, whether to inspire faith or fear? Does the
                    source of the plate’s uncanny power lie in making luridly visible the work of
                    the living others in whose shaping hands the dead find themselves delivered, and
                    delivered not contingently, according to this or that circumstance, but
                    essentially, as if commanded by an irrevocable law that commands the living to
                    follow the dead and to take up the dead without necessarily knowing what this
                    going before the living and this inexistent relation means or knowing ahead of
                    time what form it will take? But who is the enemy when the objective of warfare
                    is not simply to defeat others who are said to be belligerents but, as
                    Jean-François Lyotard says, “to kill their dead” (160)? Goya’s mutilated corpses
                    put to us that even the dead will not be safe if the enemy prevails. <emph>Great
                        deeds! With the dead!</emph> may well depict the unrestricted violence that
                    the insurgency inflicts on itself, the extrajudicial killings that swept the
                    countryside as suspected collaborators and Enlighteners were executed and
                    dismembered in the field. In other words, the artist denies us the opportunity
                    to determine whether we are looking specifically at a Spanish or a French
                    atrocity, one of several ways in which the image refuses spectatorial desires as
                    well as captivates them. His point is that the nationality of the corpses
                    doesn’t matter anymore, not only because the dead are indifferent to such
                    distinctions but also because, through a macabre form of wartime chiasmus, the
                    living now prove to be insensate to the dignity of the dead; they are dead to
                    the dead. The plate’s bitter caption is shouted into a void where the
                    dismemberment of corpses does not invert heroism, replacing courageous acts with
                    cowardly ones, but, more disturbingly, demolishes the benumbed emptiness of
                    narratives that resort to understanding war in such moralizing terms. In the
                    place where slaughter becomes an end in itself, there is no why.<note place="foot">As a prisoner in Auschwitz, Primo Levi recalls reaching for an
                        icicle to quench his thirst before it is knocked out of his hand by a Nazi
                        guard. “<foreign>Warum?</foreign>” [Why?], asks Levi. “<foreign>Hier ist
                            kein warum</foreign>” [Here there is no why], the guard replies (Levi
                        29). </note> Among other things, the caption expresses the self-cancelling
                    futility of feeling outrage at the demise of outrage. <emph>Great deeds! With
                        the Dead! </emph>is, in effect, the aesthetic form that that futility takes. </p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Even worse . . . This is worse . . . The worst is to
                        beg . . . This is the worst!</emph> With this desperate chain of
                    captions, Goya evokes the impossibility of taking measure of the disasters at
                    hand or of judging them proportionally. Instead, the artist experiences them as
                    intensifying both inexhaustibly <emph>and</emph> repeatedly. We are here denied
                    the minimal consolation that the worst has taken place because Goya’s captions
                    make it feel as though worsening and the worst are doomed to occur without end
                    and in the absence of any organizing narrative or clarifying perspective. By
                    deciding against publication, Goya refused to let the <title level="m">Disasters
                    </title>form part of that perspective, and thus from becoming a vantage point
                    from which one could say, the disasters were then but this is now. The <emph>ad
                        nauseam</emph> repetition—<emph>worse</emph> and <emph>worst</emph>—marks
                    the brute passage of potentially endless wartime in which, to recall Paulson’s
                    remarks, “one crime simply follows another,” (337) except even to say this is to
                    miss the stranger thing, the more difficult thing to think, namely, that “one
                    [worst] crime follows another” (337). There must be more worsts out there, we
                    imagine, waiting to be seen and unable not to be looked at. With no world, no
                    outside-the-disaster or other-than-the-disaster from which to determine or rank
                    degrees of suffering and cruelty with any confidence, the disasters worsen, and
                    the worst happens in the way that nothing happens in Samuel Beckett’s <title level="m">Waiting for Godot</title>, namely, more than once.<note place="foot">I am recalling Vivian Mercer’s often cited remark about <title level="m">Waiting for Godot </title>as a play in which “nothing happens,
                        twice” (6). </note> Somehow we find ourselves observing the brute seriality
                    of the most atrocious. Goya thereby uses his captions to signal a willingness to
                    tarry with the disasters, but in a fashion that frankly embraces a certain
                    inoperativity of thought—and spectatorship. For what are we looking at if what
                    we are said to see is, recurrently, the worst? If there is no “exterior,” then
                    where do the engravings position themselves vis-à-vis the disasters? As Jan
                    Mieszkowski elegantly argues, the “Napoleonic dilemma of how to tell a war story
                    when there was no longer an outside to the war grew even more vexing as it
                    ceased to be clear whether one could speak of an ‘inside’ to the participants”
                    (152). We could say that the disasters <emph>worst </emph>Goya, but they do so
                    without blinding or destroying him and, conspicuously, without provoking any
                    attempt to better them or to inscribe them into a recognizable war
                    narrative—except, perhaps, one that turns on itself and is the site of its own
                    disaster. The disasters are the phenomena to whose maximal atrocity Goya is
                    returned again, meaning that the worst is not a singular event that he takes in
                    psychically but, rather, a pandemonium for which he provides accommodation in
                    the form of his unpublished engravings. The insistence on the worst reverses the
                    expectation, perhaps more powerfully felt today than in Goya’s day,<note place="foot">What is the <emph>history</emph> and the <emph>historicity
                        </emph>of the relationship between the psyche and violence? Are there
                        periods in which trauma is more likely to be naturalized as the psyche’s
                        experience of the worst, that is, the experience of nonexperience? What
                        other modalities of tarrying with the worst, or, for that matter, memory and
                        experience, are otherwise screened out by the emphasis on trauma? Are there
                        relationships with the worst that are not, strictly speaking, mournful or
                        melancholic, relationships which are not on the side of <emph>work
                        </emph>but <emph>worklessness</emph>? For an extraordinary exploration of
                        these questions, see Terada’s “Living a Ruined Life: De Quincey beyond the
                        Worst.”</note> that the psyche’s elemental relationship with disaster is to
                    protect itself and to diminish violence, not allow for it more fully as humanly
                    possible, a position that includes thinking beyond the human, and in ways that
                    do not take the form of the human as a given. The <title level="m">Disasters
                    </title>are like a Tardis box of horror, composed of an unfurling “interior”
                    space that must make itself much more expansive than should be the case.<note place="foot">The “Tardis box” of course refers to the fictional spacecraft
                        and time machine in the British television series, <title level="m">Doctor
                            Who</title>. The “TARDIS” (or “Time And Relative Dimension In Space”) is
                        a device that resembles a police telephone box on the outside but whose
                        interior is considerably more expansive.</note> Although he is speaking of
                    the drawings from Goya’s Album D, T. J. Clark precisely captures this curious
                    quality characterizing the artist’s images: “There is never a feeling of the
                    trauma being dwelled on in order to be mastered. There is not even the feeling
                    that the horror is a trauma, or that drawing it necessarily lessens it. Maybe
                    the opposite. It isolated it; it specifies it; it gives it the blank of the page
                    to live in” (33). </p>
                  <p>Goya is not absent to the experience of the disaster but time and again presents
                    himself to its utter ruinousness, as if compelled to look persistently at that
                    which, strictly speaking, can be seen but once, and then only because that
                    vision is framed by the capacity to look away or to have seen otherwise or to
                    have seen less. The <title level="m">Disasters </title>in their entirety
                    constitute an act of looking not in spite but precisely because of what
                    Didi-Huberman calls “our inability to know how to look at them today” (i). To
                    look but not necessarily to know how to look means observing the worst without
                    apprehending ahead of time or in the aftermath what the worst summons from us
                    specifically as observers. Goya says “This is the worst,” but, strictly
                    speaking, he cannot mean what he says because there is always worse and more of
                    the worst in a <foreign>milieu </foreign>of worldlessness that lacks redemption,
                    orientation, or even the hint of relief that might come with the slackening of
                    atrocity leading up to and falling away from the worst. The whole idea of a
                    regressive worsening and the advent of the worst starts to disintegrate before
                    our eyes, and yet Goya hangs on to it, reproducing the conceit of responding to
                    the disasters in a measured and measuring way, as if art could metabolize or
                    comprehend the horror by putting it into pictures, while also creating images
                    whose captions remind us that we can do nothing to lessen the worsening and the
                    worst—except to cede a “page” to it, one of many, without end. With “the worst,”
                    Goya does not gesture to the end of the disaster, nor does he try to mark its
                    extreme outer limit. For the artist, the worst is that the worst that arrives
                    afresh as if he were to unable and unwilling to do anything but acknowledge its
                    arrival and look at its hideousness. The worst is that he has survived the worst
                    and that he is living with the worst in the moment when he says, “This is the
                    worst,” while knowing that he will need to say this again. The worst is to see
                    the worst more than once and to see it each time as if for the first time and
                    for the last time. </p>

                  <p>“For it is not in the name of a better and truer world that thought captures the
                    intolerable in this world,” Gilles Deleuze argues, “but, on the contrary, it is
                    because this world is intolerable that it can no longer think a world or think
                    itself” (qtd. in Terada, “Looking at the Stars” 290). What does no longer being
                    able to “think a world” <emph>look</emph> like? Plate 69 (Figure 2) of the
                        <title level="m">Disasters </title>may offer a clue because of its
                    commitment to tarrying with a disaster that is so complete and so completely
                    absorbing that <emph>nothing</emph> appears to escape its gravitational pull.
                        <foreign>Nada</foreign>, as we have seen, is in fact the title Goya gave the
                    print, as if to bring the viewer into the closest possible proximity with
                    nihilation while also preempting the thought of “a better or truer world.”
                        <foreign>Nada</foreign> would appear to name the design or desire that the
                    print thoughtlessly has on us, putting us at the scene of the crime, so to
                    speak, but without offering the means or hope that we might make much or for
                    that matter make anything of it. The caption invites us to dwell with the
                    disaster and do <emph>nothing</emph> more, an almost impossible task, to be
                    sure, but one worth experimenting with in a way analogous to Kant’s notion of an
                    aesthetic judgment that sees as the poets do, that is, attentively wide-eyed but
                    without a thought of assimilation or comprehension. Nothing is what thinking the
                    worst feels like. <foreign>Nada. Ello lo dice</foreign>, Goya’s caption reads:
                        “<emph>Nothing. It says as much</emph>” (or “<emph>Nothing. It says
                        [nothing]</emph>” or “<emph>Nothing. That’s what it says</emph>”). The
                    mysterious engraving for which this “nothing” is both the caption and a word
                    scrawled into an otherwise blank page in the body of the image calls strenuously
                    for an understanding that it also bluntly refuses. That the handwriting and the
                    writing hand are the same once again makes Goya into a figure in his own text.
                    Without any confidence in the concept of a world, and thus bereft of the
                    assurance that, as Colebrook puts it, “the world is given as this world for us,”
                        (<title level="m">Death of the Posthuman</title> 135) Goya abandons his
                    image to the questionable provenance of a nihilating stutter. A morass of
                    shadings and hatchings dominate the top half of the engraving, some yielding
                    barely discernible if surreally incongruous shapes, including a floating scale
                    and a cluster of faces that fade into uncertain scratchings from which faces
                    might or might not be made. Shapes that were not there at some imagined outset
                    now are there, or scarcely there. Below, a skinned and skeletalized figure, its
                    monstrous features contorted in effort, appears at first either to be sinking
                    into or struggling from an inky grave . . . until we realize that it
                    is the planar surface of the engraving itself in which the figure’s bare shape
                    is most palpably immured. Against a chaotic background we observe fragments of
                    human forms—bodiless heads, half a body stripped of its flesh—trapped between
                    the birth and death of their own emergence as forms. The
                        <foreign>tachiste</foreign> effect is profoundly estranging, as if the print
                    were flickering between the illusion of a dark depth and the depthlessness of
                    the print as such, as between pictorialism and the materiality of the picture.
                    In this way, plate 69 self-referentially gives us what Goya’s caption says it
                    gives us, <foreign>nada</foreign>, the strange substanceless thing that the
                    print elementally is, as Timothy Morton might say: “a spectral quasi-object
                    suspended in nothingness, an inconsistent bunch of squiggles that cannot ever
                    know itself as such” (198). <foreign>Nada</foreign> thus functions as a kind of
                    interdiction, emanating from both within and without the picture frame, pointing
                    in words to what the image has already accomplished, that is, refusing
                        <emph>unequivocally</emph> to be an image of something other than itself.
                    The nothingness of the nonrepresentational ground of the image stops us in our
                    tracks, as it were, commanding us to stay with the inscriptive surface where we
                    may be less likely to believe that the aesthetic can apprehend the disasters of
                    war, or embody the sublimely negative knowledge that that disastrousness cannot
                    be comprehended. Goya’s assemblage does not appear to have comprehension or
                    appropriation of any sort as its goal. Quite to the contrary, it is more a
                    question of letting rather than making the worst matter, assuming that such a
                    distinction could be imagined, and of staying close to its grim unfurling
                    without necessarily attempting to metabolize its hurtfulness or to create sense
                    out of its senselessness. Not, as Michael Naas, reading Derrida, puts it “to
                    idealize or incorporate the other’s world into my own, not to make of that world
                        <emph>a </emph>world” (233). But strictly speaking, “to live with the
                    . . . end of the world” (233) would mean living with the end of a
                    world of <emph>life</emph>, by which I mean a common world normatively given
                    over to the living, to the principles of preservation, progress, and
                    productivity, and thus to the immuno-logic of war. Central to that logic is the
                    sanctification of life that forms an alibi for a homicidal power so
                    hyperbolically enormous that it can seek to kill the dead by mutilating their
                    remains. To live with the end of the world means bearing lifelessness and
                    worldlessness—what I have called “scarcity”— but eschewing, for a moment, the
                    consolations of mourning and the economization or putting-to-work of loss. In
                    Derrida’s words, recalling Celan, “‘the world is far, the world has gone, in the
                    absence or distance of the world, I must, I owe it to myself to carry you,
                    without world, without the foundation or grounding of anything in the world’”
                    (105). This taking-on, he adds importantly, occurs “even <emph>before
                    </emph>carrying the other in oneself in mourning” (105). In other words, prior
                    to there being “me” and “you” and the picturable world or worlds that we imagine
                    inhabiting, there is a worldless <emph>portage. </emph>Perhaps to create proofs
                    but abstain forever from publication is a way of acknowledging that before
                    shouldering a burden one has already carried a weight which is nothing less than
                    the weight of the world. Or, to be more precise, a <emph>carrying</emph>, a
                    giving-over of a blank page, and little else, is the anarchically worldless
                    space in which the burdened subject materializes and finds itself compelled to
                    form and reform a world. </p>

                  <p>Among the strangest captions that Goya added to the engravings is perhaps the
                    most ordinary one: <emph>I saw it </emph>(<foreign>Yo lo vi</foreign>) (Figure
                    3). Appending the phrase “I saw it” was in Goya’s time a banally familiar
                    convention in poetry and engraving, meaning not “I saw this with my own eyes”
                    (Goya appears not actually to have seen most of the horrors that he depicts) but
                    instead functioning as a promise of two things: first, this happened, this event
                    really took place, and second, I am a “war spectator,” the one who can “create
                    the illusion of being there when dreadful things happen” (Hughes 272).
                    Mieszkowski would describe this as an example of “Napoleonic war imaginary,”
                    (5–6) but to do so would perhaps understate the curious rhetorical substitution
                    by which Goya’s signature is underwritten. For “I saw it” is a kind of
                    conjuring, the routing of authorship through its citation, and the invention of
                    a seeing and imagining artistic subject that is imposed on the blank
                    anonymity—the “it happened”—of the disastrous event, an event, moreover, that
                    that fictional “I” hails as the spectral ground of its own authority. Put
                    simply, “I saw it” is made to stand as a proxy for that which I did not see,
                    except figuratively, day for night. “I saw it” posits a world available to sight
                    and knowledge, but draws attention to itself as a positing and little more. The
                    insentient operation of rhetoric suggests that Goya is leaving traces of being
                    present to the disaster in ways that are in excess of the imaginary and the
                    phenomenological. Hidden in plain sight, Goya’s citation repurposes an otherwise
                    tired convention to register something new and very hard to say, namely, the
                    permeation of the artist by the worst—which is not quite the same thing as
                    seeing it imaginatively as a spectator or testifying to it as a witness,
                    although Goya was also caught up in the terrible labor of both those practices.
                    In its self-arresting brevity or inhibition, “I saw it” instead recalls
                    something Michael Herr says about the experience of another disastrous war, that
                    is, the disaster before Iraq and Afghanistan, before Guantánamo Bay and Abu
                    Ghraib. Herr writes, “A lot of it never made it in at all” (20). “It just stayed
                    stored there in your eyes,” (20) his stressed syllables slowing time down, as if
                    one could have the experience of “it,” an unnamed catastrophe in Southeast Asia,
                    and not so much miss the meaning, as in the case of trauma, as be stuck
                        <emph>with</emph> it or stuck to <emph>it</emph>, visually.—To experience or
                    imagine not much more than that, not much more than that happened and “I saw it”
                    . . . and for now, forever, to hold those two things in one place,
                    eyes wide shut. In its bareness or scarcity, “I saw it” is a declaration of
                    adequation and just-enoughness, of a moment of sheer commensurateness with the
                    worst, whatever this coming together might mean or come to mean. “I saw it” thus
                    withholds itself, abstaining from moving too quickly to what we are schooled
                    normatively into wanting to think, namely, “I saw this, but I wish that I saw
                    something else, something better.” When, near the end of his life, Goya left
                    behind the plates and proofs for the <title level="m">Disasters</title> and
                    moved to France, perhaps he acknowledged something that had always been the
                    case, including all the years in which he lived with them in his studio—namely,
                    that the worst remains stuck to the assemblage, and the assemblage stuck to
                    it—with or without the supplement of the “I” who sees. </p>

                     <foreign>Nada. That’s what it says </foreign>(<emph>Ello lo dice)</emph>: Goya’s
                    caption tries to give the engraving over to a kind of anonymous stammering, “it
                    says what it says,” as if it were a nothing forever on the brink of something.
                    Not for nothing did subsequent editors of Goya’s engravings mutilate this
                    inscription most of all, revising it to <emph>Nada. We shall see</emph> or
                        <emph>It will say</emph> (<foreign>Ello dirá</foreign>), the expectation of
                    future meaning, uninsurable as it is, being so much more preferable to the
                    scarcity of the predicament of sheer expectation. That this significant
                    recuperative change in the caption’s meaning could be made by only slightly
                    doctoring the caption’s characters returns us to the materiality of the letter
                    and to the nonphenomenal vision that fragments language into its meaningless
                    parts. What would it mean then to say “I saw it,” and leave it at that, to
                    experiment with the very idea of living that letting be among all the other ways
                    that one lives with others? The indeterminacy of the referent “it” redounds back
                    upon the “I” who is posited as seeing, for it is possible that the pronoun
                    refers to the engraving itself, and so functions as a prosopopoeia, an animating
                    projection on the engraving that “sees” without ever knowing what it sees. What
                    would it mean to see as the engraver or perhaps as the engraving sees, to store
                    the worst for now, forever, to dwell with disaster but in an unknown because
                    asocial, unproductive, untimely, and nondeclarative way? In giving itself to be
                    read rather than seen (writing perhaps being the most vivid instance of a
                    nonmimetic image), “I see it” reminds us that in their mimetic aspect, Goya’s
                    images call for a moral judgment while also allowing for another form of
                    judgment, if judgment is what it is, something closer to what Forest Pyle calls
                    a “blank opening onto futurity” (35). It goes without saying that that futurity
                    includes us, contemplating scenes engraved by Goya’s hands but not sent to us or
                    meant for us, scenes without an addressee and scenes that, were it not for an
                    accident of history, we could just as easily have not seen. What then can it
                    mean to tarry with an image, to see and not to understand, to engrave and not to
                    be printed, taken up, and consumed? One answer to that impossible question comes
                    unbidden from a not entirely unexpected place, that is, from another artist who
                    lives amid perpetual war brimming with the inimicalization of life that the
                    Peninsular Wars modeled, god help us. I am reminded of the novelist David
                    Grossman, who wonders aloud about what it means to occupy the catastrophe of the
                    war between Israel and the Palestinians, the war that saw his son, Uri, killed
                    by an antitank rocket in Lebanon in 2006. Grossman stands still, and that is the
                    unknown way in which he still stands, now, forever: “I touch on grief and loss
                    like one touching electricity with bare hands,” he says, “yet I do not die. I do
                    not understand how this miracle works” (n.p.).</p>
