    <text>
        <front>
            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">Although often heralded as a passionate denunciation of the mayhem
                    of the Peninsular War, Francisco de Goya’s The Disasters of War (1814-1820) was
                    not published during the artist’s lifetime. My wager is to treat Goya’s
                    desistance not as evasive but as intrinsic to the Disasters itself, now seen as
                    an artistic practice and an experiment in living that takes on ruination without
                    necessarily metabolizing it. Goya releases his images by denying them refuge in
                    the visibly social. In what ways are traces of this abstention legible in the
                    aquatints themselves? The fact that the prints remained uncirculated during
                    Goya’s lifetime threads together life and work, wartime and the aesthetic,
                    survival and ruination in ambiguous but mortalizing ways, and puts to us that,
                    for a time, for the decade that they took to engrave, and then for the remainder
                    of his life, the inventor and then the archivist of the series learned to live
                    alongside disaster in a condition that I call “worldlessness.” </p>

                    necropolitical context in which proliferating sovereign power fuses indistinctly

                        my thinking here.</note> The genesis of the text lies in the singular
                    circumstances in which Spain found itself in 1808. As Gonzalo Anes describes it:
                        <quote>The king, queen, and heirs were in captivity. There was no
                        government. The people, abandoned by the royal family when they left the
                        court to meet Napoleon in Bayonne, claimed sovereignty for themselves
                        .&#160;.&#160;. There was no constitutional authority that could assume
                        responsibility to “<foreign>arrojar a la nación a una lucha tan
                            desigual</foreign>” [hurl a nation into such an unequal fight]; there
                        was no organized army, weapons, or money. (xxxv)</quote> A year later, the
                    poet Manuel Jose Quintana noted that “the fatherland” faced nothing less than a
                    “holocaust” (<foreign>en holocausto</foreign>) (qtd. in Vega 185). Much worse
                    was to come. But what could be worse than a holocaust? In this world—if it is in
                    fact a world, and not the annunciation of the end of the world and of the end of
                    the very concept of a world—targets of opportunity abound without limit:
                    soldiers, insurgents, and civilians; men, women, and children; humans and
                    nonhumans, not to mention the environments, both built and natural, that these
                    fragile creatures inhabit or occupy. A frenzy of violence, shown to be at once
                    unregulated and highly targeted, threatens to obliterate histories, knowledges,
                    obligations, solidarities, futures, and perhaps thinking itself. Art too is
                    destroyed, including work by Goya,<note place="foot">Three large altar paintings
                        for the San Fernando de Monte Torrero church in Zaragoza were either
                        destroyed or lost during the sieges of the city. See the “Description” for
                        the “Apparition of Saint Isodoro to Saint King Fernando in front of the
                        walls of Seville” (<title level="m">Aparición de San Isidoro al Rey Fernando
                            el Santo ante los muros</title>) from the National Museum of Fine Arts
                        of Argentina. I thank Reva Wolf for graciously helping me track down the
                        fate of these altar paintings. Amid wartime shortages that included a dearth
                        of materials the artist needed to pursue his work, Goya gave up fine canvas
                        for bandages that were badly needed by the townsfolk defending Aragón, his
                        birthplace. That gift is made aslant of the wartime economy that otherwise
                        harvested the clothes of the battlefield dead to produce paper. See,
                        respectively, Hughes 283 and St. Clair 178. Mary Favret drew my attention to
                        the use of the clothes of the war dead in her book, <title level="m">War at
                            a Distance.</title></note> whose vividly realized scenes of combat,
                    starvation, torture, humiliation, menace, execution, and dismemberment can be
                    hard to look at and harder to understand. And yet, despite—or perhaps because
                    of—their difficulty, Goya’s images have remained impossible to ignore since they
                    were printed and published, long after the artist’s death. </p>
                <p>Goya’s focus is prephotographically tight. Jettisoning the convention of
                    depicting the battlefield from a panoptic distance, which presumes that the
                    spectator can and indeed wants to take the measure of war, his images zero in on
                    the toll of combat on individual bodies and small groups of bodies whose agonies
                    and indignities fill and overfill his pages. Some men are castrated; another is
                    impaled on the trunk of a tree. Women join the fight, but they are also hunted
                    down and sexually assaulted. Goya is the first artist to depict the rape of
                    women not as a battlefield aberration, much less as an aesthetically pleasing
                    scene of passionate struggle, but as a weapon of war.<note place="foot">For a
                        discussion of the question of Goya, war, and sexual violence, see
                        Sliwinski’s <title level="m">Human Rights in Camera</title> (50–53) and her
                        “Sexuality in the Time of War: Or, How Rape Became a Crime against
                        Humanity.”</note> The gendered brutality of combat hangs like a pall over
                    the battlefield whose boundaries are no longer visible. Even corpses—as well as
                    living bodies that are treated as already dead—are subjected to desecration that
                    is beyond killing, beyond the point in which violence is imagined to exhaust and
                    resolve itself in fatality, as Steven Miller has recently argued (1–50). In the
                    artist’s disjointed images we observe pervasive war suffering and war deaths,
                    and then something even more appalling, namely, “war after death” (Miller). How
                    then to draw bounding lines and etch images of war whose contours have dissolved
                    into excess and whose authorized self-descriptions no longer apply? What does
                    the human form look like when war extinguishes that form? </p>

                <p>Perhaps no scene in the <title level="m">Disasters </title>captures the bleak
                    unruliness of war more vividly than plate 39 (Figure 1), <emph>Great deeds! With
                        the dead! </emph>(<foreign>Grande hazaña! Con muertos!</foreign>), which I
                    treat in this essay as concentrating in one ghastly place many of the problems,
                    questions, and possibilities with which Goya’s assemblage thrums. Three
                    mutilated corpses are hung in a tree and displayed like trophies or presented as
                    triumphs. Two of the men have been castrated and hung upside down. One of the
                    men has been beheaded and has had his arms severed just below the shoulder.
                    Those arms are bound together at the hands and strung from a branch, the same
                    branch upon which the decapitated head is mounted. We cannot be certain that the
                    body parts are in fact parts of one whole—that is, whether the limbs and head
                    belong to the torsos at hand or to remains elsewhere. The staged nature of the
                    scene puts to us that there are perpetrators for whom violence must not only be
                    done but <emph>seen</emph> to be done, an imperative that, of course, complexly
                    implicates Goya’s decision to engrave the scene and ours to parse it.
                    Cataloguing the wounds and locating the bodies and the disposition of the body
                    parts, we find ourselves shadowing the artist to whose hand and eye the scene
                    was a horror but also a formal puzzle, a question of arrangement, orientation,
                    spacing, shading, and so forth. We come to see that looking at what Goya
                    unabashedly calls “the worst”.<note place="foot">The caption for plate 55 is
                            <emph>“The worst is to beg”</emph> (<foreign>Lo peor es
                        pedir</foreign>). As we shall see, Goya’s captions repeatedly return to what
                        is “worse” and “the worst.”</note> and working closely with formal questions
                    are not mutually exclusive practices and indeed that the form of the engraving,
                    which deliberately invites us to go over it, “part by part, limb by limb,”
                    (Benjamin, <title level="m">The Origin of German Tragic Drama</title> 176) is
                    the particular way that Goya caches the worst. The tree on which these horrors
                    are hung provides an occasion for the remains to be brought together and
                    presented, to be sure, but it is also Goya’s way of reminding us that what we
                    are seeing is the result not of an extraterrestrially malevolent will but of
                    something proximate and imaginable. The fact that the tree to which mutilations
                    are fastened is verdant, showing a stylized sprig of life amid these unnatural
                    deaths, serves as the punctum of a deeply sobering knowledge: the desecration
                    that Goya pictures may be fantastically grim, but it happened, it is happening,
                    in a place on Earth.<note place="foot">I am recalling Wieseltier, who speaks of
                        the effect of viewing color—rather than black-and-white—images associated
                        with the Holocaust: “You realize, almost as you never realized it before,
                        that the Jews were murdered in a place on earth” (90).</note> In this image
                    we see that there <emph>are</emph> fates worse than death, and part of what
                    makes scenes like this an example of the worst is not that they are sublimely
                    unimaginable but that they are, in fact, all too available to be executed,
                    observed, remembered, imagined, engraved, and thus in some sense both taken in
                    and <emph>lived with</emph>. What we see is not sublime, unless there is a
                    sublimity of radical desublimation, the dispiriting solidification of the human
                    form into its insensate segments and volumes. By an accident of history, we have
                    eighty-two or so images to consider, but the lack of any persuasive overall
                    narrative in the series, including the total number of prints making up the
                        assemblage,<note place="foot">Goya appends three etchings depicting the
                        torture of prisoners as an appendix to the volume of proofs for the <title
                            level="m">Disasters</title>, thereby complicating the idea that the
                        assemblage comes to a definitive end at plate 82, “<emph>This is the
                            truth”</emph> (<foreign>Esto es lo verdadero</foreign>). For a brief
                        discussion of the prisoner images, see Sánchez and Sayre 210–11.</note>
                    suggests both that the series comes to an end but does not conclude and that
                    many more images could well have been created. As Georges Didi-Huberman notes,
                    Goya is among a special group of artists who “know .&#160;.&#160;. that
                    disasters are multipliable to infinity” (124). Goya registers the importance of
                    making and captioning pictures even and especially if that work is without end.
                    What is centrally important to Goya is the insolent fact that dismembering and
                    displaying the corpses of the enemy dead “was thought; it was therefore
                    thinkable,” (Didi-Huberman 25),<note place="foot">In this passage Didi-Huberman,
                        citing the French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet, notes that “[the genocide]
                        was thought, it was therefore thinkable” (25).</note> just as
                    “all-out-war”—where, as Susan Sontag observes, “expenditure is all-out,
                    un-prudent, war being defined as an emergency in which no sacrifice is
                    excessive” (99)—was executable, and it was executed. Goya is quickened by the
                    need to think this executability and to say it in the form of images whose very
                    existence repudiates the desire to look away or not to look, or to look and not
                    to see, or to look and be told that there is nothing to see, or to say that it
                    happened somewhere else, during a “war,” for example, when anything can happen,
                    or that it happened, yes, but not in my experience, not to me or in front of me,
                    or that it struck me in a traumatizing manner that I am not willing or able to
                    imagine or experience. Goya makes the inability to know how to look at the worst
                    a central part of the agon of looking at the images of the worst, an agon, I
                    want to argue, that leaves indelible if subtle traces in the images themselves.
                    The <title level="m">Disasters </title>are not so much the aesthetic site where
                    we imagine Goya to be overcome by the worst or to be working through the worst
                    as they are the occasion for him to put the aesthetic into the service of
                    thinking the worst, and, importantly, courageously, of affirming that the worst
                        <emph>can </emph>be thought, in the name of ensuring that there is a place
                    in which its iniquity and enormity can pool or eddy amid the grotesque torrent
                    of violence that is wartime Spain.</p>
                <p>Goya’s assemblage is a fiercely self-contesting text, roiling with difficulties,
                    obscurities, and sudden shifts in visual styles. The refusal of the <title
                        level="m">Disasters </title>to align unproblematically with any of the
                    belligerents that they depict contributes to a dystopian picture of ambient
                    violence in which, as Ian Baucom argues, “there is no party innocent of the most
                    horrific violence, no revolution whose coming . . . betokens the possibility of
                    progress” (182-3). <foreign>Nada. Ello lo dice</foreign> (<emph>Nothing. That is
                        what it says</emph>), one of Goya’s most memorable captions announces, an
                    unadorned and guttural assertion, as much a catch in the throat as it is a
                    phrase, evoking both the waste of war and the strange void to which the labor of
                    watching war is consigned when even loss appears to be lost. If Goya grieves, he
                    grieves that grief that can teach him nothing, <foreign>nada</foreign>, which,
                    far from a condition of emptiness or vacancy, is what survival or living-on
                    looks like without the prospect of flourishing or transformation.<note
                        place="foot">I recall Ralph Waldo Emerson’s observation, in the wake of his
                        son’s death, that “I grieve that grief that can teach me nothing” (472).
                    </note> By preserving the <title level="m">Disasters </title>in their
                    unpublished state, after all, the artist makes nothing happen. But as Tilottama
                    Rajan says with regard to Romantic poetry, this is “not a sign of its difference
                    from a history where things happen” (“Keats, Poetry, and ‘The Absence of Work’”
                    335). “For poetry makes ‘nothing’ happen,” Rajan argues, by “disclosing a
                    negativity that is in history as much as in poetry” (335). After Stephen
                    Whicher’s remarks about Emerson, we can say that the grief that the <title
                        level="m">Disasters </title>cannot grieve is the form that grief takes.<note
                        place="foot">Stephen Whicher writes, “The grief that he cannot grieve is for
                        Emerson the form grief takes” (491). </note> Goya grieved the unfathomable
                    losses of the war, of that I have little doubt. But his text also touches
                        <emph>on</emph> grief, demonstrating by example that there are relationships
                    or perhaps adjacencies to ruination that are sorrowful but irreducible to
                    grieving. And so it is that Goya finds himself in a placeless place in which it
                    is neither possible nor advisable to determine with any confidence whether
                    history is changing or time is passing. The <title level="m">Disasters
                    </title>are a creature of this ambiguous impasse, in which, as Rei Terada
                    observes of Keats’s <title level="m">Hyperion</title> and <title level="m">Fall
                        of Hyperion</title> (poems that are contemporaneous with the creation of
                    Goya’s engravings), “the open-ended intolerability of the present is as
                    impossible not to see as it is to assimilate” (“Looking at the Stars Forever”
                    280). Not <emph>not</emph> to see and not to assimilate: this is the condition
                    of creative refusal that characterizes Goya’s relationship with the worst,
                    beginning with what he did and did not do with the assemblage once he had
                    brought it to the threshold of publication—or rather to the threshold of a
                    conventional understanding of publication. What I want to emphasize is this:
                    Goya did not publish the <title level="m">Disasters</title> during his lifetime.
                    He bequeathed a single set of proofs to his friend, the artist and collector
                    Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, and otherwise withheld them from publication
                    (assuming publication was indeed ever Goya’s interest or intent and thus the
                    desideratum from which the <title level="m">Disasters</title> then could be said
                    to have been withheld). Indeed, the assemblage would not be published until
                    1863, some thirty-five years after Goya’s death and half a century later than
                    the gruesome events that inspired them. To bring engravings to the proof stage
                    and then to halt the process of publication of which the printing of proofs is
                    conventionally the penultimate move is provocative to consider, especially if we
                    treat the interruption as the dynamic culmination rather than the regrettable
                    qualification of the work. I say “dynamic” because for Goya to have set the
                    assemblage aside for thirty-five years meant he did so not once, around 1820,
                    after the wars were said to have ended, but <emph>continually</emph>, repeatedly
                    deciding or returning to the decision—across shifting circumstances, both
                    biographical and historical—to shelter and affirm their studio rather than
                    social state, even after leaving the proofs and plates for the <title level="m"
                        >Disasters</title> behind when he moved to France in 1824 (Gassier and
                    Wilson 220).<note place="foot"> I use “state” as William Blake does, that is, as
                        a condition through which to pass rather than an identity that is already
                        there to assume. And I do not say “studio rather than social
                            <emph>life</emph>” because it strikes me as important to describe the
                            <title level="m">Disasters </title>as an example of what Claire
                        Colebrook, in “Earth Felt the Wound,” provocatively calls “the unlived,”
                        emphasizing the phenomenon—from acts to objects to concepts—for which
                        productivity, potentiality, or vitality don’t easily apply. The <title
                            level="m">Disasters </title>do not “reach their potential” on their
                        publication, nor are they “latent,” awaiting their public “manifestation,”
                        while they were uncirculated. And yet it is almost impossible not to speak
                        of them in these sorts of terms, which says less about the <title level="m"
                            >Disasters </title>and more about the pervasiveness of the biopolitical
                        in criticism, the naturalization of “the natural” in how we speak about the
                        aesthetic. </note> Over the course of Goya’s life, and then for some time
                    afterward, the publication of the <title level="m">Disasters </title>is
                    interrupted without interruption. To create proofs, hand them to a trusted
                    friend, but not publish the <title level="m">Disasters</title>, and not publish
                    them forever, is itself an artistic practice and irreducibly a part of what the
                    assemblage is and does. It means to publish the <title level="m"
                        >Disasters</title> without publishing them, or perhaps to publish them
                    without circulating them, a publication without publicity—this, as a way to
                    demonstrate that publication is irreducible to publicity. What if we were to
                    treat the setting aside of the <title level="m">Disasters</title> in its own
                    right, making the assemblage generically closer to a Romantic fragment and an
                    example of what Balachandra Rajan calls “the form of the unfinished”? As Rajan
                    argues, the Romantic fragment distinguishes itself by no longer being answerable
                    to a normative idea of completion: “It contributes to a whole which is neither
                    beginning nor end but only history,” (249) Rajan writes. “The unfinished, in
                    such a view, carried with it no natural citizenship, no whole from which it was
                    disinherited, or from which its incompleteness has been made to proceed” (Rajan
                    249). Goya’s abstention from publication remains mysterious to everyone except
                    the historicists, who say that he feared the displeasure of the Spanish
                    monarchy, his long-time patrons (Hughes 303; Gassier and Wilson 218). Since Goya
                    otherwise could sometimes show little concern for the sensibilities of the
                    Bourbons, whose benumbed <emph>in</emph>sensibility he didn’t hesitate to
                    capture in a famous portrait of the royal family, the reason for his decision
                    not to print the engravings probably lies there, but elsewhere too.<note
                        place="foot">The nineteenth-century poet and critic Pierre Jules Théophile
                        Gautier described the members of the royal family in Goya’s portrait as
                        looking like “the corner baker and his wife after they won the lottery”
                        (qtd. in Licht 127). As Fred Licht notes, “Even if one takes into
                        consideration the fact that Spanish portraiture is often realistic to the
                        point of eccentricity, Goya’s portrait still remains unique in its drastic
                        description of human bankruptcy” (128). </note> With the <title level="m"
                        >Disasters</title>, Goya makes himself <emph>scarce</emph>, certainly not
                    the only time his practice as an art took such a turn.<note place="foot">As
                        Gassier and Wilson put it: we have the extraordinary example of the “many
                        important works which Goya painted for himself and kept in his house” (214).
                        Sometimes Goya treated his work as a mode of interrogating and fashioning
                        himself as an other rather than as an artist who painted for others. </note>
                    My wager is to treat Goya’s desistance not as merely politically evasive or
                    professionally shrewd but “positively,” as intrinsic to the <title level="m"
                        >Disasters</title> themselves and as part of their otherwise often forgotten
                    perlocutionary materiality and force. Not doing something with the <title
                        level="m">Disasters </title>is also a way of doing something, traces of
                    which are legible in the composition, content, and captions of the images, as
                    well as in their materiality <emph>as </emph>images. The fact that the
                    engravings remained uncirculated and without meaning-to-be-circulated during
                    Goya’s lifetime threads together life and work, wartime and the aesthetic, in
                    ambiguous but mortalizing ways, and puts to us that, for a time, for the decade
                    that they took to engrave, and for the remainder of his life, the inventor and
                    then the keeper of the <title level="m">Disasters</title> lived disastrously;
                    that is, he tarried with <emph>the worst </emph>in a condition of complex
                    asociality, schooling himself, but always also in the company of others (for
                    Goya went on to produce many other works that were prepared for spectators other
                    than the artist to see), to live alone in the void of catastrophe, now, forever,
                    without the ameliorative props that his public persona as fashionable
                    portraitist and principal royal painter had furnished. Goya’s redaction, the
                    lifelong <emph>scarcity</emph> of the relation of his engravings to public view,
                    attests not only to the intolerability of the war world they depict but also to
                    the intolerability of the violent—because politically frozen—postwar world in
                    which they were finally set aside, the difficulty that Goya discerns in
                    discovering a consequential space in which to see war and to be seen <emph>to
                        see</emph> war. So Goya releases his images by <emph>refusing</emph> them a
                    “refuge in visibility” (Lippit 14) and in the visibly social. One could almost
                    say that, under these conditions, when <emph>one’s eyes fail</emph>, Goya
                    chooses to see the disaster by <emph>touching</emph> it, feeling its
                    unmistakable force, with all the grimy physicality that comes from laboring with
                    acid and ink, paper and copper, hand and burin. This <emph>tact</emph> or
                    recessiveness, this unusability about the <title level="m">Disasters</title>,
                    reminds us that the political and the historical are irreducible to the
                    publically declarative. But this negation and abstention is otherwise difficult
                    to discern if your optic is calibrated to the legible and the social, the same
                    optic, as it happens, through which sovereign power arbitrarily parses the
                    difference between who lives, whose lives are worthy of protection and
                    preservation, <emph>and</emph> those who are made to die—which is to say between
                    those who remain discernible to the law and those who are deemed to be unworthy
                    of discernibility.<note place="foot">For an elegant and powerful critique of
                        hermeneutical frameworks that value publicity over recessiveness, see

                <p>Goya’s captions are very strange: <emph>This is the worst</emph>; <emph>There
                        was nothing to be done and he died</emph>; <emph>Why?</emph>; <emph>There is
                        no one to help them</emph>; <emph>This is what you were born for</emph>;
                        <emph>I saw it</emph>. These and dozens of other declamations, ranging in
                    tone from head-shaking disbelief to helplessness, resignation, bitterness, and
                    dark humor, come across to contemporary ears like hashtags for the end of the
                    world. They follow one another and sometimes communicate laterally with each
                    other, but they track no sustained progress, no phenomenology of spirit. Their
                    pointedly legible—if laconic and agonistic—“voice” ensures that Goya becomes an
                    active figure in his own composite text, at once engraver and inaugural “reader”
                    of the engravings. Their almost strangled brevity, as if Goya were caught
                    between being at a loss for words and compulsively unable to hold his tongue,
                    embodies the crisis that overtakes the artist and that, in effect, becomes his
                    subject matter, namely, the unwillingness to look away coupled with the
                    inability to know how to look at what he is seeing. The captions are often
                    pronounced as if Goya were referring to someone else’s images, the estranging
                    effect being not unlike speaking of himself in the third person. Whether the
                    captions are a gloss that activates, schools, or even preempts viewers or
                    whether they are there to demonstrate a certain self-sufficiency about the
                    assemblage and thus a reticence about the participatory role of spectatorship is
                    not entirely clear. Goya may well be “reading” his images, and “reading” them in
                    such a strong way, in order to signal his ambivalence about the supplement of
                    spectatorial seeing, and doing so at the precise point where—momentarily—we are
                    struck blind to the images because we are reading words. What is evident is how
                    passionately Goya—or the ardent persona who writes in the artist’s unmistakable
                    hand—is in dialogue with his own engravings, his often exclamatory words in
                    striking contrast to the unerringly steady hand of his silent engravings. Yet we
                    might well ask: for whom were the captions written during the long latency
                    period when Goya lived with the unpublished <title level="m">Disasters</title>
                    in his studio, not to mention the more difficult to describe state in which the
                    assemblage found itself after his death and before their publication? It is hard
                    to shake the impression that the captions form one-half of a conversation that
                    Goya is having with himself. The captions generate a dialogue with the images
                    that we do not necessarily “hear” as participants who are presumed to be the
                    primary subjects of the engravings’ visual and verbal address but “overhear” as
                    always belated arrivals. In other words, the captions aren’t so much
                    confidential as a means by which to reshape our understanding of the meaning of
                    a public’s participation with art and of art. In them we observe how the <title
                        level="m">Disasters</title> exhibit a care of the self rather than giving
                    itself entirely over to a presumed spectatorship.</p>
                <p>Goya’s <title level="m">Disasters </title>are not privative in the sense of being
                    occult and unrecognizably idiomatic, but they were nonpublic until the
                    historical accident of their being printed and circulated more than three
                    decades after his death. That unexpectant delay ensures that spectatorship and
                    the giving-to-be-seen of images are not givens but questions worthy of
                    consideration. The interaction between the captions and the images, which is
                    between them as much as it is with us, reproduces elements of the relationship
                    that Goya forges with the <title level="m">Disasters </title>while they remained
                    in his custody. That dialogue ensures that when they were eventually published,
                    they remained haunted by their lifelong condition of having-been-set-aside. Goya
                    is hardly alone in this experiment. Rajan describes an analogous practice in the
                    work of British Romantic poets who sheltered texts in various generative ways:
                    written but never completed, completed but sutured into new poems, or completed
                    but never published, as was the case with Goya’s assemblage (“Coleridge,
                    Wordsworth, and the Textual Abject”). British poets early in the nineteenth
                    century experiment with what she calls the “textual abject,” the publically
                    uncirculated text that is not inert or abandoned but the scene of dynamic
                    recreation. As she suggests, the abject “protects .&#160;.&#160;. a space for
                    another self to emerge” (“Coleridge, Wordsworth, and the Textual Abject” 814).
                    But in Goya’s case, what are the qualities of this “self”? And what is the
                    nature of this “space”? The captions brim with a wit by turns scornful,
                    exhausted, and sorrowful that can be so piercing and acerbic as to constitute a
                    kind of attack on the images that they caption. <emph>Great deeds! With the
                        dead! </emph>is a case in point. Goya’s exclamation cannot help but form a
                    taunting gibe about the extraordinary feat of his own engraving and, by
                    extension, the project of which it is such a memorable part, as if he were
                    castigating <emph>himself</emph> for voyeuristically harnessing the worst to the
                    visible or for treating the worst as something that is meant to be seen in a
                    shared place, and indeed to contribute to the orderly formation and management
                    of such a place. Perhaps that is what makes seeing the <title level="m"
                        >Disasters </title>in a gallery or paging through them in a classroom so
                    compelling and strange; these contemplative experiences, which of course are not
                    without enormous merit, also help reproduce the two imbricated illusions with
                    which the <title level="m">Disasters </title>have a deeply agonistic
                    relationship: that the worst is elsewhere, and that here and elsewhere are
                    separate spaces in a larger but ultimately continuous “world.” To look at the
                        <title level="m">Disasters</title> and to think with them is to feel the
                    assemblage pushing back against being put to this worlding work, even as it
                    uncontrollably contributes to it in the act of being taking up as published. </p>
                <p>When Goya imagines the worst and dwells with it, this is what he can see: a view
                    of humiliation and torture, dismembered bodies strewn about a battlefield,
                    heaped in piles but also hung up, arranged like trophies to be observed, as if
                    in a macabre <foreign>tableau vivant</foreign>. We are reminded that war is
                    always already its reenactments, a stagy repetition that Goya’s images mimic
                    uncontrollably. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? In what world could
                    these losses be economized? For now, forever, time feels frozen, at a
                    standstill. The presumed scopic pleasure taken by the torturers mixes
                    uncomfortably with the horror or dismay that we are asked to feel. It is
                    tempting to say that the image captures the outer limits of sovereign power over
                    life and death, except Goya’s point would appear to be to register the effects
                    of the complete derangement of the political, not its maximum projection; the
                    desecrated body and the will to sport “playfully” with its remains marks the
                    point at which the political enemy morphs into the enemy of the political, the
                    phantasm who is no longer an adversary against whom one might fight in a “world”
                    or for a “world” but a thing or a thing-like animal (and isn’t one of the barely
                    submerged discomforting features of Goya’s bodies and body parts that they are
                    hung like carcasses in an abattoir?) with which and to which anything is
                    permitted and against which no harm, strictly speaking, can be done. The artist
                    draws attention to the ensuing chaos, and the negatively creative power that
                    flourishes in that pandemonium, where killing becomes overkilling, and when fury
                    is brought to bear on bodies “whose death is no longer what needs to be assured”
                    (Debrix and Barder 122). Because this is the work of the bone collectors, we can
                    be sure that there will be more of it, since it is in the nature of collecting
                    not to be able to stop. Beyond the murder of human beings lies the demolition of
                    the human form and the becoming-animal or becoming-thing of the enemy. Spinoza’s
                    question, “What can a body do?,” is overwritten by its cruel correlative, “What
                    can be done to a body?” Where the Dutch philosopher expressed wonder at the
                    anonymous capacities of life, irreducible to volition, the Spanish artist looks
                    on the fate of anonymous dead who are utterly exposed in death, as the dead
                    always are, to another’s volition. Amid the waste of war, Goya’s exclamation of
                        “<emph>Great deeds! With the dead!</emph>” all but drowns out Spinoza’s cry.
                    The stillness of Goya’s macabre still life puts to us that war destroys not only
                    bodies but also futures, all that a body might have done, all that makes a
                    particular body particular. “We never know how we’re organized and how modes of
                    existence are enveloped in somebody,” Gilles Deleuze argues. For those bent on
                    defiling corpses, not knowing and having no prospect of knowing these
                    particularities, which are extinguished in death, is the source of a murderous
                    rage. Goya depicts an overgoing violence that is driven by a mad desire to tear
                    the secret of embodiment from the body, dead or alive.<note place="foot">I am
                        recalling Gilles Deleuze’s extraordinary remarks about Spinoza: “The point
                        of view of an ethics is: of what are you capable, what can you do? Hence a
                        return to this sort of cry of Spinoza’s: what can a body do? We never know
                        in advance what a body can do. We never know how we’re organized and how the
                        modes of existence are enveloped in somebody” (par. 149). </note></p>
                <p>The Spanish resistance against the French is also the scene of a ferocious civil
                    war, but both are but a prelude to another war altogether, or perhaps an other
                        <emph>of </emph>war: both war and its unbecoming, war that brings out how it
                    was always already its unbecoming. Or is the more radically sobering point of
                    engraving images of men doing awful things to corpses to demonstrate that
                    custody of the dead always lies entirely and uncontrollably with those who come
                    after, whether for good or for ill, whether to inspire faith or fear? Does the
                    source of the plate’s uncanny power lie in making luridly visible the work of
                    the living others in whose shaping hands the dead find themselves delivered, and
                    delivered not contingently, according to this or that circumstance, but
                    essentially, as if commanded by an irrevocable law that commands the living to
                    follow the dead and to take up the dead without necessarily knowing what this
                    going before the living and this inexistent relation means or knowing ahead of
                    time what form it will take? But who is the enemy when the objective of warfare
                    is not simply to defeat others who are said to be belligerents but, as
                    Jean-François Lyotard says, “to kill their dead” (160)? Goya’s mutilated corpses
                    put to us that even the dead will not be safe if the enemy prevails. <emph>Great
                        deeds! With the dead!</emph> may well depict the unrestricted violence that
                    the insurgency inflicts on itself, the extrajudicial killings that swept the
                    countryside as suspected collaborators and Enlighteners were executed and
                    dismembered in the field. In other words, the artist denies us the opportunity
                    to determine whether we are looking specifically at a Spanish or a French
                    atrocity, one of several ways in which the image refuses spectatorial desires as
                    well as captivates them. His point is that the nationality of the corpses
                    doesn’t matter anymore, not only because the dead are indifferent to such
                    distinctions but also because, through a macabre form of wartime chiasmus, the
                    living now prove to be insensate to the dignity of the dead; they are dead to
                    the dead. The plate’s bitter caption is shouted into a void where the
                    dismemberment of corpses does not invert heroism, replacing courageous acts with
                    cowardly ones, but, more disturbingly, demolishes the benumbed emptiness of
                    narratives that resort to understanding war in such moralizing terms. In the
                    place where slaughter becomes an end in itself, there is no why.<note

                        icicle to quench his thirst before it is knocked out of his hand by a Nazi

                    captions, Goya evokes the impossibility of taking measure of the disasters at
                    hand or of judging them proportionally. Instead, the artist experiences them as
                    intensifying both inexhaustibly <emph>and</emph> repeatedly. We are here denied
                    the minimal consolation that the worst has taken place because Goya’s captions
                    make it feel as though worsening and the worst are doomed to occur without end
                    and in the absence of any organizing narrative or clarifying perspective. By
                    deciding against publication, Goya refused to let the <title level="m">Disasters
                    </title>form part of that perspective, and thus from becoming a vantage point
                    from which one could say, the disasters were then but this is now. The <emph>ad
                        nauseam</emph> repetition—<emph>worse</emph> and <emph>worst</emph>—marks
                    the brute passage of potentially endless wartime in which, to recall Paulson’s
                    remarks, “one crime simply follows another,” (337) except even to say this is to
                    miss the stranger thing, the more difficult thing to think, namely, that “one
                    [worst] crime follows another” (337). There must be more worsts out there, we
                    imagine, waiting to be seen and unable not to be looked at. With no world, no
                    outside-the-disaster or other-than-the-disaster from which to determine or rank
                    degrees of suffering and cruelty with any confidence, the disasters worsen, and
                    the worst happens in the way that nothing happens in Samuel Beckett’s <title
                        level="m">Waiting for Godot</title>, namely, more than once.<note
                        place="foot">I am recalling Vivian Mercer’s often cited remark about <title
                            level="m">Waiting for Godot </title>as a play in which “nothing happens,
                        twice” (6). </note> Somehow we find ourselves observing the brute seriality
                    of the most atrocious. Goya thereby uses his captions to signal a willingness to
                    tarry with the disasters, but in a fashion that frankly embraces a certain
                    inoperativity of thought—and spectatorship. For what are we looking at if what
                    we are said to see is, recurrently, the worst? If there is no “exterior,” then
                    where do the engravings position themselves vis-à-vis the disasters? As Jan
                    Mieszkowski elegantly argues, the “Napoleonic dilemma of how to tell a war story
                    when there was no longer an outside to the war grew even more vexing as it
                    ceased to be clear whether one could speak of an ‘inside’ to the participants”
                    (152). We could say that the disasters <emph>worst </emph>Goya, but they do so
                    without blinding or destroying him and, conspicuously, without provoking any
                    attempt to better them or to inscribe them into a recognizable war
                    narrative—except, perhaps, one that turns on itself and is the site of its own
                    disaster. The disasters are the phenomena to whose maximal atrocity Goya is
                    returned again, meaning that the worst is not a singular event that he takes in
                    psychically but, rather, a pandemonium for which he provides accommodation in
                    the form of his unpublished engravings. The insistence on the worst reverses the
                    expectation, perhaps more powerfully felt today than in Goya’s day,<note

                        </emph>of the relationship between the psyche and violence? Are there

                        experience of the worst, that is, the experience of nonexperience? What
                        other modalities of tarrying with the worst, or, for that matter, memory and
                        experience, are otherwise screened out by the emphasis on trauma? Are there
                        relationships with the worst that are not, strictly speaking, mournful or
                        melancholic, relationships which are not on the side of <emph>work

                        these questions, see Terada’s “Living a Ruined Life: De Quincey beyond the
                        Worst.”</note> that the psyche’s elemental relationship with disaster is to
                    protect itself and to diminish violence, not allow for it more fully as humanly
                    possible, a position that includes thinking beyond the human, and in ways that
                    do not take the form of the human as a given. The <title level="m">Disasters
                    </title>are like a Tardis box of horror, composed of an unfurling “interior”
                    space that must make itself much more expansive than should be the case.<note
                        place="foot">The “Tardis box” of course refers to the fictional spacecraft

                        a device that resembles a police telephone box on the outside but whose
                        interior is considerably more expansive.</note> Although he is speaking of
                    the drawings from Goya’s Album D, T. J. Clark precisely captures this curious
                    quality characterizing the artist’s images: “There is never a feeling of the
                    trauma being dwelled on in order to be mastered. There is not even the feeling
                    that the horror is a trauma, or that drawing it necessarily lessens it. Maybe
                    the opposite. It isolated it; it specifies it; it gives it the blank of the page
                    to live in” (33). </p>
                <p>Goya is not absent to the experience of the disaster but time and again presents
                    himself to its utter ruinousness, as if compelled to look persistently at that
                    which, strictly speaking, can be seen but once, and then only because that
                    vision is framed by the capacity to look away or to have seen otherwise or to
                    have seen less. The <title level="m">Disasters </title>in their entirety
                    constitute an act of looking not in spite but precisely because of what
                    Didi-Huberman calls “our inability to know how to look at them today” (i). To
                    look but not necessarily to know how to look means observing the worst without
                    apprehending ahead of time or in the aftermath what the worst summons from us
                    specifically as observers. Goya says “This is the worst,” but, strictly
                    speaking, he cannot mean what he says because there is always worse and more of
                    the worst in a <foreign>milieu </foreign>of worldlessness that lacks redemption,
                    orientation, or even the hint of relief that might come with the slackening of
                    atrocity leading up to and falling away from the worst. The whole idea of a
                    regressive worsening and the advent of the worst starts to disintegrate before
                    our eyes, and yet Goya hangs on to it, reproducing the conceit of responding to
                    the disasters in a measured and measuring way, as if art could metabolize or
                    comprehend the horror by putting it into pictures, while also creating images
                    whose captions remind us that we can do nothing to lessen the worsening and the
                    worst—except to cede a “page” to it, one of many, without end. With “the worst,”
                    Goya does not gesture to the end of the disaster, nor does he try to mark its
                    extreme outer limit. For the artist, the worst is that the worst that arrives
                    afresh as if he were to unable and unwilling to do anything but acknowledge its
                    arrival and look at its hideousness. The worst is that he has survived the worst
                    and that he is living with the worst in the moment when he says, “This is the
                    worst,” while knowing that he will need to say this again. The worst is to see
                    the worst more than once and to see it each time as if for the first time and
                    for the last time. </p>

                <p>“For it is not in the name of a better and truer world that thought captures the
                    intolerable in this world,” Gilles Deleuze argues, “but, on the contrary, it is
                    because this world is intolerable that it can no longer think a world or think
                    itself” (qtd. in Terada, “Looking at the Stars” 290). What does no longer being
                    able to “think a world” <emph>look</emph> like? Plate 69 (Figure 2) of the
                        <title level="m">Disasters </title>may offer a clue because of its
                    commitment to tarrying with a disaster that is so complete and so completely
                    absorbing that <emph>nothing</emph> appears to escape its gravitational pull.
                        <foreign>Nada</foreign>, as we have seen, is in fact the title Goya gave the
                    print, as if to bring the viewer into the closest possible proximity with
                    nihilation while also preempting the thought of “a better or truer world.”
                        <foreign>Nada</foreign> would appear to name the design or desire that the
                    print thoughtlessly has on us, putting us at the scene of the crime, so to
                    speak, but without offering the means or hope that we might make much or for
                    that matter make anything of it. The caption invites us to dwell with the
                    disaster and do <emph>nothing</emph> more, an almost impossible task, to be
                    sure, but one worth experimenting with in a way analogous to Kant’s notion of an
                    aesthetic judgment that sees as the poets do, that is, attentively wide-eyed but
                    without a thought of assimilation or comprehension. Nothing is what thinking the
                    worst feels like. <foreign>Nada. Ello lo dice</foreign>, Goya’s caption reads:
                        “<emph>Nothing. It says as much</emph>” (or “<emph>Nothing. It says
                        [nothing]</emph>” or “<emph>Nothing. That’s what it says</emph>”). The
                    mysterious engraving for which this “nothing” is both the caption and a word
                    scrawled into an otherwise blank page in the body of the image calls strenuously
                    for an understanding that it also bluntly refuses. That the handwriting and the
                    writing hand are the same once again makes Goya into a figure in his own text.
                    Without any confidence in the concept of a world, and thus bereft of the
                    assurance that, as Colebrook puts it, “the world is given as this world for us,”
                        (<title level="m">Death of the Posthuman</title> 135) Goya abandons his
                    image to the questionable provenance of a nihilating stutter. A morass of
                    shadings and hatchings dominate the top half of the engraving, some yielding
                    barely discernible if surreally incongruous shapes, including a floating scale
                    and a cluster of faces that fade into uncertain scratchings from which faces
                    might or might not be made. Shapes that were not there at some imagined outset
                    now are there, or scarcely there. Below, a skinned and skeletalized figure, its
                    monstrous features contorted in effort, appears at first either to be sinking
                    into or struggling from an inky grave .&#160;.&#160;. until we realize that it
                    is the planar surface of the engraving itself in which the figure’s bare shape
                    is most palpably immured. Against a chaotic background we observe fragments of
                    human forms—bodiless heads, half a body stripped of its flesh—trapped between
                    the birth and death of their own emergence as forms. The
                        <foreign>tachiste</foreign> effect is profoundly estranging, as if the print
                    were flickering between the illusion of a dark depth and the depthlessness of
                    the print as such, as between pictorialism and the materiality of the picture.
                    In this way, plate 69 self-referentially gives us what Goya’s caption says it
                    gives us, <foreign>nada</foreign>, the strange substanceless thing that the
                    print elementally is, as Timothy Morton might say: “a spectral quasi-object
                    suspended in nothingness, an inconsistent bunch of squiggles that cannot ever
                    know itself as such” (198). <foreign>Nada</foreign> thus functions as a kind of
                    interdiction, emanating from both within and without the picture frame, pointing
                    in words to what the image has already accomplished, that is, refusing
                        <emph>unequivocally</emph> to be an image of something other than itself.
                    The nothingness of the nonrepresentational ground of the image stops us in our
                    tracks, as it were, commanding us to stay with the inscriptive surface where we
                    may be less likely to believe that the aesthetic can apprehend the disasters of
                    war, or embody the sublimely negative knowledge that that disastrousness cannot
                    be comprehended. Goya’s assemblage does not appear to have comprehension or
                    appropriation of any sort as its goal. Quite to the contrary, it is more a
                    question of letting rather than making the worst matter, assuming that such a
                    distinction could be imagined, and of staying close to its grim unfurling
                    without necessarily attempting to metabolize its hurtfulness or to create sense
                    out of its senselessness. Not, as Michael Naas, reading Derrida, puts it “to
                    idealize or incorporate the other’s world into my own, not to make of that world
                        <emph>a </emph>world” (233). But strictly speaking, “to live with the
                    .&#160;.&#160;. end of the world” (233) would mean living with the end of a
                    world of <emph>life</emph>, by which I mean a common world normatively given
                    over to the living, to the principles of preservation, progress, and
                    productivity, and thus to the immuno-logic of war. Central to that logic is the
                    sanctification of life that forms an alibi for a homicidal power so
                    hyperbolically enormous that it can seek to kill the dead by mutilating their
                    remains. To live with the end of the world means bearing lifelessness and
                    worldlessness—what I have called “scarcity”— but eschewing, for a moment, the
                    consolations of mourning and the economization or putting-to-work of loss. In
                    Derrida’s words, recalling Celan, “‘the world is far, the world has gone, in the
                    absence or distance of the world, I must, I owe it to myself to carry you,
                    without world, without the foundation or grounding of anything in the world’”
                    (105). This taking-on, he adds importantly, occurs “even <emph>before
                    </emph>carrying the other in oneself in mourning” (105). In other words, prior
                    to there being “me” and “you” and the picturable world or worlds that we imagine
                    inhabiting, there is a worldless <emph>portage. </emph>Perhaps to create proofs
                    but abstain forever from publication is a way of acknowledging that before
                    shouldering a burden one has already carried a weight which is nothing less than
                    the weight of the world. Or, to be more precise, a <emph>carrying</emph>, a
                    giving-over of a blank page, and little else, is the anarchically worldless
                    space in which the burdened subject materializes and finds itself compelled to
                    form and reform a world. </p>

                <p>Among the strangest captions that Goya added to the engravings is perhaps the
                    most ordinary one: <emph>I saw it </emph>(<foreign>Yo lo vi</foreign>) (Figure
                    3). Appending the phrase “I saw it” was in Goya’s time a banally familiar
                    convention in poetry and engraving, meaning not “I saw this with my own eyes”
                    (Goya appears not actually to have seen most of the horrors that he depicts) but
                    instead functioning as a promise of two things: first, this happened, this event
                    really took place, and second, I am a “war spectator,” the one who can “create
                    the illusion of being there when dreadful things happen” (Hughes 272).
                    Mieszkowski would describe this as an example of “Napoleonic war imaginary,”
                    (5–6) but to do so would perhaps understate the curious rhetorical substitution
                    by which Goya’s signature is underwritten. For “I saw it” is a kind of
                    conjuring, the routing of authorship through its citation, and the invention of
                    a seeing and imagining artistic subject that is imposed on the blank
                    anonymity—the “it happened”—of the disastrous event, an event, moreover, that
                    that fictional “I” hails as the spectral ground of its own authority. Put
                    simply, “I saw it” is made to stand as a proxy for that which I did not see,
                    except figuratively, day for night. “I saw it” posits a world available to sight
                    and knowledge, but draws attention to itself as a positing and little more. The
                    insentient operation of rhetoric suggests that Goya is leaving traces of being
                    present to the disaster in ways that are in excess of the imaginary and the
                    phenomenological. Hidden in plain sight, Goya’s citation repurposes an otherwise
                    tired convention to register something new and very hard to say, namely, the
                    permeation of the artist by the worst—which is not quite the same thing as
                    seeing it imaginatively as a spectator or testifying to it as a witness,
                    although Goya was also caught up in the terrible labor of both those practices.
                    In its self-arresting brevity or inhibition, “I saw it” instead recalls
                    something Michael Herr says about the experience of another disastrous war, that
                    is, the disaster before Iraq and Afghanistan, before Guantánamo Bay and Abu
                    Ghraib. Herr writes, “A lot of it never made it in at all” (20). “It just stayed
                    stored there in your eyes,” (20) his stressed syllables slowing time down, as if
                    one could have the experience of “it,” an unnamed catastrophe in Southeast Asia,
                    and not so much miss the meaning, as in the case of trauma, as be stuck
                        <emph>with</emph> it or stuck to <emph>it</emph>, visually.—To experience or
                    imagine not much more than that, not much more than that happened and “I saw it”
                    .&#160;.&#160;. and for now, forever, to hold those two things in one place,
                    eyes wide shut. In its bareness or scarcity, “I saw it” is a declaration of
                    adequation and just-enoughness, of a moment of sheer commensurateness with the
                    worst, whatever this coming together might mean or come to mean. “I saw it” thus
                    withholds itself, abstaining from moving too quickly to what we are schooled
                    normatively into wanting to think, namely, “I saw this, but I wish that I saw
                    something else, something better.” When, near the end of his life, Goya left
                    behind the plates and proofs for the <title level="m">Disasters</title> and
                    moved to France, perhaps he acknowledged something that had always been the
                    case, including all the years in which he lived with them in his studio—namely,
                    that the worst remains stuck to the assemblage, and the assemblage stuck to
                    it—with or without the supplement of the “I” who sees. </p>
                <p><foreign>Nada. That’s what it says </foreign>(<emph>Ello lo dice)</emph>: Goya’s
                    caption tries to give the engraving over to a kind of anonymous stammering, “it
                    says what it says,” as if it were a nothing forever on the brink of something.
                    Not for nothing did subsequent editors of Goya’s engravings mutilate this
                    inscription most of all, revising it to <emph>Nada. We shall see</emph> or
                        <emph>It will say</emph> (<foreign>Ello dirá</foreign>), the expectation of
                    future meaning, uninsurable as it is, being so much more preferable to the
                    scarcity of the predicament of sheer expectation. That this significant
                    recuperative change in the caption’s meaning could be made by only slightly
                    doctoring the caption’s characters returns us to the materiality of the letter
                    and to the nonphenomenal vision that fragments language into its meaningless
                    parts. What would it mean then to say “I saw it,” and leave it at that, to
                    experiment with the very idea of living that letting be among all the other ways
                    that one lives with others? The indeterminacy of the referent “it” redounds back
                    upon the “I” who is posited as seeing, for it is possible that the pronoun
                    refers to the engraving itself, and so functions as a prosopopoeia, an animating
                    projection on the engraving that “sees” without ever knowing what it sees. What
                    would it mean to see as the engraver or perhaps as the engraving sees, to store
                    the worst for now, forever, to dwell with disaster but in an unknown because
                    asocial, unproductive, untimely, and nondeclarative way? In giving itself to be
                    read rather than seen (writing perhaps being the most vivid instance of a
                    nonmimetic image), “I see it” reminds us that in their mimetic aspect, Goya’s
                    images call for a moral judgment while also allowing for another form of
                    judgment, if judgment is what it is, something closer to what Forest Pyle calls
                    a “blank opening onto futurity” (35). It goes without saying that that futurity
                    includes us, contemplating scenes engraved by Goya’s hands but not sent to us or
                    meant for us, scenes without an addressee and scenes that, were it not for an
                    accident of history, we could just as easily have not seen. What then can it
                    mean to tarry with an image, to see and not to understand, to engrave and not to
                    be printed, taken up, and consumed? One answer to that impossible question comes
                    unbidden from a not entirely unexpected place, that is, from another artist who
                    lives amid perpetual war brimming with the inimicalization of life that the
                    Peninsular Wars modeled, god help us. I am reminded of the novelist David
                    Grossman, who wonders aloud about what it means to occupy the catastrophe of the
                    war between Israel and the Palestinians, the war that saw his son, Uri, killed
                    by an antitank rocket in Lebanon in 2006. Grossman stands still, and that is the
                    unknown way in which he still stands, now, forever: “I touch on grief and loss
                    like one touching electricity with bare hands,” he says, “yet I do not die. I do
                    not understand how this miracle works” (n.p.).</p>
