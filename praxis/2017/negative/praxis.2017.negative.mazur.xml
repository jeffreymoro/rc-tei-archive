            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This article takes up the act of retreating or withdrawal as a way
                    of reading the unpublished and published versions of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's
                    "Christabel." Although Coleridge intended to publish "Christabel" in the second
                    edition of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> in 1800, the poem was
                    withheld from publication until 1816 and further revised by Coleridge until
                    1834. Rather than reading revision as clarifying authorial intention, or seeing
                    less revision as creating more indeterminacy, I see Coleridge's revisions to
                    "Christabel" as representing revision in a third sense: considerable revision
                    that appears insignificant but instead compounds the indeterminacy of the text's
                    writing. Taking up Coleridge's addition of <title level="m">The Conclusion to
                        Part the Second</title> as well as the modifications to the primary scene of
                    unreadability between Geraldine and Christabel, I argue that Coleridge's
                    repeated retreating and returning to these scenes are symptomatic of a traumatic
                    relation that cannot be read in terms of authorial intention, but rather, in the
                    words of Catherine Malabou, as an involuntary retreat that "the psyche cannot
                    stage .&#160;.&#160;. for itself" (Malabou 9). </p>

                    Publication</head>
                <div type="section">
                    <p> The idea for this essay emerged because of an article by Catherine Malabou
                        in the journal <title level="m">Public</title> entitled “Is Retreat a
                        Metaphor?” (2014). Retreat, it is true, is an act, but a negative one that
                        negates even the decision to retreat, because “there can be no retreat,” in
                        Malabou’s words, “without a retreat of the retreat itself, no retreat
                        without a re-doubling, to the extent that the only gesture or move
                        retreating can perform is to perform nothing, that is, to retreat”
                        (“Retreat” 35). For Malabou, the retreat cannot be economized. Retreating
                        does not, then, perform the move of withdrawing, as in the negative ebb to
                        the positive flow of the ocean, and neither is it a remove from the
                        profanity of the world towards some posited purity in absolute privacy. In
                        contrast, the retreat demonstrates effectively “what it is not, that is
                        .&#160;.&#160;. [not] a form of presence, be it God, substance, or reality”
                        (“Retreat” 35). Much like what Derrida says of literature, there is in the
                        retreat, “a chance of saying everything without touching upon the secret” of
                        the retreat, for in the act of retreating, the retreat itself remains
                        perpetually barred (“Retreat” 29). </p>
                    <p> Though not mentioned in Malabou’s article, Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe
                        Lacoue-Labarthe had earlier theorized an alternative version of the retreat
                        in <title level="m">Le Retrait du Politique</title> (1997). Their position
                        remains tentatively hopeful, for the “retreat,” according to Nancy and
                        Lacoue-Labarthe, “makes something appear or sets something free,” not
                        “according to the rule of a nostalgic lamentation for what would have drawn
                        back .&#160;.&#160;. but according to the hypothesis that this retreat must
                        allow, or even impose, the tracing anew of the stakes of the political”
                        (131). Rather than take a position, they argue for a
                            “<emph>de</emph>-<emph>position</emph>” as a sort of
                            <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign> that thinks the limits of the political and
                        the philosophical while still holding both in reserve for something yet to
                        come (94). The hopefulness that is sketched out by this idea of the retreat
                        relies on the possibility of retracing a new ground for the political, as
                        both theorists argue in another essay, “The Jewish People Do Not Dream”:
                        “[t]o draw back [<foreign>se retirer</foreign>] is not to disappear, and
                            <emph>is</emph> not, strictly speaking, any mode of being.&#160;.&#160;.
                        . [T]he <foreign>retrait</foreign> is the action of disappearing appearing,”
                        which means that one does not merely “appear <emph>in </emph>disappearing,”
                        but rather one “appear[s] <emph>as</emph> disappearance” (qtd. in Sparks x). </p>
                    <p> In her own way, Malabou recognizes Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe by means of
                        Derrida, as she mentions that Derrida notes, in “The Retreat of Metaphor,”
                        that the limits that separate authenticity and inauthenticity have become
                        “absolutely porous” (Malabou, “Retreat” 37). Malabou continues that this
                        results in an “aporia [that] does not equate [to] an impossibility,” but
                        rather allows for the possibility to “still invent a new meaning for a
                        retreat, .&#160;.&#160;. open a new possibility of withdrawing
                        .&#160;.&#160;. [for] something yet to come,” or as Nancy and
                        Lacoue-Labarthe would say, clear the ground for a new encounter at “the
                        incision” of the retreat (Malabou “Retreat” 37, Nancy &amp; Lacoue-Labarthe
                        133). However, Malabou herself withdraws performatively, as her text moves
                        from the conditional tense of the “I would have liked to dwell” towards, as
                        she says, an other Catherine, one enveloped involuntarily that “suddenly
                        become[s] motionless and speechless, “ one that “would lie in bed often with
                        her eyes open but with a blank facial expression,” only to return again to
                        the anxious hopefulness of the conditional tense (“Retreat” 36). If
                        Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy wish to retreat as a means towards de-positioning,
                        Malabou’s performance demonstrates the fragility that underscores
                        de-position’s purposelessness; the retreat cannot be intentional, according
                        to Malabou, for from where would one have the authority to withdraw, to
                        retreat from the political in order to re-treat it? </p>
                    <p> While Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe are concerned with re-treating the
                        political––which Malabou categorizes along the lines of several voluntary
                        and intentional retreats of past figures such as Maurice Blanchot, Alexander
                        Grothendiek, and Thomas Bernhard––Malabou’s concern is with the retreat as
                        something that is accidental, making retreat impossible as a result of its
                        traumatic immediacy. For Malabou, the retreat, then, is not something chosen
                        because the subject is indifferent to the retreat. She writes that
                        “indifference” is “undecided, unvoluntary, non-chosen,” while its “rhetoric
                        comprises figures of interruption, pauses, caesuras––the blank spaces that
                        emerge when the network of connections is shredded or when the circulation
                        of energy is paralyzed” (“Retreat” 41). She further elaborates this position
                        of indifference in <title level="m">Ontology of the Accident</title> (2012),
                        where she distinguishes indifference from sorrow: indifference “is the
                        suffering caused by an absence of suffering,” a suffering in which pain
                        “manifests as indifference to pain, impassivity, forgetting, the loss of
                        symbolic reference points” (Malabou, <title level="m">Ontology </title>18).
                        Finally, in <title level="m">The New Wounded</title> (2012), the retreat’s
                        affective mode of indifference is linked to the indifference that arises
                        after neuronal trauma or the trauma of the accident, as distinct from the
                        definition of trauma offered by traditional psychoanalysis. Trauma, which is
                        associated with “permanent or temporary behaviors of <emph>indifference
                        </emph>or <emph>disaffection</emph>,” “thus designates the wound that
                        results from an effraction––an ‘effraction’ that can be physical (a ‘patent’
                        wound) or psychical. In either case, trauma names a shock that forces open
                        or pierces a protective barrier” (Malabou, <title level="m">New Wounded
                        </title>10, 6). Whereas Freud may emphasize that trauma is endogenous to the
                        psyche, Malabou expands on Freud’s analysis by including the exogenous
                        causes of trauma by integrating recent studies in neurology. In this sense,
                        Malabou’s definition of trauma recognizes that the alterations to the ego
                        that are caused by external trauma have the potential to “manifest
                        themselves as an <emph>unprecedented metamorphosis </emph>of the patient’s
                        identity,” effectively creating a new person that is cut off from their past
                        selves (<title level="m">New Wounded </title>15). Trauma, then, becomes
                        something “the psyche cannot stage .&#160;.&#160;. for itself” (Malabou,
                            <title level="m">New Wounded </title>9). Because of this change that
                        results in an indifference or disaffection, any agency linking the subject
                        to the retreat has been shattered, so that there is no longer any
                        possibility for re-treating the political. In the case of the traumatic
                        event that is exogenous to the psyche, one cannot speak of the intentional
                        retreat; rather, one can only identify the involuntary retreat that is seen
                        in the destructive negativity and unproductivity of trauma, which nullifies
                        the circulation of desire.</p>
                    <p>Because Coleridge withheld “Christabel” from publication for seventeen years,
                        it is not only necessary to re-analyze the act of withholding as a retreat
                        of a voluntary kind, but also to consider the retreat as that which is
                        indifferent with regard to the imperative towards productivity implied by
                        the act of publication. The non-publication of “Christabel” poses a problem
                        because it begs the question: what was Coleridge trying to preserve by
                        withholding “Christabel,” and from what was he retreating? Furthermore, it
                        leads us to ask: can we even read the decision to withhold a text from
                        publication? And if so, how can we read the negativity of that which appears
                        only by not appearing, that is the immaterial, which is and is not there?
                        And yet, because we cannot read that which is not there, I intend to read
                        the different versions of “Christabel” before and after publication as a way
                        of developing the concept of the retreat; for, if Derrida is correct to
                        state that the line between the public and the private is absolutely porous,
                        the unpublished versions that come before the first published edition in
                        1816 mark a way of reading Coleridge’s retreat from publication in the sense
                        of Malabou’s failure of the retreat more than Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe’s
                        re-treating the political. </p>

                    <head>A Practical and Theoretical Approach to Revision</head>
                    <p>Before turning to an analysis of “Christabel,” it is necessary to outline its
                        textual history. Thanks to the work of Jack Stillinger, whose <title
                            level="m">Coleridge and Textual Instability</title> (1994) lays the
                        groundwork for all further studies on the versions of “Christabel,” we have
                        available the most well-composed textual and compositional history of the
                        poem. Stillinger outlines the poem’s textual history from its earliest
                        stages all the way to the final versions that Coleridge was involved in
                        revising: <quote> For “Christabel,” which Coleridge began writing in 1798,
                            expanded in 1800, and then tinkered with, but never completed, all the
                            rest of his life, we have or can reconstruct some eighteen versions, but
                            almost certainly there once existed several more than that in sources
                            now lost. To begin with, we know of nine manuscript versions (or partial
                            versions earlier than the first printed text of 1816: a holograph fair
                            copy of the equivalent of 1–655 (that is, part 1, the conclusion to part
                            1, and part 2) at Victoria College, Toronto (CoS 52); transcripts of the
                            same span, 1–655, by Dorothy Wordsworth and Mary Hutchinson among the
                            Wordsworth papers at Dove Cottage, Grasmere (CoS 51), Sara Hutchinson
                            (at Yale, CoS 53), Sara Fricker Coleridge, the poet’s wife (at the
                            University of Texas, Collection, CoS 55 and 58), and an unidentified
                            copyist (at the Bodleian Library, CoS 59); readings from a now-lost
                            holograph reported by John Payne Collier in his preface to Coleridge’s
                                <title level="m">Seven Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton
                            </title>(1856); and the quotation of 656–77, which later became the
                            conclusion to part 2, in Coleridge’s letter to Southey of 6 May 1801
                                (<title level="m">CL</title>, 2:278). The first printed text, in the
                                <title level="m">Christabel</title> volume issued by Byron’s
                            publisher, John Murrary, in May 1816 (<title level="m">1816</title>),
                            can count as the tenth version. There are at least five subsequent
                            versions constituted by changes and additions that Coleridge and others
                            entered by hand in copies of 1816 [(CoS 60, CoS 61, CoS 62, CoS 63, CoS
                            64)]. The last three versions are the texts in <title level="m"
                                >1828</title>, <title level="m">1829</title>, and <title level="m"
                                >1834</title>. (<title level="m">Coleridge</title> 79)</quote>
                        Stillinger’s position regarding the versions is two-fold. First, because
                        Coleridge revised his texts so many times throughout his life, Stillinger
                        argues that “the longstanding practice of identifying definitiveness with
                        ‘final authorial intention’ is no longer defensible” (<title level="m"
                            >Coleridge </title>10). Second, Stillinger suggests that a practical
                        theory of versions should adopt an approach of “textual pluralism,” which
                        would make “every separate version” have the right to “its [own] separate
                        legitimacy,” so that “all authoritative versions [would be] equally
                        authoritative” (<title level="m">Coleridge</title> 121). This position,
                        similar to those propounded by “James Thorpe in the 1960s and then developed
                        and championed .&#160;.&#160;. in Germany by Hans Zeller, in the United
                        States by Jerome McGann, Donald Reiman, [and] Peter Shillingsburg,” would
                        thus displace final authorial intention, and finally take into account the
                        fact that authors revise (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>121).</p>
                    <p>Revision, therefore, becomes a sign that allows one to read the differences
                        in versions as not better or worse, because these versions are legitimate,
                        discrete authoritative works in themselves. Stillinger compares writers who
                        revise—such as Coleridge—to writers who revise very little, for example John
                        Keats. What is most remarkable about the latter is “Keats’s facility in
                        drafting upon, or for, an occasion” all at once, and the fact that “there is
                        practically no evidence that he wrote his longer or more ambitious poems in
                        any other way” (<title level="m">Coleridge </title>102–03). On the other
                        hand, Coleridge’s revisionary practice is a way for Stillinger, according to
                        his “Old Critical and .&#160;.&#160;. New Textual point of view,” to read
                        authorial intention into the revisions Coleridge made to his texts (<title
                            level="m">Coleridge </title>100). The spontaneity with which Keats wrote
                        his poems stands in contrast, for Stillinger, to Coleridge’s inveterate
                        revising. For instance, Stillinger quotes a letter Coleridge wrote to Joseph
                        Cottle on February 1797: “‘I torture the poem, and myself, with corrections;
                        and what I write in an hour, I sometimes take two or three days in
                        correcting,’ such as is the case with ‘The Religious Musings, [which] I have
                        altered monstrously’ (<title level="m">CIL</title>, 1: 309)” (qtd. in
                        Stillinger <title level="m">Coleridge </title>104). In this sense,
                        Coleridge’s mode of composition required of him to become both “critic<emph>
                            and interpreter</emph> of what he had initially created without a plan,
                        and now, in these subsequent stages of writing, <emph>added authorial
                            intention</emph> that was not consciously present in the original
                        composition” (Stillinger, <title level="m">Coleridge </title>107). In order
                        to account for revision while still maintaining authorial intention,
                        Stillinger thus states that one can read revision as adding in authorial
                        intention to a text that seemingly showed an unclear authorial intention at
                        the outset of composition.</p>
                    <p>That Coleridge revised “Christabel” many times is clear from the many
                        versions before and after publication. And yet, the revisions Coleridge made
                        to “Christabel” were so minimal, changing a word here, a comma there,<note
                            place="foot">In fact, Coleridge’s modifications only become more
                            aggressive after publication, after the text is given over to the
                            public. In this sense, Coleridge’s withholding shows a markedly
                            different form of revision that attempts to maintain a personal
                            connection in the unpublished versions that is separate from and yet
                            still attempts to maintain a connection with the symbolic order. The
                            effect of publication shows revisionary practices that are more
                            concerned with impersonal pronouns, and increasingly shifts towards a
                            more mediated and generic gothic poem that attempts to retreat from the
                            destructive limits the poem transgresses before publication.</note> that
                        they lead Stillinger to revise his own thesis in <title level="m">Coleridge
                            and Textual Instability</title> (1994) about Coleridge’s revisionary
                        practices. This is made clear in a footnote that Stillinger adds as he
                        theorizes the revisions Coleridge made to “Christabel” and “Kubla Khan”:
                            <quote> If there is a causal relationship––in Coleridge’s not rewriting
                            the two poems [“Christabel” and “Kubla Khan”] to add authorial intention
                            in the way I have described––then perhaps a tentative generalization is
                            in order: the more revision in a Coleridge poem, the greater the
                            likelihood of receiving determinate (authorial) meanings––and,
                            conversely, the less revision, the greater the indeterminacy. (<title
                                level="m">Coleridge </title>246)</quote> However, the differences
                        and repetitions involved in returning, retracing, or re-treating
                        “Christabel” show that there is something that perhaps gripped Coleridge in
                        a third sense that even Stillinger, despite the modification he makes to his
                        own argument, has not yet taken into account. For if the quantity of
                        revision in a Coleridge poem should indicate more determinate authorial
                        intention, and if less revision indicates a more indeterminate intention,
                        Stillinger does not account for the fact that in “Christabel” there is
                        considerable revision that appears <emph>insignificant </emph>but still
                        compounds the indeterminacy of the text’s meaning. If we invert Stillinger’s
                        argument, this third sense of revision is defined by changes whose
                        negativity turns over and over again around an insoluble secret which
                        retreats from the author, thereby substituting the fetish of revision for
                        clarification. Despite his claiming that he had a clear intention in his
                        mind, “Christabel” appeared to have a libidinal hold on Coleridge that he
                        could not quite shake, as can be seen in his inability to truly revise the
                        poem, that is, not until his first attempt to relinquish it by giving it
                        over to the public by means of its publication in 1816. In this manner, the
                        endless revisions delayed ever having to end the poem, and thus prolonged
                        Coleridge’s libidinal relation to the text, since, in the words of Žižek in
                            <title level="m">Looking Awry</title> (1991), desire “does not consist
                        in its being ‘fulfilled,’‘fully satisfied,’” but “coincides rather with the
                        reproduction of desire as such, with its circular movement” (7). </p>

                    <p> Coleridge, as many know, had at best an ambivalent relationship with the
                        public sphere in England. “The word ‘public,’ he claimed, was ‘of pernicious
                        effect by habituating every Reader to consider himself as the Judge &amp;
                        therefore Superior of the Writer,’” and Coleridge believed, in the words of
                        Lucy Newlyn, that “readers were .&#160;.&#160;. appealed to as an infallible
                        judge: he dismissed them himself, sweepingly, as ‘the half-instructed Many’”
                        (qtd. in Newlyn 52). Coleridge’s general dismissal of the growing reading

                            “Christabel” from publication can be read more generally in terms of
                            Romanticism and its relation to “publics” and “counter-publics.” For
                            instance, the intentional act of withholding a work from publication
                            shows that the unpublished is at times dialectically related to the
                            published in the same way that spheres of the counter-public attempt to
                            respond to the hegemony of the public sphere. Andrew Franta’s argument
                            in <title level="m">Romanticism and the Rise of the Mass Public</title>
                            (2007), “that the regime of publicity could be employed to manipulate
                            the very notion of representation—not by transforming debate into
                            consumption but by bypassing debate altogether,” signals that
                            Coleridge’s anxiety over the public’s power to bypass interpretation
                            altogether was an all too common concern (33). For more research
                            concerning the relation of the public sphere and Romantic authors see

                        seemingly be read as a dismissal of his early communitarian ideals such as
                        his scheme with Robert Southey to establish a Pantisocracy; this dismissal,
                        it would seem, is further reinforced by his later desire for the
                        establishment of the “clerisy” class in <title level="m">On the Constitution
                            of Church and State</title> (1829). As Jon Klancher notes in <title
                            level="m">The Making of English Reading Audiences</title> (1980),
                        Coleridge’s “clerics were meant to be .&#160;.&#160;. masters of
                        interpretation,” that is, they were meant to take possession of what could
                        be read, “to rule in and rule out the possible readings of social and
                        cultural discourse,” effectively mirroring Coleridge’s relationship with his
                        own texts as simultaneous critic and interpreter (5, 136). However, as
                        Newlyn argues, “[i]f Coleridge’s ideas about literary ownership reflected
                        his political ambivalence, more generally, towards the idea of property,
                        they can also be read as paradigmatic of the transitional status of the
                        author at the time <title level="m">Biographia </title>was published” (69).
                        What Newlyn shows is that Coleridge’s anxiety over the reader is not merely
                        an anxiety concerning his work’s reception by the public sphere; his anxiety
                        was both internal and external. The unpublishability of “Christabel”
                        directly threatens Coleridge’s idea of a class of readers that have the
                        ability to judge and interpret texts, and, therefore, represents a danger to
                        himself and to the very community of the clerisy that he envisions.
                        Coleridge’s retreat can then be read as symptomatic of his growing anxiety
                        over the poet’s failure to critically engage with and direct the
                        constitution of that public sphere, because “Christabel” is as much about a
                        neurotic obsession over an unconstitutable negativity as it is a repression
                        of that negativity, confronting its readers with a poem that remains
                        consumed with an anxiety regarding its own publishability. Taken this way,
                        Coleridge’s decision to finally publish the poem in 1816 may be read not
                        only as a historical fact, but can be read through the lens of Lacanian
                        anxiety, as Žižek argues, because “it is not the lack of the object that
                        gives rise to anxiety but, on the contrary, the danger of our getting too
                        close to the object and thus losing the lack itself”; taken this way,
                        Coleridge’s anxious revisions provide insight into the complex relation that
                        anxiety has to desire at the level of publication, as “[a]nxiety is brought
                        on by the disappearance of desire” (8).</p>
                    <p>Through withholding a work from publication, the negative right to retreat
                        not only disturbs the notion of work as a material object, but also
                        deconstructs the insistence of public sphere theorists––such as Jürgen
                        Habermas and Clifford Siskin––that literature must be interpreted as a work
                        of writing under a discourse of the professionalization of the author. Even
                        in its early conception, “Christabel” was defined by its own
                        unpublishability. The poem was originally planned for the second volume of
                        the 1800 version of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, but
                        instead was replaced with Wordsworth’s “Michael,” which Wordsworth quickly
                        finished off in order to fill in the gap. The reason for the replacement is
                        not known, but we do know that Wordsworth, in a letter to his publishers,
                        Longman and Rees, stated, “upon mature deliberation I found that the Style
                        of this Poem was so discordant from my own that it could not be printed
                        along with my poems with any propriety” (qtd. in Gamer and Porter 31). After
                        1800, Coleridge circulated and performed versions of “Christabel” for
                        friends and family, and, as Christopher Laxer notes, the poem gained
                        popularity among the British reading public due to the fact that Coleridge
                        “controlled all access to his poem and could frame the perception of it in
                        any way he liked” (169). However, while Laxer argues that Coleridge held on
                        to “Christabel” because “publication itself shines a destructive and
                        leveling sort of light” (176), one could argue that Coleridge began to lose
                        control over “Christabel” well before its publication, at both the level of
                        writing as well as at the level of performance. Indeed, Walter Scott did not
                        hear it first from Coleridge, but from Sarah Stoddart in 1802, showing that
                        well before its publication the poem had already begun to circulate outside
                        of Coleridge’s immediate control. Furthermore, the impression that
                        “Christabel” left on Scott was seen not only in its metrical resonances in
                            <title level="m">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title>, but also in
                        Scott’s recitation of the poem, which, it turns out, was how Lord Byron had
                        “first heard the poem .&#160;.&#160;. at his publisher Murray’s house on
                        Albermale street,” which in turn is the reason for Byron’s involvement in
                        putting Coleridge in touch with Murray, who later published the poem in 1816
                        (Laxer 170). Indeed, Coleridge, when he first wrote the <title level="m"
                            >Preface</title> to “Christabel” for its initial publication, “feared
                        his own work would appear derivative of precisely those poems and poetic
                        identities that it had helped to shape” (28), as Tilar Mazzeo notes in
                            <title level="m">Plagiarism and Literary Property in the Romantic
                            Period</title> (2007). Mazzeo continues, “Christabel” “had been widely
                        circulated in manuscript among the literary coterie, and, as Coleridge knew,
                        the poem had influenced the compositions of some of his more celebrated
                        contemporaries, including Lord Byron and Walter Scott” (27). For this
                        reason, Coleridge ends his preface to “Christabel” with a “doggerel version
                        of two monkish Latin hexameters”:<quote>

                        withhold “Christabel” from publication can be read as an attempt to preserve
                        a relationship between author and text. But every time Coleridge returns to
                        the text, it signals a further loss of authority. It is important to note
                        that the decision to remove the poem from <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> arose out of an agreement between Coleridge and
                        Wordsworth, allowing us to read this decision to quarantine the poem not
                        only as a means to preserve Wordsworth’s style, but also to preserve
                        Coleridge’s own. While “Wordsworth’s exclusion” of the poem, argues Jerome
                        Christensen, “registers the threat that [“Christabel”] represented as
                            <emph>text</emph> (and, in the character of Geraldine as performative
                        theory of the rhetorical power of texts) to the <title level="m">Lyrical
                            Ballads</title> as book,” the non-publication of “Christabel” was also
                        extended to Coleridge’s other publications, when Coleridge did not include
                        the poem in the quarto volume containing “Fears in Solitude” (217). And when
                        “Christabel” was finally published alongside “Kubla Khan” and “The Pains of
                        Sleep,” it is telling that Coleridge did not try to publish the poems as a
                        book, but rather, as Stillinger has called it in <title level="m">Romantic
                            Complexity</title>, “a pamphlet,” a medium of print that, ever since the
                        sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, because of the influence of Calvin and
                        Luther, was overwhelmingly political (<title level="m">Romantic Complexity
                        </title>163). The pamphlet, as Laurel Brake argues, is profoundly dialogic
                        and in “dialogue with other agents of print and speech,” and to quote Orwell
                        in Brake’s essay, “it is written because there is something that one wants
                        to say now .&#160;.&#160;. in essence it is always a protest” (3). </p>
                    <p>And yet, the pamphlet is also closer to the fragment<note place="foot"

                            poem, it is important to mention some of the most important work on the
                            Romantic fragment, such as Marjorie Levinson’s <title level="m">The
                                Romantic Fragment Poem: A Critique of a Form</title> (1978) and

                            intentional form, I argue that “Christabel” evokes the externally
                            unintended, unanticipated, and traumatic sense of Malabou’s use of the
                            term “effraction,” which requires a shift of focus away from the
                            fragment as an unfinished project towards something more akin to the
                            project’s disintegration, which is radically more negative.</note> or
                        even the manuscript than to the serialized publication or the book, since
                        pamphlets were “normally unbound .&#160;.&#160;. [and] not always aimed at
                        public, or <emph>wide circulation</emph>” (Brake 8). Indeed, as is shown in
                        a letter Coleridge wrote to Sarah Stoddart in 1803, Coleridge’s intention to
                        publish “Christabel” remained always in flux. Insofar as he considered
                        publishing it, his plan was at least never to put it in a “guinea volume,”
                        as Karen Swann notes: Coleridge “[refused] Sotheby and the ten gentlemen
                        [that accompanied him], [so that] Coleridge [stood] on his literary
                        principles” and would rather have “Christabel” published on Ballad paper
                        (397). Thus on the one hand, the pamphlet, like the ballad sheet, is still
                        aligned with the publicity of print and is categorically different from the
                        private circulation of manuscript culture. But, on the other hand, if the
                        pamphlet remains a medium of print that is devoted to protest, it also
                        troubles the Habermasian conception of the public sphere, which, as Lee
                        Morrissey argues, is based on the false “presumption of a mutually
                        reinforcing relationship between literary criticism and democracy” (2).
                        Instead, the publication of “Christabel” in the form of a pamphlet
                        participates in and simultaneously questions the very form in which the
                        public sphere is constituted, inasmuch as Coleridge attempts to publish a
                        text that thematizes its own retreat from the circulation of a symbolic
                        order. The medium of the pamphlet invites readers to consider the
                        relationship between literature and the public sphere as one that is not
                        mutually reinforcing, but rather unstable and even antagonistic, since the
                        pamphlet’s engagement with the political does not have the transparency of a
                        Habermasian communicative rationality. Much like de Man’s conception of
                        language, which “combines a logical side, which it is possible to decode,
                        and a ‘tropological’ or metaphorical side, which stays as a ‘residue of
                        indetermination’ after a decoding of the grammar has occurred,” Morrissey
                        argues that literature opens the political to that which is left unread,
                        which results in the paradox: “the avoidance of one side of the meaning is
                        unavoidable” (9). As opposed to Coleridge’s hope that the clerisy would be
                        able to become critic and interpreter for the public sphere, the revisions
                        he made to “Christabel” before and after publication thus commit him to a
                        different conception of the political and the public sphere that remains
                        under erasure. Because of the act of revision, as well as the choice of
                        publishing in the form of the pamphlet, the boundary between the published
                        and the unpublished, or the public sphere and the (un)public sphere remains
                        in question, leaving open the indeterminacy that ungrounds them both.</p>

                            for any project that was first made public” (31), so that any return to
                            those pieces that remained unpublished represents an attempt to read the
                            collection of manuscripts, notebooks, and other texts in the space
                            surrounding a published text psychoanalytically rather than for
                            continuity. The concept of the <emph>avant-texte</emph> is related more
                            generally to the field of genetic criticism, a mode of textual studies
                            and textual history that moves the study of manuscripts away from merely
                            establishing a fair or accurate copy of a text. Reading genetically
                            moves one away from reading for the “final” text, and provides readers a
                            way of dialectically relating the <emph>avant-texte</emph> to the
                            published or public text in order to re-construct the writing
                            process.</note> so as to “reconstruct the configurations of unconscious
                        desires that [allow] themselves to be seen” in “Christabel,” which opens the
                        possibility to reconstruct the “unconscious discourse [that] slips into
                        conscious discourse” (6). While it has been noted that Coleridge rarely
                        changed “Christabel” in significant ways, the one major revision comes in
                        the form of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>,
                        which was originally from a letter addressed to Robert Southey dated May
                        6th, 1801, and which was later transposed into the first published version
                        in 1816. <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> of
                        “Christabel” is so strangely placed that it somehow appears out of place.
                        Indeed, if we compare the 1816 version of the poem with its prior versions,
                        there is no Conclusion of any kind, so that the
                            <foreign>avant-texte</foreign> provides us with a more formally
                        fragmentary and unstable poem; even the first of two transcripts by Sarah
                        Stoddart ends with the words, “A fragment” (Stillinger, <title level="m"
                            >Coleridge</title> 214). In a poem so obscurely uncertain of itself, the
                            <title level="m">Conclusion</title> appears as yet another failed
                        attempt made by Coleridge to close off the poem and make it ready for the
                        public. And yet, this crossing-out or repression of the poem’s fragmentary
                        condition indicates an attempt at “a mechanism of production” (Bellemin-Noël
                        6), because “[negation],” as Freud has noted, “is a way of taking cognizance
                        of what is repressed; indeed it is already a lifting of the repression,
                        though not, of course, an acceptance of what is repressed” (235–36). Because
                        the transcripts leave the reader with Sir Leoline leading forth Geraldine,
                        and because the narrator of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title> appears unwilling to admit the psychological trauma that
                        is central to the text yet exceeds the limits that <title level="m">The

                            Part the Second </title>disfigures the very possibility of completion,
                        for it replaces the thematic of the mother and daughter relationship found
                        in <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the First</title> and substitutes
                        the Wandering Mother for the Name of the Father. When Christabel confronts
                        Sir Leoline, entreating him to send Geraldine away, we do not see a
                        resolution, but instead the Baron is revolted by his own daughter, as the
                        narrator explains, “[i]f thoughts, like these, had any share, / They only
                        swell’d his rage and pain, / And did but work confusion there” (“Christabel”
                        625–27). This rage Sir Leoline feels is fueled by Christabel’s perceived
                        incongruity with the symbolic order, which the father wishes to establish by
                        means of exchanging Geraldine for the renewed friendship of Lord Roland de
                        Vaux of Tryermaine, a friendship long lost that left a hole in both men’s
                        hearts “[l]ike cliffs which had been rent asunder” (“Christabel” 410). Since
                        “never either found another / [t]o free the hollow heart from paining”
                        (“Christabel” 407–08), Geraldine functions as a means of re-establishing
                        discourse between the two men, and thereby restoring the homosocial bond
                        with Lord Roland by means of the feminine signifier. As Kristeva says of the
                        father’s relation to the abject in <title level="m">Powers of Horror</title>
                        (1982), “a representative of the paternal function takes the place of the
                        good maternal object that is wanting,” resulting in discourse “being
                        substituted for maternal care” (45). What <title level="m">The Conclusion to
                            Part the Second</title> effectively represses is not merely Christabel,
                        but the conflict that is staged at the end of <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title>, that is the conflict between speech and the unspeakable.
                        Taken this way, the repression of Christabel’s inability to speak results in
                        the text’s missed opportunity to engage with the retreating retreat, which
                        then haunts the poem in Coleridge’s repeated attempts to revise the
                        poem.</p>
                    <p> Arguably the narrator of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title> is “Coleridge,” inserting himself to limit the poem by
                        means of form and genre, and is separate from the narration that is present
                        throughout <title level="m">Part the First</title>, <title level="m">The
                            Conclusion to Part the First</title>, and <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title>. While both narrators are characterized by a tendency to
                        repress that which they cannot accept, the first narrator appears at least
                        willing to show but not tell, while the second narrator appears to downplay
                        the experience of Christabel altogether, and instead shifts the perspective
                        to the experience of the father as a kind of substitute for the authority of
                        the writer. That <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>
                        also originates from a letter Coleridge wrote to Southey is yet another
                        indication of Coleridge’s new presence at the end of the poem. Much like the
                        way <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> focuses on
                        the role of the father as a means of further shifting focus away from
                        “Christabel”’s unfinished ending, the fact that Coleridge replaces the more
                        descriptive narration of the first narrator with a theorization on the
                        “words of unmeant bitterness” (“Christabel” 652) indicates a retreat away
                        from the unconscious of the text; for even in <title level="m">The
                            Conclusion to Part the First</title>, the narrator appears unwilling to
                        tell but still knows of the “sorrow and shame” (“Christabel” 296) that had
                        taken place between Christabel and Geraldine. Even in the <title level="m"
                            >Biographia</title>, Coleridge attempts to downplay the spectral
                        presence of the unknown in “Christabel”, describing it rather as a “work . .
                        . that pretended to be nothing more than a common Faery Tale” (238). <title
                            level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title> also presents
                        Coleridge explicitly attempting to impose the generic form of the fairy tale
                        to “Christabel,”<quote>

                        she not seeking something at the beginning of the poem? One can see the
                        split in the narration between that which comes before and after <title
                            level="m">The Conclusion to Part the Second</title>, as the first
                        narrator even admits his confusion as to why Christabel is seeking something
                        that “makes her in the wood so late, / A furlong from the castle gate”
                        (“Christabel” 25–26), while the second narrator, “Coleridge,” seems to have
                        a slightly sadistic relation to Christabel’s desolation, as can be gleaned
                        from the assertion that it is “tender too and pretty / [a]t each wild word
                        to feel within / A sweet recoil of love and pity” (“Christabel” 672–74). But
                        while the narrators of the poem fail to recognize that Christabel seeks
                        recognition––which she finds in the figure of Geraldine, though
                        negatively––they, along with Geraldine as “A sight to dream of, not to
                        tell!” (“Christabel” 248), and the Wandering Mother that only Geraldine
                        seems capable of seeing and interacting with, are symptoms of Coleridge’s
                        repression of the absence that the text does not or cannot speak. For the
                        first narrator describes the traumatic encounter but does not seem to
                        realize that it has taken place, whereas the second narrator attempts to
                        sentimentalize the poem as a means of containing the trauma that comes
                        through at the level of writing; for the second narrator is not willing to
                        give voice to the trauma of the text, though it is recognized negatively by
                        means of the addition of <title level="m">The Conclusion to Part the
                            Second</title>, which represses the ending of <title level="m">Part the
                            Second</title> . This traumatic absence comes through, and “even
                        contrives,” to quote J.C.C. Mays, “to become a metrical event” in the tale,
                        so “that the true subject of the poem is only part-contained in words” (72).
                        For instance, the em-dash that occurs when Christabel first hears the moan
                        on the other side of the old oak tree, “It moan’d as near, as near can be, /
                        But what it is, she cannot tell,—” (“Christabel” 41–42) the break in
                        narration at line 42 implies the unknown known of the text, that is, in the
                        words of Joel Faflak, the “de-humanizing generation of affect that resists
                        intellectual or textual containment” (145). </p>
                    <p> Whereas Coleridge’s non-publication of “Christabel” could be read as a
                        voluntary retreat, a decision to withhold the poem from the public as a
                        means to contain its fragmentary condition, the publication of the poem
                        presents the reading public with the involuntary retreat of Christabel as
                        subject. This involuntary retreat clashes with the assumed Romantic retreat
                        of the poet from the world of politics into nature, as Christabel does not
                        retreat as a placeholder or reserve to re-treat the political “world of
                        death” (Coleridge 321). Christabel’s withdrawal signals a way of reading the
                        retreat at a further remove from historicist narratives that read
                        Romanticism as an intentional retreat away from the public, because
                        “Christabel” as text and Christabel as character both present specifically
                        involuntary examples of the retreat that do not conform to preconceived
                        Romantic shelters in the natural or the transcendental, thus forcing us to
                        re-think these issues more generally. Consequently, the difference between
                        the voluntary and involuntary here shows that the initial retreat of
                        non-publication still implies a will to power, a hope for completion, and
                        for an end to the infinite project of writing that is implied in Coleridge’s
                            <title level="m">Preface</title> to the poem. There, he writes,
                            <quote>But as, in my very first conception of the tale, I had the whole
                            present to my mind, with the wholeness, no less than with the liveliness
                            of a vision; I trust that I shall be able to embody in verse the three
                            parts yet to come, in the course of the present year. (<title level="m"
                                >Preface</title> 161)</quote> It is telling that by the last version
                        that Coleridge revised, which was printed in 1834, this sentence was not
                        included in the text’s <title level="m">Preface</title>. Instead, what we
                        are left with is Christabel’s involuntary withdrawal from language “in the
                        touch” of Geraldine’s “bosom” that becomes the “lord of [Christabel’s]
                        utterance” (“Christabel” 255–56). </p>
                    <p> This scene has its parallel with Hegel’s description of the master-slave
                        dialectic in <title level="m">The Phenomenology of Spirit</title> (1807).
                        There, Hegel argues that once the difference between master and slave is
                        achieved, the dialectic gives way to a new moment when “servitude in its
                        consummation will really turn into the opposite of what it immediately is;
                        [because] as a consciousness forced back into itself, it will withdraw into
                        itself and be transformed by independent consciousness” (117). It is then
                        that the difference is negated once again, resulting in a negation of the
                        previous negation, which is meant to provide the grounds for liberated
                        consciousness. Christabel’s withdrawal, on the other hand, appears to show
                        that the involuntariness of that retreat presents itself as an effraction
                        that results in disaffection, neutrality, and the inevitability of
                        abjection. Instead of the liberation of consciousness Hegel describes,
                        Geraldine is not present for her, because she is rather another symptom of
                        absence, so that Christabel’s encounter with Geraldine eliminates and voids
                        recognition as evidenced by the effect of Geraldine’s “serpent’s eye” upon Christabel.<quote><lg>

                        trope at the level of composition for reading the poem as a failure, partly
                        due to Coleridge’s habit of constantly telling people that he had “the whole
                        present to [his] mind, with the wholeness, no less than with the liveliness
                        of a vision” (<title level="m">Preface </title>161). But the publication of
                        “Christabel” alongside “Kubla Khan” and “The Pains of Sleep” indicates a
                        thematic ambivalence with respect to making known the unknown that these
                        texts seem to communicate at the level of affect. For instance, the affect
                        in “Kubla Khan” is nostalgic, as the narrative voice asks itself if it is
                        possible to accomplish its desire, the narrator questioning, “[c]ould I
                        revive within me / Her symphony and song / .&#160;.&#160;. I would build
                        that dome in air” (“Kubla Khan” 42–43, 46); and, in “The Pains of Sleep,”
                        what is communicated is the affective anxiety that comes from desiring to
                        withdraw from “[d]eeds to be hid which were not hid, / Which all confused I
                        could not know, / Whether I suffered, or I did” (“The Pains of Sleep”
                        27–29). Until the pamphlet’s first printing, one could read the retreat from
                        publication as a desire to withhold—to be with and to hold on to—these
                        poems, both out of a desire for completion and because of Coleridge’s
                        fascination with the poem, for Coleridge was in many ways compelled to
                        recite “Christabel” “in societies of the most different kinds” (<title
                            level="m">Biographia</title> 238). And yet the act of publication, if we
                        take the verb “to publish” literally in its meaning “to make something
                        public” or “to make something known,” can be read as Coleridge’s attempt to
                        retreat from his relation to the poem, as he literally gives over
                        “Christabel” to the public, which would be in line with Peter Melville’s
                        approach to reading Coleridge’s poetics “through the fort-da mechanism”
                        (107). If the figure of Geraldine is the success of “Christabel,” perhaps
                        the failure to write the next three parts is due to the effect of
                        representing that “witchery by daylight,” resulting in a text that is
                        mesmerized by but can never actually speak its desire. As <foreign>objet
                            petit a</foreign>, Geraldine stands for the absolute negativity of the
                        Real, but, by the same token, remains a part of the text so as to generate
                        desire in all its manifestations. In this sense, Geraldine guarantees the
                        libidinal economy of the text, but one that, as Kristeva argues, “maintains
                        the symbolic order through exclusion” (Kristeva 10). Coleridge’s pleasure in
                        reading aloud can then be read against the grain as the pleasurable pain of
                            <foreign>jouissance</foreign>, as he even remarks in the <title
                            level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> concerning the experience of the
                        “enkindling Reciter,” that it “is equally possible” that “a reader left to
                        himself should sink below the poem, as that the poem left to itself should
                        flag beneath the feelings of the reader” (<title level="m">Biographia
                        </title>239–40). As Coleridge was well aware, it was possible for a reader
                        to be enlivened by the performance of a poem, but the affective potential of
                        a poem may be too overwhelming in solitude; as such, Coleridge’s decision to
                        publish comes from the need for the distance of publication, of
                        relinquishing the text to a public, to preserve the desire for completion by
                        retreating from the poem itself, in the same way that he discusses the
                        possibility of pleasurable pain at the end of the poem: <quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> However, the act of publication does not rid Coleridge of
                        his relation to “Christabel,” as is shown in the revisions that he makes in
                        the versions after publication, specifically those found in the five marked
                        copies of the 1816 version, and furthermore from the eleventh version to the
                        eighteenth version. For none of these additions clarify the text.
                        Significantly, the prose glosses, like those added to “The Rime of the
                        Ancient Mariner” (1798), further obscure and contribute to the fantastic
                        elements of the text: for instance, the annotations that Coleridge made to
                        lines 249–55 in 1824, “As soon as the wicked Bosom, with the mysterious sign
                        of Evil stamped thereby, touches Christabel, she is deprived of the power of
                        disclosing what has occurred” (169). Indeed, Coleridge’s lifelong revision
                        of the poem exemplifies a relationship to the text that is emblematic of
                        what Tilottama Rajan calls the “textual abject” (45). In her article, “Mary
                        Shelley’s ‘Mathilda’: Melancholy and the Political Economy of Romanticism”
                        (1994), Rajan distinguishes the “textual abject” from Kristeva’s concept of
                        the abject, thereby transposing it into a means of reading Romanticism’s
                        tendency to re-cover, “both in the sense of redeeming and of covering up,
                        the abject by absorbing its affect into narrative and explanatory
                        structures” (45). The textual abject, as opposed to the Kristevan abject, is
                        introjected instead of being cast out, because the relation becomes internal
                        to the subject in contrast to the way that Christabel at the end of the poem
                        is left abjected from the text’s libidinal economy. Indeed, the text itself
                        retreats from the abject by casting it out in so many unreadable moments,
                        and repeats Coleridge’s lifelong return and rejection of the poem, whose
                        traumatic core he cannot confront except by retreating from the facticity of
                        Christabel’s final abjection. </p>
                    <p> While the primary scene of unreadability wherein Geraldine reveals herself
                        to Christabel has been “read” many times as a lesbian fantasy or as a
                        demonic enchantment which threatens Christabel’s purity and innocence, these
                        prurient readings arguably remain under the same fantasy that Coleridge
                        himself perpetuates by re-turning and re-treating the text so as to re-cover
                        a relationship to the symbolic order, to quote Žižek once again, which
                        spares him “the encounter with the real of [his] desire” (60). Prior to
                        publication, Coleridge never changed the scene, but neither could he narrate
                        Geraldine’s body. Instead, he leaves us with a fragmented body, “Behold! her
                        bosom and half her side—” (“Christabel” 246), but somehow this body should
                        be “full in view” (“Christabel” 245). Another em-dash gives rise to the
                        narrator’s decision to cover over the encounter, so that this is a “sight to
                        dream of, not to tell” although one that “is to sleep by Christabel”
                        (“Christabel” 247–48). It is here, after the publication of the 1816
                        version, that Coleridge makes one of the most substantive changes to the
                        poem, as is shown in marginal and interlinear annotations in copies of the
                        1816 version of the text, where he replaces on “And she is to sleep by
                        Christabel” with “O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!” (Stillinger <title
                            level="m">Coleridge</title> 85). In later additions<note place="foot">

                            </lg></quote> The most common interpretation of these changes is that
                        they result from a public outcry against the poem; however, if we read the
                        published text against its<foreign> avant-texte</foreign>, the dramatic
                        interruption of the narrator, “shield sweet Christabel,” covers over the
                        indifference present in the punctuation of earlier versions in the lines
                        such as “And she is to sleep by Christabel,” as well as “And lay down by the
                        maiden’s side” (“Christabel” 248, 250). In contrast to the earlier versions,
                        the later versions intimate a much more dramatic and anxious narration, the
                        lines cut vertically with multiple exclamation marks, which constantly
                        interrupt the text. However, the exclamation marks interrupt in a way that
                        is different from the horizontal em-dashes, which present moments of
                        unspeakable silence, in much the same way that Derrida describes the secret
                        as that which “is without content, without a content separable from its
                        performative experience” (24). Reading the versions genetically from the
                        earliest versions before publication to those after publication allows
                        readers to see the changes Coleridge makes to the passage as not merely with
                        a view to the public’s reception of the poem. Rather, the revisions
                        themselves stand in for Coleridge’s failed attempts at solving the problem
                        that arises from keeping the encounter of Christabel and Geraldine in
                        reserve. This foreclosure that prevents Coleridge from disclosing this
                        moment of the text is thus performative of the economy of the text, an
                        economy ungrounded by its own recourse to negativity, and which retreats
                        from that thing which cannot be re-invested in the economy: the secret as
                        absolute reserve.</p>
                    <p> This absolute reserve remains a “sight to dream of, not to tell” and thus
                        arrests Coleridge in such a way that he spends most of the second part of
                        the poem trying to de-mystify the foreclosed disclosure. Unlike Christabel
                        and Bard Bracy, where the former can see but cannot tell while the latter
                        can tell but cannot see Geraldine for what she is not, Sir Leoline sees
                        “this Geraldine,” and deems “her sure a thing divine” (“Christabel” 463–64).
                        For the Baron, Geraldine becomes the empty signifier upon which he can
                        re-constitute a relation to the public sphere with Lord Roland, and forget
                        the loss of his wife and a present life that he calls explicitly, “a world
                        of death” (“Christabel” 321). Whereas Coleridge, in <title level="m">On the
                            Constitution of Church and State</title> (1829), outlines the balance of
                        the State by means of three estates, specifically the Barons (the
                        land-owners), the merchants (the distributive class), and the clerics (those
                        in charge of the cultivation of civilization), “Christabel” offers a
                        narrative that shows the limits of reason in the prose text, showing a much
                        more affective and repressive imbalance foregrounded in the later political
                        text. In <title level="m">Church and State</title>, Coleridge argues that
                        the state relies on the “balance of the two great correspondent, at once
                        supporting and counterpoising, interests of the state, its
                            <emph>permanence</emph> and its <emph>progression</emph>” (<title
                            level="m">Church and State </title>21; my emphasis). For Coleridge, this
                        harmony plays itself out between the two houses, “the first consisting
                        wholly of barons or landholders, permanent and hereditary senators” and “the
                        second comprising the merchants, the manufacturers, free artizans, and the
                        distributive class” (<title level="m">Church and State </title>21, 33). The
                        copula that ties these two together, according to Coleridge, is the clergy
                        or clerisy. The national clerisy are to be made up of people who are to
                        “remain at the fountain heads of the humanities, in cultivating and
                        enlarging the knowledge they already possessed, and in watching over the
                        interests of physical and moral science,” and this community is to be
                        distributed throughout the country, as was previously stated above (<title
                            level="m">Church and State </title>34). </p>
                    <p> If we use Coleridge’s schemata from <title level="m">Church and
                            State</title> as an optic for the characters of “Christabel,” we can see
                        corresponding figures of permanence and clerisy in Sir Leoline and Bard
                        Bracy respectively. Indeed, Bard Bracy’s position in the text is to
                        interpret in the same way Coleridge describes the objectives of the clerisy:
                        “to preserve the stores, to guard the treasures, of past civilization, and
                        thus to bind the present with the past; to perfect and add to the same, and
                        thus to connect the present with the future” (<title level="m">Church and
                            State</title> 34). In contrast with the “custom and law” (“Christabel”
                        326) that Sir Leoline represents, Bard Bracy’s interpretation of his dreams
                        positions him as a proto-analyst of the internal state of the psyche, but at
                        the same time, his role seems to extend towards the external as well, as is
                        evident in his desire to delay Sir Leoline’s order to seek out Lord Roland
                        so as to go out and investigate the woods. As Bracy states, “[t]his day my
                        journey should not be,” (“Christabel” 528) because the dream is a sign that
                        there is something wrong with the world. <quote><lg>

                        (“Christabel” 553) Bard Bracy’s dream interpretation, his indifference to
                        the Bard’s request represses the role of the clerisy as analyst of the mind
                        and of the world, and, in fact, goes further by mistaking Bracy’s
                        interpretation to mean that Geraldine was “Lord Roland’s beauteous dove,”
                        and vows “With arms more strong than harp or song, / Thy sire and I will
                        crush the snake” (“Christabel” 557–59), the snake being his actual daughter,
                        Christabel. As opposed to the ideal of the clerisy Coleridge sets out in
                            <title level="m">Church and State</title>, “The bard obey[s]”
                        (“Christabel” 640) the orders of Sir Leoline, and thus represses the role
                        that balances the order of permanence with that of progress, which leaves a
                        world out of balance and Christabel alone and silent at the end of the text.
                        That Bracy is able to interpret the dream but fails to intervene in the
                        world demonstrates that the clerisy and the poet alike assume a politics of
                        the future like that of the narrator of the poem, “That saints will aid if
                        men will call: / For the blue sky bends over all” (“Christabel” 318–19).
                        However, if it is a prayer, it is one that does not inspire hope, but that
                        echoes out into a poem characterized by what Malabou calls the theatre of
                        absence, “the privileged expression of affective impoverishment and
                        destructive metamorphosis” (“Retreat” 41). The invocation of the social at
                        the end of “Christabel” reveals, on the one hand, an incapacity to move
                        beyond the fantasy that relies on a future-oriented return to a public
                        sphere, and on the other hand, it shows that this attachment requires a
                        sacrifice to the future that Christabel represents as the abject that must
                        be excluded. But, like the prayer that echoes out into nowhere, Coleridge’s
                        three parts yet to come fail to materialize because “Christabel” returns
                        Coleridge back to the point of abjection, and provokes his return to the
                        unspeakable moment at the end of <title level="m">Part the First</title>
                        instead of proceeding further into the fantasy of the social. This
                        unspeakable moment, the trauma from which Christabel withdraws, enacts
                        Coleridge’s desire to go back into the past of the text rather than keep
                        moving forward, for indifference destroys the possibility of fantasy, as a
                        result of the deep effraction, the wound from which Christabel suffers but
                        cannot communicate. It is perhaps, for this reason, that so many readers
                        return to “Christabel” because, in the words of Bard Bracy, it “would not
                        pass away––” and “seems to live upon [the] eye” (“Christabel” 546–47).</p>
