            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This essay considers the doubt and its relation to desire as
                    explored in William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> (1794). It
                    argues that the novel’s interest in doubt, and particularly its interest in how
                    doubt organizes legal inquiry, should be read in dialogue with a form of legal
                    doubt adopted within eighteenth-century legal epistemology as a response to
                    problem of legal judgment under uncertainty and now crystallized in the “beyond
                    reasonable doubt” evidentiary standard that continues to organize legal proof in
                    Anglophone law. The essay considers how the novel’s insistence on the ways
                    desire conditions doubt subverts the claims to “disinterestedness” and
                    “reasonableness” that recommend “reasonable doubt” as legitimate and adequate
                    response to the risks posed by judgment under uncertainty. The novel’s ironic
                    treatment of “reasonable doubt” exposes how reasonable doubt is itself
                    conditioned by an “unreasonable” desire to preserve the possibility of legal
                    judgment despite these risks and how this unreasonable, conservative desire
                    ultimately compromises its ability to assess and respond to uncertainty. Through
                    Caleb’s “unreasonable doubt” and the reader’s “doubt-as-suspense,” the novel
                    pursues doubt as raw, affective excess -- doubt as it exists “before” it is
                    disciplined or conditioned by skepticism -- in an attempt to expose the basis of
                    doubt in unreasonable, inaccessible desire and, thus, to call into question its
                    legitimacy as a ground for legal judgment. The essay’s coda considers how the
                    doubt “before skepticism” pursued by <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                    might be generalized as a form of “Romantic doubt” and, further, how this
                    “Romantic doubt” allows us to reimagine the relation of Romanticism and
                    skepticism. </p>

                    <p> In this essay I want to consider doubt and its relation to desire as
                        explored in William Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams </title>(1794),
                        by which I mean not only how doubt could be said to produce or be attended
                        by different forms of desire (for instance, the desire to resolve doubt into
                        certainty), but also how different forms of desire condition different forms
                        of doubt, and, even more strikingly, how doubt itself constitutes a form of
                        desire in the novel. Since the novel’s exploration of doubt also focuses on
                        how doubt organizes legal inquiry (for example, into Tyrrel’s murder or
                        Falkland’s guilt), I also want to consider how the novel’s treatment of
                        doubt is in conversation with a form of legal doubt that, by the late
                        eighteenth century, had emerged as a central strategy within legal
                        epistemology for addressing the problem of legal judgment in the face of
                        imperfect evidence. Indeed, that rational, procedural form of doubt remains
                        crystallized in the familiar “beyond reasonable doubt” evidentiary standard,
                        which first emerged in common law practice in the late eighteenth-century
                        and which continues to organize legal proof in American criminal law. Much
                        has already been written about the novel’s explicit thematization of legal
                        judgment as well as its incorporation of various legal frameworks—for
                        instance, the frameworks of testimony and trial—within its narrative
                            form.<note place="foot">AUTHOR’S NOTE: I would like to extend my
                            sincerest thanks to Tilottama Rajan, Orrin Wang, Marjorie Levinson,
                            Gregg Crane, and Julia Hansen for reading and responding to earlier
                            versions of this essay. For recent treatments of <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams </title>in relation to eighteenth-century legal theory and
                            practice, see Marshall 27–64, Grossman 37–38, and Hoeveler and Jenkins
                            327. Although the following reading will concern itself more with the
                            novel’s engagement with legal epistemology rather than common law
                            practice, its argument has affinities with Marshall’s claim that the
                            novel’s legal preoccupations can be “traced to contemporary anxieties
                            about the nature of justice and to specific legal challenges in the
                            evolving Common Law system” (Marshall 2).</note> Given the central role
                        of doubt in the legal theory of the period, the novel’s emphasis on the role
                        of doubt in assessing Falkland’s case could be regarded as part and parcel
                        of its appropriation of this broader legal framework. However, in this essay
                        I intend to concentrate on how the novel’s insistence on the relation of
                        doubt and desire ultimately works to subvert this form of legal doubt by
                        exposing the desires that condition it and thus upending assumptions
                        regarding its disinterested and reasonable character.</p>
                    <p>To begin to develop these claims, we might turn to Godwin’s suggestive remark
                        in his 1831 advertisement to <title level="m">St. Leon</title> that it was,
                        in part, “the state of doubt in which the reader might for a time be as to
                        the truth of [Caleb’s] charges” against Falkland that made <title level="m"
                            >Caleb Williams </title>“a narrative of no uncommon interest” (<title
                            level="m">St. Leon </title>v). It is a remark that testifies as much to
                        the centrality of the trial framework to the novel’s form as it does to the
                        centrality of procedural doubt within that legal framework. And yet Godwin
                        does not assume the reader’s state of doubt to reflect the kind of
                        disinterestedness we might expect or even demand from a judge or jury member
                        reviewing Falkland’s case. Rather, it is a sign of the reader’s
                        “uncommon”—that is, extraordinary or even excessive—interest in Falkland’s
                        case. This is doubt as suspense, not suspension. It heats up rather than
                        cools down judgment. In this sense, the character of the reader’s doubt
                        could be said to have a closer affinity with Caleb’s doubts and suspicions
                        about Falkland; it reproduces Caleb’s doubt-as-suspense.<note place="foot"
                            >Uphaus similarly observes that Caleb’s curiosity “excites” and
                            “expresses the desires of the reader’s curiosity” (281) and functions as
                            “a psychological attribute by which the reader is lured into reenacting
                            Caleb’s processes of mind” (282). </note> At the same time, however, the
                        reader’s doubt also appears to constitute a negative recoil from Caleb’s
                        suspicions. Here again Godwin’s retrospective remark is suggestive since
                        Godwin assumes the reader’s doubt to center on the “truth of [the] charges”
                        put forward by Caleb rather than directly on the facts of Falkland’s
                        case—or, in Godwin’s terms from the same advertisement, not on Falkland’s
                        “atrocious crime” itself but on the “annoyance [Falkland] suffers from the
                        immeasurable and ever-wakeful curiosity of a raw youth” (v). In other words,
                        it is a question of the merit or grounds of Caleb’s suspicion, a question
                        that includes but also exceeds the question of Falkland’s actual guilt.
                        Although Godwin seems to assume that the reader’s doubts only exist “for a
                        time” (presumably until Falkland confesses), the novel’s ethical difficulty
                        and sophistication would seem to hinge on the fact that the reader’s doubts
                        about the “truth” of Caleb’s charges – again, in this sense of their
                        warrant, of the legitimacy of Caleb’s grounds for making them – remain long
                        after the factual certainty of Falkland’s guilt is established. The reader’s
                        doubt does not ultimately register a dispute about the facts of Falkland’s
                        case but rather a dissatisfaction with the moral ambivalence of Caleb’s
                        doubt. On one hand, it seems evident that Caleb’s doubt about Falkland’s
                        innocence is hardly grounded in a disinterested desire for legal justice.
                        Instead, his doubt seems grounded in an excessive, indeterminate form of
                        desire. On the other hand, Caleb’s doubt, however compromised by desire,
                        somehow succeeds in discovering Falkland’s guilt where the supposedly
                        disinterested procedural doubt of the legal system fails. In this sense, the
                        reader’s dissatisfaction with Caleb’s doubt is compounded by an equal
                        dissatisfaction with the legal system, whose form of legal doubt appears no
                        less compromised. To complicate matters even further, the affinities between
                        the reader’s and Caleb’s doubt make it so that any dissatisfaction the
                        reader may have with Caleb’s doubt also amounts to a negative recoil from
                        her own doubt-as-suspense, a recognition of how this affective excess
                        similarly compromises any claim the reader has to disinterested judgment.
                        This compounding dissatisfaction should be seen as an emergent effect and
                        instrument of the novel’s negativity, one which turns doubt upon itself to
                        interrogate a certain faith in doubt’s reliability as a disinterested ground
                        for judgment under uncertainty.</p>

                    <head>Constructive Skepticism and Reasonable Doubt</head>
                    <p>While the novel’s pursuit of doubt as desire engages most directly with the
                        legal form of “reasonable doubt” I have described above, it should also be
                        seen as engaging with and commenting on a more widespread embrace of
                        rational skeptical procedures as a viable response to the problem of
                        judgment under uncertainty in the period. As Barbara Shapiro notes in her
                        discussion of eighteenth-century legal theory, because legal theorists
                        assumed a fundamental similarity between legal and everyday reasoning,
                        eighteenth-century legal epistemology should not be understood as distinct
                        from the general epistemology of the period. Rather it should be viewed
                        largely as an attempt to apply the most current epistemological theory to
                        specific legal problems (Shapiro, <title level="m">Beyond Reasonable Doubt
                        </title>19, 38). As Shapiro observes, long before the phrase “reasonable
                        doubt” emerged in the common law court, it formed the cornerstone of a broad
                        epistemological program that united philosophers and divines of various
                        stripes around the premise that, despite epistemological uncertainty,
                        “reasonable men, employing their senses and rational faculties, could derive
                        truths that they would have no reason to doubt” (<title level="m">Beyond
                            Reasonable Doubt </title>7). In this essay I will refer to this broader
                        philosophical program as “constructive skepticism” following Henry van
                        Leeuwen and Jamie Ferreira who have examined its origins in the
                        probabilistic epistemologies of the late-seventeenth century philosophers
                        John Tillotson, John Wilkins, and to some extent, John Locke.<note
                            place="foot">See Van Leeuwen, <title level="m">The Problem of Certainty

                                >Scepticism and Reasonable Doubt.</title></note> The program is
                        “skeptical” in the sense that it acknowledges the fact of epistemological
                        uncertainty and “constructive” in the sense that it rejects that this basic
                        fact should have any radical implications regarding our ability to arrive at
                        degrees of “moral certainty” sufficient to justify practical action and
                        judgment (Ferreira 2–4). Put another way, while constructive skepticism
                        accepts the skeptical premise that we are unable to attain certain knowledge
                        about matters of fact, it also accepts that the careful application of
                        skeptical and rational procedures constitutes a sufficient response to the
                        problem of uncertainty and, further, a viable method for “constructing”
                        actionable, if still uncertain, knowledge about the world. In this sense,
                        constructive skepticism can be further glossed as a “therapeutic” and
                        “conservative” form of skepticism since it retains a fundamental faith in
                        the ability of a procedural, rational skepticism to address and alleviate,
                        if not resolve entirely, the epistemic problem of uncertainty that
                        skepticism in general identifies. </p>
                    <p>It is specifically this conservative character of constructive skepticism and
                        how it conditions the character of legal doubt adopted within
                        eighteenth-century legal theory that I want to examine in this section as a
                        necessary philosophical background for understanding the novel’s approach to
                        doubt. This conservatism is inscribed in the demand that legal doubt must be
                        “reasonable” doubt. It is a qualification that reflects constructive
                        skepticism’s organizing assumption regarding the qualified value of rational
                        skepticism as a response to judgment under uncertainty. On one hand, the
                        “beyond reasonable doubt” standard reflects the recognition that an actively
                        skeptical posture helps reduce the risks of factual error and wrongful
                        conviction in legal judgment. On the other hand, the standard reflects the
                        recognition that, since legal facts are always subject to some degree of
                        uncertainty, at a certain point doubt must lose its instrumental value and
                        become an impediment to legal judgment. Allowing some doubt helps reduce the
                        risk of wrongful conviction; allowing <emph>any</emph> doubt makes it
                        impossible to convict at all. As such, the “beyond reasonable doubt”
                        standard attempts to strike a balance between, on the one hand, a desire to
                        reduce the risks of uncertainty and, on the other, a desire to preserve the
                        possibility of legal judgment despite the risks that inevitably attend
                        uncertainty. It achieves this balance by positing a distinction between
                        legitimate and illegitimate forms of doubt, between “reasonable” doubts that
                        are recognized within the legal process and “unreasonable” doubts that, for
                        various reasons, fail to qualify. The distinction aims to separate
                        “plausible” from “merely possible” doubt, “reasonable” doubt from “any doubt
                        at all,” and, most importantly for our purposes, “private” or “interested”
                        forms of doubt from “public” or “disinterested” forms of doubt.</p>
                    <p>Though these distinctions appear largely normative in retrospect, they were
                        regarded as descriptive in the period and, along with constructive skeptical
                        arguments for the sufficiency for “moral certainty,” depended more
                        fundamentally on a descriptive epistemological distinction between two kinds
                        of knowledge, “probable” and “demonstrative.” “Demonstrative knowledge”
                        entailed propositions that could be proved by logical demonstration and,
                        thus, produced an “absolute” or “demonstrative” certainty that necessitated
                        assent. Since probable knowledge could never admit of this level of
                        demonstrative certainty, the evidentiary standards for proof in probable
                        knowledge had to be adjusted to reflect the intuition that one could gain
                        sufficient, if incomplete, degrees of certainty to justify practical action
                        by ascending a graduated scale of belief based on degrees of “moral
                        evidence.” In this sense, degrees of evidence could be correlated to
                        relative degrees of belief ranging from absolute doubt or disbelief up to
                        opinion and, finally, to full confidence and conviction. “Moral certainty”
                        existed at the top of this evidentiary hierarchy and was assumed to provide
                        a functional equivalent to demonstrative certainty in the realm of
                        contingent fact. It was reserved for propositions that would be
                        “unreasonable” to doubt despite any theoretical level of uncertainty.</p>
                    <p> Intuitions about the sufficiency of moral certainty were developed with
                        reference to widely-observed and fairly uncontroversial natural regularities
                        (e.g., the rising and setting of the sun or the ebb and flow of the tides)
                        or to widely attested historical or geographical facts (e.g., that there was
                        a historical figure named Julius Caesar or that a city called Rome existed).
                        But the eighteenth-century legal theorist had little reservations about
                        applying the label of moral certainty to less regular, more controversial
                        legal facts. Eighteenth-century legal treatises readily adopted the basic
                        epistemological distinction between moral and demonstrative knowledge to
                        develop a normative account of evidentiary standards. Treatise writers
                        approached the epistemological distinctions as if addressing an audience
                        that would be either unfamiliar with the nature of moral evidence or somehow
                        reluctant to accept the sufficiency of moral certainty relative to
                        demonstrative certainty. Similarly, treatise writers tended to treat
                        orientations towards uncertainty that challenged the sufficiency of moral
                        certainty as irrational and pathological. Such orientations reflected an
                        excessive and unreasonable desire for certainty that failed to grasp the
                        very nature of probable knowledge, much less the exigency and necessity of
                        practical action under uncertainty. They fixated on doubts that were
                        theoretical instead of practical, scrupulous instead of significant, matters
                        of private rather than public concern. </p>
                    <p>To enjoin readers to accept the sufficiency of moral certainty, treatise
                        writers could depict the relation between demonstrative and moral certainty
                        in various ways and to various effects. In <title level="m">Essay Upon the
                            Law of Evidence </title>(1789), for instance, the jurist John Morgan
                        stresses the functional equivalence of moral and demonstrative certainty to
                        the point of identity, asking readers to accept the truth of legal testimony
                        under oath with the same confidence as if it had been demonstratively
                        proven. For Morgan, even though “human testimony, i.e. evidence given by one
                        man to another, can never produce certainty,” nonetheless, in matters where
                        a witness is under oath “[a mind] must acquiesce [to a witness’s testimony]
                        therein as from a knowledge by demonstration, because, according to the
                        nature of things, it ought not any longer to doubt, but to be nearly, if not
                        as perfectly well satisfied, as if we of ourselves knew the fact” (5).
                        Treatise writers could also stress the categorical difference of
                        demonstrative and moral certainty in an effort to reinforce the concept of
                        sufficient though incomplete evidence. This latter strategy generally
                        necessitated pathologizing the inability to perceive this difference as
                        unreasonable and irrational. Although not a legal treatise in itself, James
                        Gambier’s popular textbook on moral evidence, <title level="m">Introduction
                            to the Study of Moral Evidence</title>(1806), provides a clear and
                        representative account of how the epistemological distinction between moral
                        and demonstrative knowledge was effectively wielded to justify the normative
                        distinction between reasonable and unreasonable doubt within legal
                        epistemology and more broadly. </p>
                    <p>Gambier considers how a matter of fact can be assumed to “rise so high as to
                        exclude all reasonable doubt” while “fall[ing] short of absolute certainty”
                        (5). While he concedes that “we are often apt to expect stronger evidence,
                        than the nature of the thing [i.e. probable knowledge] admits; and, thence,
                        to feel dissatisfied, though the point be fairly proved,” he urges that we
                        should nonetheless “accustom ourselves to yield our assent” if “such
                        evidence be produced in a sufficient degree to counterbalance all that can
                        be fairly urged against it” (Gambier 93). He continues:<quote>
                            .&#160;.&#160;. [I]f in studying the evidence on any question of fact,
                            we employ ourselves in examining whether there be not a possibility that
                            it may be false, instead of considering whether there be not a
                            sufficient probability that it is true, we shall certainly raise strong
                            doubts in our minds. But, then, we should not study the subject
                            rationally. Demonstration is the only species of reasoning, which, if
                            even conducted correctly, can exclude the possibility of error. But
                            facts do not admit of demonstration. They admit of moral evidence alone.
                            The examining, therefore, into the possibility of error is inconsistent
                            with the nature of the subject, and an absurd practice. (93–94)</quote>
                        Gambier’s assertion regarding the “irrationality,” “inconsistency,” and
                        “absurdity” of fixating on the “possibility of error” with respect to moral
                        evidence was a common refrain within eighteenth-century legal epistemology.
                        The desire to attain degrees of certainty thought to exceed “reasonable
                        doubt” was generally treated in this manner as an epistemic category error,
                        a refusal to accept the basic epistemic conditions governing the evaluation
                        of matters of fact—what Gambier refers to as the “nature of the
                        thing”—rather than, say, a legitimate concern or anxiety about the limits of
                        practical judgment established by uncertainty. Indeed, it would be possible
                        to show that similar epistemological distinctions continue to organize the
                        concept of “reasonable doubt” in legal theory. For instance, in the 1850
                        case Commonwealth v. Webster still regarded by many legal theorists as the
                        most lucid attempt to define the “beyond reasonable doubt” standard,
                        Massachusetts Supreme Court Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw characterizes
                        reasonable doubt as “.&#160;.&#160;. not mere possible doubt; because every
                        thing [sic] relating to human affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is
                        open to some possible or imaginary doubt” (qtd. in Shealy 234 n. 40).</p>
                    <p>If Gambier’s account reflects a pathology of doubt developed in response to
                        the threat posed to legal judgment within rational skepticism itself, then
                        William Paley’s reflections on legal doubt in <title level="m">The
                            Principles of Political and Moral Philosophy </title> (1785) present an
                        alternative skeptical pathology developed in response to a separate
                        tradition of theological skepticism which perceived doubt as a sign of
                        uneasy conscience and, as such, recommended withholding judgment in the face
                        of any uncertainty. Unlike the rationalist pathology sketched above, which
                        focuses on reasonable expectations of certainty as informed by epistemology,
                        this alternative pathology focuses on how private concerns of conscience
                        unreasonably interfere with public and civic duties to uphold and execute
                        the law. This pathology was characterized as the “scrupulous conscience”
                        which, as Shapiro explains, was regarded as “a troubled or diseased
                        condition” of an individual “reluctant to act even after doubts had been
                        resolved” (“Changing Language” 267). Thus, Paley laments the civil
                        disservice performed by a jury member paralyzed by “an over-strained
                        scrupulousness, or weak timidity” which “holds it the part of a safe
                        conscience not to condemn any man, whilst there exists the minutest
                        possibility of his innocence” (391). For Paley, such private reservations
                        threatened the very efficacy of the legal system itself, where that efficacy
                        was conceived largely in terms of its ability to root out and convict
                        criminals despite uncertainty: “[W]hen certain rules of adjudication must be
                        persued [sic], when certain degrees of credibility must be accepted, in
                        order to reach the crimes with which the public are infested; courts of
                        justice should not be deterred from the application of these rules, by every
                        suspicion or danger, or by the mere possibility of confounding the innocent
                        with the guilty” (393). Indeed, in his 2008 study of the origins of the
                        “beyond reasonable doubt” standard, James Q. Whitman draws on this figure of
                        the “scrupulous conscience” to support his revisionist argument that the
                        standard was developed—at least at first—not to promote sound evidentiary
                        proof practices but rather to provide “moral comfort” for jury members
                        anxious about the eternal consequences of an error in uncertain, temporal
                        judgment. For Whitman, the reasonable doubt standard was “originally a
                        theological doctrine” which responded to “religiously motivated reluctance
                        to convict” (4) by “reassur[ing] jurors that they could convict the
                        defendant without risking their own salvation, so long as their doubts about
                        guilt were not ‘reasonable’” (3). In this sense, Whitman argues, the
                        standard was “not originally designed to make it more difficult for jurors
                        to convict”—as we assume it to be today—but “to make conviction easier”
                        (4).</p>
                    <p> These alternative pathologies should sufficiently demonstrate how the
                        concept of “reasonable doubt”—though ostensibly formulated as a means of
                        alleviating the problems of uncertainty—is also informed more fundamentally
                        by a conservative desire to preserve the possibility of legal judgment under
                        uncertainty against the threats posed by more radical forms of skepticism,
                        whether those threats are perceived as coming from within the rational
                        tradition itself or from outside that tradition in the form of
                        theologically-inflected skepticism. These pathologies should also illustrate
                        how the concept of “reasonable doubt” responds to this threat by normalizing
                        a circumscribed form of “reasonable” doubt that reflects these conservative
                        assumptions and, in turn, pathologizing other orientations towards
                        uncertainty that do not reflect these conservative assumptions as excessive
                        and illegitimate. With these observations, we are now in a position to
                        consider how the novel’s exploration of doubt and desire—and, more
                        precisely, doubt-as-desire –responds to this conservatism informing
                        “reasonable doubt.”</p>

                    <head>Before Skepticism: <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> and
                        Unreasonable Doubt</head>
                    <p>The novel’s insistence on the relation of doubt and desire can be read as an
                        attempt to expose how the desire to preserve the possibility of legal
                        judgment against uncertainty conditions the form of procedural, rational
                        doubt adopted by the legal system and, ultimately, circumscribes the kinds
                        of inquiry it can perform. The novel’s pessimistic depiction of the
                        inability of the legal process to, if not convict Falkland for Tyrrel’s
                        murder, at least save the Hawkinses from wrongful conviction seems
                        constructed to raise doubts about the ability of procedural doubt to
                        identify and assess risks associated with factual uncertainty or, more
                        provocatively, to achieve anything more than preserve the appearance of the
                        legitimacy of the legal process itself. In this sense, the novel asks
                        whether legal doubt is grounded, as it professes, in a desire to assess and
                        respond to the risks of uncertainty or, instead, grounded in a more basic
                        desire to preserve the possibility of legal judgment under uncertainty
                        itself. Further, the novel seems particularly invested in exposing how the
                        normative distinction between “reasonable” and “unreasonable” forms of doubt
                        does not necessarily reflect a legitimate response to the risks of
                        uncertainty but rather functions as a technique for rationalizing the legal
                        status quo. It is as if the novel’s subversive treatment of the distinction
                        between “legitimate” and “illegitimate” doubt aims to recast that
                        distinction as one between “legitimating” and “delegitimating” forms of
                        doubt. “Legitimate” doubts are “legitimating” in the sense that they operate
                        within the legal system to strengthen and legitimize the claim that it is
                        not only possible but reasonable to perform legal judgments despite
                        uncertainty, whereas “illegitimate” doubts are “delegitimating” in that they
                        threaten to undermine this claim. In this context, the desire of the legal
                        system to represent such doubts as illegitimate “in themselves” rather than
                        in relation to the organizing assumptions of the legal system becomes an
                        essential strategy for preserving and reinforcing the authority of the legal
                        system itself. The normative distinction between reasonable and unreasonable
                        forms of doubt relies, primarily, on the assumption that “unreasonable”
                        doubts threaten the legal system on account of their origins in illegitimate
                        forms of desire. But while the distinction purports to preserve the legal
                        process from the pernicious influence of desire, the novel explores the
                        chilling possibility that this distinction not only effectively
                            <emph>inscribes</emph> such unreasonable desires in the legal process
                        but also surreptitiously obscures or conceals this fact by directing
                        critical attention towards a specter of unreasonable doubt.</p>
                    <p> We can draw out these interests in the novel by considering the brief and
                        seemingly irrelevant appearance of a group of skeptics in the midst of
                        Collins’s narrative: <quote>.&#160;.&#160;. Hawkins and his son were tried,
                            condemned, and afterwards executed. In the interval between the sentence
                            and execution Hawkins confessed his guilt with many marks of
                            compunction; though there are persons by whom this is denied; but I have
                            taken some pains to enquire into the fact, and am persuaded that their
                            disbelief is precipitate and groundless. (Godwin, <title level="m">Caleb
                                Williams </title>174)</quote> The passage is one of the few times
                        Collins breaks from his task of narrating the events surrounding Tyrrel’s
                        murder to perform the task of validating his narrative. It is significant
                        that this task of validation takes the specific form of a procedural
                        skeptical inquiry. Collins doubles back to review and confirm the evidence
                        for Hawkins’s confession in the face of skeptical objections, in a manner
                        that, though technically extralegal, seems intended to mirror and extend the
                        careful legal procedures performed to absolve Falkland of any involvement in
                        Tyrrel’s murder. Despite their minor presence, these skeptics function as an
                        essential feature of Collins’s skeptical investigation. They enable Collins
                        to demonstrate what Caleb calls the “uncommonly judicious” (166) nature of
                        Collins’s investigation by situating his procedural application of
                        reasonable doubt in productive contrast with a doubt that is marked,
                        explicitly by Collins and implicitly in other respects, as unreasonable. The
                        episode illustrates Collins’s willingness to entertain doubt as well as his
                        willingness to assess and dismiss it on rational grounds: Collins does not
                        dismiss the disbelievers reflexively but only after he has “taken some pains
                        to enquire into the fact” and is “persuaded” that their doubts are
                        “precipitate and groundless.” The figure capitalizes further on the
                        suggestive contrast established between Collins’s dynamic performance of a
                        procedural doubt and the skeptics’ static doubt and, likewise, between
                        Collins’s singularity and the skeptics’ collectivity. It is not just
                        Collins’s independent inquiry but his very independence of mind that is set
                        in relief with the mob-like collective judgment of the skeptics. This is
                        true even as Collins’s performance of intellectual autonomy manages to
                        disable the reader’s own critical capacities by omitting any specific
                        content that readers might use to perform their own assessments of these
                        skeptical doubts. The skeptics, along with the nature of their reservations,
                        remain unnamed (do they deny that Hawkins ever confessed or that he was ever
                        guilty, or both?). They are a stage prop in Collins’s performance of
                        reasonableness, a rhetorical <emph>aporia </emph> that allows Collins to
                        acknowledge and then authoritatively dismiss any doubt about the legitimacy
                        of Hawkins’s execution.</p>
                    <p>The episode should sufficiently illustrate the novel’s explicit interest in
                        what I will refer to as the “rhetoric of reasonableness” deployed by
                        constructive skepticism. And, similarly, observing the interpretive
                        instability of this episode as the novel progresses should illustrate how
                        the novel wields irony to undermine the authority of this rhetoric. Of
                        course, whatever authority the reader grants Collins will be largely
                        undermined by his later revelation that his judgment of the case had been
                        influenced by his fear of retribution from Falkland and, more to the point,
                        his desire to preserve the moral distinctions that the uncertainties of the
                        case threaten to disrupt. “If you could change all my ideas, and show me
                        that there was no criterion by which vice might be prevented from being
                        mistaken for virtue,” he asks Caleb, “what benefit would arise from that?”
                        (Godwin, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>16). The question could be
                        taken as the novel’s most concentrated expression of the conservative
                        impulse I have been examining, and it affords a suggestive glimpse into how
                        the desire to preserve the possibility of legal judgment under uncertainty
                        is suffused with an anxiety about the consequences of its impossibility. In
                        this light, legal doubt emerges as a form of suspense that anxiously
                        anticipates its ability not to account for uncertainty but to overcome it. </p>
                    <p>But, Collins’s revelation aside, it is also true that his rhetorical
                        deployment of the skeptics never quite behaves the way he intends. And the
                        unruliness of the rhetorical figure itself suggests how, in the final
                        analysis, the real instabilities and risks that attend uncertainty defy the
                        efforts of constructive skepticism to contain them. Collins’s effort to
                        validate his narrative raises suspicions about why it must be validated in
                        the first place. Collins introduces the skeptics as a way of closing down
                        the question of Hawkins’s confession, but they eventually mark the very
                        rupture in Collins’s narrative Caleb will fixate on when formulating his own
                        doubts about Hawkins’s guilt and Falkland’s innocence. Collins presumably
                        omits the skeptics’ specific objections from his narrative because he
                        believes they have no rational basis. Yet, in the light of Hawkins’s
                        innocence, this omission seems to demand that readers acknowledge the
                        ethical merit of the skeptics’ doubts <emph>prior to </emph>and even
                            <emph>despite </emph> any consideration of their rational basis.
                        Similarly, the skeptics’ plurality, which at first appeared to be a sign of
                        their intellectual slavishness, becomes a sign of their intellectual and
                        moral resolve—especially once we take into account that they are essentially
                        the only collective body figured in the novel not under the absolute sway
                            of<emph> some social </emph>superior. All told, by the novel’s end, the
                        figure’s rhetorical function seems to shift from <emph>aporia </emph>to
                            <emph>exempla</emph>, in what amounts to an ironic inversion of that
                        religious genre’s tendency to introduce skeptics as counterexamples whose
                        disbelief and its miserable consequences are meant to redouble the faith of
                        both reader and author. In this inversion, “unreasonable” doubt as it is
                        defined by constructive skepticism stands out as the only reasonable and
                        ethical response to the risks of uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>The critique I have developed from Collins’s episode with the skeptics should
                        clarify the novel’s deep skepticism regarding the legal concept of
                        reasonable doubt, the rhetoric of reasonableness it deploys, and the
                        conservative desires that inform it. Yet, as much as Collins’s episode with
                        the skeptics clarifies about the novel’s interest in “unreasonable” doubt as
                        a negative response to “reasonable doubt,” it risks giving the false
                        impression that this response can be neatly, clearly, or completely
                        articulated by this critique. On the contrary, this critique seems to be
                        only a side effect of a much more disruptive form of negativity pursued by
                        the novel, one which ultimately muddies whatever critical or ethical clarity
                        I have drawn from the ironies above. In fact, it is arguably even misleading
                        to characterize the effects of the novel’s negativity as “critique,” since
                        the procedure of rational critique we have inherited from the eighteenth
                        century is animated by the very same spirit of constructive skepticism the
                        novel calls into question. To see this, simply consider that Kant’s critical
                        project, although typically framed as an idealist response to Hume’s
                        skeptical empiricism, is no less a variety of skepticism itself, one that is
                        distinctively conservative and therapeutic.<note place="foot">After all,
                            Kant’s aim is to reassure us that we can remain confident in our ability
                            to employ our rational faculties to attain reliable knowledge about the
                            phenomenal world of appearances as long as we accept our inability to
                            know the world beyond appearances, in itself, as noumena. The formal
                            parallels between Kant’s distinction between phenomena and noumena and
                            the constructive skeptical distinction between moral and demonstrative
                            certainty should be evident, as should be Kant’s parallel use of this
                            distinction to justify judgment under uncertainty. Even the very
                            tendency to contrast Kant’s critical project against Hume’s “radical”
                            project reproduces precisely the same rhetoric I have identified with
                            constructive skepticism above. And even though the exploratory and
                            experimental nature of Hume’s skeptical philosophy affords many
                            productive loose ends that may be pursued to more radical skeptical
                            conclusions, Hume’s systematic project appears no less informed by
                            constructive skepticism than Kant’s. Indeed, if we accept at face value
                            Hume’s rejection of absolute or “academic” skepticism and his acceptance
                            of a category of uncertain but indisputable knowledge (what Hume calls
                            “proofs” as opposed to certain “demonstrations” or disputable
                            “probabilities”), it seems plausible to suggest that no philosophical
                            critique endemic to the eighteenth century remains untouched by the
                            spirit of constructive skepticism.</note>This is an observation I will
                        return to at the essay’s conclusion when I consider how the negativity
                            <title level="m">Caleb Williams </title> pursues suggests a much
                        different understanding of Romanticism’s relation to skepticism than the one
                        proposed by Stanley Cavell in his well-known account of Romanticism as a
                        “response” to Kant’s settlement with epistemological skepticism.</p>
                    <p>If it is misleading to characterize the novel’s negativity as critique, it is
                        similarly misleading to characterize it as a form of skepticism itself, even
                        as the novel’s negativity takes doubt both as its central instrument and
                        object of inquiry. This is because the force of novel’s negativity seems to
                        originate in its exploration of doubt as it exists <emph>before </emph>it
                        hardens or stabilizes into skepticism. Indeed, the novel seems to resist any
                        conflation of skepticism and doubt in an effort to preserve the unruly
                        aspects of doubt that get lost once doubt is disciplined by skepticism. That
                        is, if skepticism can be characterized as a directed, instrumental
                        application of doubt to specific intellectual or epistemic problems, then I
                        would argue that the novel <emph>pursues</emph> a form of doubt that lacks
                        this instrumentality or directedness: a form of doubt that is inchoate,
                        marked by affective excess rather than intellectual restraint, hot rather
                        than cold.<note place="foot">Indeed, in his essayistic treatments of belief
                            and doubt, Godwin does attempt to inject desire into rational
                            skepticism, and briefly surveying the problems he encounters should
                            illustrate how rational skepticism cannot accommodate the examination of
                            doubt and desire the novel pursues. In “Essay of Skepticism,” for
                            instance, Godwin works against the common assumption that skepticism
                            must be “necessarily allied to coldness of character” and insists
                            instead that skeptical inquiry must be imbued with an “ardour and
                            animation” located between cold “indifference” and overheated
                            “enthusiasm” (308). Even as the skeptic must be “careful not to suffer a
                            predilection for one side of a question” (302) he is nonetheless “by no
                            means inclined to hold himself in a state of equal indifference to all
                            opinions” (304). Yet, Godwin seems well aware of problems of asserting
                            the influence of interest or passion into rational skepticism in this
                            way, a fact which comes through in his more downbeat essay, “On Belief.”
                            There, the disinterested procedure posed as an ideal by skepticism seems
                            to be inevitably thwarted by an insidious will to believe. For while
                            Godwin insists that “we must be, at all times, and to the last hour of
                            our existence, accessible to conviction built upon new evidence” (247)
                            he also admits that when considering any consequential issue there
                            appears to be “ever a secret influence urging me earnestly to desire to
                            find one side of the question right and the other wrong” (249) and that
                            “[t]hat which we wish to believe, we are already greatly in progress to
                            embrace” (249).</note> In the episode above, Collins refers to the
                        skeptics’ doubt as “groundless” in the sense of lacking rational grounds,
                        but it is better to characterize the doubt I am describing as the affective
                        ground from which skeptical doubt draws its critical energies, the raw
                        doubt-as-desire that skepticism refines and harnesses. Here it should be
                        clear that I have effectively described the character of Caleb’s doubt. It
                        should also be evident that the destabilizing effects achieved by the novel
                        will emanate from the unreasonableness of Caleb’s doubt-as-desire. In any
                        case, these effects seem too ambivalent to constitute anything like a
                        skeptical program. They faithfully reproduce the doubt and uncertainty from
                        which they originate.</p>
                    <p>These negative definitions of the novel’s negativity should provide a
                            <emph>sense of just </emph>how far the novel must depart from our usual
                        understanding of the forms negativity can take so that it may arrive in
                        uncharted waters or, as Godwin famously declared, “launch [readers] upon a
                        sea of moral and political inquiry” (<title level="m">Caleb Williams
                        </title>451). However, we can begin to sketch out a positive account of the
                        novel’s negativity by first identifying the ways that Caleb’s doubt does
                        appear to accord with the critique of “reasonable doubt” I have developed
                        from the passage above. Once we have pursued this accord to its limit, we
                        can then consider how the unreasonableness of Caleb’s doubt necessarily
                        points beyond this critique. </p>
                    <p>In light of the legal epistemology I have sketched, we might argue that
                        Caleb’s tendency to understand his doubt primarily as a form of
                        curiosity—one that is excessive, unproductive, and idiosyncratic or, in
                        Caleb’s terms, “ungoverned,” “infantine,” and “unreasonable” (Godwin, <title
                            level="m">Caleb Williams </title>212, 224)—reflects the extent to which
                        Caleb has internalized the normative distinction between reasonable and
                        unreasonable doubt as means for assessing the ethical merit (or lack
                        thereof) of his doubt. Indeed, Caleb consistently weighs his skeptical
                        disposition against an internalized sense of what a reasonable person would
                        or would not doubt. He continually seeks—and fails—to find what he would
                        consider to be rational grounds to justify his dissatisfaction with
                        Collins’s narrative. Caleb doubts Hawkins’s guilt even as Hawkins’s alleged
                        confession makes him feel “there was no longer a possibility of doubting”
                        (180); he pursues his suspicions about Falkland even as “could find nothing
                        that [he] could consider as justifying [him] in persisting in the shadow of
                        a doubt” (198) about Falkland’s innocence. In this way, Caleb anxiously
                        observes the distance between his doubt as it is and his sense of what it
                        should be.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, Caleb’s internalization of these norms helps explain, to some
                        extent, his inability to attribute <emph>any</emph> ethical value to his
                        doubt, despite the many opportunities he has to reassess or qualify its
                        value in light of new evidence. Falkland confesses his guilt, Collins
                        reveals his narrative to have been compromised by political and practical
                        concerns, but Caleb only grows more certain of the unethical and
                        pathological nature of his own doubt. In his retrospective attempt to
                        “divid[e] .&#160;.&#160;. the offensive [and] defensive” (212) parts of his
                        actions, he ends up condemning all his behavior leading up to Falkland’s
                        confession. By the novel’s conclusion, Caleb has even rejected this division
                        and remains saddled with a sense of guilt many critics have found to be,
                        like his curiosity, excessive and inexplicable. Yet, on this reading, any
                        dissatisfaction a reader might have with Caleb’s inability to recover any
                        ethical merit in his actions or with the excessive sense of guilt that
                        results from this inability should ultimately resolve into a dissatisfaction
                        with the normative assumptions that enable Caleb to misread his doubt in
                        this way. Caleb’s conversations later in the novel with Collins and
                        Laura—both of whom reinforce this misreading—seem designed in part to
                        exacerbate this sense of dissatisfaction. And, in this way, the novel
                        recovers the ethical potential of Caleb’s doubt while also sowing discontent
                        with institutional efforts to obscure or discredit that ethical potential. </p>
                    <p>Approaching Caleb’s doubt in this recuperative manner illustrates how the
                        novel’s negativity carries forward the deconstructive project Godwin pursues
                        against political institutions in <title level="m">An Enquiry to Political
                            Justice </title>(1793). In that work we find Godwin similarly invested
                        in exposing the various techniques political institutions deploy to
                        condition private acts of judgment so they reflect and reinforce the
                        organizing assumptions of the institutions themselves. Caleb’s mistaken
                        dismissal of his doubt as idiosyncratic and his consequent inability to
                        perceive its ethical and political potential exemplifies the pernicious
                        effects of what Godwin attacks in the <title level="m">Enquiry </title>as
                        the attempt to distinguish between public and private spheres of judgment,
                        or, in Godwin’s terms, between “conduct in civil concerns” in which positive
                        institutions “may properly interfere” and “matters of conscience” in which
                        “positive institutions ought to leave me personally free” (<title level="m"
                            >Political Justice </title>75). For Godwin, while such distinctions
                        might appear to establish an autonomous sphere where ethical considerations
                        preside independently from political interests, their ultimate effect is to
                        consolidate institutional power against the disruptive ethical and political
                        potential of conscience. And it is notable that, for Godwin, the tension an
                        individual feels between the responsibilities dictated by private judgment
                        and those dictated by institutions often manifests as doubt: an individual’s
                        desire to “believe what is dictated to them” by institutions is frustrated
                        by the absence of “that in which belief consists, evidence and conviction”
                        (368), resulting in “a perpetual dissatisfaction” (368) which speaks to the
                        “execrable tyranny” (368) of any attempt to coerce private judgment.<note
                            place="foot">Moreover, Godwin’s specific critique of legal institutions
                            in the <title level="m">Enquiry </title>involves recovering and
                            elaborating the radical ethical implications of the “imperfection” or
                            “uncertainty” of evidence (Godwin <title level="m">Political Justice
                            </title>381, 401). For Godwin, since “[n]o principles of evidence have
                            yet been laid down that are infallible” (78), the “veracity” and
                            “competence” of witnesses as accurate and just observers must be subject
                            to “continual doubt” (381). </note> Caleb’s doubt thus has the effect of
                        both exemplifying this dissatisfaction for and generating this
                        dissatisfaction within the reader.</p>
                    <p>Although the novel’s negative project aligns with the deconstructive project
                        of the <title level="m">Enquiry </title> in this general sense, the novel’s
                        insistence that the procedural skepticism adopted within rational inquiry
                        itself constitutes a form of institutionality that compromises private
                        judgment illustrates how the novel manages to extend the <title level="m"
                            >Enquiry</title>’s project beyond the limits imposed by its own
                        commitment to rationalism. To be sure, throughout the <title level="m"
                            >Enquiry </title> Godwin is concerned with preserving the autonomy of
                        private judgment against the impositions of institutional norms. Yet Godwin
                        also places great faith in the assumption that reason always functions in
                        accord with individual conscience, as an instrument and not an impediment to
                        the unbiased exercise of private judgment. It is a faith that originates in
                        Godwin’s appreciation for the dynamic and progressive nature of rational
                        inquiry, which he characteristically contrasts to the stagnancy of custom
                        and dogma. “Refer [people] to reading, to conversation, to meditation,”
                        Godwin writes, “but teach them neither creeds nor catechisms, either moral
                        or political” (352). Indeed, it is in this spirit that Godwin deploys a
                        rhetoric of reasonableness throughout the <title level="m">Enquiry</title>
                        to punctuate his own exercises in private, rational judgment. But this
                        assumption regarding the natural alignment of reason and conscience also
                        blinds the <title level="m">Enquiry</title> to how a rhetoric of
                        reasonableness might be deployed <emph>against</emph> conscience as it
                        manifests in “private” doubt or how such a rhetoric might be wielded to
                        close down, rather than open up, rational inquiry. Yet, this is precisely
                        how Collins (or Paley) deploys such rhetoric. Likewise, these are the
                        rhetorical and ideological effects that Caleb must resist to pursue his own
                        unreasonable doubt. In this respect, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>
                        could be said to turn the <title level="m">Enquiry</title>’s deconstructive
                        project on the latent threat of dogmatism posed by the rhetoric of
                        reasonableness that treatise employs.</p>
                    <p> So far I have approached Caleb’s unreasonable doubt with the assumption that
                        it aligns with and reinforces the critique of reasonable doubt I have teased
                        out of the novel’s ironic treatment of Collins’s rhetoric of reasonableness.
                        On this assumption, the novel would appear to stage a coordinated critique
                        of the legal system that mobilizes doubt and irony to undermine the
                        legitimacy of the circumscribed form of doubt that system normalizes in an
                        effort to preserve its own legitimacy. From this perspective, the novel’s
                        critique of reasonable doubt also appears to align with—and extend in
                        striking and productive ways—the deconstructive project pursued in Godwin’s
                            <title level="m">Enquiry</title>. This is a satisfying and neat
                        interpretation of the novel’s interest in unreasonable doubt. But it also
                        helps clarify why Caleb’s doubt <emph>cannot </emph>be perceived as
                        ethically viable and must instead be regarded as “unreasonable” in ways that
                        exceed the ideological distortions created by the normative account of
                        reasonable doubt. For, on this reading, Caleb’s doubt, although wrongly
                        dismissed by the legal system and even by Caleb itself on the basis of its
                        private and pathological nature, nonetheless appears to emerge as a viable
                        ethical orientation to the problem of judgment under uncertainty. Yet, the
                        novel’s interest in unreasonable doubt does not seem to be how unreasonable
                        doubt might <emph>replace</emph> the circumscribed form of “reasonable
                        doubt” adopted within legal theory as, say, a more adequate response to the
                        risks of judgment under uncertainty. Rather, the novel’s interest lies in
                        how Caleb’s unreasonable doubt reveals the fundamental interestedness of all
                        doubt—that is, how all doubt is grounded in desire—in a way that calls into
                        question the viability of doubt as a disinterested ground for legal
                        judgment. This point is succinctly captured in a central ethical paradox
                        that frustrates any recuperative reading of Caleb’s doubt: as readers, we
                        have no way of knowing that Caleb’s doubts about Falkland are justified
                        until he confirms this fact through evidently unjustifiable means. Any
                        attempt to assert the ethical viability of Caleb’s doubt requires condoning
                        the perverse psychological torture he performs on Falkland to confirm his
                        suspicions. Caleb may not be as guilty as he believes, but he is hardly
                        innocent. Further, this ambivalence gestures towards the insufficiency of
                        the categories of guilt and innocence to capture Caleb’s moral predicament. </p>
                    <p>While many critics have been puzzled by Caleb’s excessive sense of guilt at
                        the novel’s end, there has been little debate that Caleb’s suspicions
                        towards Falkland at the beginning of the novel are ethically problematic in
                        ways that the reading of Caleb’s doubt I have pursued above cannot
                        adequately address. For where I have read Caleb’s tendency to understand his
                        doubt as curiosity to be, in some respect, an ideological mechanism that
                        misrepresents an ethical response as a pathological one, other critics have
                        persuasively interpreted Caleb’s curiosity to be a symptom of other inchoate
                        forms of desire. Some critics, for instance, have argued that Caleb’s
                        curiosity masks a political desire to wield the knowledge of Falkland’s
                        secret crimes against him as a means to achieve political power and
                            equality.<note place="foot">See, for instance, Handwerk 951–53, which
                            also persuasively argues that Caleb’s guilt reflects Caleb’s inability
                            to recontextualize, and thus rationalize, his own actions within an
                            ideological framework in the same way he can Falkland’s at the end of

                        compulsive curiosity as a symptom of his unspeakable homosocial desire for

                        himself at one point proposes the compelling explanation that his excessive,
                        suspicious reading of Falkland’s behavior amounts to a symptom of his early
                        habit of reading romances, in what amounts to a suggestive gesture towards
                        the relation between paranoia and the experience of plottedness that several
                        critics have since explored in other contexts (<title level="m">Caleb

                            about the causal and teleological shape of everyday experience
                            (Molesworth 6–7).</note> On one hand, the viability and mutual
                        compatibility of these different interpretations should attest to the
                        overdetermined nature of Caleb’s doubt; this interpretative excess could be
                        said to simply reproduce the affective excesses that condition Caleb’s
                        doubt. On the other hand, although this interpretative excess appears to
                        present several competing or complementary desires “motivating” Caleb’s
                        doubt, it also attests more fundamentally to the indeterminate nature of
                        Caleb’s doubt—that is, its lack of clear motive, interest, or aim. It is as
                        if Caleb’s doubt radiates interestedness even as it does not display
                        interestedness in any of its recognizable forms. The fact that no single
                        interpretation of his curiosity feels any more viable than the other
                        confirms this indeterminacy. And this observation lends some credence to
                        Caleb’s tendency to characterize his curiosity as immature and inexplicable
                        instead of sinister or malicious. Indeed, even as critics have perceived
                        something much more sinister behind his treatment of Falkland than
                        “curiosity” can address, they have rarely suggested that Caleb is conscious
                        of or consciously concealing the desires that motivate his curiosity.
                        Instead, it is much more common to read Caleb as a victim of his repressed
                        desires or other ideological mechanisms.<note place="foot">For instance,
                            Gold and Handwerk pursue their ideological readings explicitly against
                            the assumption that Caleb’s behavior can be attributed to personal
                            idiosyncrasy or pathology. Even Uphaus, who objects to reading Caleb’s
                            behavior in terms of the “corrupting influences of social and political
                            institutions” (279), nonetheless mitigates Caleb’s agency by asserting
                            that “Caleb’s curiosity is not entirely governed by conscious control:
                            his instincts exceed his control and always drive him forward” (282).

                    </p>
                    <p>Rather than attempting to ascribe some specific motive or desire to Caleb’s
                        doubt, it seems more productive to consider how the indeterminate nature of
                        Caleb’s desire itself generates an irresistible but problematic urge in the
                        reader to doubt his motivations even as Caleb’s desires remain inaccessible.
                        Of course, as I have already suggested, this lingering dissatisfaction with
                        Caleb’s doubt is important in itself for the way that it disrupts any moral
                        or ethical certainties that might potentially be inferred from Caleb’s act
                        of discovering Falkland’s guilt. Even though, against the background of the
                        ineffective and compromised procedural doubt of the legal institution,
                        Caleb’s doubt somehow emerges as a <emph>more</emph> ethical response to
                        judgment under uncertainty, the reader’s sense that Caleb’s doubt is
                        grounded in illegitimate desire—which remains even after Falkland
                        confesses—makes it difficult to attribute any ethical or legal value to his
                        discovery. The ethical dilemma manages to exceed the mutually exclusive
                        logic of ethical judgment in a way that evacuates it of its meaning. In this
                        context it seems possible to say that Caleb’s doubt is somehow unethical yet
                        ethical, but to say this is to say nothing at all about Caleb’s doubt.
                        Instead, it is to demonstrate the insufficiency of these categories
                        themselves to respond to the complexity introduced by uncertainty. But it
                        seems equally important that this dissatisfaction—that is, the reader’s
                        conviction that Caleb’s doubt is somehow motivated by illegitimate
                        desire—remains even as the reader has no means of resolving the
                        indeterminacy surrounding Caleb’s doubt-as-desire, no means of confirming
                        this suspicion. It reflects the extent to which the reader’s doubt is itself
                        unreasonable, propelled but also compromised by the desire to judge Caleb’s
                        actions finally as ethical or unethical, interested or disinterested. In
                        this way, the novel embraces the ethical dilemma presented by Caleb’s doubt
                        as a productive site of negativity and exploits it to sow a more fundamental
                        doubt about the legitimacy of ethical judgments, one captured in Caleb’s own
                        progressive dissatisfaction with his former belief that innocence and guilt
                        were “things in the whole world most opposite to each other” (243) as he
                        discovers that such a belief is “impossible .&#160;.&#160;. to hold” once
                        one is “conversant with the passions and institutions of men” (404).</p>

                    <head>Coda: Romantic Doubt</head>
                    <p> While the striking deconstruction of eighteenth-century constructive
                        skepticism <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> performs seems to be only
                        a by-product of the novel’s more ambitious pursuit of the destabilizing
                        excesses of negativity, the presence and precision of that critique suggest
                        the potential for reading the form of doubt the novel recovers—what I have
                        characterized as doubt “before skepticism”—as a specifically “Romantic” form
                        of doubt that constitutes, to some extent, a Romantic reaction to the
                        conservative and constructive character of eighteenth-century rational
                        skepticism. By characterizing this Romantic doubt as a “reaction” to
                        skepticism in this way, I expect readers to hear echoes of Stanley Cavell’s
                        interpretation of Romanticism as a response to Kant’s “settlement” with
                        skepticism. But, by recalling Cavell, my aim is also to demonstrate how this
                        form of Romantic doubt offers a significant challenge to Cavell’s thesis
                        and, further, reveals Cavell’s own conservative tendencies. </p>
                    <p> To draw out this challenge, I want to focus on the way that Cavell
                        constricts or limits the possible forms that any Romantic “reaction” to—and,
                        particularly, <emph>against</emph>—Kant’s settlement with skepticism might
                        take. Cavell imagines the Romantic response to Kant’s settlement to have two
                        faces. One face, which Cavell calls “avoidance,” registers a fundamental
                        dissatisfaction with the limits Kant places on our ability to access the
                        thing-in-itself, while the other, which Cavell calls “acknowledgment,”
                        accepts the validity of and stability afforded by Kant’s limits on
                        knowledge. In one sense, Cavell sees these twin reactions as dynamically
                        constructed and mutually reinforcing: the Romantic “simultaneously craves
                        [the] comfort [of Kant’s idea of limitation] and crave[s] escape from its
                        comfort .&#160;.&#160;. as if the one stance produced the wish for the
                        other” (32). But, in another, Cavell sees them as a two-phase progression
                        that amounts to a maturation. While Cavell empathizes with the Romantic
                        response of “avoidance” (“You don’t—do you?—have to be a romantic to feel
                        sometimes about that settlement: Thanks for nothing” [31]), it is evident
                        that Cavell regards “acknowledgement” as the more productive, mature, and
                        theoretically interesting response. For whereas the strategy of avoidance
                        entails for Cavell pursuing the idle Romantic fantasies of animism and
                        solitude, the strategy of acknowledgement sets to the responsible tasks of
                        accepting and adjusting to the hard limits established by language as a
                        social form and, further, of working within these confines to remake and
                        contribute to (ordinary) language so that it reflects common interests and
                        desires. </p>
                    <p>Cavell’s preferred project of acknowledgement and adjustment continues to
                        influence approaches to Romanticism in ways that testify to its critical
                        sophistication and potential. <note place="foot">For a recent study informed
                            by Cavell’s project of acknowledgment and adjustment, see Nersessian,
                                <title level="m">Utopia, Limited: Romanticism and
                            Adjustment</title>.</note> But one issue with Cavell’s interpretation is
                        that, because he ultimately accepts the philosophical authority of Kant’s
                        settlement—he refers to it as “the most stable philosophical settlement in
                        the modern period” (31)—Cavell has a fairly limited conception of what
                        rejecting Kant’s settlement might entail. And he assumes, ultimately, that
                        Kant’s settlement sets the conditions for any response to it. Cavell’s
                        strategy of avoidance may have the Romantic reject the terms of Kant’s
                        settlement, but only after she has accepted Kant’s characterization of the
                        problem of knowledge as valid and authoritative (if only to overcome it on
                        his terms). Yet, the negativity I have explored in this essay points us to
                        an alternative form the Romantic rejection of Kant’s settlement might take.
                        In this form, the Romantic’s dissatisfaction with Kant lies not with the
                        ways Kant’s limit cordons off certain knowledge or denies transcendence but
                        in the way that Kant’s settlement misrepresents the nature or extent of the
                        threat to judgment posed by uncertainty. Romantic doubt, as informed by
                        negativity, does not reject Kant’s limits themselves but rather rejects the
                        false comfort with uncertainty and false confidence in our ability to
                        overcome its threat that those limits promote. Instead, Romantic doubt would
                        cultivate a discomfort with the risks uncertainty poses and sow doubt about
                        our ability to overcome or even know them. Romantic doubt is the “awful
                        doubt” (Shelley 77) of Shelley’s “Mont Blanc” that an unflinching view of
                        Nature as mystery recommends: a sense of doubt that is informed by an awe of
                        uncertainty, that stands in opposition to the mild “faith” in our ability to
                        reconcile ourselves with uncertainty through positive means, and that “but
                        for such faith” would achieve this (negative) reconciliation and likewise
                        “.&#160;.&#160;. repeal / Large codes of fraud and woe” (80–81). The
                        discontent with “moral certainty” Romantic doubt names clarifies the
                        political and ethical charge of Keats’s formulation of negative capability
                        as “being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
                        reaching after fact and reason” (492). From the perspective of Romantic
                        doubt, Keats’s negative capability does not recommend relinquishing our
                        desire for absolute certainty or cultivating an ease with uncertainty.
                        Rather, it cautions against the “irritable,” false comfort that follows from
                        believing that we can conquer uncertainty through constructions of fact and
                        reason. It is a reminder that even to reach for fact or reason is to
                        underestimate the threat of uncertainty since our desire to overcome that
                        threat always threatens to persuade us we already have.</p>
