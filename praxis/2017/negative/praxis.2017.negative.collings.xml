            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">Romantic literature at times features instances of positive
                    negation, that trope whereby a literary text gives a body, face, visible form,
                    or effective agency to negativity. In doing so, it anticipates similar features
                    in modernist critical theory, such as Heidegger’s notion of the possibility of
                    the impossibility of existence, or Bataille’s rendition of the presence of the
                    absence of God. Such figures appear in the late poetry of Samuel Taylor
                    Coleridge, especially “Human Life, On the Denial of Immortality,” which reveal a
                    counterside to his late theological reflections. That poem’s deployment of what
                    Coleridge elsewhere considers to be the “positive state” of “Eternal Death”
                    proposes that without the immortality of the soul, the best instance of positive
                    negation is the living human being, who (in an echo of Milton’s Death)
                    personifies the nothingness she or he must face. Such a figure, the poem
                    suggests, can neither mount a suitable emotion in relation to its nothingness
                    nor make its nothingness meaningful; nevertheless, as something crafted by
                    nature’s “restless hands unconsciously,” the mortal becomes a figure of excess,
                    of what interrupts mere blankness, exemplifying not a dialectical rendition of
                    death but a second-order nullity, and thus can be defined through a Lacanian
                    enigmatic signifier, even if one deprived of any code in which it may make
                    sense. The poem thus anticipates certain a/theological features of recent
                    thought, mapping the human as a site for the assertion of negativity. </p>

                <div type="section">
                <p> In taking up the theme of the “rights of the negative,” one might reasonably ask
                    how the negative has rights, how it might assert its rights, indeed how it might
                    make a demand of any kind. The negative, one might argue, is
                        <emph>negative</emph>, operating over against the domain of positive
                    institutions, assertions, and demands. Yet one might reasonably argue that by
                    virtue of that fact, nothing asserts itself so insistently as the negative, that
                    any positive instance necessarily operates in relation to a negativity that
                    never ceases to make itself felt.</p>
                <p> Such reflections, however, rely on the prior fact that something like “the
                    negative” or one of its analogues has been isolated, named, and given specific
                    powers within a discourse or practice. But this minimal figure, which makes of
                    negativity a moment within the domain of the apparently positive, may at times
                    adopt a more radical form through the trope of direct embodiment—that is, a
                    face, voice, or agency, a capacity to challenge the subject explicitly. Within
                    canonic Romantic literature, one might find several examples of this trope,
                    including the metafictional ghost that appears in <title level="m">The
                        Monk</title>, the “unfathered vapour” in Wordsworth’s crossing of the Alps,
                    the creature in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, and the figure of deathly
                    negation in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. All of these
                    instances, as well as many others, no doubt allude on some level to the most
                    notorious instance of the figure, that darkness visible, Milton’s Death. These
                    versions of the negative appear in order to assert themselves, to make
                    implacable demands, and thus in some degree to horrify and alter those who
                    encounter them. Various renditions of positive negation emerge in other forms of
                    articulation in the Romantic era as well: one might think of the “empty place of
                    power” that according to Claude Lefort emerges over the course of the French
                    Revolution to become a constitutive aspect of modern democracies (27), or
                    alternatively of the formative role of natural disaster, war, and famine in
                    Malthusian demography. Some might argue that the Kantian analytic of the
                    sublime, Schelling’s notion of the rotary motion of antithetical principles in
                    his <title level="m">Ages of the World</title>, or Hegel’s account of Absolute
                    Knowledge belong within this field as well. If one glances ahead to later
                    moments in the philosophical tradition, one might think of Heidegger’s
                    discussion of the “possibility of the measureless impossibility of existence” in
                        <title level="m">Being and Time</title> (307) and of what Denis Hollier,
                    capturing the sense of Georges Bataille’s notion of the sacred, describes not as
                    the “<title level="m">absence of</title> [God’s] <emph>presence</emph>” but the
                        “<emph>presence of</emph> [his] <emph>absence</emph>” (133). Even nearer to
                    us is the Lacanian Real, which takes a logic or process that perpetually
                    undermines the symbolic and imaginary orders and treats it as an entity, an
                    uncanny Thing.</p>
                <p> Within this broad ensemble, certain moments in Coleridge’s late poems may seem
                    inconsequential, for they do not seem to be motivated by any ambitious poetic or
                    philosophical project. Indeed, in some cases the key articulations take place in
                    poems he did not at first intend to publish. Yet it is well worth reading those
                    moments carefully with a view toward the broader questions raised by Romanticism
                    and its heirs, for they make visible the counterseams in the texture of
                    Coleridge’s overall theological and philosophical thought, and articulate, with
                    unusual brevity and precision, some of the continuing stakes of positive
                    negation.</p>
                <p> These preoccupations first appear explicitly in a tangle of incipient poems
                    written in an 1811 <title level="m">Notebook</title> entry, especially the two
                    poems eventually published in 1834 under the titles of “Limbo” and “Ne Plus
                    Ultra” (<title level="m">Notebooks</title> 4073–74; <title level="m">Complete
                        Poems</title> 357–59). The poem “Limbo” initially outlines the limbo-zone of
                    “half-being,” which is “Wall’d round” to secure it from a more fearful state,
                    “the mere horror of blank Naught-at-all” (4, 23). In its final lines it moves
                    beyond the “Purgatory curse” of “dull Privation” to contemplate a darker
                    alternative: “Hell knows a fear far worse / A fear—a future state;—‘tis positive
                    Negation!” (26–28). In settling on this final phrase, Coleridge departs from an
                    earlier line in the notebook draft where he writes of “aye-unepithetable
                    Negation” (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title> 584; <title level="m"
                        >Notebooks </title>4073), in effect hinting that “unepithetable” is itself
                    an epithet—and that the notion of a positive negation only makes sharper the
                    idea of an unmodifiable one. As Morton Paley points out, these lines allude to a
                    notion in the third sermon of John Donne, an author central to the entire
                    notebook entry, that hell is the privation of God (Paley 202). But by shifting
                    from privation to negation, Coleridge suggests in effect that hell is nothing
                    other than a certain negation itself, or what in a later annotation to the
                    anonymous book <title level="m">Eternal Punishment Proved to Be Not Suffering,
                        but Privation</title> (1817), he calls the “positive State” of “Eternal
                    Death” (<title level="m">Marginalia</title> 559). Through the notion of
                    “positive Negation,” Coleridge does not simply write an oxymoron but invokes a
                    fully considered concept, one we could describe not merely as absence, but more
                    fundamentally as the presence of absence, the possibility of impossibility.</p>
                <p> That poem’s intervention is so brief, however, that it only broaches the theme.
                    Thus it is not surprising that Coleridge extends its musings in nearby notebook
                    lines, published under the title “Ne Plus Ultra,” where a speaker initially
                    addresses nothingness as the “Sole Positive of Night!” (1). Here that
                    nothingness is given a much broader force, for the speaker goes on to suggest
                    that it is “The one permitted opposite of God!,” the “sole despair / Of both th’
                    eternities in Heaven!” (4, 14–15). The poem seems to rest on the notion that
                    only nothingness is permitted to oppose God, insofar as God has no true
                    opposite. But if there is a <emph>positive</emph> negation, then its
                    antithetical persistence can indeed generate astonishment. Rather than
                    representing Hell, a domain presumably subject to divine control, or a blank
                    naught-at-all of death, which only those alive may fear, here it has power to
                    interdict the activity of God and the angels. The negative has become a threat
                    to the most assertive sway of the positive itself. </p>
                <p> But the import of this poem’s stance remains unclear: <emph>how</emph> might
                    sheer nothingness have the capacity to interdict God’s actions? Is Coleridge
                    riffing on his trope here, as if in the spirit of his version of Donne, or is he
                    beginning to conceive of a negativity like those that appear in Hegel or
                    Schelling? The final lines of the notebook entry speak of his ambivalence in
                    this regard, where he writes, “A Specimen of the Sublime dashed to pieces by
                    cutting too close with her fiery Four in Hand round the corner of Non-sense”
                        (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title> 584; <title level="m">Notebooks
                    </title>4073). </p>
                <p> Yet Coleridge does not abandon the themes broached in these lines, for he
                    explores them more fully soon thereafter in a poem published in 1817, “Human
                    Life, On the Denial of Immortality” (<title level="m">Complete Poems</title>
                    362)—a continuity made even more evident by Coleridge’s remark in a marginal
                    annotation that this poem, too, was written “in purposed imitation of Donne”
                        (<title level="m">Poetical Works </title>1101). Here he takes up the
                    possibility, already broached in “Limbo,” that human beings may enter the
                    “future state” of nonexistence, but for now considers the implications of that
                    possibility for the significance of human life as it is lived. If human beings
                    face a blank nothingness after death, the poem suggests, then the value of life
                    itself is cancelled. Accordingly, in this poem positive negation is neither what
                    the living fear nor an agency that interdicts God’s activity but an absence that
                    transforms the positive itself into a nullity, into a “Blank accident” (14). If
                    human life is mortal, the poem suggests, then the exemplary figure of “positive
                    Negation” is the human being, who ultimately personifies the nothingness that
                    she must face, as if to instance in another way what is visible in Milton’s
                    Death. Yet here that trope uniquely appears not as a ghost, monster, allegorical
                    construction, structural principle, or demographic driver, but as the living
                    human being. </p>
                <p> In that respect, Coleridge’s nullified subject comes into close proximity with
                    the subject of Hegel’s <title level="m">Phenomenology</title>.<note place="foot"
                        >In the Preface to that work, Hegel crucially places his account of
                        “tarrying with the negative” in the context of the demand to confront death;
                        for him, Spirit “wins its truth only when, in utter dismemberment, it finds
                        itself.” Moreover, in his depiction of this tarrying, Hegel gives death’s
                        negativity a certain positive force, a face: “Spirit is this power only by
                        looking the negative in the face, and tarrying with it.” In this key
                        passage, Hegel arguably places a version of positive negation (negation
                        given a face, voice, or agency) at the heart of his project. See Hegel
                        19.</note> Indeed, one can trace in this poem certain features of a
                    dialectical shift: the transformation of an external or future nullity—death, a
                    future state of nonexistence—into an internal or present one. Here the subject
                    is placed in dialectical relation with death, except that in this case, no
                    negation of the negation takes place, no sublation of the subject’s mortality.
                    Here one arrives at “positive” negation not through a dialectical reversal of
                    the negative but through its intensification, its emergence as an even more
                    clearly delineated instance of the negative, one that leads to nothing other
                    than itself. This poem thus anticipates those who refuse the turn whereby Hegel
                    transforms the negative into the starting point of the subject’s becoming (cf.
                    Bataille); instead, it transforms nullity into a higher version of nullity, into
                    a subjectivity nearly indistinguishable from its own future inexistence. Where
                    Hegel affirms and dialectically transposes the subject’s mortality, Coleridge
                    refuses to accept it; for him, a subject characterized by its negation becomes
                    the very emblem of absurdity and inexistence, of a life lived under the shadow
                    of what Tilottama Rajan has in another context called “unusable negativity”
                    (46). </p>
                <p> Of course, the poem is meant in part to explore a <title level="m">reductio ad
                        absurdum</title>, to conceive of the ludicrous implications of what its
                    title marks as the “denial” of the immortality of the soul. As several scholars
                    have suggested, the fact that the poem is written in the conditional mode—“If
                    dead, we cease to be” (1)—signals that it takes up a contrary-to-fact scenario,
                    a possibility excluded by the theology Coleridge articulates in many of his late
                    writings (Kessler 69–80; Vaz-Hooper).<note place="foot">Insofar as the poem
                        pursues this approach, it deploys a strategy characteristic of the late
                        theological writings. A key passage of the <title level="m">Opus
                            Maximum</title>, for example, maintains that “[w]e affirm” that work’s
                        central postulate “&lt;not&gt; because we .&#160;.&#160;. comprehend the
                        affirmation, but because we clearly comprehend the absurdity of the denial”
                        (221). On negative proofs in that work, see Evans 17, 36–38, 59,
                        105–117.</note> But such is not its entire purpose, for it also takes up the
                    concern with hopelessness or loss which informs a half-dozen lyrics he composed
                    after 1805, from “Constancy to an Ideal Object” through “Love’s Apparition and
                    Evanishment,” and thus exemplifies what Eric Wilson has described as the poet’s
                    “double vision,” his ability to linger with opposed possibilities (xiii).<note
                        place="foot">The most significant poems in this group (apart from several
                        notebook fragments) include “Constancy to an Ideal Object,” “The Blossoming
                        of the Solitary Date-Tree. A Lament,” “The Visionary Hope,” “Limbo,” “Ne
                        Plus Ultra,” “Human Life, On the Denial of Immortality,” “Work Without
                        Hope,” “The Pang More Sharp Than All: An Allegory,” “Phantom or Fact?,” and
                        “Love’s Apparition and Evanishment: An Allegoric Romance.” The fact that
                        Coleridge wrote so many poems of such ambition on these themes suggests that
                        together they constitute a key dimension of his corpus, an important—if less
                        discussed—dimension of his authorship.</note> This lyric, in short, balances
                    itself between the scorn for disbelief and the lyrical evocation of a negated
                    state; it explores nonsense seriously, articulating the nearly inexplicable
                    logic of the theological uncanny.</p>
                <p> Initially it charts its concerns by suggesting that a purely mortal life, in
                    finding no realization after death, consists of nothing but biological life,
                    nothing but “sound,” “motion,” or “breath” (4, 5)—not so much bare life as
                        <emph>wasted</emph> life. In a later passage, the poem extends this thought
                    by suggesting that such a life’s “laughter and tears / Mean but themselves”
                    (17–18)—in effect, that even nonverbal expressions cease to find their place in
                    any code. The reflexive consciousness of this state is equally futile; as the
                    poem later suggests, it would be just as useless to mourn the passing of such a
                    life as to attempt <emph>not</emph> to mourn it. To react to it in
                        <emph>any</emph> fashion, it suggests, would be vacuous: “Yet what and
                    whence thy gain, if thou withhold / These costless shadows of thy shadowy self?
                    / Be sad, be glad, be neither! seek, or shun!” (25–26). Moreover, it contends
                    that the defeat of signification also defeats affect itself, making “dreams” and
                    “hopes and fears” equally weightless (16–17). The poem thus expresses a longing
                    for the <emph>gap</emph> between sign and signified, between nonverbal
                    expression and code; the absence of that gap, it seems, cancels significance,
                    emotion, and purpose alike, as if in its absence existence remains so
                    insistently literal that it cannot even attain to the minimal, impoverished
                    status of the pure signifier. In the poem’s account, only a possible immortality
                    can ground meaning; without that immortality, human life has an uncanny status,
                    for having only “phantom purposes,” it becomes merely an “Image of image, ghost
                    of ghostly elf” (9, 23)—a ghostly “gust[]” and no more (3).<note place="foot">My
                        thanks to Brian McGrath for the suggestion that “gust” resonates with the
                        theme of the ghost and phantom throughout the poem.</note></p>
                <p> But if it is merely an image <emph>of</emph> image, ghost <emph>of</emph>
                    ghostly elf, then it replicates a nonexistence it shares with the nonhuman
                    world; what precedes and generates it is a phantom like itself. The absence of
                    substance in human life implies in retrospect the absence of substance in nature
                    as well. The poem thus begins to outline a logic of nullity’s perpetual
                    replication, whereby the absence of immortality undoes the substance of human
                    being, which in turn demonstrates the absence of being in nature.</p>
                <p> Although it often relies on this repetition of futility across several
                    registers, and thus on a sort of flat “hauntology” (Bryant 245–90; Derrida 10),
                    in a key passage it interrupts that prospect as it depicts the moment in which
                    nature produces humankind: <quote><lg>
                            <l> O Man! thou vessel purposeless, unmeant,</l>
                            <l> Yet drove-hive strange of phantom purposes! </l>
                            <l> Surplus of nature’s dread activity, </l>
                            <l> Which, as she gazed on some nigh-finished vase,</l>
                            <l> Retreating slow, with meditative pause,</l>
                            <l> She formed with restless hands unconsciously!</l>
                            <l> Blank accident! nothing’s anomaly! (8–14)</l>
                        </lg></quote> At first a reader might think that in these lines apostrophe,
                    which may be taken as a trope that typically animates or gives life, instead
                        <emph>dis</emph>animates “Man.”<note place="foot">For a key intertext here
                        see the passage in which Sara Guyer follows Barbara Johnson’s discussion of
                        lyric animation, apostrophe, prososopeia, and abortion (11–20). “Human Life”
                        for a moment deploys similar tropes to figure what one might call an
                        animated instance of nonlife (or abortive creation), but it eventually
                        resorts to a slightly different set of tropes as discussed below.</note> But
                    rather than being reducible to flat nothingness, human life soon attains the
                    status of “surplus” or “anomaly,” terms that retain the sense of the purposeless
                    or unintended but that also hint that human life <emph>exceeds</emph> mere
                    blankness. Indeed, if nature—herself an instance of personified nullity, of
                    positive negation—could interrupt herself and create humankind with “restless
                    hands unconsciously,” then humankind is the surplus of an unconscious act, a
                    slip of the hand, something unmeant—but still exceptional and potentially
                    significant in the way that the father’s “unmeant” words in the Conclusion to
                    Part II of <title level="m">Christabel</title>, for example, still retain an
                    unconscious import (cf. Mileur 63–66).<note place="foot">The prospect of
                        interpreting nature as a nullity with restless hands would, of course,
                        ordinarily vex Coleridge, but such a rendition of nature is not entirely
                        outside the realm of his thought; on his difficulty in establishing a firm
                        interpretation of nature within the context of natural religion, see
                        Brice.</note> A phantom, it seems, is not merely nothing; insofar as it
                    instantiates an impulse that caused an artist meditatively to interrupt her task
                    of shaping a “nigh-unfinished vase,” it reveals a <emph>telling</emph>
                    nothingness, one that would intrude into the activity of positive creation to
                    produce the anomalous signifier. In this respect, it enacts an agency quite
                    similar to the interruptive power we encountered in “Ne Plus Ultra,” the sort
                    capable of interdicting the activity of a god; after all, if nature here is in
                    the midst of producing an artifact such as a vase, she may be informed by the
                    capacity for creative intention, however dreadful her activity may be. In that
                    case, however, humanity remains distinctive as the product of an
                        <emph>unconscious</emph> act, a cryptic intention. Since the poem regards
                    humanity as “nothing’s anomaly,” as if nature here is synonymous with the
                    nothing, perhaps it suggests that <emph>nullity, through its power to interrupt
                        itself, can produce something distinctive, something irreducible to bare
                        absence</emph>. Of course, the poem almost simultaneously suggests that the
                    significance of that accidental surplus must remain “blank,” that the unmeant
                    can never attain positive meaning. Yet the anomalous blankness to which it
                    points suggests that human life is a meaningfully meaningless interruption, a
                    significant insignificance, a distinctive sort of nonsense—in effect a semiotic
                    and ontological phantom. </p>
                <p> In the absence of a gap between affect and meaning appears another gap: that
                    between nothingness and its surplus. This second gap enables human life to
                    become more than merely literal, for its status as unconsciously generated
                    surplus makes it an enigmatic signifier, even if one deprived of any code in
                    which it can make sense. That development, however, suggests as well that the
                    negative has not merely replicated itself across registers, for by interrupting
                    itself it gives the further version of nullity a distinctive import. As if to
                    confirm these suggestions, in its final line—which, as Onita Vaz-Hooper points
                    out, as a twenty-ninth line, constitutes a surplus within a poem that otherwise
                    consists of two complete sonnets (536–37)—the poem does not claim that human
                    life lacks being; on the contrary, it broaches the possibility that the human
                    “being’s being” is contradiction, suggesting that one finds contradiction in the
                    being <emph>of </emph>human being, the difficult shift from one level to
                    another. In some measure, then, that line registers the deadlock inherent in the
                    status of being nothing’s anomaly and, through its very status as surplus,
                    insists on the haunting quality of that useless excess.</p>
                <p> These possibilities may return us as well to the invocation of Milton as a
                    highly conventional emblem of theological, political, poetic, and personal
                    immortality (7). On one level, this passage invites us to consider and repudiate
                    the apparently absurd possibility that such a figure could “know death,” could
                    indeed cease to be. Yet until his correction to the poem’s proofs, Coleridge had
                    written, “And <emph>when</emph> a soul like Milton’s can know death” (<title
                        level="m">Poetical Works</title> 1101), gesturing toward the possibility,
                    which still lingers in the published version of the poem, that perhaps so great
                    a soul as Milton’s could do that difficult thing and <emph>know</emph> death,
                    could contend with the impossible task of grasping it—or that so great a poet as
                    Milton, through his figure of Death, could create the template for later
                    attempts, indeed for Coleridge’s own effort in this poem.<note place="foot">For
                        a contrasting reading of the revision of this line consistent with her
                        overall account, see Vaz-Hooper, 538–39.</note> By suggesting, even in such
                    a cryptic manner, that such an act might be done, and to some extent attempting
                    to carry it out in its own right, the poem hints that attempting to know a final
                    death could be its most urgent, if undeclared business, as if it could set
                    itself the task of exploring the possibility of a certain impossibility, the
                    presence of a certain absence.</p>
                <p> Thus this poem in certain moments articulates a distinctive rendition of
                    negativity, conceiving of a broadly Gothic a/theology or hauntology that refuses
                    the dialectical process visible in Hegel in favor of a proto-psychoanalytic
                    account. Indeed, Coleridge’s most direct interlocutor may be Lacan, whose sense
                    that the subject is an enigmatic signifier that ultimately lacks an Other in
                    which that signifier would attain a secure meaning (cf. Žižek 110–128) and which
                    can perhaps best encounter itself anamorphically in the image of a skull (Lacan
                    79–90) matches well with the indications in this poem. But the poem may
                    anticipate Lacan in these ways precisely by making explicit those elements of
                    Romanticism on which psychoanalysis eventually draws, taking its place within
                    the long genealogy of a certain rendition of human inexistence.</p>
                <p> In doing so, the poem also entangles that genealogy with other important
                    strands. In his recent book, <title level="m">Minding the Modern</title> (2013),
                    Thomas Pfau lucidly designates the Coleridge of the <title level="m">Opus
                        Maximum </title>as his chief exemplar of one who, living in the midst of
                    modernity, nevertheless sustains and advocates those concepts of person,
                    relationship, and normative framework, inherited from Aristotle, Augustine,
                    Aquinas, and others, that modernity has forsaken (Pfau). But one might well take
                    up a question Pfau does not consider: whether Coleridge’s positive theology
                    might be shadowed by another discourse, not by a concession to modernity
                        <emph>per se</emph>, but rather by the counterside of theological certainty
                    itself, a poetics that finds in that contrary domain the distinctive
                    possibilities of positive negation. Such a poetics might anticipate as well
                    certain a/theological features of recent thought, not least in Lacan, where
                    negativity continues to assert its rights, even over against the apparent
                    nullity of the human condition.</p>
