            <p class="noCount">This collection thinks the “rights” of the negative against the more common association
               of the term “rights” with human rights and rights that can be posited. Such rights,
               despite their seeming liberalism, produce a normative notion of the person which is
               in the end biopolitical, and moreover, in assuming that rights can always be posited,
               they assume the primacy of the public sphere. The essays in this collection all resist
               the current emphasis on the public sphere that has resulted from the absorption of
               “Romanticism” into the “Nineteenth Century,” and focus instead on Romanticism as a
               retreat from publication, publicity and consensus. Whether this retreat is absolute
               negation or a withdrawal that holds something in reserve is a question left open in
               the spaces between these six essays on Godwin, Charlotte Smith, Coleridge and Goya.

               <p>The impetus for this collection of essays came from a recent conference of the North
                  American Society for the Study of Romanticism on “Romanticism and Rights” that, in
                  evoking discourses of natural and human rights, also raised the question of the right
                  to, or of, the negative. As Jean-Luc Nancy admits, in critiquing rights which have
                  “pragmatic definitions,” the “suppression or suspension” of such rights “opens directly
                  onto the intolerable” (2). But as Lyotard suggests, rights are no simple matter: there
                  are “wrongs” which cannot be remedied through “rights” because they cannot be phrased
                  in a “language common to . . . the other party” (28). Lyotard is more broadly concerned
                  with a <em>differend</em> that eludes capture in discourse and that will always persist even if a new discourse
                  and the right to it are established. Since the utopianism of human rights discourse
                  is only one aspect of a larger foreclosure, the bigger question here is of what is
                  left out by the emphasis on the public (or even counter-public) sphere that has come
                  to dominate much writing on Romanticism, and for which rights—juridical or otherwise—are
                  only a metonym. Within a discourse that assumes the sufficiency of the public sphere,
                  there are things that cannot be said or done, because a discourse for them does not,
                  or does not yet, or may not ever exist; there are things that cannot be published,
                  to give an example used by Lyotard (4), which is pertinent to this collection.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is this question of what is foreclosed by the social that has led the biopolitical
                     philosopher Roberto Esposito to argue in <em>Third Person</em> that human rights include only by exclusion, and that this aporia is “the line that
                     passes . . . between rights and the human condition, and in the process rips them
                     apart” (68–69). By this Esposito means, following Hannah Arendt, that “the law allows
                     entrance only to those who fall into some category—citizens, subjects, even slaves—hence,
                     insofar as they fall into a political community” (69–70). Thus it is not so much that
                     rights exclude certain people (who can always be included in a new category),

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This is the point made by Luhmann, who sees the public sphere as sufficiently open
                              to accommodate continuous “structural transformation” through an expansion of communicative
                              rationality in which even “improbable communications” of the most “personalized” nature
                              develop a “code” that allows them to become part of the system, as the very existence
                              of a “threshold of improbability” expands the “number of communicable topics” (8–9,
                              18–20). There is thus no need for anything outside discourse, which also means that
                              what is not yet part of discourse is “understood and practised” not at a “thematic
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> as that this very inclusion excludes a <em>differend</em> concealed in these individuals: for instance Caleb Williams in Adam Sneed’s essay,
                     who is never quite inside the category he fills, that of the person who seeks truth
                     and justice. At the heart of this aporia that traverses the notion of rights, according
                     to Esposito, is the distortion imposed by the term “person,” introduced to bridge
                     the gap between “the concept of human being and that of citizen” (3). In the discourse
                     of rights only a life “that can provide the credentials of personhood” is “qualitatively
                     significant” (2). With the delimitation of human being in terms of personhood, and
                     with the definition of a person as the condition of possibility for a citizen, or
                     in Giorgio Agamben’s terminology, with the absorption of <em>zoe</em> into <em>bios,</em> comes a set of normalizing values that enfranchise not just some forms of psychological
                     life but also certain modes of thinking at the cost of others.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The essays in this collection are not necessarily concerned with rights in a juridical
                  sense, though not surprisingly the issue does come up in the two pieces on Godwin.
                  Indeed, the right of the negative inevitably entails a use of that word that is more
                  metaphoric and elusive than any positive right. We speak here of the “right” of the
                  negative because the plural might imply a range of rights that can be specified, but
                  it is also necessary to think in terms of “rights” because the effects of this right,
                  and indeed what an effect is, are far from clear. And we speak of a right “of” rather
                  than “to” the negative because the right not to be or do something, as in civil disobedience,
                  risks being a determinate negation that is simply an antithetical form of positivity.
                  These essays, by contrast, explore a certain insistence of the negative that cannot
                  always be encompassed in the right not to do or be something: an insistence that traverses
                  a subject such as Christabel without exactly being something that she “has” or of
                  which she, or even Coleridge, is fully conscious. Christabel’s odd passivity, explored
                  in Marc Mazur’s essay, makes her no more than a channel for a negativity that cannot
                  be easily located. But we must also speak of a right “to” the negative, as a way of
                  conveying the force that the negative can have, for instance in my own essay on Godwin’s
                  <em>Mandeville</em>, whose protagonist, even as a “<span class="foreign">non-ens</span>” (439), insists on his right to be in the mode of not being. Hegel explores this
                  retreat from the collectivity, which is more perverse, more difficult of access, than
                  non-conformity, when he describes a self that is “turned against its structure” so
                  that “the negative thing is the structure itself.” In Hegel’s words, “the organism
                  is then in the opposed forms of <em>being</em> and <em>self;</em> and the <em>self</em> is precisely <em>that</em> for which the negative of itself <em>is</em>,” that which “relates itself to itself as a negative” (428).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Our first essay on Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em> is the closest to engaging with the judicial system as an arena in which to think
                     the right of the negative. In “Caleb’s Unreasonable Doubt” Adam Sneed takes up the
                     concept of reasonable doubt in legal epistemology, which he relates not to Humean
                     skepticism but to a seventeenth- and eighteenth-century tradition of “constructive
                     skepticism” in which the entertaining of doubt is meant to establish relative certainty.
                     Against this containment of doubt, Sneed finds that the reasonable doubt which Collins’
                     story of Falkland’s innocence elicits in Caleb generates a further dissatisfaction
                     with Caleb’s own unreasonable desire for certainty, thus resulting in a spiraling
                     doubt that goes beyond skepticism, which is still a kind of position. For the affective
                     excesses of the narrative—Caleb’s excessive curiosity, his seemingly unwarranted sense
                     of guilt, and his peculiar elective affinity with Falkland—all function as remainders
                     that prevent us from reading the text straightforwardly as positing something, for
                     instance a critique of the <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span>. Paradoxically, in all the cases where Caleb doubts Collins or where his own credibility
                     is called in question, Caleb is in the right. Yet being right casts him into a life
                     that is somehow wrong, a life that cannot be vindicated, as the novel unfolds along
                     the fragile line between rights and human being. And here, we might add, Esposito’s
                     analysis of the troubling relation between rights and citizenship has much to say
                     about Godwin’s novel. For the right Caleb asserts to uncover and publish the truth
                     about Falkland, and indeed his very curiosity, are intimately linked to the claim
                     of Godwin’s “humble,” upwardly mobile protagonist to personhood and citizenship (Godwin, <em>Caleb Williams</em> 59). So by the end of this profoundly deconstructive narrative, Caleb has “no character
                     to vindicate” (434) as he reverts to being a third person, the voice in which Godwin
                     began the novel, and which for Esposito is the voice of writing: “to write has always
                     meant to ‘pass from the first to the third person’” and to a “relation of self nonidentification”
                     (130–31).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Esposito is quoting Maurice Blanchot’s The Space of Literature. In his 1832 Preface
                              to Fleetwood Godwin says that he began Caleb Williams “in the third person,” but then
                              made “the hero of [the] tale his own historian”; in “this mode I persisted in all
                              my subsequent . . . fiction” (448). The point would be inconsequential, except that
                              Caleb casts doubt on his own first person narrative when he oddly decides to convey
                              Collins’ third person narrative in the first person (Caleb Williams 66), thus producing
                              a continuous “aphonia of the narrative voice” (Esposito 131).</span></div>

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>If the aleatory doubt that becomes the very structure of the novel comes from Godwin’s
                  emphasis on “the right of private judgment” (<em>Enquiry</em> 1: 170), our next essay moves to a genre more traditionally allied with a retreat
                  from the public, namely the lyric. Readings by Abrams and Wasserman that saw the Romantic
                  lyric as conjoining self and nature, inside and outside, or subject and object, have
                  long since ceased to be the norm, given that critics after de Man have seen the greater
                  Romantic lyric as invoking this paradigm only in the mode of compensation. But in
                  his essay on Charlotte Smith’s <em>Elegiac Sonnets,</em> Samuel Rowe questions the marginalization of Smith as a sentimental poetess, and
                  makes a bold claim for Smith (rather than Coleridge) as having initiated a tradition
                  of lyric negativity. The negative turn in her sonnets (referring to a thematic but
                  also a formal turn at the sestet or couplet) is particularly radical because while
                  the poems are about loss, Smith will not divulge what has been lost. The containment
                  of elegy within the sonnet’s tightness rather than the more sprawling forms of <em>Lycidas</em> or <em>In Memoriam </em>contributes to this reserve, which refuses any return from object loss through “normal”
                  mourning. Thus unlike Adorno in “Lyric Poetry and Society,” Smith thinks the lyric
                  outside of a correlationism in which withdrawal from the social sustains “the integrity
                  of a coercive reality precisely by refusing to align with it” (Rowe par.17). In thus
                  protecting the Real of loss, Smith does claim a right “to” the negative, a right “not
                  to communicate” (par. 25), but this claim, by declining all phenomenal content, produces
                  an “empty” subjectification that holds “subjectivity in a contentless void” (pars.
                  5,19).</p>
               <p>Like Rowe, David Collings in his essay “Positive Negation” focuses on the lyric, or
                  more precisely the short poem, since Coleridge’s “Limbo,” “Ne Plus Ultra,” “Human
                  Life” and his late poems generally, are less easily categorizable than Smith’s sonnets.
                  Using these fundamentally metaphysical poems to theorize negativity, Collings raises
                  the philosophical problem of how the negative can have “rights.” How can it make a
                  demand, when it has not been named and “given specific powers within a discourse or
                  practice” (par. 2)? Whereas Smith’s right not to communicate does exist within a discursive
                  practice and so is still a right exercised by a subject, for Collings the idea that
                  what cannot be posited has rights is metaphysically an oxymoron. And yet non-being,
                  even as absolute nullity, somehow <em>is</em>: a problem also faced in <em>Ages of the World</em> by Schelling, who comes up both in this essay and my own. For Schelling the negative
                  is not simply privative. Not only is negation originary, because the positive can
                  have being “only by repressing the negating force in itself”; a being also “cannot
                  negate itself as actual without at the same time positing itself as the actualizing
                  potency that begets itself” (17–18). To describe the presence of absence, or how that
                  which has no being, can assume a “face, voice, or agency” through a “<em>trope</em> of direct embodiment” (par. 2; emphasis mine), Collings borrows the term “positive
                  Negation” from Coleridge’s “Limbo.” Milton’s Death, invoked by Coleridge, provides
                  a first “template” (par. 14) for this right of the negative to be posited as that
                  which (it) is not: a claim for which Coleridge’s own “positive Negation” is also a
                  catachresis.</p>
               <p>The difficulty of thinking this catachresis may be why Coleridge did not publish these
                  poems for many years, and then too only as anomalies. This withholding surfaces repeatedly
                  in Romanticism, in work referred to in several essays—for instance, Smith’s right
                  not to communicate, Schelling’s unpublished <em>Weltalter</em> project, and Goya’s <em>Disasters of War</em> in David Clark’s essay, which were never exhibited. It is the explicit concern of
                  the next article by Marc Mazur, which explores Coleridge’s delay in publishing “Christabel”
                  even as he circulated it privately, and the continuing “retreat into self” (Schelling
                  6) that characterizes the published versions. Mazur begins by theorizing two versions
                  of this retreat based on work by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy and by
                  Catherine Malabou. In the former’s <em>Retreating the Political</em> (as in Adorno’s “Lyric Poetry and Society”), what is involved is a withdrawal that
                  re-treats the political. Such withdrawal, as we have already seen, risks being caught
                  in a correlationism that reconfirms what it retreats from. But for Malabou the retreat
                  is not voluntary, not political; it does not assume the intentionality of a fully
                  constituted subject, and so is not even readable. What Mazur notes as the “indifference”
                  that attends the narration in the unpublished versions of <em>Christabel</em> (par.18) allows for this unreadability; we can think of these versions as written
                  in the third person, <span class="foreign">le neutre</span> in Blanchot’s term, which Esposito sees as resisting any interpellation into civic
                  personhood. But in the “Conclusion to Part the Second,” added in 1816, the Symbolic
                  Order is reestablished through the pact between Geraldine and Sir Leoline, even as
                  Christabel herself retreats from the empty place of this reconstitution of the social.
                  Coleridge tries to take control of the poem as narrator, intervening into a narration
                  whose earlier indifference had cathected the trauma or unassimilable effraction traced
                  by Malabou in <em>Ontology of the Accident</em> (par. 4). And yet in finally publishing the poem, Coleridge does not so much complete
                  it as himself retreat from it by handing it over to a public about which he remains
                  deeply ambivalent: an ambivalence mirrored in the ineffectuality of Bard Bracy, as
                  the poem “turns over and over again around an insoluble secret which retreats from
                  the author” (par. 8).</p>
               <p>Retreat is also at the center of my own essay on Godwin’s <em>Mandeville</em> (1817), a historical novel whose protagonist never enters history as he progressively
                  retreats into the closet of his psychic history. The novel, which has many resonances
                  with Godwin’s own time, is set in the <span class="foreign">interregnum</span>, the only period when Britain had no King, and is bookended by two rebellions: the
                  Irish Rebellion of 1641 and Mandeville’s private attack on his unimpeachably good
                  classmate Clifford, who is about to marry Mandeville’s sister in a domestic simulation
                  of the impending Restoration. By way of the protagonist’s “eternal war” on Clifford,
                  the novel engages in an almost pathological deconstruction of the beautiful, the good,
                  and the true. It ends shockingly with his accidental defacement by Clifford, an effraction
                  that dis-figures all schemes of restoration. Against readers who find the climax hard
                  to absorb and feel that Godwin meant to “complete” the novel otherwise, I argue that
                  he deliberately stages a psychoanalysis of “taste” and indeed of aesthetics itself,
                  as what Baumgarten calls the art of thinking beautifully (533). Godwin wrote the novel
                  after a long retreat of his own following the failure of 1790s radicalism, during
                  which he struggled with how to write history negatively, or how to write the negative
                  as history, as positive Negation. In this history, the fanaticism of the seventeenth
                  century and its later secularization as the misanthropy that so fascinated him are
                  tropes that must be turned round and back in on themselves, so as to discern within
                  them “something not yet made good” that “pushes its essence forward” (Habermas 78).
                  Yet in the context of the novel, this potential remains “contracted and self-negated”
                  (Schelling 18), withheld in an absolute reserve.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Godwin went on to write a <em>History of the Commonwealth of England</em> (1824–28): a more sober and concrete sequel to <em>Political Justice</em>. If <em>Mandeville</em> is knotted into a negative dialectic with the <em>History</em>, as <em>Caleb Williams</em> was with <em>Political Justice</em>, its conclusion suspends any dialectic over a black hole. There is no such ambiguity
                     in David Clark’s essay on Goya’s <em>Disasters of War</em>, the eighty two images of tortured and mangled bodies from the Peninsular War of
                     1808–14 that are the backside of Goya’s long career as a court painter. Clark’s essay
                     has much in common with my own: both deal with texts from the second decade of the
                     nineteenth century that are set against the backdrop of war, and both deal with texts
                     that are brutally unaesthetic. But there is no “tropology” of the negative here, in
                     which the negative too is not what it is; there is no future, only bare life. Unlike
                     the essays by Rowe and Collings, Clark’s essay also bears directly on the public sphere,
                     but there are no persons in the images, no citizens, as the figures are anonymous
                     and lacking in what Heidegger calls “world.” Goya printed early proofs of many of
                     the plates in the <em>Disasters,</em> but he never published them: not an accident, but “an artistic practice” (par. 5)
                     that we have seen in other figures discussed in this collection. By keeping the images
                     in a “studio rather than social state” (par. 5), Goya refuses them any refuge in the
                     social. It is surely curious that in a Romanticism now configured around the Regency,
                     and thus around a public sphere of consensus rather than dissensus,

                     and Spain. Rather than arguing that Romanticism invented the depoliticized category
                     of “literature” as the delayed completion of Britain’s “bloodless Revolution” (Jarrells
                     7–14, 17–19), we should perhaps think Romanticism within this withdrawal into the
                     rights of the negative, with all the differences about the negative that emerge in

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">This is the point made by Luhmann, who sees the public sphere as sufficiently open
               to accommodate continuous “structural transformation” through an expansion of communicative
               rationality in which even “improbable communications” of the most “personalized” nature
               develop a “code” that allows them to become part of the system, as the very existence
               of a “threshold of improbability” expands the “number of communicable topics” (8–9,
               18–20). There is thus no need for anything outside discourse, which also means that
               what is not yet part of discourse is “understood and practised” not at a “<em>thematic level</em>” but at the level of its “<em>codification</em>” (20-1).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Esposito is quoting Maurice Blanchot’s <em>The Space of Literature</em>. In his 1832 Preface to <em>Fleetwood</em> Godwin says that he began <em>Caleb Williams</em> “in the third person,” but then made “the hero of [the] tale his own historian”;
               in “this mode I persisted in all my subsequent . . . fiction” (448). The point would
               be inconsequential, except that Caleb casts doubt on his own first person narrative
               when he oddly decides to convey Collins’ third person narrative in the first person
               (<em>Caleb Williams</em> 66), thus producing a continuous “aphonia of the narrative voice” (Esposito 131).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
