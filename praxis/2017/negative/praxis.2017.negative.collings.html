            <p class="noCount">Romantic literature at times features instances of positive negation, that trope whereby
               a literary text gives a body, face, visible form, or effective agency to negativity.
               In doing so, it anticipates similar features in modernist critical theory, such as
               Heidegger’s notion of the possibility of the impossibility of existence, or Bataille’s
               rendition of the presence of the absence of God. Such figures appear in the late poetry
               of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, especially “Human Life, On the Denial of Immortality,”
               which reveal a counterside to his late theological reflections. That poem’s deployment
               of what Coleridge elsewhere considers to be the “positive state” of “Eternal Death”
               proposes that without the immortality of the soul, the best instance of positive negation
               is the living human being, who (in an echo of Milton’s Death) personifies the nothingness
               she or he must face. Such a figure, the poem suggests, can neither mount a suitable
               emotion in relation to its nothingness nor make its nothingness meaningful; nevertheless,
               as something crafted by nature’s “restless hands unconsciously,” the mortal becomes
               a figure of excess, of what interrupts mere blankness, exemplifying not a dialectical
               rendition of death but a second-order nullity, and thus can be defined through a Lacanian
               enigmatic signifier, even if one deprived of any code in which it may make sense.
               The poem thus anticipates certain a/theological features of recent thought, mapping
               the human as a site for the assertion of negativity. </p>

               <p>In taking up the theme of the “rights of the negative,” one might reasonably ask how
                  the negative has rights, how it might assert its rights, indeed how it might make
                  a demand of any kind. The negative, one might argue, is <em>negative</em>, operating over against the domain of positive institutions, assertions, and demands.
                  Yet one might reasonably argue that by virtue of that fact, nothing asserts itself
                  so insistently as the negative, that any positive instance necessarily operates in
                  relation to a negativity that never ceases to make itself felt.</p>
               <p>Such reflections, however, rely on the prior fact that something like “the negative”
                  or one of its analogues has been isolated, named, and given specific powers within
                  a discourse or practice. But this minimal figure, which makes of negativity a moment
                  within the domain of the apparently positive, may at times adopt a more radical form
                  through the trope of direct embodiment—that is, a face, voice, or agency, a capacity
                  to challenge the subject explicitly. Within canonic Romantic literature, one might
                  find several examples of this trope, including the metafictional ghost that appears
                  in <em>The Monk</em>, the “unfathered vapour” in Wordsworth’s crossing of the Alps, the creature in <em>Frankenstein</em>, and the figure of deathly negation in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>. All of these instances, as well as many others, no doubt allude on some level to
                  the most notorious instance of the figure, that darkness visible, Milton’s Death.
                  These versions of the negative appear in order to assert themselves, to make implacable
                  demands, and thus in some degree to horrify and alter those who encounter them. Various
                  renditions of positive negation emerge in other forms of articulation in the Romantic
                  era as well: one might think of the “empty place of power” that according to Claude
                  Lefort emerges over the course of the French Revolution to become a constitutive aspect
                  of modern democracies (27), or alternatively of the formative role of natural disaster,
                  war, and famine in Malthusian demography. Some might argue that the Kantian analytic
                  of the sublime, Schelling’s notion of the rotary motion of antithetical principles
                  in his <em>Ages of the World</em>, or Hegel’s account of Absolute Knowledge belong within this field as well. If one
                  glances ahead to later moments in the philosophical tradition, one might think of
                  Heidegger’s discussion of the “possibility of the measureless impossibility of existence”
                  in <em>Being and Time</em> (307) and of what Denis Hollier, capturing the sense of Georges Bataille’s notion
                  of the sacred, describes not as the “<em>absence of</em> [God’s] <em>presence</em>” but the “<em>presence of</em> [his] <em>absence</em>” (133). Even nearer to us is the Lacanian Real, which takes a logic or process that
                  perpetually undermines the symbolic and imaginary orders and treats it as an entity,
                  an uncanny Thing.</p>
               <p>Within this broad ensemble, certain moments in Coleridge’s late poems may seem inconsequential,
                  for they do not seem to be motivated by any ambitious poetic or philosophical project.
                  Indeed, in some cases the key articulations take place in poems he did not at first
                  intend to publish. Yet it is well worth reading those moments carefully with a view
                  toward the broader questions raised by Romanticism and its heirs, for they make visible
                  the counterseams in the texture of Coleridge’s overall theological and philosophical
                  thought, and articulate, with unusual brevity and precision, some of the continuing
                  stakes of positive negation.</p>
               <p>These preoccupations first appear explicitly in a tangle of incipient poems written
                  in an 1811 <em>Notebook</em> entry, especially the two poems eventually published in 1834 under the titles of
                  “Limbo” and “Ne Plus Ultra” (<em>Notebooks</em> 4073–74; <em>Complete Poems</em> 357–59). The poem “Limbo” initially outlines the limbo-zone of “half-being,” which
                  is “Wall’d round” to secure it from a more fearful state, “the mere horror of blank
                  Naught-at-all” (4, 23). In its final lines it moves beyond the “Purgatory curse” of
                  “dull Privation” to contemplate a darker alternative: “Hell knows a fear far worse
                  / A fear—a future state;—‘tis positive Negation!” (26–28). In settling on this final
                  phrase, Coleridge departs from an earlier line in the notebook draft where he writes
                  of “aye-unepithetable Negation” (<em>Complete Poems</em> 584; <em>Notebooks </em>4073), in effect hinting that “unepithetable” is itself an epithet—and that the notion
                  of a positive negation only makes sharper the idea of an unmodifiable one. As Morton
                  Paley points out, these lines allude to a notion in the third sermon of John Donne,
                  an author central to the entire notebook entry, that hell is the privation of God
                  (Paley 202). But by shifting from privation to negation, Coleridge suggests in effect
                  that hell is nothing other than a certain negation itself, or what in a later annotation
                  to the anonymous book <em>Eternal Punishment Proved to Be Not Suffering, but Privation</em> (1817), he calls the “positive State” of “Eternal Death” (<em>Marginalia</em> 559). Through the notion of “positive Negation,” Coleridge does not simply write
                  an oxymoron but invokes a fully considered concept, one we could describe not merely
                  as absence, but more fundamentally as the presence of absence, the possibility of
                  impossibility.</p>
               <p>That poem’s intervention is so brief, however, that it only broaches the theme. Thus
                  it is not surprising that Coleridge extends its musings in nearby notebook lines,
                  published under the title “Ne Plus Ultra,” where a speaker initially addresses nothingness
                  as the “Sole Positive of Night!” (1). Here that nothingness is given a much broader
                  force, for the speaker goes on to suggest that it is “The one permitted opposite of
                  God!,” the “sole despair / Of both th’ eternities in Heaven!” (4, 14–15). The poem
                  seems to rest on the notion that only nothingness is permitted to oppose God, insofar
                  as God has no true opposite. But if there is a <em>positive</em> negation, then its antithetical persistence can indeed generate astonishment. Rather
                  than representing Hell, a domain presumably subject to divine control, or a blank
                  naught-at-all of death, which only those alive may fear, here it has power to interdict
                  the activity of God and the angels. The negative has become a threat to the most assertive
                  sway of the positive itself.</p>
               <p>But the import of this poem’s stance remains unclear: <em>how</em> might sheer nothingness have the capacity to interdict God’s actions? Is Coleridge
                  riffing on his trope here, as if in the spirit of his version of Donne, or is he beginning
                  to conceive of a negativity like those that appear in Hegel or Schelling? The final
                  lines of the notebook entry speak of his ambivalence in this regard, where he writes,
                  “A Specimen of the Sublime dashed to pieces by cutting too close with her fiery Four
                  in Hand round the corner of Non-sense” (<em>Complete Poems</em> 584; <em>Notebooks </em>4073).</p>
               <p>Yet Coleridge does not abandon the themes broached in these lines, for he explores
                  them more fully soon thereafter in a poem published in 1817, “Human Life, On the Denial
                  of Immortality” (<em>Complete Poems</em> 362)—a continuity made even more evident by Coleridge’s remark in a marginal annotation
                  that this poem, too, was written “in purposed imitation of Donne” (<em>Poetical Works </em>1101). Here he takes up the possibility, already broached in “Limbo,” that human beings
                  may enter the “future state” of nonexistence, but for now considers the implications
                  of that possibility for the significance of human life as it is lived. If human beings
                  face a blank nothingness after death, the poem suggests, then the value of life itself
                  is cancelled. Accordingly, in this poem positive negation is neither what the living
                  fear nor an agency that interdicts God’s activity but an absence that transforms the
                  positive itself into a nullity, into a “Blank accident” (14). If human life is mortal,
                  the poem suggests, then the exemplary figure of “positive Negation” is the human being,
                  who ultimately personifies the nothingness that she must face, as if to instance in
                  another way what is visible in Milton’s Death. Yet here that trope uniquely appears
                  not as a ghost, monster, allegorical construction, structural principle, or demographic
                  driver, but as the living human being.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In that respect, Coleridge’s nullified subject comes into close proximity with the
                     subject of Hegel’s <em>Phenomenology</em>.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In the Preface to that work, Hegel crucially places his account of “tarrying with
                              the negative” in the context of the demand to confront death; for him, Spirit “wins
                              its truth only when, in utter dismemberment, it finds itself.” Moreover, in his depiction
                              of this tarrying, Hegel gives death’s negativity a certain positive force, a face:
                              “Spirit is this power only by looking the negative in the face, and tarrying with
                              it.” In this key passage, Hegel arguably places a version of positive negation (negation
                              given a face, voice, or agency) at the heart of his project. See Hegel 19.</span></div>
                     </div> Indeed, one can trace in this poem certain features of a dialectical shift: the transformation
                     of an external or future nullity—death, a future state of nonexistence—into an internal
                     or present one. Here the subject is placed in dialectical relation with death, except
                     that in this case, no negation of the negation takes place, no sublation of the subject’s
                     mortality. Here one arrives at “positive” negation not through a dialectical reversal
                     of the negative but through its intensification, its emergence as an even more clearly
                     delineated instance of the negative, one that leads to nothing other than itself.
                     This poem thus anticipates those who refuse the turn whereby Hegel transforms the
                     negative into the starting point of the subject’s becoming (cf. Bataille); instead,
                     it transforms nullity into a higher version of nullity, into a subjectivity nearly
                     indistinguishable from its own future inexistence. Where Hegel affirms and dialectically
                     transposes the subject’s mortality, Coleridge refuses to accept it; for him, a subject
                     characterized by its negation becomes the very emblem of absurdity and inexistence,
                     of a life lived under the shadow of what Tilottama Rajan has in another context called
                     “unusable negativity” (46).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Of course, the poem is meant in part to explore a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, to conceive of the ludicrous implications of what its title marks as the “denial”
                     of the immortality of the soul. As several scholars have suggested, the fact that
                     the poem is written in the conditional mode—“If dead, we cease to be” (1)—signals
                     that it takes up a contrary-to-fact scenario, a possibility excluded by the theology
                     Coleridge articulates in many of his late writings (Kessler 69–80; Vaz-Hooper).

                              the late theological writings. A key passage of the Opus Maximum, for example, maintains
                              that “[w]e affirm” that work’s central postulate “&lt;not&gt; because we . . . comprehend
                              the affirmation, but because we clearly comprehend the absurdity of the denial” (221).

                     </div> But such is not its entire purpose, for it also takes up the concern with hopelessness
                     or loss which informs a half-dozen lyrics he composed after 1805, from “Constancy
                     to an Ideal Object” through “Love’s Apparition and Evanishment,” and thus exemplifies
                     what Eric Wilson has described as the poet’s “double vision,” his ability to linger
                     with opposed possibilities (xiii).

                     evocation of a negated state; it explores nonsense seriously, articulating the nearly
                     inexplicable logic of the theological uncanny.</p>

                  <p>Initially it charts its concerns by suggesting that a purely mortal life, in finding
                     no realization after death, consists of nothing but biological life, nothing but “sound,”
                     “motion,” or “breath” (4, 5)—not so much bare life as <em>wasted</em> life. In a later passage, the poem extends this thought by suggesting that such a
                     life’s “laughter and tears / Mean but themselves” (17–18)—in effect, that even nonverbal
                     expressions cease to find their place in any code. The reflexive consciousness of
                     this state is equally futile; as the poem later suggests, it would be just as useless
                     to mourn the passing of such a life as to attempt <em>not</em> to mourn it. To react to it in <em>any</em> fashion, it suggests, would be vacuous: “Yet what and whence thy gain, if thou withhold
                     / These costless shadows of thy shadowy self? / Be sad, be glad, be neither! seek,
                     or shun!” (25–26). Moreover, it contends that the defeat of signification also defeats
                     affect itself, making “dreams” and “hopes and fears” equally weightless (16–17). The
                     poem thus expresses a longing for the <em>gap</em> between sign and signified, between nonverbal expression and code; the absence of
                     that gap, it seems, cancels significance, emotion, and purpose alike, as if in its
                     absence existence remains so insistently literal that it cannot even attain to the
                     minimal, impoverished status of the pure signifier. In the poem’s account, only a
                     possible immortality can ground meaning; without that immortality, human life has
                     an uncanny status, for having only “phantom purposes,” it becomes merely an “Image
                     of image, ghost of ghostly elf” (9, 23)—a ghostly “gust[]” and no more (3).

               <p>But if it is merely an image <em>of</em> image, ghost <em>of</em> ghostly elf, then it replicates a nonexistence it shares with the nonhuman world;
                  what precedes and generates it is a phantom like itself. The absence of substance
                  in human life implies in retrospect the absence of substance in nature as well. The
                  poem thus begins to outline a logic of nullity’s perpetual replication, whereby the
                  absence of immortality undoes the substance of human being, which in turn demonstrates
                  the absence of being in nature.</p>

                     </div> But rather than being reducible to flat nothingness, human life soon attains the status
                     of “surplus” or “anomaly,” terms that retain the sense of the purposeless or unintended
                     but that also hint that human life <em>exceeds</em> mere blankness. Indeed, if nature—herself an instance of personified nullity, of positive
                     negation—could interrupt herself and create humankind with “restless hands unconsciously,”
                     then humankind is the surplus of an unconscious act, a slip of the hand, something
                     unmeant—but still exceptional and potentially significant in the way that the father’s
                     “unmeant” words in the Conclusion to Part II of <em>Christabel</em>, for example, still retain an unconscious import (cf. Mileur 63–66).

                              ordinarily vex Coleridge, but such a rendition of nature is not entirely outside the
                              realm of his thought; on his difficulty in establishing a firm interpretation of nature
                              within the context of natural religion, see Brice.</span></div>
                     </div> A phantom, it seems, is not merely nothing; insofar as it instantiates an impulse
                     that caused an artist meditatively to interrupt her task of shaping a “nigh-unfinished
                     vase,” it reveals a <em>telling</em> nothingness, one that would intrude into the activity of positive creation to produce
                     the anomalous signifier. In this respect, it enacts an agency quite similar to the
                     interruptive power we encountered in “Ne Plus Ultra,” the sort capable of interdicting
                     the activity of a god; after all, if nature here is in the midst of producing an artifact
                     such as a vase, she may be informed by the capacity for creative intention, however
                     dreadful her activity may be. In that case, however, humanity remains distinctive
                     as the product of an <em>unconscious</em> act, a cryptic intention. Since the poem regards humanity as “nothing’s anomaly,”
                     as if nature here is synonymous with the nothing, perhaps it suggests that <em>nullity, through its power to interrupt itself, can produce something distinctive,
                        something irreducible to bare absence</em>. Of course, the poem almost simultaneously suggests that the significance of that
                     accidental surplus must remain “blank,” that the unmeant can never attain positive
                     meaning. Yet the anomalous blankness to which it points suggests that human life is
                     a meaningfully meaningless interruption, a significant insignificance, a distinctive
                     sort of nonsense—in effect a semiotic and ontological phantom.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In the absence of a gap between affect and meaning appears another gap: that between
                  nothingness and its surplus. This second gap enables human life to become more than
                  merely literal, for its status as unconsciously generated surplus makes it an enigmatic
                  signifier, even if one deprived of any code in which it can make sense. That development,
                  however, suggests as well that the negative has not merely replicated itself across
                  registers, for by interrupting itself it gives the further version of nullity a distinctive
                  import. As if to confirm these suggestions, in its final line—which, as Onita Vaz-Hooper
                  points out, as a twenty-ninth line, constitutes a surplus within a poem that otherwise
                  consists of two complete sonnets (536–37)—the poem does not claim that human life
                  lacks being; on the contrary, it broaches the possibility that the human “being’s
                  being” is contradiction, suggesting that one finds contradiction in the being <em>of </em>human being, the difficult shift from one level to another. In some measure, then,
                  that line registers the deadlock inherent in the status of being nothing’s anomaly
                  and, through its very status as surplus, insists on the haunting quality of that useless
                  excess.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>These possibilities may return us as well to the invocation of Milton as a highly
                     conventional emblem of theological, political, poetic, and personal immortality (7).
                     On one level, this passage invites us to consider and repudiate the apparently absurd
                     possibility that such a figure could “know death,” could indeed cease to be. Yet until
                     his correction to the poem’s proofs, Coleridge had written, “And <em>when</em> a soul like Milton’s can know death” (<em>Poetical Works</em> 1101), gesturing toward the possibility, which still lingers in the published version
                     of the poem, that perhaps so great a soul as Milton’s could do that difficult thing
                     and <em>know</em> death, could contend with the impossible task of grasping it—or that so great a poet
                     as Milton, through his figure of Death, could create the template for later attempts,
                     indeed for Coleridge’s own effort in this poem.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                              (7)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a contrasting reading of the revision of this line consistent with her overall
                              account, see Vaz-Hooper, 538–39.</span></div>
                     </div> By suggesting, even in such a cryptic manner, that such an act might be done, and
                     to some extent attempting to carry it out in its own right, the poem hints that attempting
                     to know a final death could be its most urgent, if undeclared business, as if it could
                     set itself the task of exploring the possibility of a certain impossibility, the presence
                     of a certain absence.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Thus this poem in certain moments articulates a distinctive rendition of negativity,
                  conceiving of a broadly Gothic a/theology or hauntology that refuses the dialectical
                  process visible in Hegel in favor of a proto-psychoanalytic account. Indeed, Coleridge’s
                  most direct interlocutor may be Lacan, whose sense that the subject is an enigmatic
                  signifier that ultimately lacks an Other in which that signifier would attain a secure
                  meaning (cf. Žižek 110–128) and which can perhaps best encounter itself anamorphically
                  in the image of a skull (Lacan 79–90) matches well with the indications in this poem.
                  But the poem may anticipate Lacan in these ways precisely by making explicit those
                  elements of Romanticism on which psychoanalysis eventually draws, taking its place
                  within the long genealogy of a certain rendition of human inexistence.</p>
               <p>In doing so, the poem also entangles that genealogy with other important strands.
                  In his recent book, <em>Minding the Modern</em> (2013), Thomas Pfau lucidly designates the Coleridge of the <em>Opus Maximum </em>as his chief exemplar of one who, living in the midst of modernity, nevertheless sustains
                  and advocates those concepts of person, relationship, and normative framework, inherited
                  from Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and others, that modernity has forsaken (Pfau).
                  But one might well take up a question Pfau does not consider: whether Coleridge’s
                  positive theology might be shadowed by another discourse, not by a concession to modernity
                  <em>per se</em>, but rather by the counterside of theological certainty itself, a poetics that finds
                  in that contrary domain the distinctive possibilities of positive negation. Such a
                  poetics might anticipate as well certain a/theological features of recent thought,
                  not least in Lacan, where negativity continues to assert its rights, even over against
                  the apparent nullity of the human condition.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">In the Preface to that work, Hegel crucially places his account of “tarrying with
               the negative” in the context of the demand to confront death; for him, Spirit “wins
               its truth only when, in utter dismemberment, it finds itself.” Moreover, in his depiction
               of this tarrying, Hegel gives death’s negativity a certain positive force, a face:
               “Spirit is this power only by looking the negative in the face, and tarrying with
               it.” In this key passage, Hegel arguably places a version of positive negation (negation
               given a face, voice, or agency) at the heart of his project. See Hegel 19.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Insofar as the poem pursues this approach, it deploys a strategy characteristic of
               the late theological writings. A key passage of the <em>Opus Maximum</em>, for example, maintains that “[w]e affirm” that work’s central postulate “&lt;not&gt; because
               we . . . comprehend the affirmation, but because we clearly comprehend the absurdity
               of the denial” (221). On negative proofs in that work, see Evans 17, 36–38, 59, 105–117.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">The most significant poems in this group (apart from several notebook fragments) include

               “The Visionary Hope,” “Limbo,” “Ne Plus Ultra,” “Human Life, On the Denial of Immortality,”

               and “Love’s Apparition and Evanishment: An Allegoric Romance.” The fact that Coleridge
               wrote so many poems of such ambition on these themes suggests that together they constitute
               a key dimension of his corpus, an important—if less discussed—dimension of his authorship.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
