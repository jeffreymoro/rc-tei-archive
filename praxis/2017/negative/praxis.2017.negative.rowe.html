            <p class="noCount">This essay proposes a reinterpretation of Charlotte Smith’s role in the romantic sonnet
               revival. It argues, against the predominant trend in Smith criticism, that <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em> is a counter-sentimental work. Smith’s primary innovation in the sonnet form was
               a particular way of using its “turn” function to dissociate the lyric subject from
               an unsatisfying reality. This gesture—the “negative turn”—occurs throughout the many
               editions of <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em>. Emphasizing this aspect of Smith’s sonnets prepares the ground for a hypothesis
               about her influence on subsequent generations of poets: similar rhetorical devices
               can be found in works by Cowper, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats. The phenomenological
               efficacy of the “negative turn,” in Smith and other poets, can be usefully described
               via D. W. Winnicott’s psychoanalytic argument for a “right not to communicate.” Smith’s
               sonnets invoke this right, and provide a crucial poetic technique for dissociating
               from the coercive facticity of an unsatisfying reality.</p>

                  <p>In the brief essay on the sonnet included in his 1797 <em>Poems</em>, Samuel Taylor Coleridge nods to William Bowles and Charlotte Smith as “they who
                     first made [the sonnet] popular.” Coleridge offers a brief genre-theory of the sonnet,
                     beginning by describing it as “a small poem, in which some lonely feeling is developed”
                     (<em>Poems </em>71). As any reader of Smith’s sonnets would attest, so far so good. Coleridge elaborates: <span class="quote">‘In a Sonnet then we require a development of some lonely feeling, by whatever cause
                        it may have been excited; but those Sonnets appear to me the most exquisite, in which
                        moral Sentiments, Affections, or Feelings, are deduced from, and associated with,
                        the scenery of Nature. Such compositions generate a habit of thought highly favourable
                        to delicacy of character. They create a sweet and indissoluble union between the intellectual
                        and material world. (<em>Poems </em>72)’</span> I want to argue that it is precisely this “sweet and indissoluble union” between inner
                     and outer worlds that that Smith’s sonnets fail to achieve—or, perhaps, programmatically
                     evade. Coleridge, famously, championed Bowles rather than Smith, despite the latter’s
                     arguably greater prominence in the 1790s. The impulses that Coleridge derived from
                     Bowles, as W. K. Wimsatt and M. H. Abrams both seminally argued, allowed him to develop
                     an intricate form of lyric coordination between the inner and the outer. The best
                     of Smith’s sonnets, in stark contrast, use the form to maintain subjectivity as an
                     unarticulated space that withdraws from lived experience, in a kind of refusal of
                     the dialectical imperative to integrate mind with nature. Coleridge’s preference for
                     Bowles over Smith, then, may be historically significant in ways that we have not
                     fully appreciated. In fact, criticism since Abrams has given us ample reason to regard
                     this preference as a defensive one. That is, it has led us to suspect that Coleridgean
                     lyrics, and Romantic lyrics in general, are not able to effect the “sweet and indissoluble
                     union” between mind and world that they aim at.

                              with the outer), as in the work of Geoffrey Hartman; and a historicist line (positing
                              that lyric attains subjective-objective closure only by excluding historical processes),
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> While criticism has demonstrated the intricate varieties of failure, dissociation,
                     and loss in Smith’s successors, Smith herself has largely remained confined, within
                     literary historiography, to a late eighteenth-century tradition of sentimental women’s
                     writing. What follows is an attempt to dispute this classification, and to claim Smith
                     for a Romantic tradition of lyric negativity.

                              form of poetry that concerns itself with procedures of “deduction” and “association”
                              “between the intellectual and material world,” of attunement between subjectivity
                              and its external objects. The consensus that this form of poetry self-evidently exists
                              and is called “lyric” has recently been shaken (Jackson; Culler). While I am unable
                              to address this important and productive controversy in this paper, it does seem to
                              me that retaining “lyric subjectivity” as a plausible analytic category allows one

                  <p>In recent decades, Smith’s place within the Romantic canon has seemed increasingly
                     secure. This security has been afforded, in large part, by an emerging understanding
                     of her singularly influential role in the Romantic sonnet revival. My aim here is
                     to contribute to this consensus, but also to argue that we have yet to fully grasp
                     the nature of Smith’s innovations in the form. Smith’s recuperation of the sonnet,
                     I will argue, should be understood as motivated by her discovery of a certain way
                     of using the resources of the form to articulate a gesture of affective dissociation
                     and phenomenal withdrawal from the world. I will call this gesture the “negative turn.”
                     The negative turn invests Smith’s <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em> (1784) with a certain silence or reserve that is central to the affective contours
                     of the poetry. It is a phenomenological gesture, but also first and foremost a technical
                     procedure, a certain way of using the sonnet’s “turn” or <span class="foreign">volta</span> function. The most technically accomplished and interesting of Smith’s sonnets utilize
                     this device to construct a mode of address that disarticulates the subject from its
                     environment. They stabilize subjectivity in relation to a world that is hostile, demanding,
                     or bewildering, and do so not by a gesture of mastery, but of disengagement. This

                              sentimental transaction shares an adjective with the inventor of the negative turn.</span></div>

                  <p>Throughout the recovery of Smith’s work during the past several decades, it has often
                     been assumed, and sometimes argued, that she was something called a Sentimental Poetess.

                              (the Poetess) in the “lyricization” of Romantic and Victorian poetry. Without necessarily
                              concurring with their claims for the historical specificity of the lyric mode, I share
                              their dissatisfaction with the way in which the figure of the Poetess has been adopted
                              in our reception of women’s writing, very especially in the case of Smith.</span></div>
                     </div> Her work has been pointed to, accordingly, as a substantiation of the link between
                     high Romanticism and the eighteenth-century culture of sensibility (McGann, <em>Poetics of Sensibility</em>; Nagle; Özdemir).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A subtle and interesting variant of this argument can be found in both Adela Pinch
                              and Jacqueline Labbe’s work on Smith. While both scholars essentially situate Smith
                              within a tradition of sentimental women’s writing, they also argue for the essential
                              artificiality or impersonality of sentimental conventions (Pinch; Labbe, Charlotte
                              Smith).</span></div>
                     </div> If we read Smith’s sonnets for their diction and rhetoric, there is a great deal to
                     be said for this claim. If we turn to the underlying lyric structure of the sonnets,
                     however, something deeply counter-sentimental in Smith’s writing emerges—which is
                     to say, something predicated on a lack of sensibility and responsiveness to social
                     and natural worlds. Many critics of the sonnets notice a curious lack of specificity
                     in Smith’s laments (McGann, <em>Poetics of Sensibility</em> 157; Labbe, <em>Charlotte Smith </em>75–76; Weisman 25). With only a few exceptions, the sonnets maintain a stony silence
                     on the cause of their despondency. This fact is all the more remarkable given what
                     we know about Smith’s life, which furnished her with ample cause for lament.

                              poetry (Smith xix–xxviii).</span></div>
                     </div> Nor can the sonnets’ taciturnity be plausibly attributed to feminine modesty: Smith
                     was not at all reticent about discussing her grievances in correspondence, and publicly
                     alluded to them at length in the 1797 preface to the second volume of her <em>Poems</em>.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Michael Hansen has helpfully situated Smith (and the sonnet revival writ large) within
                  a different tradition, that of the eighteenth-century elegy. As Hansen argues, the
                  word “elegiac” in the book’s title should be taken as a generic affiliation, not just
                  a modal description. This generic redescription of the <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em> (as elegies written as sonnets rather than sonnets that happen to be elegies) is
                  crucial to understanding Smith’s pedigree: according to Hansen’s lineage, she descends
                  as much from the Graveyard Poets as from sentimental writing. Yet to describe the
                  sonnets as elegiac we must have recourse to a strange concept: that of the object-less
                  elegy. With the exception of a set of sonnets spoken by fictional characters and another
                  set that allude to Smith’s deceased daughter Anna (and even here footnotes may be
                  necessary to catch the reference), these elegies consistently decline to say what
                  there is to elegize. Nor do they seem particularly concerned with extricating themselves
                  from the impasses in which they dwell. The lyric function of the elegy, it seems safe
                  to say, is generally to designate a lost object, and then to propose a means of recuperating
                  that loss. The majority of Smith’s sonnets are notable for taking neither of these
                  steps.</p>
               <p>We have accrued a number of rich and precise ways of talking about dissatisfaction
                  and loss in Romantic poetry. If I venture to coin a new phrase to describe the gesture
                  that recurs in Smith’s sonnets, it is because it does not seem to me to be perfectly
                  described by any existing paradigm. Rei Terada describes phenomenophilia as a therapeutic
                  retreat from the coercive pressure of ontology into the domain of pure phenomenal
                  appearing. Yet Smith’s dissatisfaction consistently fails to find any appearance that
                  it might attach to as recuperative. Jerome McGann makes an incisive distinction between
                  two different forms of elegy with different economic characters: compensatory (Wordsworth;
                  replacement and remuneration) and ecstatic (Blake and Byron; pure expenditure and
                  loss) (<em>Poetics of Sensibility </em>150–73). McGann situates Smith’s sonnets in the latter category, yet the poems fit
                  the label awkwardly: they tend to end neither apocalyptically nor orgasmically, but
                  with a demurral. Laura Quinney locates Smith within the genealogy of the “poetics
                  of disappointment,” a tradition of writing that tracks the fall from narcissistic
                  self-validation into the raw, formless flux of mere life. (28-30) Despite their references
                  to the lost plenitude of childhood experience, however, Smith’s sonnets are notable
                  for their refusal to have much to say about the lived affective present that has replaced
                  that plenitude, other than that it is painful. Perhaps closest to the Smithean gesture
                  is the state that Anne-Lise François has described as “recessive action”: a withdrawal
                  from the imperative to action into a state of modest, anticipatory attention. Yet
                  the theoretical force of François’ thought is to show that recession can count as
                  a kind of action, while the force of Smith’s sonnets derives from a more stringent
                  form of stasis, from the feat of engineering closure out of impasse itself. The negative
                  turn, a procedure Smith seems to have discovered within the formal resources of the
                  sonnet, finds a stable ground for subjectivity in the fact of dissatisfaction, the
                  inability of the mind to wholly endorse the world in which it finds itself. This kind
                  of subjectification, in its purest form, is essentially empty, declining all phenomenal
                  content except that of quiet demurral from the world it is offered. Supported by the
                  negative turn, the lyric subject withdraws into the shadow cast by the plenitude of
                  the phenomenal world.</p>

                  sonnets, this one adopts formal elements of both the Shakespearean and Petrarchan
                  variants. Most crucial, however, is the strong rhetorical break before the concluding

                  traditions, alternating between personified or agential natural features (“Spring,”
                  “slow-descending showers”) and typified human agents (the “shepherd” and the “hind,”
                  the prototypical inhabitants, respectively, or pastoral and georgic space). The sentiment
                  expressed here fits comfortably enough within William Empson’s classic description
                  of the pastoral: as articulating class difference via a vision of the simple, if melancholically
                  finite, life. Yet, upon reaching the couplet, we enter a very different rhetorical
                  space: the appearance of first-person pronouns shifts the sensorial organization of
                  the poem from pastoral/georgic to lyric, retrospectively inflecting the entire scene
                  described in the quatrains around the failure of the lyric subject to take pleasure
                  in it. In fact, the relationship between quatrains and couplet is almost paratactic,
                  as if rigorously separating the lyric subject from its world, rather than trying to
                  rearticulate a relation between them. The turn into the couplet, then, is also a turn
                  into elegiac subjectification. It registers the presence of a mind that hovers on
                  the edge of its world without engaging it.</p>
               <p>One of the most rhetorically virtuosic instances of the negative turn appears in a
                  late sonnet, “To the sun” (<a class="link_ref" href="#sLXXXIX" title=""><a id="mLXXXIX"><!--anchor--></a>LXXXIX</a>). Among the rare sonnets that articulate an object of loss (Smith’s daughter Anna),
                  this poem unfolds as a single sentence. Two quatrains organized by conjoined “whether”
                  clauses follow the sun’s diurnal course: morning in the first quatrain and, with accelerating
                  rhythm, noon and sundown in the second. With the apostrophe to the sun as “celestial
                  lamp” at the beginning of line 9, the subject of the sentence (the word “influence”)
                  is announced, and appears to initiate an episode of paint-by-numbers apostrophic praise.
                  Though the sonnet is quasi-Petrarchan in form, its actual turn occurs at line 11,
                  with the appearance of predicate and object: “shines not for me.” Across the enjambed
                  line break, what appeared to be a formulaic paean to the sun has collapsed into something
                  quite different. The appearance of the first-person pronoun opens up an inner space
                  of non-participation in the sun’s universal illumination. While the first two thirds
                  of the sonnet sing the praises of the sun’s illuminating powers, the last third posits
                  an un-illuminable inner world. The sonnet, characteristically, is disinterested in
                  mediating between these two worlds. Its form functions to sustain subjectivity as
                  a kind of negative space that emerges against the background of lived experience.
                  This space is articulated by a gesture of misrecognition and non-participation in
                  just the kind of reliable natural process that is generally held to support a common
                  world. The lyric subject here sets herself up as an exception to the famous designation
                  of universality in Ecclesiastes: “everything under the sun.”</p>
               <p>The complexity and rigor of Smith’s negative turn is perhaps nowhere more striking
                  than in her most famous sonnet, “Written in the church-yard at Middleton in Sussex”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="#sXLIV" title=""><a id="mXLIV"><!--anchor--></a>XLIV</a>). The scene described here is hardly one of pastoral contentment or sunny illumination,
                  and one might think that Smith had finally found an external scene with which she
                  could express sympathy or identification. The poem systematically develops the familiar
                  Romantic theme of mutability, interweaving concentric cycles of flux: astronomical,
                  geological, maritime, and human. A fitting tableau, it would seem, for a writer so
                  concerned with loss. Yet the poem’s culminating gesture, accomplished in the couplet,
                  is one of disaffiliation with the dead, and rigorous separation of inner and outer
                  storms. Rather than immersing itself in the grim scene it witnesses, the lyric subject
                  articulates itself as an excluded remainder. The contrast between the pronoun “they”
                  in line 12 and the “I” line 13 is characteristic: the lyric “I” sets itself up by
                  demurring from a given world, by refusing to recognize itself therein. This is certainly
                  not, within the canonical Romantic theory of lyric expressivity, how lyric subjectivity
                  is supposed to work. In this sense, the sonnet is a much stranger and more radical
                  poem than the more canonical contributions on the same subject (mutability) by Wordsworth
                  and Shelley: it is as if the inevitable disintegration of human worlds within the
                  flux of natural change were not, taken on its own, tragic enough.</p>

                     </div> By my count, thirty-nine of the sonnets display the dissociative structure of feeling
                     I have tried to describe, in which the lyric subject articulates its experience of
                     dissatisfaction against a world that fails to reflect that experience. Of these, twenty-six
                     use the turn function of the sonnet form to articulate the affective disjunction between
                     subject and world. (This sometimes occurs in the traditional locations of lines 9
                     or 13, and is sometimes slightly displaced, as in “To the sun.”) In the formal resources
                     of the sonnet, Smith found a support for a phenomenological procedure of disarticulation
                     between dissatisfied self and indifferent world. The sonnet’s renowned turn function,
                     in her poetry, becomes a turn into subjectification, into the detection of the self
                     as a kind of vacant space of disavowal of the exterior world. The type of Romantic
                     practiced in the sonnets, then, is quite different from that stipulated by a critic
                     like Abrams, who acknowledges the Romantic interest in dissatisfaction and misrecognition,
                     but emphasizes the ultimate re-coordination of inner and outer worlds as fundamental
                     to the structure of Romantic lyric. Subsequent criticism has, again, been more skeptical
                     about the possibility of this re-coordination. Yet it has largely continued to assume
                     that lyrics seek mind-world closure, even if unable to achieve it. In their rigorous
                     avoidance of such closure, Smith’s collection of dissociative sonnets was perhaps
                     never quite equaled in the decades following the 1780s. If one reads Smith’s successors
                     with one’s ears cocked, however, traces of Smithean dissociation remain audible.</p>

                  <p>The Smithean negative turn has a sporadic but persistent presence in the next three
                     decades of canonical poetry. The most pristine example, after <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em>, is probably found in William Cowper’s “The Cast-away.” The poem’s famous final gesture
                     has become so familiar that we may need to refresh ourselves as to its strangeness:
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">No voice divine the storm allay'd, </div>

                           <div class="l">When, snatch'd from all effectual aid, </div>
                           <div class="l">We perish'd, each alone; </div>
                           <div class="l">But I, beneath a rougher sea, <span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                           <div class="l">And whelm'd in deeper gulfs than he. (Cowper 319; ll. 61–66)</div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> The poem’s entire project, up to this point, has been to construct a correspondence
                     between two forms of woe, that of the drowning sailor and that of the poet. The latter,
                     though completely undescribed in the poem, is presented as its true subject, the former
                     as an extended simile. As Cowper explains: “mis’ry still delights to trace / Its semblance
                     in another’s case” (ll. 59–60). This analogic argument is completed in the final lines
                     with a compact statement of symmetry: “We perish’d, each alone.” The abyssal experiences
                     of sailor and poet may be incommunicable, but they are nevertheless mutually intelligible
                     as two cases of a general condition of incommunicability. This is a grim recuperative
                     gesture, but basically a stable one. Yet, with an unmistakably Smithean use of the
                     first-person pronoun, the final couplet punctures this closure, shifting from an analogic
                     argument to a comparative one. This “I,” which has been tacitly present throughout
                     the poem as the occluded referent of the maritime simile, quietly withdraws from the
                     analogic closure that has supported it. The final couplet—recognizably sonnet-like
                     in its economy—is a gesture of the utmost rigor: it withdraws subjectivity from the
                     most minimal form of content or correspondence with an external object.

                              two forms of suffering, only to qualify the equivalence: “A fate too similar is mine,
                              / But I—in lingering pain repine, / And still my lost felicity deplore!” (Smith 91;

                     final couplet. The passage’s argument seems complete without it: twilight steals over
                     the heart in sympathy with the corresponding external phenomenon, and the “sadly-pleasing
                     visions” it produces are in danger of fading from view in sympathy with the environment
                     that engendered them. “Yet,” something of the “tender gloom” remains: a certain coldness
                     and shuddering. This “yet,” and the apparent excrescence of the couplet it initiates,
                     marks the turn into elegiac subjectification, the detachment of phenomenal experience
                     from its objects. The “shuddering tear” may be melodramatic, but it should not be
                     mistaken for sentimental: the tear here serves a highly unusual function, articulating
                     the element in experience that fails to enter sympathetic resonance with the world.

               <p> By the eye’s “blankness,” Coleridge turns out to mean a disjunction between seeing
                  and feeling, a failure of objects in the sensorium to find internal correspondents.
                  In this gap between seeing and feeling, subjectivity detects itself as precisely what
                  fails to appear in the phenomenal field. As Tilottama Rajan argues, this “failure

                  pole to pole’ (l. 135) projected in the concluding benediction,” in which Coleridge

                                       quite live up to Smithean standards of rigor: Shelley’s troubled thought appears to
                                       be initiated by a breeze that disturbs the tranquil image in the pool. Yet even if
                                       some degree of connection between inner and outer turmoil remains, the meteorological
                                       phenomenon in question is very quickly displaced by its mental counterpart: “Until
                                       an envious wind crept by, / Like an unwelcome thought / Which from the mind’s too
                                       faithful eye / Blots one dear image out” (ll. 81–4).</span></div>

                     </blockquote> “Shelley’s mind” is here understood as that which remains unassimilated to the world’s
                     basic quality of habitability (the perpetual kindness of Jane and greenness of forests).
                     The mind here has a purely negative phenomenal profile, articulating subjectivity
                     as that which is subtracted from the world. It is registered through the detection
                     of turmoil where the world offers none. <em>The Triumph of Life </em>itself, finally, opens with what might be seen as a massive elaboration of the same
                     procedure Smith undertakes in her sonnet “To the sun.” As the sun rises and the “mask
                     / Of darkness [falls] from the awakened Earth,” (ll. 3–4) a universal sympathetic
                     motion occurs among things illuminated:

                     </blockquote> Yet, as in Smith’s sonnet, however, this sweeping designation of solar universality
                     has at least one exception: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                        </div>
                     </blockquote> The introduction of the first-person pronoun into the poem is accomplished via a negative
                     conjunction: not “and,” “but.” Subjectification is introduced into mere sensation
                     via the quiet failure of the “I” to align with what it senses. The poem designates
                     the mental phenomena that resist absorption into universality as Shelley’s “thoughts
                     that must remain untold.” This can be read in two ways: thoughts that Shelley declines
                     to communicate (of which more below), or thoughts implicitly incommunicable because
                     contentless, composed of the mere demurral comprised by phenomenal dissatisfaction
                     with a given world.</p>
               </div>
               <p>There is thus reason to speculate that the possibilities Smith discovered in the sonnet
                  were disseminated among a variety of verse forms. To return to the Romantic sonnet
                  tradition, however, we can consider an unusual, delicate Wordsworth sonnet of 1802,
                  <a class="link_ref" href="#sWords" title=""><a id="mWords"><!--anchor--></a>“Composed after a Journey across the Hamilton Hills.”</a> Up through the first three lines of the sestet, this poem offers a micro-elegy resolved
                  by a modest compensation: Wordsworth and his travelling companions arrive too late
                  to enjoy the view of Yorkshire from the Hambleton hills, but are treated instead to
                  a magnificent prospect of the sky at dusk. McGann’s distinction between compensatory
                  and ecstatic elegies is useful here: the language of compensation in the sonnet is
                  explicitly economic (“sights that might well repay all disappointment”), setting up
                  a logic in which a lost pleasure is, in the manner of double-entry book-keeping, balanced
                  out by an unexpected one. Yet a subtle negative turn, occurring in the middle of line
                  12, seems to articulate an exterior to this compensatory logic: the replacement of
                  one prospect by another occurs, it turns out, within an inexorable condition of forgetfulness,
                  the loss that always occurs when human minds attempt to register the unearthly. The
                  delight that the eye takes in the aerial prospect, prior to the turn, is wholly unironic,
                  almost embarrassingly Wordsworthian. The negative turn, however, retroactively registers
                  a contrast: “the eye may be delighted, but as for me . . . .” This gesture is, in
                  a quiet way, quite strange: it causes the compensatory closure established above to
                  unravel, as well as abruptly cancelling the equation of things of the sky (clouds)
                  and things of the earth (buildings) that the second quatrain works so hard to achieve.
                  Marked by an inscrutable affective timbre, the final two and a half lines end the
                  poem with a retreat backward into the void of subjectification, a content-less dissatisfaction
                  with lived experience that seems, retrospectively, to have been resonating under the
                  poem all along.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the single most striking example of the negative turn in post-Smithean Romanticism
                  is found in one of Keats’ best-known sonnets, <a class="link_ref" href="#sKeats" title=""><a id="mKeats"><!--anchor--></a>“When I have fears that I may cease to be.”</a> As in Smith’s sonnet to the sun, a parallel grammatical structure organizes this
                  sonnet’s quatrains as antecedents of the conclusion reached in the final couplet.
                  Three objects of loss—inner and outer poetic objects and a woman that Keats had glimpsed
                  at Vauxhall gardens years earlier—are proposed in each of the quatrains, setting up
                  a proleptic elegiac structure in which the couplet, we might expect, will play a compensatory
                  role. A famous Shakespearean procedure, for example, might use the couplet to find
                  a kind of durability and immortality within the poem itself: “So long as men can breathe
                  and eyes can see / So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.” The compensation
                  that this sonnet’s turn offers, however, is quite ambivalent and subtle:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">—then on the shore</div>
                     <div class="l">Of the wide world I stand alone, and think</div>
                     <div class="l">Till love and fame to nothingness do sink. (Keats 118–19)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> The sonnet might appear to be imperfectly Shakespearean in form in that it enjambs
                  the line preceding the couplet. However, a fundamental disjunction—the disjunction
                  I have been calling the negative turn—occurs between the situation described at the
                  end of line 12 and that of lines 13 and 14. Prior to the enjambment, we are presented
                  with the prospect—a highly Smithean one, as it happens—of standing despondently on
                  the shore. Once we enter the rhetorical space of the couplet, however, we encounter
                  a much stranger idea: “standing on the shore of the world.” This form of elegiac subjectivity
                  involves not the replacement of lost objects, but the fact of their “sinking” into
                  “nothingness,” falling away into a void. Standing on the shore of the world propels
                  the lyric subject into an infinite inner distance from which the objects of the world
                  approach inconsequentiality. Keats’ sonnet thus offers an austere account of melancholia:
                  the death of an outer object world and the retreat into an inner replacement.</p>

                     is all the more striking if we recall that Shakespeare’s sonnets, with their aphoristic,
                     rhetorical use of the turn function, had yet to undergo critical recuperation in the
                     1780s and 90s.

                     </div> Ever since Stuart Curran’s recovery of Smith’s poetry in the 1990s, critics have noted
                     the remarkable energy with which <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em> resuscitated a dormant genre. I wish to add the suggestion that the formal and phenomenological
                     impulse I have been calling the negative turn was the motor of this astonishing revival.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Different ethical and political interpretations of the negative turn might be imagined.
                  Mark Seltzer fortuitously settles on a related term (the turn away, the “turn turn”)
                  to describe the process through which persons create inner spaces “away” (Erving Goffman)
                  from the “official world.” The official world is understood, in a Luhmannian, systems-theoretical
                  idiom, as the collection of self-generating systems that sustain ordinary life. To
                  turn away from the official world, for Seltzer, merely articulates the system’s function
                  of exo-reference that defines and stabilizes its operations. Turned-away subjectivity
                  thus feels, phenomenally, exterior to the official world, but remains enmeshed in
                  its capture. (Seltzer’s systems-theoretical approach is marked by that intellectual
                  tradition’s characteristic affect: gentle paranoia.) The lyric negative turn, following
                  this line of argument, can be viewed as sustaining the integrity of a coercive reality
                  precisely by inwardly refusing to align with it.</p>
               <p>Jonathan Flatley offers the materials for a different interpretation when he theorizes
                  a connection between melancholic inner distance and “affective mapping.” The latter
                  is a process of attunement to the correspondences between inner affective space and
                  outer political space. Such correspondences, for Flatley, are most likely to come
                  into view when affective life is approached in a depressive mode—the movement into
                  the depressive position being, in a Kleinian idiom, a gesture that makes the world
                  whole by falling out of it. Melancholic detachment thus provides the opening for new
                  mappings of affective and political space. In Smith’s case, we might think of the
                  fact that she expanded her technical range, starting in the 1790s, to include political
                  verse as well as the elegiac sonnet. (While continuing to compose and publish sonnets,
                  Smith went on to write first “The Emigrants” [1798], a poem that curiously blends
                  elegiac subjectivity with political commentary, and then “Beachy Head” [1807], which,
                  as Kevis Goodman has shown, is concerned with the mapping of political space and time
                  from within a georgic sensorium.)</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The problem that comes into view, then, is whether phenomenal detachment from a dissatisfying
                     world should be viewed as buttressing or eroding the normative facticity of that world.
                     This dilemma, as Terada has shown, stems from the phenomenological intractability
                     of the fact-value problem, the tendency of reliable experiences to gain normative
                     gravity.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Again, Smith’s sonnets model on a very different response to fact-value conflation
                              than the one Terada finds in Coleridge and other phenomenophiles.</span></div>
                     </div> Smith began writing sonnets in the shadow of an Enlightenment tradition of optimism
                     about the fact-value problem (Hume’s firm is/ought distinction, Bentham’s counter-normative
                     theory of legislation) and before the consolidation of conservative counterarguments
                     affirming the ethical weight of established custom (Burke’s <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France </em>[1790]). In these two currents, dissatisfaction with what is demands either the construction
                     of an account of what ought to be or a stance of principled resignation to the identity
                     of is and ought. Smith’s sonnets chart a third course, detaching rigorously from what
                     is while declining to articulate a corresponding ought. As I have argued, the negative
                     turn holds subjectivity in a contentless void at the edge of lived experience. In
                     doing so, it fully acknowledges the facticity of an unsatisfying reality, yet leaves
                     unspoken the reality that the subject wished to find instead.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In this way, Smith’s sonnets stage acts of non-communication in a very precise sense,
                  that offered by D. W. Winnicott in a paper titled “Communicating and not communicating
                  leading to a study of certain opposites” (1996). In Winnicottian clinical theory,
                  healthy adult psychic organization involves the splitting of experience into “true”
                  and “false” selves. The former is composed by object-relating with internal, subjective,
                  unreal (and therefore real-feeling) phenomenon; the latter by compliance with external,
                  objective, real (and therefore unreal-feeling) facts. It is crucial for the subject
                  to remain in communication with her internal objects to maintain this organization,
                  yet this enterprise is attended by the danger that the true self might become fully
                  communicable and thus be exhausted. Such danger explains “the frightening fantasy
                  of being infinitely exploited . . . the fantasy of being eaten or swallowed up . . .
                  <em>the fantasy of being found</em>” (179; Winnicott’s italics). Thus the curiously elliptical forms of communication
                  practiced by certain people, for example artists, in whom “one can detect an inherent
                  dilemma, which belongs to the co-existence of two trends, the urgent need to communicate
                  and the still more urgent need not to be found” (185).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In Winnicottian terms, the feat accomplished by the Smithean negative turn is a quiet
                     refusal of compliance. It communicates nothing other than the possibility that there
                     might be something to communicate other than an assent to external facticity. Such
                     a non-communication by no means guarantees the existence of some particular, revelatory
                     secret, but does reserve a place for such secrets. The Winnicottian name for this
                     place is the “true self,” or the “non-communicating central self, for ever immune
                     from the reality principle, and for ever silent” (192). This silent void of inner
                     unreality is both elided and indicated by the negative turn.

                     the right not to communicate” (179). A clinician rather than an ethicist, he does
                     not develop this idea. However, it should not be confused with, for example, the Foucauldian
                     polemic against the repressive hypothesis, which holds that individuals should be
                     free to pursue artificial self-fashioning rather than unfold the innermost truths
                     of their being. Rather, the Winnicottian right not to communicate designates a right
                     to dissociation, a right to demur from the facticity of a commonly-held world. It
                     describes the cultivation of inner distance from the real as something that persons
                     must respect in one another.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As critics of Smith (especially Adela Pinch) have long pointed out, the language Smith
                  speaks in the sonnets is often not her own: Smith frequently borrowed and repurposed
                  lines from other poems, and her diction relies heavily on the tropes of eighteenth-century
                  sentimentalism, elegy, and georgic. Thus, even more than self-consciously innovative
                  poets, a writer like Smith works in the communal medium of linguistic exchange and
                  circulation. This lexical bricolage has made it easy to misread Smith as a Sentimental
                  Poetess—that is, a writer who facilitates the circulation of affects and sentiments
                  among persons. Yet the <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em> shape their borrowed linguistic material into a lyric structure designed precisely
                  to afford dissociation from the commonly-held world mediated in language. Oren Izenberg,
                  in the context of twentieth-century American poetry, has argued that one significant
                  strain of poetic experimentalism seeks to replace poems with persons, or to use poetry
                  as a technique for discovering accounts of personhood that might serve as a ground
                  for the social. The Smithean negative turn functions in a related but inverted fashion:
                  it utilizes poetic form (in the most literal-minded sense of the term) to allow persons
                  to withdraw themselves from the ground of social being. It permits the lyric subject,
                  even as she is immersed in the linguistic material of communal life, to remain silent.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Not communicating is thus, for Smith as for Winnicott, a way of dissociating from
                     the facticity of a commonly-held world. In psychoanalytic thought, the concept of
                     facticity or reality has tended to be attached, in one way or another, to the experience
                     of dissatisfaction. That is, the fact of having an experience to which one cannot
                     fully assent serves, for Freud and his students, as a guarantee that that experience
                     bears a relation to external reality.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Variations on this theme occur, for example, in Freud’s account of the inhibitory
                              function of the “reality principle,” Klein’s argument that the ego can integrate its
                              objects only by (depressively) acknowledging the fact of their separateness, Lacan’s
                              account of anxiety as a signal of the Real, and Winnicott’s theory of transitional
                              objects. </span></div>
                     </div> This tradition of Freudian epistemology places in a new light the question that Seltzer
                     and Flatley identify: whether subjective dissociation from the factical world has
                     the capacity to change anything about that world. This is, as in Seltzer and Flatley,
                     a problem that pertains to the relation of the individual to the social aggregate,
                     but also, as in the broader Freudian tradition, a problem that grounds subjectivity.
                     In Winnicott, the splitting of the ego into “true” and “false” components is a result
                     of “compliance” with the intractable facticity of the external world. The self cannot
                     afford, most of the time, not to comply with the real, but it is rarely fully prepared
                     to do so. In a crucial sense, compliance is thus always false compliance, and the
                     splitting of the self allows external compliance to coincide with internal demurral.
                     Smith’s innovations in the sonnet-form are, I hypothesize, the result of one mind’s
                     negotiation with this problem. The negative turn provides the means of addressing
                     reality from across a gulf of inner distance. It thereby preserves the silent reservoir
                     of inner unreality that makes this distance bearable.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In one of the late sonnets, “To the invisible moon” (<a class="link_ref" href="#sLXXX" title=""><a id="mLXXX"><!--anchor--></a>LXXX</a>) we find Smith more or less explicitly invoking her right not to communicate. This
                  epistle to the moon, written in the apostrophic second person, communicates an intention
                  not to communicate. Smith would like the moon to know that she is hidden from it,
                  but this is not the same as wanting to be found. The italicized “I”—here, as always
                  in Smith, the signal of negative subjectification—expresses a clear preference: not
                  to transact with the commonly-held world that might be supported by affective or meteorological
                  phenomena. The “I” counts itself as an exception to the gentle, melancholic agency
                  of moonlight, which might sooth others, but does not sooth <em>me</em>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>However, it should be made clear that this sonnet does not offer a pristine specimen
                     of the negative turn, and indeed is rather unusual for Smith. It permits us to cross
                     over from the negated, moonlit world of commonality into the unilluminated inner void
                     that this negation preserves. “But <em>I . . .</em>”: generally, Smith uses this disjunctive conjunction to absent herself from the phenomenal
                     world. Here, however, the dissociative “I” takes on a verb of affirmation: “prefer.”
                     This preferring marks an exit from the pure impotentiality—as with Bartleby—of preferring
                     not to or preferring nothing.

                     </div> That is, it constitutes a lapse in Smith’s rigorous object-less-ness. On the dark
                     side of the earth, we encounter Smith’s unreal, introjected objects: Mars, the “red
                     comet,” the “fire-ting’d waves.”

                              landscape supports Smith’s inner object-relating, the fact that it happens to exist
                              by no means cancels its unreality (Winnicott, “Transitional Objects”).</span></div>
                     </div> By reporting the gleaming and flashing of these quasi-hallucinatory phenomena, Smith
                     suspends, for a moment, the silence that underlies the most ostensibly melodramatic
                     of the sonnets. This communication is brought to a close by the couplet, which returns
                     to an “I” that can only be articulated by negative comparison (“beings less accurst
                     than I”). Yet in allowing this dilation and closure of a hallucinatory inner space,
                     Smith waives, ever so briefly, her right not to communicate.</p>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">This post-Abramsian development might be divided, for heuristic purposes, into at
               least three strains: a De Manian line (positing that the Romantic lyric’s very materials,
               language and image, irrevocably alienate it from the reality it seeks to attune itself
               to) as in the work of Tilottama Rajan (204–59); a phenomenologically-inflected line
               (positing the abyssal intractability of the inner world that lyric tries to align
               with the outer), as in the work of Geoffrey Hartman; and a historicist line (positing
               that lyric attains subjective-objective closure only by excluding historical processes),
               as in the work of Marjorie Levinson and Jerome McGann (<em>Romantic Ideology</em>). Each of these lines was in place well before scholars began to seriously read Smith,
               and she therefore is largely or entirely absent from the seminal arguments.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Throughout this paper, I assume, along with Coleridge, that there is a recognizable
               form of poetry that concerns itself with procedures of “deduction” and “association”
               “between the intellectual and material world,” of attunement between subjectivity
               and its external objects. The consensus that this form of poetry self-evidently exists
               and is called “lyric” has recently been shaken (Jackson; Culler). While I am unable
               to address this important and productive controversy in this paper, it does seem to
               me that retaining “lyric subjectivity” as a plausible analytic category allows one
               to describe currents in Smith’s poetry that a historicist approach might miss. In
               Smith’s particular case, I find the (solid) historicist conclusion that Smith’s work
               can be understood within the late eighteenth-century “culture of sensibility” to be
               inadequate, for reasons I will try to describe below.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Throughout, I use the term “Smithean” to refer to Charlotte and not, as is customary,
               Adam. It may come to seem ironic that the most accomplished theorist of interpersonal
               sentimental transaction shares an adjective with the inventor of the negative turn.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Virginia Jackson and Yopie Prins helpfully describe the importance of this figure
               (the Poetess) in the “lyricization” of Romantic and Victorian poetry. Without necessarily
               concurring with their claims for the historical specificity of the lyric mode, I share
               their dissatisfaction with the way in which the figure of the Poetess has been adopted
               in our reception of women’s writing, very especially in the case of Smith.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">A subtle and interesting variant of this argument can be found in both Adela Pinch
               and Jacqueline Labbe’s work on Smith. While both scholars essentially situate Smith
               within a tradition of sentimental women’s writing, they also argue for the essential
               artificiality or impersonality of sentimental conventions (Pinch; Labbe, <em>Charlotte Smith</em>).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">For a brief overview of Smith’s early, unhappy marriage and lifelong financial and
               legal problems, see Stuart Curran’s helpful introduction to his edition of Smith’s
               poetry (Smith xix–xxviii).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Further striking examples include sonnets III, VIII, LV, LXVII, LXXI, and XCII.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">“The Castaway” can be usefully compared with Smith’s narrative poem “The peasant of
               the Alps,” which concludes with a negative turn that proposes a correspondence between
               two forms of suffering, only to qualify the equivalence: “A fate too similar is mine,
               / But I—in lingering pain repine, / And still my lost felicity deplore!” (Smith 91;
               ll. 49–51). Cowper and Smith corresponded briefly in 1793, after Smith’s dedication
               of <em>The Emigrants </em>to the former.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">The poem contains what appear to be several direct allusions to <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em>, one of them initially appearing, in true Smithean fashion, in scare quotes, but
               never explicitly attributed. Wordsworth and Smith had spent an afternoon together,
               according to Smith’s correspondence, in 1791, after the composition but before the
               publication of “An Evening Walk” (Labbe, <em>Writing Romanticism</em> 1–14).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">This Smithean current in Wordsworth can arguably be followed to the first two stanzas
               of the “Immortality” ode.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">The disarticulation between inner turmoil and outer calm in this poem does not, admittedly,
               quite live up to Smithean standards of rigor: Shelley’s troubled thought appears to
               be initiated by a breeze that disturbs the tranquil image in the pool. Yet even if
               some degree of connection between inner and outer turmoil remains, the meteorological
               phenomenon in question is very quickly displaced by its mental counterpart: “Until
               an envious wind crept by, / Like an unwelcome thought / Which from the mind’s too
               faithful eye / Blots one dear image out” (ll. 81–4).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">There is no reason to think that Smith had read Shakespeare’s sonnets: her poetry
               alludes in several places to the plays, but nowhere to the sonnets, nor are the latter
               referred to in her correspondence.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">For partial exceptions, see Thomas Gray’s “Sonnet on the Death of Mr. Richard West”
               and Warton’s Sonnet I (Warton 75). Both poems, however, are isolated within their
               respective oeuvres, nor do they contain all the elements I have tried to describe
               as pertaining to the negative turn.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">Again, Smith’s sonnets model on a very different response to fact-value conflation
               than the one Terada finds in Coleridge and other phenomenophiles.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">Mary Jacobus helpfully explicates Winnicott’s paper at length. She also points out
               passages remarkably resonant with this theory in Book III of <em>The Prelude</em> (152–59). It is worth mentioning that Smith would have been fresh in Wordsworth’s
               memory when he arrived at Cambridge, as he had been lent a copy of <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em> by his schoolmaster only a few years earlier.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">Variations on this theme occur, for example, in Freud’s account of the inhibitory
               function of the “reality principle,” Klein’s argument that the ego can integrate its
               objects only by (depressively) acknowledging the fact of their separateness, Lacan’s
               account of anxiety as a signal of the Real, and Winnicott’s theory of transitional
               objects. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">See Giorgio Agamben’s Aristotelian reading of Melville’s story (243–71).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">The sonnet, of course, does seem to describe an actual landscape. If, however, this
               landscape supports Smith’s inner object-relating, the fact that it happens to exist
               by no means cancels its unreality (Winnicott, “Transitional Objects”).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
