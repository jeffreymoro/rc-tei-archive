                <p rend="noCount">This essay proposes a reinterpretation of Charlotte Smith’s role
                    in the romantic sonnet revival. It argues, against the predominant trend in
                    Smith criticism, that <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> is a
                    counter-sentimental work. Smith’s primary innovation in the sonnet form was a
                    particular way of using its “turn” function to dissociate the lyric subject from
                    an unsatisfying reality. This gesture—the “negative turn”—occurs throughout the
                    many editions of <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>. Emphasizing this
                    aspect of Smith’s sonnets prepares the ground for a hypothesis about her
                    influence on subsequent generations of poets: similar rhetorical devices can be
                    found in works by Cowper, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats. The
                    phenomenological efficacy of the “negative turn,” in Smith and other poets, can
                    be usefully described via D. W. Winnicott’s psychoanalytic argument for a “right
                    not to communicate.” Smith’s sonnets invoke this right, and provide a crucial
                    poetic technique for dissociating from the coercive facticity of an unsatisfying
                    reality. </p>

                    <p>In the brief essay on the sonnet included in his 1797 <title level="m"
                            >Poems</title>, Samuel Taylor Coleridge nods to William Bowles and
                        Charlotte Smith as “they who first made [the sonnet] popular.” Coleridge
                        offers a brief genre-theory of the sonnet, beginning by describing it as “a
                        small poem, in which some lonely feeling is developed” (<title level="m"
                            >Poems </title>71). As any reader of Smith’s sonnets would attest, so
                        far so good. Coleridge elaborates: <quote>In a Sonnet then we require a
                            development of some lonely feeling, by whatever cause it may have been
                            excited; but those Sonnets appear to me the most exquisite, in which
                            moral Sentiments, Affections, or Feelings, are deduced from, and
                            associated with, the scenery of Nature. Such compositions generate a
                            habit of thought highly favourable to delicacy of character. They create
                            a sweet and indissoluble union between the intellectual and material
                            world. (<title level="m">Poems </title>72)</quote> I want to argue that
                        it is precisely this “sweet and indissoluble union” between inner and outer
                        worlds that that Smith’s sonnets fail to achieve—or, perhaps,
                        programmatically evade. Coleridge, famously, championed Bowles rather than
                        Smith, despite the latter’s arguably greater prominence in the 1790s. The
                        impulses that Coleridge derived from Bowles, as W. K. Wimsatt and M. H.
                        Abrams both seminally argued, allowed him to develop an intricate form of
                        lyric coordination between the inner and the outer. The best of Smith’s
                        sonnets, in stark contrast, use the form to maintain subjectivity as an
                        unarticulated space that withdraws from lived experience, in a kind of
                        refusal of the dialectical imperative to integrate mind with nature.
                        Coleridge’s preference for Bowles over Smith, then, may be historically
                        significant in ways that we have not fully appreciated. In fact, criticism
                        since Abrams has given us ample reason to regard this preference as a
                        defensive one. That is, it has led us to suspect that Coleridgean lyrics,
                        and Romantic lyrics in general, are not able to effect the “sweet and
                        indissoluble union” between mind and world that they aim at.<note
                            place="foot">This post-Abramsian development might be divided, for
                            heuristic purposes, into at least three strains: a De Manian line
                            (positing that the Romantic lyric’s very materials, language and image,
                            irrevocably alienate it from the reality it seeks to attune itself to)
                            as in the work of Tilottama Rajan (204–59); a
                            phenomenologically-inflected line (positing the abyssal intractability
                            of the inner world that lyric tries to align with the outer), as in the
                            work of Geoffrey Hartman; and a historicist line (positing that lyric
                            attains subjective-objective closure only by excluding historical
                            processes), as in the work of Marjorie Levinson and Jerome McGann
                                (<title level="m">Romantic Ideology</title>). Each of these lines
                            was in place well before scholars began to seriously read Smith, and she
                            therefore is largely or entirely absent from the seminal
                            arguments.</note> While criticism has demonstrated the intricate
                        varieties of failure, dissociation, and loss in Smith’s successors, Smith
                        herself has largely remained confined, within literary historiography, to a
                        late eighteenth-century tradition of sentimental women’s writing. What
                        follows is an attempt to dispute this classification, and to claim Smith for
                        a Romantic tradition of lyric negativity.<note place="foot">Throughout this
                            paper, I assume, along with Coleridge, that there is a recognizable form
                            of poetry that concerns itself with procedures of “deduction” and
                            “association” “between the intellectual and material world,” of
                            attunement between subjectivity and its external objects. The consensus
                            that this form of poetry self-evidently exists and is called “lyric” has
                            recently been shaken (Jackson; Culler). While I am unable to address
                            this important and productive controversy in this paper, it does seem to
                            me that retaining “lyric subjectivity” as a plausible analytic category
                            allows one to describe currents in Smith’s poetry that a historicist
                            approach might miss. In Smith’s particular case, I find the (solid)
                            historicist conclusion that Smith’s work can be understood within the
                            late eighteenth-century “culture of sensibility” to be inadequate, for
                            reasons I will try to describe below.</note></p>
                    <p> In recent decades, Smith’s place within the Romantic canon has seemed
                        increasingly secure. This security has been afforded, in large part, by an
                        emerging understanding of her singularly influential role in the Romantic
                        sonnet revival. My aim here is to contribute to this consensus, but also to
                        argue that we have yet to fully grasp the nature of Smith’s innovations in
                        the form. Smith’s recuperation of the sonnet, I will argue, should be
                        understood as motivated by her discovery of a certain way of using the
                        resources of the form to articulate a gesture of affective dissociation and
                        phenomenal withdrawal from the world. I will call this gesture the “negative
                        turn.” The negative turn invests Smith’s <title level="m">Elegiac
                            Sonnets</title> (1784) with a certain silence or reserve that is central
                        to the affective contours of the poetry. It is a phenomenological gesture,
                        but also first and foremost a technical procedure, a certain way of using
                        the sonnet’s “turn” or <foreign>volta</foreign> function. The most
                        technically accomplished and interesting of Smith’s sonnets utilize this
                        device to construct a mode of address that disarticulates the subject from
                        its environment. They stabilize subjectivity in relation to a world that is
                        hostile, demanding, or bewildering, and do so not by a gesture of mastery,
                        but of disengagement. This distinctively Smithean<note place="foot">
                            Throughout, I use the term “Smithean” to refer to Charlotte and not, as
                            is customary, Adam. It may come to seem ironic that the most
                            accomplished theorist of interpersonal sentimental transaction shares an
                            adjective with the inventor of the negative turn.</note> gesture of
                        phenomenal withdrawal, I want to suggest, casts a longer shadow over Smith’s
                        inheritors than we have yet acknowledged.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the recovery of Smith’s work during the past several decades, it
                        has often been assumed, and sometimes argued, that she was something called
                        a Sentimental Poetess.<note place="foot">Virginia Jackson and Yopie Prins
                            helpfully describe the importance of this figure (the Poetess) in the
                            “lyricization” of Romantic and Victorian poetry. Without necessarily
                            concurring with their claims for the historical specificity of the lyric
                            mode, I share their dissatisfaction with the way in which the figure of
                            the Poetess has been adopted in our reception of women’s writing, very
                            especially in the case of Smith.</note> Her work has been pointed to,
                        accordingly, as a substantiation of the link between high Romanticism and
                        the eighteenth-century culture of sensibility (McGann, <title level="m"
                            >Poetics of Sensibility</title>; Nagle; Özdemir).<note place="foot"> A
                            subtle and interesting variant of this argument can be found in both
                            Adela Pinch and Jacqueline Labbe’s work on Smith. While both scholars
                            essentially situate Smith within a tradition of sentimental women’s
                            writing, they also argue for the essential artificiality or
                            impersonality of sentimental conventions (Pinch; Labbe, <title level="m"
                                >Charlotte Smith</title>).</note> If we read Smith’s sonnets for
                        their diction and rhetoric, there is a great deal to be said for this claim.
                        If we turn to the underlying lyric structure of the sonnets, however,
                        something deeply counter-sentimental in Smith’s writing emerges—which is to
                        say, something predicated on a lack of sensibility and responsiveness to
                        social and natural worlds. Many critics of the sonnets notice a curious lack
                        of specificity in Smith’s laments (McGann, <title level="m">Poetics of
                            Sensibility</title> 157; Labbe, <title level="m">Charlotte Smith
                        </title>75–76; Weisman 25). With only a few exceptions, the sonnets maintain
                        a stony silence on the cause of their despondency. This fact is all the more
                        remarkable given what we know about Smith’s life, which furnished her with
                        ample cause for lament.<note place="foot"> For a brief overview of Smith’s
                            early, unhappy marriage and lifelong financial and legal problems, see
                            Stuart Curran’s helpful introduction to his edition of Smith’s poetry
                            (Smith xix–xxviii).</note> Nor can the sonnets’ taciturnity be plausibly
                        attributed to feminine modesty: Smith was not at all reticent about
                        discussing her grievances in correspondence, and publicly alluded to them at
                        length in the 1797 preface to the second volume of her <title level="m"
                            >Poems</title>.</p>
                    <p>Michael Hansen has helpfully situated Smith (and the sonnet revival writ
                        large) within a different tradition, that of the eighteenth-century elegy.
                        As Hansen argues, the word “elegiac” in the book’s title should be taken as
                        a generic affiliation, not just a modal description. This generic
                        redescription of the <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> (as elegies
                        written as sonnets rather than sonnets that happen to be elegies) is crucial
                        to understanding Smith’s pedigree: according to Hansen’s lineage, she
                        descends as much from the Graveyard Poets as from sentimental writing. Yet
                        to describe the sonnets as elegiac we must have recourse to a strange
                        concept: that of the object-less elegy. With the exception of a set of
                        sonnets spoken by fictional characters and another set that allude to
                        Smith’s deceased daughter Anna (and even here footnotes may be necessary to
                        catch the reference), these elegies consistently decline to say what there
                        is to elegize. Nor do they seem particularly concerned with extricating
                        themselves from the impasses in which they dwell. The lyric function of the
                        elegy, it seems safe to say, is generally to designate a lost object, and
                        then to propose a means of recuperating that loss. The majority of Smith’s
                        sonnets are notable for taking neither of these steps.</p>
                    <p> We have accrued a number of rich and precise ways of talking about
                        dissatisfaction and loss in Romantic poetry. If I venture to coin a new
                        phrase to describe the gesture that recurs in Smith’s sonnets, it is because
                        it does not seem to me to be perfectly described by any existing paradigm.
                        Rei Terada describes phenomenophilia as a therapeutic retreat from the
                        coercive pressure of ontology into the domain of pure phenomenal appearing.
                        Yet Smith’s dissatisfaction consistently fails to find any appearance that
                        it might attach to as recuperative. Jerome McGann makes an incisive
                        distinction between two different forms of elegy with different economic
                        characters: compensatory (Wordsworth; replacement and remuneration) and
                        ecstatic (Blake and Byron; pure expenditure and loss) (<title level="m"
                            >Poetics of Sensibility </title>150–73). McGann situates Smith’s sonnets
                        in the latter category, yet the poems fit the label awkwardly: they tend to
                        end neither apocalyptically nor orgasmically, but with a demurral. Laura
                        Quinney locates Smith within the genealogy of the “poetics of
                        disappointment,” a tradition of writing that tracks the fall from
                        narcissistic self-validation into the raw, formless flux of mere life.
                        (28-30) Despite their references to the lost plenitude of childhood
                        experience, however, Smith’s sonnets are notable for their refusal to have
                        much to say about the lived affective present that has replaced that
                        plenitude, other than that it is painful. Perhaps closest to the Smithean
                        gesture is the state that Anne-Lise François has described as “recessive
                        action”: a withdrawal from the imperative to action into a state of modest,
                        anticipatory attention. Yet the theoretical force of François’ thought is to
                        show that recession can count as a kind of action, while the force of
                        Smith’s sonnets derives from a more stringent form of stasis, from the feat
                        of engineering closure out of impasse itself. The negative turn, a procedure
                        Smith seems to have discovered within the formal resources of the sonnet,
                        finds a stable ground for subjectivity in the fact of dissatisfaction, the
                        inability of the mind to wholly endorse the world in which it finds itself.
                        This kind of subjectification, in its purest form, is essentially empty,
                        declining all phenomenal content except that of quiet demurral from the
                        world it is offered. Supported by the negative turn, the lyric subject
                        withdraws into the shadow cast by the plenitude of the phenomenal world.</p>

                    <p>A crisp example can be found in <ref target="#sXXXI"><anchor xml:id="mXXXI"
                            />sonnet XXXI</ref>, “Written in Farm Wood, South Downs, in May 1784.”
                        As with many or most of Smith’s sonnets, this one adopts formal elements of
                        both the Shakespearean and Petrarchan variants. Most crucial, however, is
                        the strong rhetorical break before the concluding couplet—a feature that
                        marks it, arguably, as more English than Italian. For three quatrains, we
                        are comfortably situated somewhere in between the pastoral and georgic
                        traditions, alternating between personified or agential natural features
                        (“Spring,” “slow-descending showers”) and typified human agents (the
                        “shepherd” and the “hind,” the prototypical inhabitants, respectively, or
                        pastoral and georgic space). The sentiment expressed here fits comfortably
                        enough within William Empson’s classic description of the pastoral: as
                        articulating class difference via a vision of the simple, if melancholically
                        finite, life. Yet, upon reaching the couplet, we enter a very different
                        rhetorical space: the appearance of first-person pronouns shifts the
                        sensorial organization of the poem from pastoral/georgic to lyric,
                        retrospectively inflecting the entire scene described in the quatrains
                        around the failure of the lyric subject to take pleasure in it. In fact, the
                        relationship between quatrains and couplet is almost paratactic, as if
                        rigorously separating the lyric subject from its world, rather than trying
                        to rearticulate a relation between them. The turn into the couplet, then, is
                        also a turn into elegiac subjectification. It registers the presence of a
                        mind that hovers on the edge of its world without engaging it.</p>
                    <p> One of the most rhetorically virtuosic instances of the negative turn
                        appears in a late sonnet, “To the sun” (<ref target="#sLXXXIX"><anchor
                                xml:id="mLXXXIX"/>LXXXIX</ref>). Among the rare sonnets that
                        articulate an object of loss (Smith’s daughter Anna), this poem unfolds as a
                        single sentence. Two quatrains organized by conjoined “whether” clauses
                        follow the sun’s diurnal course: morning in the first quatrain and, with
                        accelerating rhythm, noon and sundown in the second. With the apostrophe to
                        the sun as “celestial lamp” at the beginning of line 9, the subject of the
                        sentence (the word “influence”) is announced, and appears to initiate an
                        episode of paint-by-numbers apostrophic praise. Though the sonnet is
                        quasi-Petrarchan in form, its actual turn occurs at line 11, with the
                        appearance of predicate and object: “shines not for me.” Across the enjambed
                        line break, what appeared to be a formulaic paean to the sun has collapsed
                        into something quite different. The appearance of the first-person pronoun
                        opens up an inner space of non-participation in the sun’s universal
                        illumination. While the first two thirds of the sonnet sing the praises of
                        the sun’s illuminating powers, the last third posits an un-illuminable inner
                        world. The sonnet, characteristically, is disinterested in mediating between
                        these two worlds. Its form functions to sustain subjectivity as a kind of
                        negative space that emerges against the background of lived experience. This
                        space is articulated by a gesture of misrecognition and non-participation in
                        just the kind of reliable natural process that is generally held to support
                        a common world. The lyric subject here sets herself up as an exception to
                        the famous designation of universality in Ecclesiastes: “everything under
                        the sun.”</p>
                    <p> The complexity and rigor of Smith’s negative turn is perhaps nowhere more
                        striking than in her most famous sonnet, “Written in the church-yard at
                        Middleton in Sussex” (<ref target="#sXLIV"><anchor xml:id="mXLIV"
                            />XLIV</ref>). The scene described here is hardly one of pastoral
                        contentment or sunny illumination, and one might think that Smith had
                        finally found an external scene with which she could express sympathy or
                        identification. The poem systematically develops the familiar Romantic theme
                        of mutability, interweaving concentric cycles of flux: astronomical,
                        geological, maritime, and human. A fitting tableau, it would seem, for a
                        writer so concerned with loss. Yet the poem’s culminating gesture,
                        accomplished in the couplet, is one of disaffiliation with the dead, and
                        rigorous separation of inner and outer storms. Rather than immersing itself
                        in the grim scene it witnesses, the lyric subject articulates itself as an
                        excluded remainder. The contrast between the pronoun “they” in line 12 and
                        the “I” line 13 is characteristic: the lyric “I” sets itself up by demurring
                        from a given world, by refusing to recognize itself therein. This is
                        certainly not, within the canonical Romantic theory of lyric expressivity,
                        how lyric subjectivity is supposed to work. In this sense, the sonnet is a
                        much stranger and more radical poem than the more canonical contributions on
                        the same subject (mutability) by Wordsworth and Shelley: it is as if the
                        inevitable disintegration of human worlds within the flux of natural change
                        were not, taken on its own, tragic enough.</p>
                    <p>The structure I’ve tried to outline appears persistently throughout the
                            <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>, from the slender first edition
                        to the full, two-volume version of 1800.<note place="foot"> Further striking
                            examples include sonnets III, VIII, LV, LXVII, LXXI, and XCII.</note> By
                        my count, thirty-nine of the sonnets display the dissociative structure of
                        feeling I have tried to describe, in which the lyric subject articulates its
                        experience of dissatisfaction against a world that fails to reflect that
                        experience. Of these, twenty-six use the turn function of the sonnet form to
                        articulate the affective disjunction between subject and world. (This
                        sometimes occurs in the traditional locations of lines 9 or 13, and is
                        sometimes slightly displaced, as in “To the sun.”) In the formal resources
                        of the sonnet, Smith found a support for a phenomenological procedure of
                        disarticulation between dissatisfied self and indifferent world. The
                        sonnet’s renowned turn function, in her poetry, becomes a turn into
                        subjectification, into the detection of the self as a kind of vacant space
                        of disavowal of the exterior world. The type of Romantic practiced in the
                        sonnets, then, is quite different from that stipulated by a critic like
                        Abrams, who acknowledges the Romantic interest in dissatisfaction and
                        misrecognition, but emphasizes the ultimate re-coordination of inner and
                        outer worlds as fundamental to the structure of Romantic lyric. Subsequent
                        criticism has, again, been more skeptical about the possibility of this
                        re-coordination. Yet it has largely continued to assume that lyrics seek
                        mind-world closure, even if unable to achieve it. In their rigorous
                        avoidance of such closure, Smith’s collection of dissociative sonnets was
                        perhaps never quite equaled in the decades following the 1780s. If one reads
                        Smith’s successors with one’s ears cocked, however, traces of Smithean
                        dissociation remain audible.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <p>The Smithean negative turn has a sporadic but persistent presence in the next
                        three decades of canonical poetry. The most pristine example, after <title
                            level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>, is probably found in William Cowper’s
                        “The Cast-away.” The poem’s famous final gesture has become so familiar that
                        we may need to refresh ourselves as to its strangeness:<quote><lg>
                                <l>No voice divine the storm allay'd, </l>
                                <l>No light propitious shone, </l>
                                <l>When, snatch'd from all effectual aid, </l>
                                <l>We perish'd, each alone; </l>
                                <l>But I, beneath a rougher sea, </l>
                                <l>And whelm'd in deeper gulfs than he. (Cowper 319; ll. 61–66)</l>
                            </lg></quote> The poem’s entire project, up to this point, has been to
                        construct a correspondence between two forms of woe, that of the drowning
                        sailor and that of the poet. The latter, though completely undescribed in
                        the poem, is presented as its true subject, the former as an extended
                        simile. As Cowper explains: “mis’ry still delights to trace / Its semblance
                        in another’s case” (ll. 59–60). This analogic argument is completed in the
                        final lines with a compact statement of symmetry: “We perish’d, each alone.”
                        The abyssal experiences of sailor and poet may be incommunicable, but they
                        are nevertheless mutually intelligible as two cases of a general condition
                        of incommunicability. This is a grim recuperative gesture, but basically a
                        stable one. Yet, with an unmistakably Smithean use of the first-person
                        pronoun, the final couplet punctures this closure, shifting from an analogic
                        argument to a comparative one. This “I,” which has been tacitly present
                        throughout the poem as the occluded referent of the maritime simile, quietly
                        withdraws from the analogic closure that has supported it. The final
                        couplet—recognizably sonnet-like in its economy—is a gesture of the utmost
                        rigor: it withdraws subjectivity from the most minimal form of content or
                        correspondence with an external object.<note place="foot"> “The Castaway”
                            can be usefully compared with Smith’s narrative poem “The peasant of the
                            Alps,” which concludes with a negative turn that proposes a
                            correspondence between two forms of suffering, only to qualify the
                            equivalence: “A fate too similar is mine, / But I—in lingering pain
                            repine, / And still my lost felicity deplore!” (Smith 91; ll. 49–51).
                            Cowper and Smith corresponded briefly in 1793, after Smith’s dedication
                            of <title level="m">The Emigrants </title>to the former.</note></p>
                    <p>Several striking examples of the negative turn appear in Wordsworth’s early
                        poetry. The fragment “A Night-Piece” recounts the passage of the moon
                        through a gap in the clouds. Upon the completion of this “solemn scene,” the
                        poem enters a new rhetorical space: <quote><lg>
                                <l>At length the vision closes, and the mind</l>
                                <l>Not undisturbed by the deep joy it feels,</l>
                                <l>Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,</l>
                                <l>Is left to muse upon the solemn scene. (Wordsworth 45; ll.
                                    20–23)</l>
                            </lg></quote> It is only with the closure of the “vision” that the
                        envisioning mind becomes sensible. Mind exists as an after-resonance of
                        vision, yet is stringently partitioned off from it. A similar gesture occurs
                        in “An Evening Walk,” a poem in which the evidence of Wordsworth’s early
                        admiration of Smith is well-documented.<note place="foot">The poem contains

                            </lg></quote> The diction and rhetoric here seem akin to that of <title
                            level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>, but a more striking correspondence
                        can be found in the apparent redundancy of the final couplet. The passage’s
                        argument seems complete without it: twilight steals over the heart in
                        sympathy with the corresponding external phenomenon, and the “sadly-pleasing
                        visions” it produces are in danger of fading from view in sympathy with the
                        environment that engendered them. “Yet,” something of the “tender gloom”
                        remains: a certain coldness and shuddering. This “yet,” and the apparent
                        excrescence of the couplet it initiates, marks the turn into elegiac
                        subjectification, the detachment of phenomenal experience from its objects.
                        The “shuddering tear” may be melodramatic, but it should not be mistaken for
                        sentimental: the tear here serves a highly unusual function, articulating
                        the element in experience that fails to enter sympathetic resonance with the
                            world.<note place="foot"> This Smithean current in Wordsworth can
                            arguably be followed to the first two stanzas of the “Immortality”

                    <p>Coleridge’s “Dejection” ode (1802) offers a striking and well-known negative turn:<quote><lg>
                                <l>And still I gaze—and with how blank an eye! </l>
                                <l>And those thin clouds above, in flakes and bars, </l>
                                <l>That give away their motion to the stars; </l>
                                <l>Those stars, that glide behind them or between, </l>
                                <l>Now sparkling, now bedimmed, but always seen: </l>
                                <l>Yon crescent Moon, as fixed as if it grew </l>
                                <l>In its own cloudless, starless lake of blue; </l>

                            </lg></quote> By the eye’s “blankness,” Coleridge turns out to mean a
                        disjunction between seeing and feeling, a failure of objects in the
                        sensorium to find internal correspondents. In this gap between seeing and
                        feeling, subjectivity detects itself as precisely what fails to appear in
                        the phenomenal field. As Tilottama Rajan argues, this “failure of communion
                        .&#160;.&#160;. radically calls into question the vision of life eddying
                        ‘from pole to pole’ (l. 135) projected in the concluding benediction,” in
                        which Coleridge attempts to vicariously recuperate his own dejection via an
                        address to Sara Hutchinson (232).</p>
                    <p> Nearly two decades later, several similar negative turns would occur in
                        Shelley’s late, dejected lyrics. “Stanzas Written in Dejection, Near Naples”
                        offers two full stanzas of luscious maritime description before breaking off
                        into affective dissociation: “How sweet! did any heart now share in my
                        emotion” (Shelley 136, ll. 27). “To Jane. The Recollection” concludes with a
                        long description of the pines and sky outside Naples reflected in a
                        motionless pool of water, only to conclude with a reassertion of “Shelley’s mind”:<quote><lg>
                                <l>Though Thou art ever fair and kind</l>
                                <l>And forests ever green,</l>
                                <l>Lest oft is peace in S’s mind</l>
                                <l>Than calm in waters seen.<note place="foot">The disarticulation
                                        between inner turmoil and outer calm in this poem does not,
                                        admittedly, quite live up to Smithean standards of rigor:
                                        Shelley’s troubled thought appears to be initiated by a
                                        breeze that disturbs the tranquil image in the pool. Yet
                                        even if some degree of connection between inner and outer
                                        turmoil remains, the meteorological phenomenon in question
                                        is very quickly displaced by its mental counterpart: “Until
                                        an envious wind crept by, / Like an unwelcome thought /
                                        Which from the mind’s too faithful eye / Blots one dear
                                        image out” (ll. 81–4).</note> (Shelley 474; ll. 85–88)</l>
                            </lg></quote> “Shelley’s mind” is here understood as that which remains
                        unassimilated to the world’s basic quality of habitability (the perpetual
                        kindness of Jane and greenness of forests). The mind here has a purely
                        negative phenomenal profile, articulating subjectivity as that which is
                        subtracted from the world. It is registered through the detection of turmoil
                        where the world offers none. <title level="m">The Triumph of Life
                        </title>itself, finally, opens with what might be seen as a massive
                        elaboration of the same procedure Smith undertakes in her sonnet “To the
                        sun.” As the sun rises and the “mask / Of darkness [falls] from the awakened
                        Earth,” (ll. 3–4) a universal sympathetic motion occurs among things illuminated:<quote><lg>
                                <l>And in succession due, did Continent, </l>
                                <l>Isle, Ocean, and all things that in them wear </l>
                                <l>The form and character of mortal mould </l>
                                <l>Rise as the Sun their father rose […] (Shelley 484; ll.
                                    15–18)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Yet, as in Smith’s sonnet, however, this sweeping
                        designation of solar universality has at least one exception: <quote><lg>
                                <l>But I, whom thoughts which must remain untold </l>
                                <l>Had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem </l>
                                <l>The cone of night .&#160;.&#160;. (ll. 21–3)</l>
                            </lg></quote> The introduction of the first-person pronoun into the poem
                        is accomplished via a negative conjunction: not “and,” “but.”
                        Subjectification is introduced into mere sensation via the quiet failure of
                        the “I” to align with what it senses. The poem designates the mental
                        phenomena that resist absorption into universality as Shelley’s “thoughts
                        that must remain untold.” This can be read in two ways: thoughts that
                        Shelley declines to communicate (of which more below), or thoughts
                        implicitly incommunicable because contentless, composed of the mere demurral
                        comprised by phenomenal dissatisfaction with a given world.</p>
                    <p>There is thus reason to speculate that the possibilities Smith discovered in
                        the sonnet were disseminated among a variety of verse forms. To return to
                        the Romantic sonnet tradition, however, we can consider an unusual, delicate
                        Wordsworth sonnet of 1802, <ref target="#sWords"><anchor xml:id="mWords"
                            />“Composed after a Journey across the Hamilton Hills.”</ref> Up through
                        the first three lines of the sestet, this poem offers a micro-elegy resolved
                        by a modest compensation: Wordsworth and his travelling companions arrive
                        too late to enjoy the view of Yorkshire from the Hambleton hills, but are
                        treated instead to a magnificent prospect of the sky at dusk. McGann’s
                        distinction between compensatory and ecstatic elegies is useful here: the
                        language of compensation in the sonnet is explicitly economic (“sights that
                        might well repay all disappointment”), setting up a logic in which a lost
                        pleasure is, in the manner of double-entry book-keeping, balanced out by an
                        unexpected one. Yet a subtle negative turn, occurring in the middle of line
                        12, seems to articulate an exterior to this compensatory logic: the
                        replacement of one prospect by another occurs, it turns out, within an
                        inexorable condition of forgetfulness, the loss that always occurs when
                        human minds attempt to register the unearthly. The delight that the eye
                        takes in the aerial prospect, prior to the turn, is wholly unironic, almost
                        embarrassingly Wordsworthian. The negative turn, however, retroactively
                        registers a contrast: “the eye may be delighted, but as for me
                        .&#160;.&#160;. .” This gesture is, in a quiet way, quite strange: it causes
                        the compensatory closure established above to unravel, as well as abruptly
                        cancelling the equation of things of the sky (clouds) and things of the
                        earth (buildings) that the second quatrain works so hard to achieve. Marked
                        by an inscrutable affective timbre, the final two and a half lines end the
                        poem with a retreat backward into the void of subjectification, a
                        content-less dissatisfaction with lived experience that seems,
                        retrospectively, to have been resonating under the poem all along.</p>
                    <p> Perhaps the single most striking example of the negative turn in
                        post-Smithean Romanticism is found in one of Keats’ best-known sonnets, <ref
                            target="#sKeats"><anchor xml:id="mKeats"/>“When I have fears that I may
                            cease to be.”</ref> As in Smith’s sonnet to the sun, a parallel
                        grammatical structure organizes this sonnet’s quatrains as antecedents of
                        the conclusion reached in the final couplet. Three objects of loss—inner and
                        outer poetic objects and a woman that Keats had glimpsed at Vauxhall gardens
                        years earlier—are proposed in each of the quatrains, setting up a proleptic
                        elegiac structure in which the couplet, we might expect, will play a
                        compensatory role. A famous Shakespearean procedure, for example, might use
                        the couplet to find a kind of durability and immortality within the poem
                        itself: “So long as men can breathe and eyes can see / So long lives this,
                        and this gives life to thee.” The compensation that this sonnet’s turn
                        offers, however, is quite ambivalent and subtle:<quote><lg>
                                <l>—then on the shore</l>
                                <l>Of the wide world I stand alone, and think</l>
                                <l>Till love and fame to nothingness do sink. (Keats 118–19)</l>
                            </lg></quote> The sonnet might appear to be imperfectly Shakespearean in
                        form in that it enjambs the line preceding the couplet. However, a
                        fundamental disjunction—the disjunction I have been calling the negative
                        turn—occurs between the situation described at the end of line 12 and that
                        of lines 13 and 14. Prior to the enjambment, we are presented with the
                        prospect—a highly Smithean one, as it happens—of standing despondently on
                        the shore. Once we enter the rhetorical space of the couplet, however, we
                        encounter a much stranger idea: “standing on the shore of the world.” This
                        form of elegiac subjectivity involves not the replacement of lost objects,
                        but the fact of their “sinking” into “nothingness,” falling away into a
                        void. Standing on the shore of the world propels the lyric subject into an
                        infinite inner distance from which the objects of the world approach
                        inconsequentiality. Keats’ sonnet thus offers an austere account of
                        melancholia: the death of an outer object world and the retreat into an
                        inner replacement.</p>

                    <p> If the literary genealogy hypothesized here is plausible, we can suggest
                        that the primary historical importance of Smith’s <title level="m">Elegiac
                            Sonnets</title> lies not in their popularization of sentimental topoi,
                        but in their discovery of a new lyric technique for detachment from the
                        world. The originality of this procedure is all the more striking if we
                        recall that Shakespeare’s sonnets, with their aphoristic, rhetorical use of
                        the turn function, had yet to undergo critical recuperation in the 1780s and
                            90s.<note place="foot"> There is no reason to think that Smith had read
                            Shakespeare’s sonnets: her poetry alludes in several places to the
                            plays, but nowhere to the sonnets, nor are the latter referred to in her
                            correspondence.</note> Nor do the other scattered collections of sonnets
                        produced in the late eighteenth century (by Thomas Warton and Smith’s patron
                        William Hayley, for example) provide much precedent for the Smithean
                        negative turn.<note place="foot">For partial exceptions, see Thomas Gray’s
                            “Sonnet on the Death of Mr. Richard West” and Warton’s Sonnet I (Warton
                            75). Both poems, however, are isolated within their respective oeuvres,
                            nor do they contain all the elements I have tried to describe as
                            pertaining to the negative turn.</note> Ever since Stuart Curran’s
                        recovery of Smith’s poetry in the 1990s, critics have noted the remarkable
                        energy with which <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> resuscitated a
                        dormant genre. I wish to add the suggestion that the formal and
                        phenomenological impulse I have been calling the negative turn was the motor
                        of this astonishing revival.</p>
                    <p> Different ethical and political interpretations of the negative turn might
                        be imagined. Mark Seltzer fortuitously settles on a related term (the turn
                        away, the “turn turn”) to describe the process through which persons create
                        inner spaces “away” (Erving Goffman) from the “official world.” The official
                        world is understood, in a Luhmannian, systems-theoretical idiom, as the
                        collection of self-generating systems that sustain ordinary life. To turn
                        away from the official world, for Seltzer, merely articulates the system’s
                        function of exo-reference that defines and stabilizes its operations.
                        Turned-away subjectivity thus feels, phenomenally, exterior to the official
                        world, but remains enmeshed in its capture. (Seltzer’s systems-theoretical
                        approach is marked by that intellectual tradition’s characteristic affect:
                        gentle paranoia.) The lyric negative turn, following this line of argument,
                        can be viewed as sustaining the integrity of a coercive reality precisely by
                        inwardly refusing to align with it.</p>
                    <p>Jonathan Flatley offers the materials for a different interpretation when he
                        theorizes a connection between melancholic inner distance and “affective
                        mapping.” The latter is a process of attunement to the correspondences
                        between inner affective space and outer political space. Such
                        correspondences, for Flatley, are most likely to come into view when
                        affective life is approached in a depressive mode—the movement into the
                        depressive position being, in a Kleinian idiom, a gesture that makes the
                        world whole by falling out of it. Melancholic detachment thus provides the
                        opening for new mappings of affective and political space. In Smith’s case,
                        we might think of the fact that she expanded her technical range, starting
                        in the 1790s, to include political verse as well as the elegiac sonnet.
                        (While continuing to compose and publish sonnets, Smith went on to write
                        first “The Emigrants” [1798], a poem that curiously blends elegiac
                        subjectivity with political commentary, and then “Beachy Head” [1807],
                        which, as Kevis Goodman has shown, is concerned with the mapping of
                        political space and time from within a georgic sensorium.)</p>
                    <p> The problem that comes into view, then, is whether phenomenal detachment
                        from a dissatisfying world should be viewed as buttressing or eroding the
                        normative facticity of that world. This dilemma, as Terada has shown, stems
                        from the phenomenological intractability of the fact-value problem, the
                        tendency of reliable experiences to gain normative gravity.<note
                            place="foot"> Again, Smith’s sonnets model on a very different response
                            to fact-value conflation than the one Terada finds in Coleridge and
                            other phenomenophiles.</note> Smith began writing sonnets in the shadow
                        of an Enlightenment tradition of optimism about the fact-value problem
                        (Hume’s firm is/ought distinction, Bentham’s counter-normative theory of
                        legislation) and before the consolidation of conservative counterarguments
                        affirming the ethical weight of established custom (Burke’s <title level="m"
                            >Reflections on the Revolution in France </title>[1790]). In these two
                        currents, dissatisfaction with what is demands either the construction of an
                        account of what ought to be or a stance of principled resignation to the
                        identity of is and ought. Smith’s sonnets chart a third course, detaching
                        rigorously from what is while declining to articulate a corresponding ought.
                        As I have argued, the negative turn holds subjectivity in a contentless void
                        at the edge of lived experience. In doing so, it fully acknowledges the
                        facticity of an unsatisfying reality, yet leaves unspoken the reality that
                        the subject wished to find instead. </p>
                    <p>In this way, Smith’s sonnets stage acts of non-communication in a very
                        precise sense, that offered by D. W. Winnicott in a paper titled
                        “Communicating and not communicating leading to a study of certain
                        opposites” (1996). In Winnicottian clinical theory, healthy adult psychic
                        organization involves the splitting of experience into “true” and “false”
                        selves. The former is composed by object-relating with internal, subjective,
                        unreal (and therefore real-feeling) phenomenon; the latter by compliance
                        with external, objective, real (and therefore unreal-feeling) facts. It is
                        crucial for the subject to remain in communication with her internal objects
                        to maintain this organization, yet this enterprise is attended by the danger
                        that the true self might become fully communicable and thus be exhausted.
                        Such danger explains “the frightening fantasy of being infinitely exploited
                        .&#160;.&#160;. the fantasy of being eaten or swallowed up .&#160;.&#160;.
                            <emph>the fantasy of being found</emph>” (179; Winnicott’s italics).
                        Thus the curiously elliptical forms of communication practiced by certain
                        people, for example artists, in whom “one can detect an inherent dilemma,
                        which belongs to the co-existence of two trends, the urgent need to
                        communicate and the still more urgent need not to be found” (185).</p>
                    <p> In Winnicottian terms, the feat accomplished by the Smithean negative turn
                        is a quiet refusal of compliance. It communicates nothing other than the
                        possibility that there might be something to communicate other than an
                        assent to external facticity. Such a non-communication by no means
                        guarantees the existence of some particular, revelatory secret, but does
                        reserve a place for such secrets. The Winnicottian name for this place is
                        the “true self,” or the “non-communicating central self, for ever immune
                        from the reality principle, and for ever silent” (192). This silent void of
                        inner unreality is both elided and indicated by the negative turn.<note
                            place="foot">Mary Jacobus helpfully explicates Winnicott’s paper at
                            length. She also points out passages remarkably resonant with this
                            theory in Book III of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> (152–59). It
                            is worth mentioning that Smith would have been fresh in Wordsworth’s
                            memory when he arrived at Cambridge, as he had been lent a copy of
                                <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> by his schoolmaster only a
                            few years earlier.</note> Winnicott, reading his paper to the San
                        Francisco Psychoanalytic Society in 1963, finds himself surprised that his
                        thought has led him “to staking a claim .&#160;.&#160;. to the right not to
                        communicate” (179). A clinician rather than an ethicist, he does not develop
                        this idea. However, it should not be confused with, for example, the
                        Foucauldian polemic against the repressive hypothesis, which holds that
                        individuals should be free to pursue artificial self-fashioning rather than
                        unfold the innermost truths of their being. Rather, the Winnicottian right
                        not to communicate designates a right to dissociation, a right to demur from
                        the facticity of a commonly-held world. It describes the cultivation of
                        inner distance from the real as something that persons must respect in one
                        another. </p>
                    <p> As critics of Smith (especially Adela Pinch) have long pointed out, the
                        language Smith speaks in the sonnets is often not her own: Smith frequently
                        borrowed and repurposed lines from other poems, and her diction relies
                        heavily on the tropes of eighteenth-century sentimentalism, elegy, and
                        georgic. Thus, even more than self-consciously innovative poets, a writer
                        like Smith works in the communal medium of linguistic exchange and
                        circulation. This lexical bricolage has made it easy to misread Smith as a
                        Sentimental Poetess—that is, a writer who facilitates the circulation of
                        affects and sentiments among persons. Yet the <title level="m">Elegiac
                            Sonnets</title> shape their borrowed linguistic material into a lyric
                        structure designed precisely to afford dissociation from the commonly-held
                        world mediated in language. Oren Izenberg, in the context of
                        twentieth-century American poetry, has argued that one significant strain of
                        poetic experimentalism seeks to replace poems with persons, or to use poetry
                        as a technique for discovering accounts of personhood that might serve as a
                        ground for the social. The Smithean negative turn functions in a related but
                        inverted fashion: it utilizes poetic form (in the most literal-minded sense
                        of the term) to allow persons to withdraw themselves from the ground of
                        social being. It permits the lyric subject, even as she is immersed in the
                        linguistic material of communal life, to remain silent.</p>
                    <p> Not communicating is thus, for Smith as for Winnicott, a way of dissociating
                        from the facticity of a commonly-held world. In psychoanalytic thought, the
                        concept of facticity or reality has tended to be attached, in one way or
                        another, to the experience of dissatisfaction. That is, the fact of having
                        an experience to which one cannot fully assent serves, for Freud and his
                        students, as a guarantee that that experience bears a relation to external
                            reality.<note place="foot"> Variations on this theme occur, for example,
                            in Freud’s account of the inhibitory function of the “reality
                            principle,” Klein’s argument that the ego can integrate its objects only
                            by (depressively) acknowledging the fact of their separateness, Lacan’s
                            account of anxiety as a signal of the Real, and Winnicott’s theory of
                            transitional objects. </note> This tradition of Freudian epistemology
                        places in a new light the question that Seltzer and Flatley identify:
                        whether subjective dissociation from the factical world has the capacity to
                        change anything about that world. This is, as in Seltzer and Flatley, a
                        problem that pertains to the relation of the individual to the social
                        aggregate, but also, as in the broader Freudian tradition, a problem that
                        grounds subjectivity. In Winnicott, the splitting of the ego into “true” and
                        “false” components is a result of “compliance” with the intractable
                        facticity of the external world. The self cannot afford, most of the time,
                        not to comply with the real, but it is rarely fully prepared to do so. In a
                        crucial sense, compliance is thus always false compliance, and the splitting
                        of the self allows external compliance to coincide with internal demurral.
                        Smith’s innovations in the sonnet-form are, I hypothesize, the result of one
                        mind’s negotiation with this problem. The negative turn provides the means
                        of addressing reality from across a gulf of inner distance. It thereby
                        preserves the silent reservoir of inner unreality that makes this distance
                        bearable.</p>
                    <p>In one of the late sonnets, “To the invisible moon” (<ref target="#sLXXX"
                                ><anchor xml:id="mLXXX"/>LXXX</ref>) we find Smith more or less
                        explicitly invoking her right not to communicate. This epistle to the moon,
                        written in the apostrophic second person, communicates an intention not to
                        communicate. Smith would like the moon to know that she is hidden from it,
                        but this is not the same as wanting to be found. The italicized “I”—here, as
                        always in Smith, the signal of negative subjectification—expresses a clear
                        preference: not to transact with the commonly-held world that might be
                        supported by affective or meteorological phenomena. The “I” counts itself as
                        an exception to the gentle, melancholic agency of moonlight, which might
                        sooth others, but does not sooth <emph>me</emph>. </p>
                    <p>However, it should be made clear that this sonnet does not offer a pristine
                        specimen of the negative turn, and indeed is rather unusual for Smith. It
                        permits us to cross over from the negated, moonlit world of commonality into
                        the unilluminated inner void that this negation preserves. “But <emph>I
                            .&#160;.&#160;.</emph>”: generally, Smith uses this disjunctive
                        conjunction to absent herself from the phenomenal world. Here, however, the
                        dissociative “I” takes on a verb of affirmation: “prefer.” This preferring
                        marks an exit from the pure impotentiality—as with Bartleby—of preferring
                        not to or preferring nothing.<note place="foot"> See Giorgio Agamben’s
                            Aristotelian reading of Melville’s story (243–71).</note> That is, it
                        constitutes a lapse in Smith’s rigorous object-less-ness. On the dark side
                        of the earth, we encounter Smith’s unreal, introjected objects: Mars, the
                        “red comet,” the “fire-ting’d waves.”<note place="foot">The sonnet, of
                            course, does seem to describe an actual landscape. If, however, this
                            landscape supports Smith’s inner object-relating, the fact that it
                            happens to exist by no means cancels its unreality (Winnicott,
                            “Transitional Objects”).</note> By reporting the gleaming and flashing
                        of these quasi-hallucinatory phenomena, Smith suspends, for a moment, the
                        silence that underlies the most ostensibly melodramatic of the sonnets. This
                        communication is brought to a close by the couplet, which returns to an “I”
                        that can only be articulated by negative comparison (“beings less accurst
                        than I”). Yet in allowing this dilation and closure of a hallucinatory inner
                        space, Smith waives, ever so briefly, her right not to communicate. </p>

                            <l>Hold like rich garners the full ripen’d grain;</l>
                            <l>When I behold, upon the night’s starr’d face,</l>
                            <l>Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,</l>
                            <l>And think that I may never live to trace</l>
                            <l>Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;</l>
                            <l>And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,</l>
                            <l>That I may never look upon thee more,</l>
                            <l>Never have relish in the faery power</l>
                            <l>Of unreflecting love;—then on the shore</l>
                            <l>Of the wide world I stand alone, and think</l>
                            <l>Till love and fame to nothingness do sink. (Keats 118–119)</l>

                            <l>Dark and conceal’d art thou, soft Evening’s Queen,</l>

                            <l>Portentous, gleams above the troubled deep;</l>
                            <l>Or the red comet shakes his blazing hair;</l>
                            <l>Or on the fire-ting’d waves the lightnings leap;</l>
                            <l>While thy fair beams illume another sky,</l>
                            <l>And shine for beings less accurst than I. (Smith 69)</l>
