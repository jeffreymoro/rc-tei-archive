            <p class="noCount">This paper takes up Godwin’s fourth major novel, <em>Mandeville</em> (1817), and explores its extreme negativity as a recursive space for the stalled
               revolutionary energies of what Godwin saw as the only period in British history worthy
               of “genuine and independent man”: the period of the Civil Wars and the “English Revolution,”
               which had many resonances with his own time. The novel, which begins with the Irish
               Rebellion of 1641 and ends on the eve of the Restoration, is a catachresis: a historical
               novel whose protagonist never enters history as he progressively retreats into the
               closet of his psychic history. At its center is the misanthropic protagonist’s “eternal
               war” on his rival and future brother-in-law Clifford, who prvides an alibi for an
               almost pathological deconstruction of normativity. The story ends shockingly with
               Mandeville’s accidental defacement by Clifford, an effraction that dis-figures all
               schemes of restoration. But the novel is by no means the “domestic story” that Godwin’s
               publisher wanted to make it, as Mandeville’s damaged life is a symptom, “imprinted
               by history and the process of history’s destruction of the body” (Foucault). Approaching
               the text within the political unconscious of seventeenth-century religious politics,
               I see the fanaticism that provides the text’s historical backdrop and its later secularization
               as misanthropy as tropes that must be turned back and in on themselves to discern
               whether history is absolute negation or the site of a <em>dissensus</em> whose potential comes forth warped and convoluted by a culture that represses its
               underlying contradictions.</p>

                  <p>The year 1817 in England was a period of new dissident activity that witnessed a renewed
                     series of Gagging Acts.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Godwin began writing Mandeville in 1816 and completed the first volume in January
                              1817; he received the proofs of the second volume back on May 16th and completed the
                              novel in October 1817. The Seditious Meetings Act and the Treason Act were both passed
                              in March, 1817. These were renewals of the similarly named acts of 1795 which were
                              due to expire because of a sunset clause, and about which Godwin had written, quite
                              temperately, in “Considerations on Lord Grenville’s and Mr. Pitt’s Bills.” A Habeas
                              Corpus Suspension Act was also passed in 1817; there had been similar acts in 1798
                              and 1799.</span></div>
                     </div> In December of that year, Godwin published <em>Mandeville: A Tale of the Seventeenth Century in England</em>, a novel of stalled revolution and psychic war, the writing of which had been particularly
                     slow by his standards. The novel follows a hiatus of twelve years after the appearance
                     of his third major novel <em>Fleetwood</em> (1805), a space of withdrawal and negation—or a retreat in the sense theorized elsewhere
                     in this collection by Marc Mazur—that is by no means insignificant.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>After <em>Caleb Williams </em>(1795), Godwin had begun to write a world history in bits and pieces, which, like
                     the figure of the burrow that Deleuze and Guattari use to describe “minor literature”
                     (3), has many entrances and rules of usage that Godwin probes through Greece, Renaissance
                     Europe, seventeenth-century and Restoration England, and through genres as different
                     as biography, children’s books, actual histories, novels, and interventions in current
                     affairs such as his extension of the population debate to the global implications
                     of the Irish situation.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In a contribution to The Morning Chronicle on “Ireland” (1821), Godwin attributes
                              the burgeoning population of Ireland to poverty, and sees Britain’s miserable treatment
                              of this minor country as a global problem that could well reopen the tenuous and false
                              “peace” achieved by Britain’s victory at Waterloo (473).</span></div>
                     </div> Godwin was always interested in minor history, which, to adapt Deleuze and Guattari
                     on “minor literature,” occupies a minor position within a major culture, and therefore
                     has a “high coefficient of deterritorialization” (16). Just before <em>Mandeville</em> he had published the <em>Lives of Edward and John Philips, Nephews and Pupils of Milton</em> (1815), which sidesteps the major figure of Milton and takes up his relatively obscure
                     nephews. Through this skew, Godwin avoids being bound into any number of simplifying
                     narratives that might present Milton as a canonical or hagiographical figure, might
                     positivize the indeterminacies and disavowals in his Republicanism, or might reify
                     his disillusioned retreat from history. The seventeenth century held Godwin’s attention
                     for thirteen years, as he published the <em>Lives</em>, then <em>Mandeville, </em>and finally his <em>History of the Commonwealth of England</em> (1824–28). The period of the Civil Wars and the dissipation of their energies after
                     the Restoration thus has a unique place in Godwin’s historiography, and <em>Mandeville</em>, in dialogue with his <em>History of the Commonwealth</em>, casts the latter’s enlightenment into the black hole of a negative dialectic. Indeed
                     in oblique ways <em>Mandeville</em> is also knotted into a similar dialectic with the unprocessed and silenced revolutionary
                     energies of the 1790s. For it forms a pair with the more soberly utopian <em>History of the Commonwealth</em> that takes us back to the systole and diastole between <em>Caleb Williams</em> and the <em>Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em> (1793/1798), which Godwin still described as his “favourite work” nearly four decades
                     later (“Preface” 7).

                  <p>The novel is a historical novel about a minor Royalist, Charles Mandeville, who never
                     enters history because he never leaves the closet of his psychic history: his “eternal
                     war” on his intolerably “good” classmate Clifford (<em>Mandeville</em> 210), who marries Mandeville’s sister Henrietta. Yet Godwin resisted the suggestion
                     of his publisher, Archibald Constable, that he call <em>Mandeville</em> a “domestic story,” and instead insisted on subtitling it a “Tale of the Seventeenth
                     Century <em>in England</em>” (italics mine).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>. Godwin’s publisher Constable wanted him to remove the words “in England” and replace
                              them with “domestic story,” which he did for purposes of an Advertisement, but would
                              not do on the title-page itself. See in Garside: the letters of September 27th, 1816
                              (where Godwin is already using the final subtitle) and October 7th, 1816 (where he
                              accedes to a substitution). On April 16th, 1817, when he had either finished Vol.
                              2 or was close to doing so (he received proofs back on May 16th), Godwin strongly
                              insisted on the original title, adding, “In civility to your objection I made a verbal
                              alteratio…</span></div>
                     </div> This is to say that both the reviewers who saw the historical framework as irrelevant
                     and the imitators who reduced the novel to a domestic story missed its larger point.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>. Criticizing Godwin on numerous points of historical accuracy, The British Review
                              claims that “the historical part and the fictitious have no close connection with
                              each other” and the “historical passages appear as awkward appendages.” The reviewer
                              goes so far as to say that if the entire section on the Irish massacre were “expunged,
                              the story would lose nothing” (11–20). Even more sympathetic reviewers concentrate
                              only on Mandeville himself and not on the dialectic with the historical background.
                              The parodic “fourth” volume bound with Godwin’s novel in a British Library copy and
                              entitled Man…</span></div>
                     </div> For Godwin sees Mandeville as both an individual and a symptom, as what Foucault calls
                     “the inscribed surface of events . . . totally imprinted by history and the process
                     of history’s destruction of the body” (148). It is with this symptomology in mind
                     that Godwin says he “would rather follow [a man] into his closet” than “observe” him
                     “upon the public stage” of “Universal History” (“History and Romance” 294).</p>
               </div>
               <p><em>Mandeville</em> is set in the only period when Britain was kingless, the time that saw the beheading
                  of Charles I, the “English Revolution,” and the Protectorate—but it is book-ended
                  by two uprisings ex-centric to its setting “in England.” The first is the Ulster Rebellion
                  of 1641, where Mandeville’s parents are killed in the massacre of Protestant settlers.
                  The child is saved by his Catholic nurse, but taken from her by the severe Hilkiah
                  Bradford, chaplain of the garrison set up to protect the English “plantations” in
                  Ireland. Hilkiah tutors him in the forlorn castle of Mandeville’s uncle Audley, until
                  the Puritanical preceptor dies and the boy is sent to school at Winchester. The second
                  uprising is the rag-tag assault that Mandeville himself leads on the marriage coach
                  bearing Henrietta and Clifford. Clifford is unharmed, but Mandeville is severely disfigured.
                  The novel ends as Mandeville triumphantly contemplates his face in a mirror, on the
                  eve of a Restoration he has refused in dis-figuring the union figured in the marriage.
                  For this marriage of Henrietta, a Presbyterian brought up as an Anglican, to Clifford,
                  an Episcopalian who turns Catholic so that he can inherit from a relative, is the
                  very symbol of the settlements and expediencies of the Restoration.</p>
               <p>The novel has many resonances with Godwin’s own time. They include the return of the
                  Ulster Rebellion in the Irish Uprising of 1798, and the parallel between the 1790s
                  pamphlet wars and the schoolboy incident of the cartoons. In this incident, Mandeville
                  is falsely condemned by the staunchly Royalist prefects at Winchester when a book
                  of anti-monarchist cartoons is found in his room, and his Presbyterian origins play
                  a significant role in this judgment (158). The book had been abandoned there by his
                  friend, the cowardly Waller (also a Presbyterian), who lets Mandeville take the rap
                  for him. The judgment is its own form of gagging act, and dogs Mandeville throughout
                  his life, impeding his entrance into history. Most importantly, the similarities between
                  the time of the novel and Godwin’s own period also include the parallel politics of
                  the Restoration and Regency as simulations of settlement, and a stunning final paragraph
                  where Mandeville anachronistically compares his disfigurement by Clifford to the “brand[ing]”
                  of negro slaves (448), in a conflation of Irish and black plantations, the seventeenth
                  and nineteenth centuries.</p>
               <p>Most readers pathologize Mandeville, nor would one want to have him as a friend in
                  real life. As he says, in a typically military metaphor, “I dug a broad and a deep
                  foss, and threw up an intrenchment, to cut me off from creatures wearing the human
                  form” (171). Mandeville’s hatred of Clifford is unreasonable, almost a fetish, and
                  makes sense only insofar as Clifford is an alibi for the deconstruction of a society
                  normatively structured around virtue and cheerfulness. Henrietta, for her part, does
                  everything possible to support her brother, but from an enlightened perspective that
                  misses the trauma of this period before the Enlightenment. Indeed the “Arcadian” Henrietta
                  (240), who has been separated from her brother and sent to stay with friends of her
                  parents to shield her from the war in Ireland, is carefully set up by Godwin as an
                  Enlightenment character. Godwin has her give a long speech, part of which is drawn
                  from Shaftesbury (243), not the seventeenth-century politician who figures in the
                  narrative, but his grandson, the author of <em>Characteristics</em>; moreover, Godwin draws attention to this anachronism (310). Henrietta is watched
                  over by the Montagus, an aristocratic family who facilitate her marriage to Clifford,
                  and who did not live at their aptly named country seat of Beaulieu until the eighteenth
                  century (147n.2). And true to her Enlightenment character, when Mandeville is confined
                  in a “receptacle for lunatics” at Cowley (233), Henrietta watches over him, oblivious
                  to the “violence” and “blows” used to restrain him (234), which he describes in language
                  that recalls the traumatic scenes of his childhood in Ireland (110). These scenes,
                  which Mandeville recalls as “visionary,” in contrast to his “eventless” life in his
                  uncle’s house (109–10), testify to a certain energizing power of the negative, even
                  as abjection. For as Godwin’s contemporary Friedrich Schelling writes in his unpublished
                  <em>Ages of the World </em>(1815), if we strip the veil from what has been “covered up and from the outside has
                  adopted peaceful qualities,” “forces” are unconcealed that were previously “held down
                  by the magic of life.” These “forces appear” when “an organic being becomes sick,”
                  and are not simply diseased but mark the ferment of an “inner life that incessantly
                  gives birth to itself and again consumes itself” (20, 48).</p>
               <p>It is all too easy to identify with Henrietta and Clifford because we ought to. But
                  like all Godwin’s novels, the first-person narration induces what I have called a
                  “perverse identification” with the main character (<em>Romantic Narrative</em>, 89, 136–38), in which we must turn against our own <em>habitus</em> in ways that disclose its tropological structuring. Freud describes the transgression
                  of our own normality required for this transference, which does not work if the character
                  is too removed from normality. To shake up an initial repression in the reader, Freud
                  says, we must “follow the development of the illness along with the sufferer” (308–10).
                  Hence Godwin builds a powerful case for Mandeville’s growing paranoia, which includes
                  the Irish massacre, the cartoon episode, and the Royalist Penruddock insurgency against
                  Cromwell where Mandeville wants to show his loyalty to the King but Clifford is preferred
                  for the secretaryship because of the cartoon incident and Mandeville’s Presbyterian
                  family. The case for Mandeville also includes the abuse consequently heaped on him
                  at Oxford by his friend Lisle who sees him as a turncoat. As a result Mandeville has
                  a psychotic break that leads to his confinement at Cowley. Henrietta’s tender care
                  may beguile us into seeing this madhouse in terms of the later “humane psychiatry”
                  associated with Philippe Pinel and the York Retreat. However, this is less a reality
                  in the time of the Great Confinement than a way of unsettling our own enlightenment,
                  by disclosing the “world of terrors” that a “benevolent hand seems to cover up from
                  us,” as Schelling writes (49). And finally, because Mandeville is deemed insane, his
                  former schoolmate Mallison and Mallison’s uncle, the lawyer Holloway, worm their way
                  into the dying Audley’s affections and almost cheat Mandeville of his inheritance.</p>
               <p>At the same time, underlaid in Mandeville’s narration is a later voice that comments
                  on religio-political history, women’s exclusion from education, and, untypically for
                  a Royalist, Cromwell’s achievements (153–54, 192). The interweaving of these voices
                  means that the narrative is not so much told as <em>received</em> in the first person, such that we may not literally identify with Mandeville, but
                  have a responsibility to hear him. For as Schelling puts it, “humans show a natural
                  predilection for the affirmative,” for what is outgoing and “self-giving” like Clifford,
                  “just as much as they turn away from the negative,” from what is “inhibiting” and
                  “conflicting, . . . that which, so to speak, should not be and yet is, nay, must be. . .
                  . [this] No that resists the Yes, this darkening that resists the light, this obliquity
                  that resists the straight, this left that resists the right, and however else one
                  has attempted to express this eternal antithesis in images” (6).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>From this perspective, Mandeville’s “causeless aversion” (Lockhart 271) for Clifford
                     is the site of the novel’s political unconscious,
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                              word occurs seventeen times in the novel, most of them significant (e.g. 60, 107,
                              109, 116, 129, 132, 216, 248, 297, 365, 369, 389, 406).</span></div>
                     </div> an alibi for the deconstruction of a damaged society that Godwin conducts through
                     Mandeville. For as Theodor Adorno argues, if a “psycho-analysis” of our culture were
                     possible, it would “show the sickness” of our time “to consist in normality.” The
                     “achievements demanded” of someone “healthy in body and mind,” someone cheerful and
                     able to adapt to the inevitable, are “performed only at the cost of the profoundest
                     mutilation” (Adorno 58–59). Through Mandeville’s damaged life, we are forced to know
                     what the “goodness” of Clifford and Henrietta excludes, the supreme condescension
                     even of its attempts to be understanding, and its violence as a form of normalization.
                     Or as Schelling puts it, “Conceptually, that which has being is always that in which
                     the affirming principle is active and outwardly manifest.” But “it does not always
                     follow that what has being in accord with” the normativity of “the concept . . . really
                     has being.” For “level-headedness, and organization” can “just as well” be seen as
                     that which “does not have being,” since “the affirming principle . . . has being . . .
                     only by repressing the negating force in itself” (Schelling 15, 18).</p>
               </div>
               <p>In what follows I approach the right of the negative through Mandeville’s Presbyterian
                  affiliation as the cipher of a position, and then through the fanaticism that traverses
                  the period as the vehicle for a <em>dissensus</em> that resurfaces in his misanthropy, the tropological structure of which is crystallized
                  in the last chapter as a deliberate staging of trope and dis-figuration. In the sectarian
                  geography of a period in which political government was being renegotiated through
                  church government, there were three broad divisions. The Episcopalians placed bishops
                  under the Archbishop, analogically guaranteeing monarchy. The Congregationalists gave
                  each congregation the right to run its affairs, providing a basis for the “right of
                  private judgment” that Godwin theorized as a form of rational dissent in his <em>Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em> (1: 170), but also a basis for various fanaticisms. The Presbyterians were in between,
                  devolving authority to elders or presbyters, but not to individual congregations.
                  The religious and political did not always synchronize, and their shifting, approximate,
                  or expedient alignments are too complex to describe here. But they combined and decombined
                  in ways which, though confusing, created a margin of error that both stalled history
                  and drove it forward.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Mandeville’s place in this religio-political web is complex and registers what is
                     shut out from normalizing histories, whether they are Tory, Whig, or radical. Mandeville
                     comes from an unaligned Presbyterian family, but in a perverse contortion of himself
                     he becomes more staunchly Royalist after the cartoon episode. Unlike the religious
                     Presbyterians in Scotland, the parliamentary Presbyterians in England followed what
                     Godwin in the novel calls “a middle and temperate course” (157). At first their structures
                     of church government made them question absolute monarchy. But they grew alarmed at
                     the mix of radical democracy and religious sub-sects they had unleashed, and regrouped
                     behind the King. While one could thus see the Presbyterians as precursors of the constitutional
                     monarchy that simulated democracy after the Glorious Revolution, Godwin also saw them
                     as progressive. That Mandeville is a Royalist but a Presbyterian is thus significant.
                     On the one hand, against the grain of his own sympathies, Godwin writes a story with
                     no Republican characters, a one-sidedness that gives the novel its claustrophobic
                     shape. Is this because a Republican history, such as Godwin’s own <em>History of the Commonwealth</em>, is itself flawed in ways that can only be felt within what he calls an “individual”
                     history, as opposed to a “general” history that glosses over particularities by focusing
                     on recurrent patterns that are inevitably normative?

                              an individual history that follows a man “into his closet” from a general history
                              that looks for universal patterns and is therefore a form of what he would call “institution.”
                              Individual history is a source of transformative, or in the case of Mandeville, traumatic
                              particulars with which the reader interacts as in a magnetic field of (dis)affinities
                              (291–94).</span></div>
                     </div> After all, the interregnum saw the continuation of colonialism in Ireland and Barbados,
                     while Parliament did more to oppress the Irish than did the King. So in the negative
                     dialectic that forms his sense of history, which is always other to itself, Godwin
                     can only (dis)figure his opposition to things as they are in the “damaged life” of
                     someone from the other side. On the other hand, Mandeville is a Presbyterian Royalist,
                     and proudly notes that the Presbyterians were “the original stirrers of the war between
                     the king and the parliament” (156). This odd comment, coming from a Royalist, registers
                     his difference from the Episcopalian Royalism of Clifford, aligning Mandeville with
                     what he opposes, creating a space for what has not yet come to consciousness.</p>
               </div>
               <p>By a similar troping or twisting, Mandeville is also subtextually aligned with Ireland.
                  In a lurid figure he describes the “inter-destructiveness” that binds him and Clifford
                  as conjoined twins: <span class="quote">‘Mezentius, the famous tyrant of antiquity, tied a living body to a dead one, and
                     caused the one to take in, and gradually become a partner of, the putrescence of the
                     other. I have read of twin children, whose bodies were so united in their birth, that
                     they could never after be separated, while one carried with him, wherever he went,
                     an intolerable load, and of whom, when one died, it involved the necessary destruction
                     of the other. (230)’</span> Much earlier, in 1786, in his letter “To the People of Ireland” urging them not to
                  be seduced by economic arguments into a union with England, Godwin had used the same
                  image: <span class="quote">‘few objects [are] more calamitous or more unnatural, than the union of two countries
                     circumstanced as I have described. It is like that refined piece of cruelty, scarcely
                     to be named by the tongue . . . of tying a living body [Ireland] to a dead one [England],
                     and causing them to putrify and perish together. (301)’</span> The repetition of this image subtextually aligns Mandeville, as a living body, with
                  Ireland as a victim of oppression, an alignment again hinted at in the novel’s last
                  paragraph, where Clifford’s wounding of Mandeville is compared to the branding of
                  negro slaves by “tyrannical planters” (448), in a reference back to the plantations
                  in Ireland with which the novel begins. <em>Prima facie</em> Mandeville should have no sympathy with the country where his parents were massacred.
                  And yet in a perverse twisting of his psyche, he identifies with the victims of the
                  English planters whom his father’s garrison was supposed to protect. In the circumstances
                  it is not unreasonable to see in the struggle of Mandeville against Clifford a displaced
                  version of what Godwin describes as the “grand contest” that animated the Stuart period
                  (“History and Romance” 297): that of Parliament and King, or of the anonymous against
                  those born to the royal manner and “brought up in reverential ideas of kingship and
                  prerogative,” like Clifford (<em>Mandeville</em> 173). Hence the paradox that Mandeville finds the “visionary scenes” of “flight”
                  and “murder” that followed the Ulster Rebellion more exhilarating than his “monotonous”
                  and “eventless” life in his uncle’s house (109–10), as he finds the hiding-places
                  of power in half-memories of his infancy in Ireland: the place of his psychic birth
                  as a subject of injustice, a body in bits and pieces, like the body politic of Britain
                  itself.</p>
               <p>This hermeneutic skew whereby the positive is inverted into the negative also helps
                  explain the role of fanaticism in the novel. In his early essay “Of History and Romance”
                  (1797), written for a second edition of <em>The Enquirer</em> but not published, Godwin singles out the period of the Stuarts “as the only portion
                  of our history interesting to the heart of man.” He dismisses the “servile courtiers”
                  of the preceding Elizabethan period, and the triviality of history after 1688: “From
                  the moment that the grand contest excited under the Stuarts was quieted by the [Glorious]
                  Revolution, our history assumes its most insipid and insufferable form. It is the
                  history of negotiations and tricks.” But he sees the potential of the Stuart period
                  for generating a “history of genuine, independent man” as “obscured by the vile jargon
                  of fanaticism” (296–97). Yet in the novel, fanaticism is more complex: an environment
                  for the energies unleashed by the English Revolution that Christopher Hill describes
                  as “a third culture” which exceeds the struggle of King and parliament. This “popular,
                  heretical culture” emphasized the Bible as “interpreted by individual conscience,”
                  but its views came “jumbled up with magical and prophetical ideas” (69–79). The novel
                  is peppered with these sects mentioned by Hilkiah or Mandeville himself, not all of
                  which are fundamentalist. For they include fanatical and apocalyptic sects like the
                  Fifth Monarchists, who existed only from 1649–61, who were obsessed with the apocalyptic
                  number 666 as a year close at hand, and who took their name from a prophecy in the
                  Book of Daniel that four monarchies would precede the fifth monarchy or new spiritual
                  kingdom of Christ. But the sects mentioned in <em>Mandeville</em> also include enthusiasts such as the Quakers and the Diggers or “True Levellers,”
                  radical democrats some of whose ideas lie at the origins of Godwin’s own Rational
                  Dissent and his views on property. Such sects are absent from the more rational <em>History of the Commonwealth</em>, as is the broader environment of Catholic-Protestant fanaticism introduced into
                  the novel at the very beginning by the Irish massacre. The suppression of these sects
                  after the Restoration, and particularly the Glorious Revolution, is one reason why
                  subsequent British history is “insipid” (Godwin, “History and Romance” 297), as Lee
                  Morrissey recognizes in opposing a seventeenth-century public sphere of <em>dissensus</em> to the Habermasian consensual public sphere of the next century (1–53).</p>
               <p>As a channel for this third culture, and the very embodiment of fanaticism, Hilkiah
                  injects a dark urgency into the novel. Hilkiah is the animus and animating principle
                  that separates Mandeville’s non-conformity from that of Audley, who stands beyond
                  his nephew as a “celestial spirit” (304), but sinks “without power of resistance”
                  under “any hostility” (87). Yet Hilkiah’s bigotry indicates how the legacy of <em>dissensus</em> comes forth warped and convoluted by what that has not yet been set right in a culture
                  that represses its underlying contradictions. Hilkiah’s influence works itself “deeply
                  into the substance” of Mandeville’s character (123), in the misanthropy that structures
                  his psyche as the negative of itself. Yet Mandeville is not positively attached to
                  Hilkiah and indeed feels a “rooted aversion of heart” from his preceptor (129). Though
                  he speaks Hilkiah’s Biblical and stilted language, he has no stake in the religious
                  controversies of the time. Hence fanaticism is secularized and troped into misanthropy,
                  as Mandeville lives on into the Restoration, though obscurely, as the figure for “something
                  not yet made good that pushes its essence forward” in the trauma of the seventeenth
                  century.</p>

                  <p>The phrase is used by Habermas in an unusual essay in which he links Ernst Bloch to

                     (6)—or the “matter” that stalls “history”—to a “utopian treatment.” (Habermas, “Ernst

                              was on Schelling. Referring to Schelling’s philosophy of nature and Ages of the World,
                              Habermas’ comments on Bloch and Schelling in this essay and in another essay on “The
                              German Idealism of the Jewish Philosophers” (cf. 39–40) are brief and evocative rather
                              than documentary in bringing Schelling into a tradition of Marxist negative dialectics,
                              in which we might be more used to seeing Hegel. For a “Schellingian” reading of Mandeville
                              see my article, “The Disfiguration of Enlightenment” (175, 182–87).</span></div>
                     </div> What Bloch finds in Schelling’s rotary movement between the affirmative and negative
                     drives is a “primordial hunger” in which the “knot of the world presses toward resolution,”
                     making the negative “the elemental energy of hope” (Habermas, “Ernst Bloch” 63, 69–71).
                     Fanaticism is this dark knot, which Alberto Toscano has recently analyzed as more
                     than simply “the encroachment of religion into a supposedly secularized public sphere.”
                     What separates the fanatic from a madman in his refusal to compromise is the “universality”
                     at which he aims (Toscano xi–xii). Interestingly Toscano reads fanaticism through
                     Bloch’s principle of synchronicity and non-synchronicity, in which Bloch, writing
                     during the Nazi period, tries to “forge a theory of fascism that would . . . confront
                     head-on the affective purchase of distinctly millenarian ideas” that were a “perversion
                     of the anti-clerical and egalitarian heresies which find their source” in the twelfth
                     century (52–53). For Bloch, who does not believe that the “archaic” will be subsumed
                     by “progress,” there is always a non-synchronicity between the present and “the incomplete
                     pasts that teem in its interstices” (Toscano 53–55). Hill’s third culture is precisely
                     a collection of such “modes of organization and belief” which are “out of joint with
                     a politically and economically defined (and enforced) present” (Toscano 52). This
                     anachronism is throughout the novel, and penetrates Mandeville’s Latinate and Biblical
                     diction, not to mention the non-synchronicity of Godwin’s writing a novel about the
                     seventeenth century in the nineteenth century, and our reading of the novel in the

                  <p>To be sure, Godwin is not a fanatic: hence his decision to respond moderately to the
                     Gagging Acts in his “Considerations on Lord Grenville’s and Mr. Pitt’s Bills,” a decision
                     that offended his more radical colleague, John Thelwall. But in the years between
                     the 1790s and 1817 something had changed, and in writing a novel that allows us to
                     trace the misanthropy that so fascinated him back to fanaticism, Godwin probes the
                     question raised by Toscano, as to whether there can be a “history” without fanaticism
                     (xxiii). The next text in the historical series that Godwin wrote out of sequence
                     is his <em>Lives of Edward and John Philips</em>, set partly in the Restoration, and the further ones are <em>Caleb Williams</em> and <em>Fleetwood</em>.

                     </div> The misanthropy probed in these novels is more brooding and inward-directed than the
                     “hatred” which Mandeville, who also describes himself as a misanthrope, calls his
                     “ruling passion” (305, 343). We can approach misanthropy through what Hegel, drawing
                     on the physiology of his time but giving it a more psychological coloring, calls “irritability.”
                     Irritability is a “reaction of self-maintenance” against the other “with which it
                     is in relation” (Hegel 358–59), a dis-ease in which the self is “restricted to itself”
                     as “the negative of itself” (Hegel 438), such that the “negative thing is the structure
                     itself” (Hegel 429). But whereas Hegelian negativity has a certain propulsive force,
                     which also drives fanaticism, the negativity of <em>Fleetwood</em>, as irritability, remains unfocused, more at the level of drive than desire.</p>
               </div>
               <p><em>Fleetwood</em> is subtitled “the new man of feeling” in an allusion to the novel of sensibility.
                  In the etiology of a damaged society traced through Godwin’s novels, misanthropy as
                  irritability is thus more (re)active than sensibility, but is nevertheless a domestication
                  of fanaticism. This is to say that in retrospect we can read <em>Fleetwood</em>’s status as a “domestic story” symptomatically. After the Restoration and the Enlightenment,
                  as we see in the de-generation of Milton through his nephews, the “civic apathy and
                  depoliticization” characteristic of an age of commerce (Toscano 23) are the order
                  of the day. Audley’s “apathy and neutrality” (<em>Mandeville</em> 236), which are not indifference but the radical passivity of pure retreat, make
                  him transcendentally “unequal to contention” (87). But <em>Fleetwood</em>’s misanthropy is a purely private trope for the <em>dissensus</em> that showed itself more openly during the <span class="foreign">interregnum</span>, and that dissipates itself in <span class="foreign">ennui</span> after the Enlightenment. “Born from a prior failure” (Toscano xxiv), fanaticism,
                  of course, is also deeply tropological, doubly negative: a negation of what it hates
                  and a negation of itself. And yet it is invested in history, which misanthropy is
                  not.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><em>Mandeville</em> ends shockingly with the hero looking at his disfigured face in a glass darkly. Though
                     he may be fifty-two when he writes his story,
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">

                              (1690) to Leveson Gower (228), he must be at least fifty two at the time he writes
                              his memoir.</span></div>
                     </div> he breaks it off when he is just short of twenty-one. Some readers find this ending
                     difficult to absorb, speculating that Godwin meant to continue the novel. Yet despite
                     casual remarks about doing so and about ending with the Titus Oates conspiracy when
                     Mandeville would have been thirty-nine, in his correspondence with Constable Godwin
                     speaks only of three volumes (71), following the three-act structure of a play. One
                     can also see the end as premature because of two references to writing from a wiser
                     perspective (191, 220). But these are in Volume 2, and in a period before the use
                     of the speed-press, authors handed over their work in parts rather than as a completed
                     manuscript to which we can attribute “final authorial intention”—a practice with which
                     Godwin expressed repeated discomfort, as he emphasized that he was constantly revising,
                     did not want to surrender the manuscript in parts, and was anxious at having a printer
                     at the distance of Edinburgh.

                     </div> The passages in question, like the concession to having Constable advertise the novel
                     as a domestic story (see note 3), may be holdovers from an earlier stage of conception
                     or genuflections to taste. By the eighteenth century, “taste” and “aesthetics” had
                     become powerful tools for closing down an earlier public sphere that was characterized
                     by <em>dissensus</em>. Indeed, Godwin is interested in the seventeenth century “in England” precisely because
                     it was a more open, violent and contentious time, and the schoolboy episode of the
                     cartoons refers in miniature to the pamphlet wars of the seventeenth century, which
                     once again threatened to crack open the immunitary mechanisms of the public sphere
                     in the 1790s. Correspondingly, there is scant evidence in <em>Mandeville</em> of any mandatory maturity, and the novel actively resists the institution of taste.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I therefore suggest a different hypothesis: that Godwin meant to conclude with Volume
                     3, but hit on the mirror stage as the most effective finale only at the end. From
                     his correspondence and diary, it seems that he started revising the last volume, briefly
                     interrupted his revisions on the death of his friend, the Irish patriot John Philpot
                     Curran, to whom he dedicates the novel, but then also stopped for three days to write
                     six more pages, before he returned to revising the whole.

                     </div> Much like what happened with <em>Caleb Williams</em>, we can thus see Godwin as having written two endings, first finishing with Chapter
                     XVI, and then adding what is now the last chapter. These “endings” could not be more
                     different.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Chapter XVI ends bitterly, “Aye; my story is arrived at a festival” (441). Had the
                  text concluded with this hysterical rant on Henrietta’s betrayal, it would be worthy
                  of the anonymous parody which is bound with <em>Mandeville</em> in the British Library copy, and which was written as a fourth volume and subtitled
                  “last words of a maniac!” But the further chapter adds two things: the assault on
                  the marriage coach which replaces the Oates conspiracy, and the shift from Henrietta
                  to Mandeville himself, whose tone is now tightly controlled. Unlike Chapter XVI, which
                  brings Mandeville’s psychic disintegration to a head, in this ending he gathers himself
                  together as a subject. But this is a subject who survives as bare life, one who has
                  exchanged his position as the son of parents allied with the planters in Ireland for
                  that of a negro slave in a later plantation, and whose very facelessness is the face
                  of anonymous history: <span class="quote">‘I had received a deep and perilous gash, the broad brand of which I shall not fail
                     to carry with me to my grave. The sight of my left eye is gone; the cheek beneath
                     is severed, with a deep trench between. My wound is of that sort, which in the French
                     civil wars got the name of <em>une balafre</em>. I have pleased myself, in the fury and bitterness of my soul, with tracing the whole
                     force of that word. It is <em>cicatrix luculenta</em>, a glazed or shining scar, like the effect of a streak of varnish upon a picture.
                     <em>Balafre</em> I find explained by Girolamo Vittori, by the Italian word <span class="foreign">smorfiato</span>; and this again—I mean the noun <span class="foreign">smorfia</span>—is decided by “the resolute” John Florio to signify . . . a mocking or push with
                     one’s mouth. The explanation of these lexicographers is happily suited to my case,
                     and the mark I for ever carry about with me. The reader may recollect the descriptions
                     I have occasionally been obliged to give, of the beauty of my person and countenance. . .
                     . When I first looked in my glass, and saw my face, once more stripped of its tedious
                     dressings, I thought I never saw anything so monstrous. . . . The sword of my enemy
                     had given a perpetual grimace, a sort of preternatural and unvarying distorted smile,
                     or deadly grin, to my countenance. . . . Every time my eye accidentally caught my
                     mirror, I saw Clifford, and the cruel heart of Clifford, branded into me. My situation
                     was not like what it had hitherto been. Before, to think of Clifford was an act of
                     the mind . . . now I bore Clifford and his injuries perpetually about with me. Even
                     as certain tyrannical planters in the West Indies have set a brand with a red hot
                     iron upon the negroes they have purchased, to denote that they are irremediably a
                     property, so Clifford had set his mark upon me, as a token that I was his for ever.
                     (447–48)’</span> The identity Mandeville claims here is defiantly traumatic, stubbornly attached to
                  the imprints of his subjection, as the imprints of multiple texts on a body which
                  he bequeaths to his reader as, precisely, a text. Yet the tone is also triumphant,
                  because master and slave, Clifford and Mandeville, are finally equals. Now Clifford
                  is indeed tied to Mandeville, as the dead body of England to a living body. Or perhaps
                  we should not describe it as a living body but as one that lives on, in Derrida’s
                  particular sense of <span class="foreign">sur-vivre</span> as “non-closure,” and “the endurance of that which cannot exist” (Guyer 251–52).
                  Because Clifford has hurt Mandeville, he is at last guilty; the figure of the “good”
                  has been ruined, disfigured.</p>
               <p>One commentator, responding in <em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</em> to the more sympathetic review by John Gibson Lockhart, and noting the novel’s excessively
                  metaphoric style, criticized this passage for its “<em>surgically</em> technical” language (405–08). But its pedantry is the very cicatrix of which it speaks,
                  a tightening and drying of the skin over a wound. If metaphor, as Ortega y Gasset
                  says, “substitutes one thing for another—from an urge not so much to get at the first
                  as to get rid of the second” (31), the cicatrix as the scar of this euphemism, this
                  turning away, is the laying bare of the substitutions that inform even the barest
                  facts and the wounds they cover over. It is a laying bare that is in turn its own
                  form of covering and shelter.</p>
               <p>The tone of this passage is at once masochistic and exhilarating. We cannot just dismiss
                  Mandeville as disturbed because we find the scene disturbing. Like trope itself as
                  a turning, like the twisting of perverse identification, the passage must be turned
                  back on itself. It must be read and re-read not just for Mandeville’s resistances
                  but for our own resistances to what does not agree with traditional criteria of “beauty”
                  that lead us to turn away from a face that is too hard to face. For in its reference
                  to criteria of beauty, the scene holds the mirror up to aesthetics as the art of thinking
                  beautifully (Baumgarten 533), and also to the making of figures and the evasions of
                  reading that make literature conform to taste instead of being the place of the “absolute
                  secret” (Derrida 28–29). In fact, Mandeville only speaks once of the comely figure
                  he once cut, and this is in connection with the uncommon beauty of <em>his horse</em> (344). It is, rather, the vocabulary of disease and wounds that has been throughout
                  the text, but “secret” psychic wounds (209, 231, 251, 317, 331, 336, 365). Now, however,
                  the wound is finally external, allowing him to speak as a survivor of war, so that
                  Godwin can remove the “tedious bandages” from myths of Restoration and settlement.
                  Yet if we now see the unvarnished truth behind the symbolic veneer, even that truth
                  can be grasped only tropologically through lexicographers, as the passage foregrounds
                  the substitutions of language, turning from French to Latin to Italian, as if to emphasize
                  something esoteric, something that remains withheld, a dark energy that has yet to
                  be deciphered.</p>
               <p>The metapsychology of the novel’s doubly retreating negativity is well described by
                  Schelling, who never published the <em>Ages</em>, and may never have emerged from grappling with its negativity. Schelling tries to
                  redeem the negative in terms of the “inverted position” of “life forces” (18). Referring
                  to the two potencies which he had initially described as the affirming or “outpouring”
                  force and the “force of selfhood, of retreat into self” (6), Schelling writes of their
                  interimplication: “What in the preceding potency was the exterior, contracting, and
                  negating, is itself, in the successive potency, the inner, contracted, and self-negated.
                  And conversely, what was there inhibited, is what is here free” (18).</p>
               <p>The thrust of this passage is a theory of “involution” (Schelling 83), wherein the
                  two forces, similar to <span class="foreign">eros</span> and <span class="foreign">thanatos</span>, are both “far from each other and infinitely near. Far, because what is affirmed
                  and manifest in one of them, is posited in the other as negated and in the dark. Near,
                  because it only requires an inversion, a turning out of what was concealed . . . to
                  transpose, and so to speak, transform, the one into the other” (18). The “turning
                  out” of each into the other and the syntactic balance of this phrasing imply a coming
                  together of opposites, and this inversion/conversion are what permit us to find in
                  Schelling a certain utopianism, as Bloch also did. In the longer view allowed by Godwin’s
                  history in bits and pieces, it is not wrong to see in <em>Mandeville</em> as well this utopianism of something “not yet made good that pushes its essence forward.”
                  But unlike Shelley’s hope in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, which “creates / From its own wreck the thing it contemplates” (4: 573–74), it is
                  far from clear in <em>Mandeville</em> what we hope <em>for</em>. Similarly in the passage from Schelling, there is really no positive; there is the
                  mere trace of a promise in the phrase “it only requires.” The first “potency” exists
                  only as “contracting and negating,” as, for example, in the “intrenchment” by which
                  Mandeville cuts himself off from the human race (Godwin, <em>Mandeville</em> 171), while in the sequel it is “contracted and <em>self-negated</em>” rather than “<em>negating</em>” (emphases mine). What can be the difference between these negations except that
                  by virtue of turning in on itself to negate itself, as in Mandeville’s exhilaration
                  over his defacement, what has been restrained is now “free” and is no longer “exterior”
                  to itself, so that what was “negated and in the dark” has become “manifest” (Schelling
                  18).</p>
               <p>The story, as we have said, ends when Mandeville is just short of the age of majority,
                  and this is because Godwin cannot see his way to the narrative of historical maturation
                  told by Burke and Scott in which Britain, unlike France, went through its revolution
                  and regicide before the Enlightenment. It is because the period before the Glorious
                  Revolution remains, even now, in the moment of our reading, an open wound like the
                  “perilous gash” across Mandeville’s face. But after this turning out of what was concealed,
                  the figure or “mark” that Mandeville makes (447) again retreats, as he lives on anonymously,
                  for some thirty years, into the Restoration. And yet even as he remains “in the dark”
                  and “self-negated” the concluding reference to slavery also brings the novel full
                  circle into the present. Returning to the plantations in Ireland with which the novel
                  began, it links them to the racism and imperialism of Godwin’s own time in a circle
                  of political injustice. This circle enfolds Mandeville’s personal wounds in a complex
                  tropology with secret recesses, in which Mandeville must invert himself into the victim
                  of the “tyrannical planters” with whom his family was aligned, exposing the self-confuting
                  logic of a “United Kingdom” of Great Britain and projecting a damaged self that exists
                  only as its negation, like a negative that remains to be developed.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Godwin began writing <em>Mandeville</em> in 1816 and completed the first volume in January 1817; he received the proofs of
               the second volume back on May 16th and completed the novel in October 1817. The Seditious
               Meetings Act and the Treason Act were both passed in March, 1817. These were renewals
               of the similarly named acts of 1795 which were due to expire because of a sunset clause,
               and about which Godwin had written, quite temperately, in “Considerations on Lord
               Grenville’s and Mr. Pitt’s Bills.” A <em>Habeas Corpus</em> Suspension Act was also passed in 1817; there had been similar acts in 1798 and 1799.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">In a contribution to <em>The Morning Chronicle</em> on “Ireland” (1821), Godwin attributes the burgeoning population of Ireland to poverty,
               and sees Britain’s miserable treatment of this minor country as a global problem that
               could well reopen the tenuous and false “peace” achieved by Britain’s victory at Waterloo
               (473).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">For further discussion of the significance of the hiatus between <em>Fleetwood</em> and <em>Mandeville</em>, see my “Introduction” to <em>Mandeville</em> (11–18). For further discussion of how Godwin was writing a more global history in
               bits and pieces, see my article “Between Individual and General History” (115–19).
               The present article draws on both of the above. I am grateful to Broadview Press and
               <em>Nineteenth-Century Prose</em> for allowing me to do so.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">. Godwin’s publisher Constable wanted him to remove the words “in England” and replace
               them with “domestic story,” which he did for purposes of an Advertisement, but would
               not do on the title-page itself. See in Garside: the letters of September 27th, 1816
               (where Godwin is already using the final subtitle) and October 7th, 1816 (where he
               accedes to a substitution). On April 16th, 1817, when he had either finished Vol.
               2 or was close to doing so (he received proofs back on May 16th), Godwin strongly
               insisted on the original title, adding, “In civility to your objection I made a verbal
               alteration in this phrase; but I am grown less modest and pliant now . . . and I request
               that the first and more significant title may be restored” (Constable 88).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">. Criticizing Godwin on numerous points of historical accuracy, <em>The British Review</em> claims that “the historical part and the fictitious have no close connection with
               each other” and the “historical passages appear as awkward appendages.” The reviewer
               goes so far as to say that if the entire section on the Irish massacre were “expunged,
               the story would lose nothing” (11–20). Even more sympathetic reviewers concentrate
               only on Mandeville himself and not on the dialectic with the historical background.
               The parodic “fourth” volume bound with Godwin’s novel in a British Library copy and
               entitled <em>Mandeville: Last Words of a Maniac!</em> also dehistoricizes the text. Finally, “Miserrimus,” printed privately by Frederick
               Reynolds, an admirer of Godwin and editor of <em>The Keepsake</em>, has many parallels to Godwin’s novel, and also reduces the story to a love triangle.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">. Aversion, as turning away, is itself a form of emotional trope. Interestingly the
               word occurs seventeen times in the novel, most of them significant (e.g. 60, 107,
               109, 116, 129, 132, 216, 248, 297, 365, 369, 389, 406).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">These are terms Godwin uses in his essay “Of History and Romance,” to distinguish
               an individual history that follows a man “into his closet” from a general history
               that looks for universal patterns and is therefore a form of what he would call “institution.”
               Individual history is a source of transformative, or in the case of <em>Mandeville,</em> traumatic particulars with which the reader interacts as in a magnetic field of (dis)affinities
               (291–94).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Although Habermas’ work subsequently went in a very different direction, his dissertation
               was on Schelling. Referring to Schelling’s philosophy of nature and <em>Ages of the World,</em> Habermas’ comments on Bloch and Schelling in this essay and in another essay on “The
               German Idealism of the Jewish Philosophers” (cf. 39–40) are brief and evocative rather
               than documentary in bringing Schelling into a tradition of Marxist negative dialectics,
               in which we might be more used to seeing Hegel. For a “Schellingian” reading of <em>Mandeville</em> see my article, “The Disfiguration of Enlightenment” (175, 182–87).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Edward Philips lived from 1630 to circa 1696, and John lived from 1631–1706. The nephews’
               lives span the seventeenth century but John, in particular, is a Restoration character.
               On the <em>Lives</em>, see my essay “Uncertain Futures.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Since Mandeville, who is born in 1638, refers to Dryden’s dedication of his play <em>Amphitryon</em> (1690) to Leveson Gower (228), he must be at least fifty two at the time he writes
               his memoir.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">. See Letter of February 3rd, 1817 (Garside), and also Constable (72, 80–82, 85).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
