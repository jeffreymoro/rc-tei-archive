                <p rend="noCount">This collection thinks the “rights” of the negative against the
                    more common association of the term “rights” with human rights and rights that
                    can be posited. Such rights, despite their seeming liberalism, produce a
                    normative notion of the person which is in the end biopolitical, and moreover,
                    in assuming that rights can always be posited, they assume the primacy of the
                    public sphere. The essays in this collection all resist the current emphasis on
                    the public sphere that has resulted from the absorption of “Romanticism” into
                    the “Nineteenth Century,” and focus instead on Romanticism as a retreat from
                    publication, publicity and consensus. Whether this retreat is absolute negation
                    or a withdrawal that holds something in reserve is a question left open in the
                    spaces between these six essays on Godwin, Charlotte Smith, Coleridge and Goya.

                <div type="section">
                <p> The impetus for this collection of essays came from a recent conference of the
                    North American Society for the Study of Romanticism on “Romanticism and Rights”
                    that, in evoking discourses of natural and human rights, also raised the
                    question of the right to, or of, the negative. As Jean-Luc Nancy admits, in
                    critiquing rights which have “pragmatic definitions,” the “suppression or
                    suspension” of such rights “opens directly onto the intolerable” (2). But as
                    Lyotard suggests, rights are no simple matter: there are “wrongs” which cannot
                    be remedied through “rights” because they cannot be phrased in a “language
                    common to .&#160;.&#160;. the other party” (28). Lyotard is more broadly
                    concerned with a <emph>differend</emph> that eludes capture in discourse and
                    that will always persist even if a new discourse and the right to it are
                    established. Since the utopianism of human rights discourse is only one aspect
                    of a larger foreclosure, the bigger question here is of what is left out by the
                    emphasis on the public (or even counter-public) sphere that has come to dominate
                    much writing on Romanticism, and for which rights—juridical or otherwise—are
                    only a metonym. Within a discourse that assumes the sufficiency of the public
                    sphere, there are things that cannot be said or done, because a discourse for
                    them does not, or does not yet, or may not ever exist; there are things that
                    cannot be published, to give an example used by Lyotard (4), which is pertinent
                    to this collection.</p>
                <p> It is this question of what is foreclosed by the social that has led the
                    biopolitical philosopher Roberto Esposito to argue in <title level="m">Third
                        Person</title> that human rights include only by exclusion, and that this
                    aporia is “the line that passes .&#160;.&#160;. between rights and the human
                    condition, and in the process rips them apart” (68–69). By this Esposito means,
                    following Hannah Arendt, that “the law allows entrance only to those who fall
                    into some category—citizens, subjects, even slaves—hence, insofar as they fall
                    into a political community” (69–70). Thus it is not so much that rights exclude
                    certain people (who can always be included in a new category),<note place="foot"
                        >This is the point made by Luhmann, who sees the public sphere as
                        sufficiently open to accommodate continuous “structural transformation”
                        through an expansion of communicative rationality in which even “improbable
                        communications” of the most “personalized” nature develop a “code” that
                        allows them to become part of the system, as the very existence of a
                        “threshold of improbability” expands the “number of communicable topics”
                        (8–9, 18–20). There is thus no need for anything outside discourse, which
                        also means that what is not yet part of discourse is “understood and
                        practised” not at a “<emph>thematic level</emph>” but at the level of its
                            “<emph>codification</emph>” (20-1).</note> as that this very inclusion
                    excludes a <emph>differend</emph> concealed in these individuals: for instance
                    Caleb Williams in Adam Sneed’s essay, who is never quite inside the category he
                    fills, that of the person who seeks truth and justice. At the heart of this
                    aporia that traverses the notion of rights, according to Esposito, is the
                    distortion imposed by the term “person,” introduced to bridge the gap between
                    “the concept of human being and that of citizen” (3). In the discourse of rights
                    only a life “that can provide the credentials of personhood” is “qualitatively
                    significant” (2). With the delimitation of human being in terms of personhood,
                    and with the definition of a person as the condition of possibility for a
                    citizen, or in Giorgio Agamben’s terminology, with the absorption of
                        <emph>zoe</emph> into <emph>bios,</emph> comes a set of normalizing values
                    that enfranchise not just some forms of psychological life but also certain
                    modes of thinking at the cost of others.</p>
                <p> The essays in this collection are not necessarily concerned with rights in a
                    juridical sense, though not surprisingly the issue does come up in the two
                    pieces on Godwin. Indeed, the right of the negative inevitably entails a use of
                    that word that is more metaphoric and elusive than any positive right. We speak
                    here of the “right” of the negative because the plural might imply a range of
                    rights that can be specified, but it is also necessary to think in terms of
                    “rights” because the effects of this right, and indeed what an effect is, are
                    far from clear. And we speak of a right “of” rather than “to” the negative
                    because the right not to be or do something, as in civil disobedience, risks
                    being a determinate negation that is simply an antithetical form of positivity.
                    These essays, by contrast, explore a certain insistence of the negative that
                    cannot always be encompassed in the right not to do or be something: an
                    insistence that traverses a subject such as Christabel without exactly being
                    something that she “has” or of which she, or even Coleridge, is fully conscious.
                    Christabel’s odd passivity, explored in Marc Mazur’s essay, makes her no more
                    than a channel for a negativity that cannot be easily located. But we must also
                    speak of a right “to” the negative, as a way of conveying the force that the
                    negative can have, for instance in my own essay on Godwin’s <title level="m"
                        >Mandeville</title>, whose protagonist, even as a
                        “<foreign>non-ens</foreign>” (439), insists on his right to be in the mode
                    of not being. Hegel explores this retreat from the collectivity, which is more
                    perverse, more difficult of access, than non-conformity, when he describes a
                    self that is “turned against its structure” so that “the negative thing is the
                    structure itself.” In Hegel’s words, “the organism is then in the opposed forms
                    of <emph>being</emph> and <emph>self;</emph> and the <emph>self</emph> is
                    precisely <emph>that</emph> for which the negative of itself <emph>is</emph>,”
                    that which “relates itself to itself as a negative” (428).</p>
                <p> Our first essay on Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> is the
                    closest to engaging with the judicial system as an arena in which to think the
                    right of the negative. In “Caleb’s Unreasonable Doubt” Adam Sneed takes up the
                    concept of reasonable doubt in legal epistemology, which he relates not to
                    Humean skepticism but to a seventeenth- and eighteenth-century tradition of
                    “constructive skepticism” in which the entertaining of doubt is meant to
                    establish relative certainty. Against this containment of doubt, Sneed finds
                    that the reasonable doubt which Collins’ story of Falkland’s innocence elicits
                    in Caleb generates a further dissatisfaction with Caleb’s own unreasonable
                    desire for certainty, thus resulting in a spiraling doubt that goes beyond
                    skepticism, which is still a kind of position. For the affective excesses of the
                    narrative—Caleb’s excessive curiosity, his seemingly unwarranted sense of guilt,
                    and his peculiar elective affinity with Falkland—all function as remainders that
                    prevent us from reading the text straightforwardly as positing something, for
                    instance a critique of the <foreign>ancien régime</foreign>. Paradoxically, in
                    all the cases where Caleb doubts Collins or where his own credibility is called
                    in question, Caleb is in the right. Yet being right casts him into a life that
                    is somehow wrong, a life that cannot be vindicated, as the novel unfolds along
                    the fragile line between rights and human being. And here, we might add,
                    Esposito’s analysis of the troubling relation between rights and citizenship has
                    much to say about Godwin’s novel. For the right Caleb asserts to uncover and
                    publish the truth about Falkland, and indeed his very curiosity, are intimately
                    linked to the claim of Godwin’s “humble,” upwardly mobile protagonist to
                    personhood and citizenship (Godwin, <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> 59).
                    So by the end of this profoundly deconstructive narrative, Caleb has “no
                    character to vindicate” (434) as he reverts to being a third person, the voice
                    in which Godwin began the novel, and which for Esposito is the voice of writing:
                    “to write has always meant to ‘pass from the first to the third person’” and to
                    a “relation of self nonidentification” (130–31).<note place="foot">Esposito is
                        quoting Maurice Blanchot’s <title level="m">The Space of Literature</title>.
                        In his 1832 Preface to <title level="m">Fleetwood</title> Godwin says that
                        he began <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> “in the third person,” but
                        then made “the hero of [the] tale his own historian”; in “this mode I
                        persisted in all my subsequent .&#160;.&#160;. fiction” (448). The point
                        would be inconsequential, except that Caleb casts doubt on his own first
                        person narrative when he oddly decides to convey Collins’ third person
                        narrative in the first person (<title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> 66),
                        thus producing a continuous “aphonia of the narrative voice” (Esposito 131).

                <p> If the aleatory doubt that becomes the very structure of the novel comes from
                    Godwin’s emphasis on “the right of private judgment” (<title level="m"
                        >Enquiry</title> 1: 170), our next essay moves to a genre more traditionally
                    allied with a retreat from the public, namely the lyric. Readings by Abrams and
                    Wasserman that saw the Romantic lyric as conjoining self and nature, inside and
                    outside, or subject and object, have long since ceased to be the norm, given
                    that critics after de Man have seen the greater Romantic lyric as invoking this
                    paradigm only in the mode of compensation. But in his essay on Charlotte Smith’s
                        <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets,</title> Samuel Rowe questions the
                    marginalization of Smith as a sentimental poetess, and makes a bold claim for
                    Smith (rather than Coleridge) as having initiated a tradition of lyric
                    negativity. The negative turn in her sonnets (referring to a thematic but also a
                    formal turn at the sestet or couplet) is particularly radical because while the
                    poems are about loss, Smith will not divulge what has been lost. The containment
                    of elegy within the sonnet’s tightness rather than the more sprawling forms of
                        <title level="m">Lycidas</title> or <title level="m">In Memoriam
                    </title>contributes to this reserve, which refuses any return from object loss
                    through “normal” mourning. Thus unlike Adorno in “Lyric Poetry and Society,”
                    Smith thinks the lyric outside of a correlationism in which withdrawal from the
                    social sustains “the integrity of a coercive reality precisely by refusing to
                    align with it” (Rowe par.17). In thus protecting the Real of loss, Smith does
                    claim a right “to” the negative, a right “not to communicate” (par. 25), but
                    this claim, by declining all phenomenal content, produces an “empty”
                    subjectification that holds “subjectivity in a contentless void” (pars. 5,19). </p>
                <p> Like Rowe, David Collings in his essay “Positive Negation” focuses on the lyric,
                    or more precisely the short poem, since Coleridge’s “Limbo,” “Ne Plus Ultra,”
                    “Human Life” and his late poems generally, are less easily categorizable than
                    Smith’s sonnets. Using these fundamentally metaphysical poems to theorize
                    negativity, Collings raises the philosophical problem of how the negative can
                    have “rights.” How can it make a demand, when it has not been named and “given
                    specific powers within a discourse or practice” (par. 2)? Whereas Smith’s right
                    not to communicate does exist within a discursive practice and so is still a
                    right exercised by a subject, for Collings the idea that what cannot be posited
                    has rights is metaphysically an oxymoron. And yet non-being, even as absolute
                    nullity, somehow <emph>is</emph>: a problem also faced in <title level="m">Ages
                        of the World</title> by Schelling, who comes up both in this essay and my
                    own. For Schelling the negative is not simply privative. Not only is negation
                    originary, because the positive can have being “only by repressing the negating
                    force in itself”; a being also “cannot negate itself as actual without at the
                    same time positing itself as the actualizing potency that begets itself”
                    (17–18). To describe the presence of absence, or how that which has no being,
                    can assume a “face, voice, or agency” through a “<emph>trope</emph> of direct
                    embodiment” (par. 2; emphasis mine), Collings borrows the term “positive
                    Negation” from Coleridge’s “Limbo.” Milton’s Death, invoked by Coleridge,
                    provides a first “template” (par. 14) for this right of the negative to be
                    posited as that which (it) is not: a claim for which Coleridge’s own “positive
                    Negation” is also a catachresis. </p>
                <p> The difficulty of thinking this catachresis may be why Coleridge did not publish
                    these poems for many years, and then too only as anomalies. This withholding
                    surfaces repeatedly in Romanticism, in work referred to in several essays—for
                    instance, Smith’s right not to communicate, Schelling’s unpublished <title
                        level="m">Weltalter</title> project, and Goya’s <title level="m">Disasters
                        of War</title> in David Clark’s essay, which were never exhibited. It is the
                    explicit concern of the next article by Marc Mazur, which explores Coleridge’s
                    delay in publishing “Christabel” even as he circulated it privately, and the
                    continuing “retreat into self” (Schelling 6) that characterizes the published
                    versions. Mazur begins by theorizing two versions of this retreat based on work
                    by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy and by Catherine Malabou. In the
                    former’s <title level="m">Retreating the Political</title> (as in Adorno’s
                    “Lyric Poetry and Society”), what is involved is a withdrawal that re-treats the
                    political. Such withdrawal, as we have already seen, risks being caught in a
                    correlationism that reconfirms what it retreats from. But for Malabou the
                    retreat is not voluntary, not political; it does not assume the intentionality
                    of a fully constituted subject, and so is not even readable. What Mazur notes as
                    the “indifference” that attends the narration in the unpublished versions of
                        <title level="m">Christabel</title> (par.18) allows for this unreadability;
                    we can think of these versions as written in the third person, <foreign>le
                        neutre</foreign> in Blanchot’s term, which Esposito sees as resisting any
                    interpellation into civic personhood. But in the “Conclusion to Part the
                    Second,” added in 1816, the Symbolic Order is reestablished through the pact
                    between Geraldine and Sir Leoline, even as Christabel herself retreats from the
                    empty place of this reconstitution of the social. Coleridge tries to take
                    control of the poem as narrator, intervening into a narration whose earlier
                    indifference had cathected the trauma or unassimilable effraction traced by
                    Malabou in <title level="m">Ontology of the Accident</title> (par. 4). And yet
                    in finally publishing the poem, Coleridge does not so much complete it as
                    himself retreat from it by handing it over to a public about which he remains
                    deeply ambivalent: an ambivalence mirrored in the ineffectuality of Bard Bracy,
                    as the poem “turns over and over again around an insoluble secret which retreats
                    from the author” (par. 8).</p>
                <p> Retreat is also at the center of my own essay on Godwin’s <title level="m"
                        >Mandeville</title> (1817), a historical novel whose protagonist never
                    enters history as he progressively retreats into the closet of his psychic
                    history. The novel, which has many resonances with Godwin’s own time, is set in
                    the <foreign>interregnum</foreign>, the only period when Britain had no King,
                    and is bookended by two rebellions: the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and Mandeville’s
                    private attack on his unimpeachably good classmate Clifford, who is about to
                    marry Mandeville’s sister in a domestic simulation of the impending Restoration.
                    By way of the protagonist’s “eternal war” on Clifford, the novel engages in an
                    almost pathological deconstruction of the beautiful, the good, and the true. It
                    ends shockingly with his accidental defacement by Clifford, an effraction that
                    dis-figures all schemes of restoration. Against readers who find the climax hard
                    to absorb and feel that Godwin meant to “complete” the novel otherwise, I argue
                    that he deliberately stages a psychoanalysis of “taste” and indeed of aesthetics
                    itself, as what Baumgarten calls the art of thinking beautifully (533). Godwin
                    wrote the novel after a long retreat of his own following the failure of 1790s
                    radicalism, during which he struggled with how to write history negatively, or
                    how to write the negative as history, as positive Negation. In this history, the
                    fanaticism of the seventeenth century and its later secularization as the
                    misanthropy that so fascinated him are tropes that must be turned round and back
                    in on themselves, so as to discern within them “something not yet made good”
                    that “pushes its essence forward” (Habermas 78). Yet in the context of the
                    novel, this potential remains “contracted and self-negated” (Schelling 18),
                    withheld in an absolute reserve. </p>
                <p> Godwin went on to write a <title level="m">History of the Commonwealth of
                        England</title> (1824–28): a more sober and concrete sequel to <title
                        level="m">Political Justice</title>. If <title level="m">Mandeville</title>
                    is knotted into a negative dialectic with the <title level="m">History</title>,
                    as <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> was with <title level="m">Political
                        Justice</title>, its conclusion suspends any dialectic over a black hole.
                    There is no such ambiguity in David Clark’s essay on Goya’s <title level="m"
                        >Disasters of War</title>, the eighty two images of tortured and mangled
                    bodies from the Peninsular War of 1808–14 that are the backside of Goya’s long
                    career as a court painter. Clark’s essay has much in common with my own: both
                    deal with texts from the second decade of the nineteenth century that are set
                    against the backdrop of war, and both deal with texts that are brutally
                    unaesthetic. But there is no “tropology” of the negative here, in which the
                    negative too is not what it is; there is no future, only bare life. Unlike the
                    essays by Rowe and Collings, Clark’s essay also bears directly on the public
                    sphere, but there are no persons in the images, no citizens, as the figures are
                    anonymous and lacking in what Heidegger calls “world.” Goya printed early proofs
                    of many of the plates in the <title level="m">Disasters,</title> but he never
                    published them: not an accident, but “an artistic practice” (par. 5) that we
                    have seen in other figures discussed in this collection. By keeping the images
                    in a “studio rather than social state” (par. 5), Goya refuses them any refuge in
                    the social. It is surely curious that in a Romanticism now configured around the
                    Regency, and thus around a public sphere of consensus rather than
                        dissensus,<note place="foot">I explore the consequences of the current
                        critical reconfiguration of the Romantic period around the Regency rather
                        than the French Revolution in my article, “The Prose of the World:
                        Romanticism, the Nineteenth Century, and the Reorganization of Knowledge.”
                    </note> there are so many instances of this refusal: not just in England, but
                    also in Germany and Spain. Rather than arguing that Romanticism invented the
                    depoliticized category of “literature” as the delayed completion of Britain’s
                    “bloodless Revolution” (Jarrells 7–14, 17–19), we should perhaps think
                    Romanticism within this withdrawal into the rights of the negative, with all the
                    differences about the negative that emerge in the spaces between these
                    essays.</p>
