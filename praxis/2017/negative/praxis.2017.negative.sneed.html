            <p class="noCount">This essay considers the doubt and its relation to desire as explored in William Godwin’s
               <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794). It argues that the novel’s interest in doubt, and particularly its interest
               in how doubt organizes legal inquiry, should be read in dialogue with a form of legal
               doubt adopted within eighteenth-century legal epistemology as a response to problem
               of legal judgment under uncertainty and now crystallized in the “beyond reasonable
               doubt” evidentiary standard that continues to organize legal proof in Anglophone law.
               The essay considers how the novel’s insistence on the ways desire conditions doubt
               subverts the claims to “disinterestedness” and “reasonableness” that recommend “reasonable
               doubt” as legitimate and adequate response to the risks posed by judgment under uncertainty.
               The novel’s ironic treatment of “reasonable doubt” exposes how reasonable doubt is
               itself conditioned by an “unreasonable” desire to preserve the possibility of legal
               judgment despite these risks and how this unreasonable, conservative desire ultimately
               compromises its ability to assess and respond to uncertainty. Through Caleb’s “unreasonable
               doubt” and the reader’s “doubt-as-suspense,” the novel pursues doubt as raw, affective
               excess -- doubt as it exists “before” it is disciplined or conditioned by skepticism
               -- in an attempt to expose the basis of doubt in unreasonable, inaccessible desire
               and, thus, to call into question its legitimacy as a ground for legal judgment. The
               essay’s coda considers how the doubt “before skepticism” pursued by <em>Caleb Williams</em> might be generalized as a form of “Romantic doubt” and, further, how this “Romantic
               doubt” allows us to reimagine the relation of Romanticism and skepticism.</p>

                  <p>In this essay I want to consider doubt and its relation to desire as explored in William
                     Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams </em>(1794), by which I mean not only how doubt could be said to produce or be attended
                     by different forms of desire (for instance, the desire to resolve doubt into certainty),
                     but also how different forms of desire condition different forms of doubt, and, even
                     more strikingly, how doubt itself constitutes a form of desire in the novel. Since
                     the novel’s exploration of doubt also focuses on how doubt organizes legal inquiry
                     (for example, into Tyrrel’s murder or Falkland’s guilt), I also want to consider how
                     the novel’s treatment of doubt is in conversation with a form of legal doubt that,
                     by the late eighteenth century, had emerged as a central strategy within legal epistemology
                     for addressing the problem of legal judgment in the face of imperfect evidence. Indeed,
                     that rational, procedural form of doubt remains crystallized in the familiar “beyond
                     reasonable doubt” evidentiary standard, which first emerged in common law practice
                     in the late eighteenth-century and which continues to organize legal proof in American
                     criminal law. Much has already been written about the novel’s explicit thematization
                     of legal judgment as well as its incorporation of various legal frameworks—for instance,
                     the frameworks of testimony and trial—within its narrative form.

                              Wang, Marjorie Levinson, Gregg Crane, and Julia Hansen for reading and responding
                              to earlier versions of this essay. For recent treatments of Caleb Williams in relation
                              to eighteenth-century legal theory and practice, see Marshall 27–64, Grossman 37–38,
                              and Hoeveler and Jenkins 327. Although the following reading will concern itself more
                              with the novel’s engagement with legal epistemology rather than common law practice,
                              its argument has affinities with Marshall’s claim that the novel’s legal preoccupations
                              can…</span></div>
                     </div> Given the central role of doubt in the legal theory of the period, the novel’s emphasis
                     on the role of doubt in assessing Falkland’s case could be regarded as part and parcel
                     of its appropriation of this broader legal framework. However, in this essay I intend
                     to concentrate on how the novel’s insistence on the relation of doubt and desire ultimately
                     works to subvert this form of legal doubt by exposing the desires that condition it
                     and thus upending assumptions regarding its disinterested and reasonable character.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To begin to develop these claims, we might turn to Godwin’s suggestive remark in his
                     1831 advertisement to <em>St. Leon</em> that it was, in part, “the state of doubt in which the reader might for a time be
                     as to the truth of [Caleb’s] charges” against Falkland that made <em>Caleb Williams </em>“a narrative of no uncommon interest” (<em>St. Leon </em>v). It is a remark that testifies as much to the centrality of the trial framework
                     to the novel’s form as it does to the centrality of procedural doubt within that legal
                     framework. And yet Godwin does not assume the reader’s state of doubt to reflect the
                     kind of disinterestedness we might expect or even demand from a judge or jury member
                     reviewing Falkland’s case. Rather, it is a sign of the reader’s “uncommon”—that is,
                     extraordinary or even excessive—interest in Falkland’s case. This is doubt as suspense,
                     not suspension. It heats up rather than cools down judgment. In this sense, the character
                     of the reader’s doubt could be said to have a closer affinity with Caleb’s doubts
                     and suspicions about Falkland; it reproduces Caleb’s doubt-as-suspense.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Uphaus similarly observes that Caleb’s curiosity “excites” and “expresses the desires
                              of the reader’s curiosity” (281) and functions as “a psychological attribute by which
                              the reader is lured into reenacting Caleb’s processes of mind” (282). </span></div>
                     </div> At the same time, however, the reader’s doubt also appears to constitute a negative
                     recoil from Caleb’s suspicions. Here again Godwin’s retrospective remark is suggestive
                     since Godwin assumes the reader’s doubt to center on the “truth of [the] charges”
                     put forward by Caleb rather than directly on the facts of Falkland’s case—or, in Godwin’s
                     terms from the same advertisement, not on Falkland’s “atrocious crime” itself but
                     on the “annoyance [Falkland] suffers from the immeasurable and ever-wakeful curiosity
                     of a raw youth” (v). In other words, it is a question of the merit or grounds of Caleb’s
                     suspicion, a question that includes but also exceeds the question of Falkland’s actual
                     guilt. Although Godwin seems to assume that the reader’s doubts only exist “for a
                     time” (presumably until Falkland confesses), the novel’s ethical difficulty and sophistication
                     would seem to hinge on the fact that the reader’s doubts about the “truth” of Caleb’s
                     charges – again, in this sense of their warrant, of the legitimacy of Caleb’s grounds
                     for making them – remain long after the factual certainty of Falkland’s guilt is established.
                     The reader’s doubt does not ultimately register a dispute about the facts of Falkland’s
                     case but rather a dissatisfaction with the moral ambivalence of Caleb’s doubt. On
                     one hand, it seems evident that Caleb’s doubt about Falkland’s innocence is hardly
                     grounded in a disinterested desire for legal justice. Instead, his doubt seems grounded
                     in an excessive, indeterminate form of desire. On the other hand, Caleb’s doubt, however
                     compromised by desire, somehow succeeds in discovering Falkland’s guilt where the
                     supposedly disinterested procedural doubt of the legal system fails. In this sense,
                     the reader’s dissatisfaction with Caleb’s doubt is compounded by an equal dissatisfaction
                     with the legal system, whose form of legal doubt appears no less compromised. To complicate
                     matters even further, the affinities between the reader’s and Caleb’s doubt make it
                     so that any dissatisfaction the reader may have with Caleb’s doubt also amounts to
                     a negative recoil from her own doubt-as-suspense, a recognition of how this affective
                     excess similarly compromises any claim the reader has to disinterested judgment. This
                     compounding dissatisfaction should be seen as an emergent effect and instrument of
                     the novel’s negativity, one which turns doubt upon itself to interrogate a certain
                     faith in doubt’s reliability as a disinterested ground for judgment under uncertainty.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While the novel’s pursuit of doubt as desire engages most directly with the legal
                     form of “reasonable doubt” I have described above, it should also be seen as engaging
                     with and commenting on a more widespread embrace of rational skeptical procedures
                     as a viable response to the problem of judgment under uncertainty in the period. As
                     Barbara Shapiro notes in her discussion of eighteenth-century legal theory, because
                     legal theorists assumed a fundamental similarity between legal and everyday reasoning,
                     eighteenth-century legal epistemology should not be understood as distinct from the
                     general epistemology of the period. Rather it should be viewed largely as an attempt
                     to apply the most current epistemological theory to specific legal problems (Shapiro, <em>Beyond Reasonable Doubt </em>19, 38). As Shapiro observes, long before the phrase “reasonable doubt” emerged in
                     the common law court, it formed the cornerstone of a broad epistemological program
                     that united philosophers and divines of various stripes around the premise that, despite
                     epistemological uncertainty, “reasonable men, employing their senses and rational
                     faculties, could derive truths that they would have no reason to doubt” (<em>Beyond Reasonable Doubt </em>7). In this essay I will refer to this broader philosophical program as “constructive
                     skepticism” following Henry van Leeuwen and Jamie Ferreira who have examined its origins
                     in the probabilistic epistemologies of the late-seventeenth century philosophers John
                     Tillotson, John Wilkins, and to some extent, John Locke.

                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Van Leeuwen, The Problem of Certainty in English Thought, 1630–1690 and Ferreira,
                              Scepticism and Reasonable Doubt.</span></div>
                     </div> The program is “skeptical” in the sense that it acknowledges the fact of epistemological
                     uncertainty and “constructive” in the sense that it rejects that this basic fact should
                     have any radical implications regarding our ability to arrive at degrees of “moral
                     certainty” sufficient to justify practical action and judgment (Ferreira 2–4). Put
                     another way, while constructive skepticism accepts the skeptical premise that we are
                     unable to attain certain knowledge about matters of fact, it also accepts that the
                     careful application of skeptical and rational procedures constitutes a sufficient
                     response to the problem of uncertainty and, further, a viable method for “constructing”
                     actionable, if still uncertain, knowledge about the world. In this sense, constructive
                     skepticism can be further glossed as a “therapeutic” and “conservative” form of skepticism
                     since it retains a fundamental faith in the ability of a procedural, rational skepticism
                     to address and alleviate, if not resolve entirely, the epistemic problem of uncertainty
                     that skepticism in general identifies.</p>
               </div>
               <p>It is specifically this conservative character of constructive skepticism and how
                  it conditions the character of legal doubt adopted within eighteenth-century legal
                  theory that I want to examine in this section as a necessary philosophical background
                  for understanding the novel’s approach to doubt. This conservatism is inscribed in
                  the demand that legal doubt must be “reasonable” doubt. It is a qualification that
                  reflects constructive skepticism’s organizing assumption regarding the qualified value
                  of rational skepticism as a response to judgment under uncertainty. On one hand, the
                  “beyond reasonable doubt” standard reflects the recognition that an actively skeptical
                  posture helps reduce the risks of factual error and wrongful conviction in legal judgment.
                  On the other hand, the standard reflects the recognition that, since legal facts are
                  always subject to some degree of uncertainty, at a certain point doubt must lose its
                  instrumental value and become an impediment to legal judgment. Allowing some doubt
                  helps reduce the risk of wrongful conviction; allowing <em>any</em> doubt makes it impossible to convict at all. As such, the “beyond reasonable doubt”
                  standard attempts to strike a balance between, on the one hand, a desire to reduce
                  the risks of uncertainty and, on the other, a desire to preserve the possibility of
                  legal judgment despite the risks that inevitably attend uncertainty. It achieves this
                  balance by positing a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate forms of doubt,
                  between “reasonable” doubts that are recognized within the legal process and “unreasonable”
                  doubts that, for various reasons, fail to qualify. The distinction aims to separate
                  “plausible” from “merely possible” doubt, “reasonable” doubt from “any doubt at all,”
                  and, most importantly for our purposes, “private” or “interested” forms of doubt from
                  “public” or “disinterested” forms of doubt.</p>
               <p>Though these distinctions appear largely normative in retrospect, they were regarded
                  as descriptive in the period and, along with constructive skeptical arguments for
                  the sufficiency for “moral certainty,” depended more fundamentally on a descriptive
                  epistemological distinction between two kinds of knowledge, “probable” and “demonstrative.”
                  “Demonstrative knowledge” entailed propositions that could be proved by logical demonstration
                  and, thus, produced an “absolute” or “demonstrative” certainty that necessitated assent.
                  Since probable knowledge could never admit of this level of demonstrative certainty,
                  the evidentiary standards for proof in probable knowledge had to be adjusted to reflect
                  the intuition that one could gain sufficient, if incomplete, degrees of certainty
                  to justify practical action by ascending a graduated scale of belief based on degrees
                  of “moral evidence.” In this sense, degrees of evidence could be correlated to relative
                  degrees of belief ranging from absolute doubt or disbelief up to opinion and, finally,
                  to full confidence and conviction. “Moral certainty” existed at the top of this evidentiary
                  hierarchy and was assumed to provide a functional equivalent to demonstrative certainty
                  in the realm of contingent fact. It was reserved for propositions that would be “unreasonable”
                  to doubt despite any theoretical level of uncertainty.</p>
               <p>Intuitions about the sufficiency of moral certainty were developed with reference
                  to widely-observed and fairly uncontroversial natural regularities (e.g., the rising
                  and setting of the sun or the ebb and flow of the tides) or to widely attested historical
                  or geographical facts (e.g., that there was a historical figure named Julius Caesar
                  or that a city called Rome existed). But the eighteenth-century legal theorist had
                  little reservations about applying the label of moral certainty to less regular, more
                  controversial legal facts. Eighteenth-century legal treatises readily adopted the
                  basic epistemological distinction between moral and demonstrative knowledge to develop
                  a normative account of evidentiary standards. Treatise writers approached the epistemological
                  distinctions as if addressing an audience that would be either unfamiliar with the
                  nature of moral evidence or somehow reluctant to accept the sufficiency of moral certainty
                  relative to demonstrative certainty. Similarly, treatise writers tended to treat orientations
                  towards uncertainty that challenged the sufficiency of moral certainty as irrational
                  and pathological. Such orientations reflected an excessive and unreasonable desire
                  for certainty that failed to grasp the very nature of probable knowledge, much less
                  the exigency and necessity of practical action under uncertainty. They fixated on
                  doubts that were theoretical instead of practical, scrupulous instead of significant,
                  matters of private rather than public concern. </p>
               <p>To enjoin readers to accept the sufficiency of moral certainty, treatise writers could
                  depict the relation between demonstrative and moral certainty in various ways and
                  to various effects. In <em>Essay Upon the Law of Evidence </em>(1789), for instance, the jurist John Morgan stresses the functional equivalence of
                  moral and demonstrative certainty to the point of identity, asking readers to accept
                  the truth of legal testimony under oath with the same confidence as if it had been
                  demonstratively proven. For Morgan, even though “human testimony, i.e. evidence given
                  by one man to another, can never produce certainty,” nonetheless, in matters where
                  a witness is under oath “[a mind] must acquiesce [to a witness’s testimony] therein
                  as from a knowledge by demonstration, because, according to the nature of things,
                  it ought not any longer to doubt, but to be nearly, if not as perfectly well satisfied,
                  as if we of ourselves knew the fact” (5). Treatise writers could also stress the categorical
                  difference of demonstrative and moral certainty in an effort to reinforce the concept
                  of sufficient though incomplete evidence. This latter strategy generally necessitated
                  pathologizing the inability to perceive this difference as unreasonable and irrational.
                  Although not a legal treatise in itself, James Gambier’s popular textbook on moral
                  evidence, <em>Introduction to the Study of Moral Evidence</em>(1806), provides a clear and representative account of how the epistemological distinction
                  between moral and demonstrative knowledge was effectively wielded to justify the normative
                  distinction between reasonable and unreasonable doubt within legal epistemology and
                  more broadly.</p>
               <p>Gambier considers how a matter of fact can be assumed to “rise so high as to exclude
                  all reasonable doubt” while “fall[ing] short of absolute certainty” (5). While he
                  concedes that “we are often apt to expect stronger evidence, than the nature of the
                  thing [i.e. probable knowledge] admits; and, thence, to feel dissatisfied, though
                  the point be fairly proved,” he urges that we should nonetheless “accustom ourselves
                  to yield our assent” if “such evidence be produced in a sufficient degree to counterbalance
                  all that can be fairly urged against it” (Gambier 93). He continues:<span class="quote">‘. . . [I]f in studying the evidence on any question of fact, we employ ourselves
                     in examining whether there be not a possibility that it may be false, instead of considering
                     whether there be not a sufficient probability that it is true, we shall certainly
                     raise strong doubts in our minds. But, then, we should not study the subject rationally.
                     Demonstration is the only species of reasoning, which, if even conducted correctly,
                     can exclude the possibility of error. But facts do not admit of demonstration. They
                     admit of moral evidence alone. The examining, therefore, into the possibility of error
                     is inconsistent with the nature of the subject, and an absurd practice. (93–94)’</span> Gambier’s assertion regarding the “irrationality,” “inconsistency,” and “absurdity”
                  of fixating on the “possibility of error” with respect to moral evidence was a common
                  refrain within eighteenth-century legal epistemology. The desire to attain degrees
                  of certainty thought to exceed “reasonable doubt” was generally treated in this manner
                  as an epistemic category error, a refusal to accept the basic epistemic conditions
                  governing the evaluation of matters of fact—what Gambier refers to as the “nature
                  of the thing”—rather than, say, a legitimate concern or anxiety about the limits of
                  practical judgment established by uncertainty. Indeed, it would be possible to show
                  that similar epistemological distinctions continue to organize the concept of “reasonable
                  doubt” in legal theory. For instance, in the 1850 case Commonwealth v. Webster still
                  regarded by many legal theorists as the most lucid attempt to define the “beyond reasonable
                  doubt” standard, Massachusetts Supreme Court Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw characterizes
                  reasonable doubt as “. . . not mere possible doubt; because every thing [sic] relating
                  to human affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is open to some possible or imaginary
                  doubt” (qtd. in Shealy 234 n. 40).</p>
               <p>If Gambier’s account reflects a pathology of doubt developed in response to the threat
                  posed to legal judgment within rational skepticism itself, then William Paley’s reflections
                  on legal doubt in <em>The Principles of Political and Moral Philosophy </em> (1785) present an alternative skeptical pathology developed in response to a separate
                  tradition of theological skepticism which perceived doubt as a sign of uneasy conscience
                  and, as such, recommended withholding judgment in the face of any uncertainty. Unlike
                  the rationalist pathology sketched above, which focuses on reasonable expectations
                  of certainty as informed by epistemology, this alternative pathology focuses on how
                  private concerns of conscience unreasonably interfere with public and civic duties
                  to uphold and execute the law. This pathology was characterized as the “scrupulous
                  conscience” which, as Shapiro explains, was regarded as “a troubled or diseased condition”
                  of an individual “reluctant to act even after doubts had been resolved” (“Changing
                  Language” 267). Thus, Paley laments the civil disservice performed by a jury member
                  paralyzed by “an over-strained scrupulousness, or weak timidity” which “holds it the
                  part of a safe conscience not to condemn any man, whilst there exists the minutest
                  possibility of his innocence” (391). For Paley, such private reservations threatened
                  the very efficacy of the legal system itself, where that efficacy was conceived largely
                  in terms of its ability to root out and convict criminals despite uncertainty: “[W]hen
                  certain rules of adjudication must be persued [sic], when certain degrees of credibility
                  must be accepted, in order to reach the crimes with which the public are infested;
                  courts of justice should not be deterred from the application of these rules, by every
                  suspicion or danger, or by the mere possibility of confounding the innocent with the
                  guilty” (393). Indeed, in his 2008 study of the origins of the “beyond reasonable
                  doubt” standard, James Q. Whitman draws on this figure of the “scrupulous conscience”
                  to support his revisionist argument that the standard was developed—at least at first—not
                  to promote sound evidentiary proof practices but rather to provide “moral comfort”
                  for jury members anxious about the eternal consequences of an error in uncertain,
                  temporal judgment. For Whitman, the reasonable doubt standard was “originally a theological
                  doctrine” which responded to “religiously motivated reluctance to convict” (4) by
                  “reassur[ing] jurors that they could convict the defendant without risking their own
                  salvation, so long as their doubts about guilt were not ‘reasonable’” (3). In this
                  sense, Whitman argues, the standard was “not originally designed to make it more difficult
                  for jurors to convict”—as we assume it to be today—but “to make conviction easier”
                  (4).</p>
               <p>These alternative pathologies should sufficiently demonstrate how the concept of “reasonable
                  doubt”—though ostensibly formulated as a means of alleviating the problems of uncertainty—is
                  also informed more fundamentally by a conservative desire to preserve the possibility
                  of legal judgment under uncertainty against the threats posed by more radical forms
                  of skepticism, whether those threats are perceived as coming from within the rational
                  tradition itself or from outside that tradition in the form of theologically-inflected
                  skepticism. These pathologies should also illustrate how the concept of “reasonable
                  doubt” responds to this threat by normalizing a circumscribed form of “reasonable”
                  doubt that reflects these conservative assumptions and, in turn, pathologizing other
                  orientations towards uncertainty that do not reflect these conservative assumptions
                  as excessive and illegitimate. With these observations, we are now in a position to
                  consider how the novel’s exploration of doubt and desire—and, more precisely, doubt-as-desire
                  –responds to this conservatism informing “reasonable doubt.”</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Before Skepticism: <em>Caleb Williams</em> and Unreasonable Doubt</span></h2>
               <p>The novel’s insistence on the relation of doubt and desire can be read as an attempt
                  to expose how the desire to preserve the possibility of legal judgment against uncertainty
                  conditions the form of procedural, rational doubt adopted by the legal system and,
                  ultimately, circumscribes the kinds of inquiry it can perform. The novel’s pessimistic
                  depiction of the inability of the legal process to, if not convict Falkland for Tyrrel’s
                  murder, at least save the Hawkinses from wrongful conviction seems constructed to
                  raise doubts about the ability of procedural doubt to identify and assess risks associated
                  with factual uncertainty or, more provocatively, to achieve anything more than preserve
                  the appearance of the legitimacy of the legal process itself. In this sense, the novel
                  asks whether legal doubt is grounded, as it professes, in a desire to assess and respond
                  to the risks of uncertainty or, instead, grounded in a more basic desire to preserve
                  the possibility of legal judgment under uncertainty itself. Further, the novel seems
                  particularly invested in exposing how the normative distinction between “reasonable”
                  and “unreasonable” forms of doubt does not necessarily reflect a legitimate response
                  to the risks of uncertainty but rather functions as a technique for rationalizing
                  the legal status quo. It is as if the novel’s subversive treatment of the distinction
                  between “legitimate” and “illegitimate” doubt aims to recast that distinction as one
                  between “legitimating” and “delegitimating” forms of doubt. “Legitimate” doubts are
                  “legitimating” in the sense that they operate within the legal system to strengthen
                  and legitimize the claim that it is not only possible but reasonable to perform legal
                  judgments despite uncertainty, whereas “illegitimate” doubts are “delegitimating”
                  in that they threaten to undermine this claim. In this context, the desire of the
                  legal system to represent such doubts as illegitimate “in themselves” rather than
                  in relation to the organizing assumptions of the legal system becomes an essential
                  strategy for preserving and reinforcing the authority of the legal system itself.
                  The normative distinction between reasonable and unreasonable forms of doubt relies,
                  primarily, on the assumption that “unreasonable” doubts threaten the legal system
                  on account of their origins in illegitimate forms of desire. But while the distinction
                  purports to preserve the legal process from the pernicious influence of desire, the
                  novel explores the chilling possibility that this distinction not only effectively
                  <em>inscribes</em> such unreasonable desires in the legal process but also surreptitiously obscures
                  or conceals this fact by directing critical attention towards a specter of unreasonable
                  doubt.</p>
               <p>We can draw out these interests in the novel by considering the brief and seemingly
                  irrelevant appearance of a group of skeptics in the midst of Collins’s narrative:
                  <span class="quote">‘. . . Hawkins and his son were tried, condemned, and afterwards executed. In the
                     interval between the sentence and execution Hawkins confessed his guilt with many
                     marks of compunction; though there are persons by whom this is denied; but I have
                     taken some pains to enquire into the fact, and am persuaded that their disbelief is
                     precipitate and groundless. (Godwin, <em>Caleb Williams </em>174)’</span> The passage is one of the few times Collins breaks from his task of narrating the
                  events surrounding Tyrrel’s murder to perform the task of validating his narrative.
                  It is significant that this task of validation takes the specific form of a procedural
                  skeptical inquiry. Collins doubles back to review and confirm the evidence for Hawkins’s
                  confession in the face of skeptical objections, in a manner that, though technically
                  extralegal, seems intended to mirror and extend the careful legal procedures performed
                  to absolve Falkland of any involvement in Tyrrel’s murder. Despite their minor presence,
                  these skeptics function as an essential feature of Collins’s skeptical investigation.
                  They enable Collins to demonstrate what Caleb calls the “uncommonly judicious” (166)
                  nature of Collins’s investigation by situating his procedural application of reasonable
                  doubt in productive contrast with a doubt that is marked, explicitly by Collins and
                  implicitly in other respects, as unreasonable. The episode illustrates Collins’s willingness
                  to entertain doubt as well as his willingness to assess and dismiss it on rational
                  grounds: Collins does not dismiss the disbelievers reflexively but only after he has
                  “taken some pains to enquire into the fact” and is “persuaded” that their doubts are
                  “precipitate and groundless.” The figure capitalizes further on the suggestive contrast
                  established between Collins’s dynamic performance of a procedural doubt and the skeptics’
                  static doubt and, likewise, between Collins’s singularity and the skeptics’ collectivity.
                  It is not just Collins’s independent inquiry but his very independence of mind that
                  is set in relief with the mob-like collective judgment of the skeptics. This is true
                  even as Collins’s performance of intellectual autonomy manages to disable the reader’s
                  own critical capacities by omitting any specific content that readers might use to
                  perform their own assessments of these skeptical doubts. The skeptics, along with
                  the nature of their reservations, remain unnamed (do they deny that Hawkins ever confessed
                  or that he was ever guilty, or both?). They are a stage prop in Collins’s performance
                  of reasonableness, a rhetorical <em>aporia </em> that allows Collins to acknowledge and then authoritatively dismiss any doubt about
                  the legitimacy of Hawkins’s execution.</p>
               <p>The episode should sufficiently illustrate the novel’s explicit interest in what I
                  will refer to as the “rhetoric of reasonableness” deployed by constructive skepticism.
                  And, similarly, observing the interpretive instability of this episode as the novel
                  progresses should illustrate how the novel wields irony to undermine the authority
                  of this rhetoric. Of course, whatever authority the reader grants Collins will be
                  largely undermined by his later revelation that his judgment of the case had been
                  influenced by his fear of retribution from Falkland and, more to the point, his desire
                  to preserve the moral distinctions that the uncertainties of the case threaten to
                  disrupt. “If you could change all my ideas, and show me that there was no criterion
                  by which vice might be prevented from being mistaken for virtue,” he asks Caleb, “what
                  benefit would arise from that?” (Godwin, <em>Caleb Williams</em>16). The question could be taken as the novel’s most concentrated expression of the
                  conservative impulse I have been examining, and it affords a suggestive glimpse into
                  how the desire to preserve the possibility of legal judgment under uncertainty is
                  suffused with an anxiety about the consequences of its impossibility. In this light,
                  legal doubt emerges as a form of suspense that anxiously anticipates its ability not
                  to account for uncertainty but to overcome it.</p>
               <p>But, Collins’s revelation aside, it is also true that his rhetorical deployment of
                  the skeptics never quite behaves the way he intends. And the unruliness of the rhetorical
                  figure itself suggests how, in the final analysis, the real instabilities and risks
                  that attend uncertainty defy the efforts of constructive skepticism to contain them.
                  Collins’s effort to validate his narrative raises suspicions about why it must be
                  validated in the first place. Collins introduces the skeptics as a way of closing
                  down the question of Hawkins’s confession, but they eventually mark the very rupture
                  in Collins’s narrative Caleb will fixate on when formulating his own doubts about
                  Hawkins’s guilt and Falkland’s innocence. Collins presumably omits the skeptics’ specific
                  objections from his narrative because he believes they have no rational basis. Yet,
                  in the light of Hawkins’s innocence, this omission seems to demand that readers acknowledge
                  the ethical merit of the skeptics’ doubts <em>prior to </em>and even <em>despite </em> any consideration of their rational basis. Similarly, the skeptics’ plurality, which
                  at first appeared to be a sign of their intellectual slavishness, becomes a sign of
                  their intellectual and moral resolve—especially once we take into account that they
                  are essentially the only collective body figured in the novel not under the absolute
                  sway of<em>some social </em>superior. All told, by the novel’s end, the figure’s rhetorical function seems to
                  shift from <em>aporia </em>to <em>exempla</em>, in what amounts to an ironic inversion of that religious genre’s tendency to introduce
                  skeptics as counterexamples whose disbelief and its miserable consequences are meant
                  to redouble the faith of both reader and author. In this inversion, “unreasonable”
                  doubt as it is defined by constructive skepticism stands out as the only reasonable
                  and ethical response to the risks of uncertainty.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The critique I have developed from Collins’s episode with the skeptics should clarify
                     the novel’s deep skepticism regarding the legal concept of reasonable doubt, the rhetoric
                     of reasonableness it deploys, and the conservative desires that inform it. Yet, as
                     much as Collins’s episode with the skeptics clarifies about the novel’s interest in
                     “unreasonable” doubt as a negative response to “reasonable doubt,” it risks giving
                     the false impression that this response can be neatly, clearly, or completely articulated
                     by this critique. On the contrary, this critique seems to be only a side effect of
                     a much more disruptive form of negativity pursued by the novel, one which ultimately
                     muddies whatever critical or ethical clarity I have drawn from the ironies above.
                     In fact, it is arguably even misleading to characterize the effects of the novel’s
                     negativity as “critique,” since the procedure of rational critique we have inherited
                     from the eighteenth century is animated by the very same spirit of constructive skepticism
                     the novel calls into question. To see this, simply consider that Kant’s critical project,
                     although typically framed as an idealist response to Hume’s skeptical empiricism,
                     is no less a variety of skepticism itself, one that is distinctively conservative

                     how the negativity <em>Caleb Williams </em> pursues suggests a much different understanding of Romanticism’s relation to skepticism
                     than the one proposed by Stanley Cavell in his well-known account of Romanticism as
                     a “response” to Kant’s settlement with epistemological skepticism.</p>

                  <p>If it is misleading to characterize the novel’s negativity as critique, it is similarly
                     misleading to characterize it as a form of skepticism itself, even as the novel’s
                     negativity takes doubt both as its central instrument and object of inquiry. This
                     is because the force of novel’s negativity seems to originate in its exploration of
                     doubt as it exists <em>before </em>it hardens or stabilizes into skepticism. Indeed, the novel seems to resist any conflation
                     of skepticism and doubt in an effort to preserve the unruly aspects of doubt that
                     get lost once doubt is disciplined by skepticism. That is, if skepticism can be characterized
                     as a directed, instrumental application of doubt to specific intellectual or epistemic
                     problems, then I would argue that the novel <em>pursues</em> a form of doubt that lacks this instrumentality or directedness: a form of doubt that
                     is inchoate, marked by affective excess rather than intellectual restraint, hot rather
                     than cold.

                              desire into rational skepticism, and briefly surveying the problems he encounters
                              should illustrate how rational skepticism cannot accommodate the examination of doubt
                              and desire the novel pursues. In “Essay of Skepticism,” for instance, Godwin works
                              against the common assumption that skepticism must be “necessarily allied to coldness
                              of character” and insists instead that skeptical inquiry must be imbued with an “ardour
                              and animation” located between cold “indifference” and overheated “enthusiasm” (308).

                     </div> In the episode above, Collins refers to the skeptics’ doubt as “groundless” in the
                     sense of lacking rational grounds, but it is better to characterize the doubt I am
                     describing as the affective ground from which skeptical doubt draws its critical energies,
                     the raw doubt-as-desire that skepticism refines and harnesses. Here it should be clear
                     that I have effectively described the character of Caleb’s doubt. It should also be
                     evident that the destabilizing effects achieved by the novel will emanate from the
                     unreasonableness of Caleb’s doubt-as-desire. In any case, these effects seem too ambivalent
                     to constitute anything like a skeptical program. They faithfully reproduce the doubt
                     and uncertainty from which they originate.</p>
               </div>
               <p>These negative definitions of the novel’s negativity should provide a <em>sense of just </em>how far the novel must depart from our usual understanding of the forms negativity
                  can take so that it may arrive in uncharted waters or, as Godwin famously declared,
                  “launch [readers] upon a sea of moral and political inquiry” (<em>Caleb Williams </em>451). However, we can begin to sketch out a positive account of the novel’s negativity
                  by first identifying the ways that Caleb’s doubt does appear to accord with the critique
                  of “reasonable doubt” I have developed from the passage above. Once we have pursued
                  this accord to its limit, we can then consider how the unreasonableness of Caleb’s
                  doubt necessarily points beyond this critique.</p>
               <p>In light of the legal epistemology I have sketched, we might argue that Caleb’s tendency
                  to understand his doubt primarily as a form of curiosity—one that is excessive, unproductive,
                  and idiosyncratic or, in Caleb’s terms, “ungoverned,” “infantine,” and “unreasonable”
                  (Godwin, <em>Caleb Williams </em>212, 224)—reflects the extent to which Caleb has internalized the normative distinction
                  between reasonable and unreasonable doubt as means for assessing the ethical merit
                  (or lack thereof) of his doubt. Indeed, Caleb consistently weighs his skeptical disposition
                  against an internalized sense of what a reasonable person would or would not doubt.
                  He continually seeks—and fails—to find what he would consider to be rational grounds
                  to justify his dissatisfaction with Collins’s narrative. Caleb doubts Hawkins’s guilt
                  even as Hawkins’s alleged confession makes him feel “there was no longer a possibility
                  of doubting” (180); he pursues his suspicions about Falkland even as “could find nothing
                  that [he] could consider as justifying [him] in persisting in the shadow of a doubt”
                  (198) about Falkland’s innocence. In this way, Caleb anxiously observes the distance
                  between his doubt as it is and his sense of what it should be.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Caleb’s internalization of these norms helps explain, to some extent, his
                  inability to attribute <em>any</em> ethical value to his doubt, despite the many opportunities he has to reassess or
                  qualify its value in light of new evidence. Falkland confesses his guilt, Collins
                  reveals his narrative to have been compromised by political and practical concerns,
                  but Caleb only grows more certain of the unethical and pathological nature of his
                  own doubt. In his retrospective attempt to “divid[e] . . . the offensive [and] defensive”
                  (212) parts of his actions, he ends up condemning all his behavior leading up to Falkland’s
                  confession. By the novel’s conclusion, Caleb has even rejected this division and remains
                  saddled with a sense of guilt many critics have found to be, like his curiosity, excessive
                  and inexplicable. Yet, on this reading, any dissatisfaction a reader might have with
                  Caleb’s inability to recover any ethical merit in his actions or with the excessive
                  sense of guilt that results from this inability should ultimately resolve into a dissatisfaction
                  with the normative assumptions that enable Caleb to misread his doubt in this way.
                  Caleb’s conversations later in the novel with Collins and Laura—both of whom reinforce
                  this misreading—seem designed in part to exacerbate this sense of dissatisfaction.
                  And, in this way, the novel recovers the ethical potential of Caleb’s doubt while
                  also sowing discontent with institutional efforts to obscure or discredit that ethical
                  potential.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Approaching Caleb’s doubt in this recuperative manner illustrates how the novel’s
                     negativity carries forward the deconstructive project Godwin pursues against political
                     institutions in <em>An Enquiry to Political Justice </em>(1793). In that work we find Godwin similarly invested in exposing the various techniques
                     political institutions deploy to condition private acts of judgment so they reflect
                     and reinforce the organizing assumptions of the institutions themselves. Caleb’s mistaken
                     dismissal of his doubt as idiosyncratic and his consequent inability to perceive its
                     ethical and political potential exemplifies the pernicious effects of what Godwin
                     attacks in the <em>Enquiry </em>as the attempt to distinguish between public and private spheres of judgment, or,
                     in Godwin’s terms, between “conduct in civil concerns” in which positive institutions
                     “may properly interfere” and “matters of conscience” in which “positive institutions
                     ought to leave me personally free” (<em>Political Justice </em>75). For Godwin, while such distinctions might appear to establish an autonomous sphere
                     where ethical considerations preside independently from political interests, their
                     ultimate effect is to consolidate institutional power against the disruptive ethical
                     and political potential of conscience. And it is notable that, for Godwin, the tension
                     an individual feels between the responsibilities dictated by private judgment and
                     those dictated by institutions often manifests as doubt: an individual’s desire to
                     “believe what is dictated to them” by institutions is frustrated by the absence of
                     “that in which belief consists, evidence and conviction” (368), resulting in “a perpetual
                     dissatisfaction” (368) which speaks to the “execrable tyranny” (368) of any attempt
                     to coerce private judgment.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Moreover, Godwin’s specific critique of legal institutions in the Enquiry involves
                              recovering and elaborating the radical ethical implications of the “imperfection”
                              or “uncertainty” of evidence (Godwin Political Justice 381, 401). For Godwin, since
                              “[n]o principles of evidence have yet been laid down that are infallible” (78), the
                              “veracity” and “competence” of witnesses as accurate and just observers must be subject
                              to “continual doubt” (381).</span></div>
                     </div> Caleb’s doubt thus has the effect of both exemplifying this dissatisfaction for and
                     generating this dissatisfaction within the reader.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Although the novel’s negative project aligns with the deconstructive project of the
                  <em>Enquiry </em> in this general sense, the novel’s insistence that the procedural skepticism adopted
                  within rational inquiry itself constitutes a form of institutionality that compromises
                  private judgment illustrates how the novel manages to extend the <em>Enquiry</em>’s project beyond the limits imposed by its own commitment to rationalism. To be sure,
                  throughout the <em>Enquiry </em> Godwin is concerned with preserving the autonomy of private judgment against the
                  impositions of institutional norms. Yet Godwin also places great faith in the assumption
                  that reason always functions in accord with individual conscience, as an instrument
                  and not an impediment to the unbiased exercise of private judgment. It is a faith
                  that originates in Godwin’s appreciation for the dynamic and progressive nature of
                  rational inquiry, which he characteristically contrasts to the stagnancy of custom
                  and dogma. “Refer [people] to reading, to conversation, to meditation,” Godwin writes,
                  “but teach them neither creeds nor catechisms, either moral or political” (352). Indeed,
                  it is in this spirit that Godwin deploys a rhetoric of reasonableness throughout the
                  <em>Enquiry</em> to punctuate his own exercises in private, rational judgment. But this assumption
                  regarding the natural alignment of reason and conscience also blinds the <em>Enquiry</em> to how a rhetoric of reasonableness might be deployed <em>against</em> conscience as it manifests in “private” doubt or how such a rhetoric might be wielded
                  to close down, rather than open up, rational inquiry. Yet, this is precisely how Collins
                  (or Paley) deploys such rhetoric. Likewise, these are the rhetorical and ideological
                  effects that Caleb must resist to pursue his own unreasonable doubt. In this respect,
                  <em>Caleb Williams</em> could be said to turn the <em>Enquiry</em>’s deconstructive project on the latent threat of dogmatism posed by the rhetoric
                  of reasonableness that treatise employs.</p>
               <p>So far I have approached Caleb’s unreasonable doubt with the assumption that it aligns
                  with and reinforces the critique of reasonable doubt I have teased out of the novel’s
                  ironic treatment of Collins’s rhetoric of reasonableness. On this assumption, the
                  novel would appear to stage a coordinated critique of the legal system that mobilizes
                  doubt and irony to undermine the legitimacy of the circumscribed form of doubt that
                  system normalizes in an effort to preserve its own legitimacy. From this perspective,
                  the novel’s critique of reasonable doubt also appears to align with—and extend in
                  striking and productive ways—the deconstructive project pursued in Godwin’s <em>Enquiry</em>. This is a satisfying and neat interpretation of the novel’s interest in unreasonable
                  doubt. But it also helps clarify why Caleb’s doubt <em>cannot </em>be perceived as ethically viable and must instead be regarded as “unreasonable” in
                  ways that exceed the ideological distortions created by the normative account of reasonable
                  doubt. For, on this reading, Caleb’s doubt, although wrongly dismissed by the legal
                  system and even by Caleb itself on the basis of its private and pathological nature,
                  nonetheless appears to emerge as a viable ethical orientation to the problem of judgment
                  under uncertainty. Yet, the novel’s interest in unreasonable doubt does not seem to
                  be how unreasonable doubt might <em>replace</em> the circumscribed form of “reasonable doubt” adopted within legal theory as, say,
                  a more adequate response to the risks of judgment under uncertainty. Rather, the novel’s
                  interest lies in how Caleb’s unreasonable doubt reveals the fundamental interestedness
                  of all doubt—that is, how all doubt is grounded in desire—in a way that calls into
                  question the viability of doubt as a disinterested ground for legal judgment. This
                  point is succinctly captured in a central ethical paradox that frustrates any recuperative
                  reading of Caleb’s doubt: as readers, we have no way of knowing that Caleb’s doubts
                  about Falkland are justified until he confirms this fact through evidently unjustifiable
                  means. Any attempt to assert the ethical viability of Caleb’s doubt requires condoning
                  the perverse psychological torture he performs on Falkland to confirm his suspicions.
                  Caleb may not be as guilty as he believes, but he is hardly innocent. Further, this
                  ambivalence gestures towards the insufficiency of the categories of guilt and innocence
                  to capture Caleb’s moral predicament.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While many critics have been puzzled by Caleb’s excessive sense of guilt at the novel’s
                     end, there has been little debate that Caleb’s suspicions towards Falkland at the
                     beginning of the novel are ethically problematic in ways that the reading of Caleb’s
                     doubt I have pursued above cannot adequately address. For where I have read Caleb’s
                     tendency to understand his doubt as curiosity to be, in some respect, an ideological
                     mechanism that misrepresents an ethical response as a pathological one, other critics
                     have persuasively interpreted Caleb’s curiosity to be a symptom of other inchoate
                     forms of desire. Some critics, for instance, have argued that Caleb’s curiosity masks
                     a political desire to wield the knowledge of Falkland’s secret crimes against him
                     as a means to achieve political power and equality.

                     between paranoia and the experience of plottedness that several critics have since

                     competing or complementary desires “motivating” Caleb’s doubt, it also attests more
                     fundamentally to the indeterminate nature of Caleb’s doubt—that is, its lack of clear

                     it does not display interestedness in any of its recognizable forms. The fact that
                     no single interpretation of his curiosity feels any more viable than the other confirms
                     this indeterminacy. And this observation lends some credence to Caleb’s tendency to
                     characterize his curiosity as immature and inexplicable instead of sinister or malicious.
                     Indeed, even as critics have perceived something much more sinister behind his treatment
                     of Falkland than “curiosity” can address, they have rarely suggested that Caleb is
                     conscious of or consciously concealing the desires that motivate his curiosity. Instead,
                     it is much more common to read Caleb as a victim of his repressed desires or other
                     ideological mechanisms.

                              the assumption that Caleb’s behavior can be attributed to personal idiosyncrasy or

                              influences of social and political institutions” (279), nonetheless mitigates Caleb’s
                              agency by asserting that “Caleb’s curiosity is not entirely governed by conscious
                              control: his instincts exceed his control and always drive him forward” (282). </span></div>

               </div>
               <p>Rather than attempting to ascribe some specific motive or desire to Caleb’s doubt,
                  it seems more productive to consider how the indeterminate nature of Caleb’s desire
                  itself generates an irresistible but problematic urge in the reader to doubt his motivations
                  even as Caleb’s desires remain inaccessible. Of course, as I have already suggested,
                  this lingering dissatisfaction with Caleb’s doubt is important in itself for the way
                  that it disrupts any moral or ethical certainties that might potentially be inferred
                  from Caleb’s act of discovering Falkland’s guilt. Even though, against the background
                  of the ineffective and compromised procedural doubt of the legal institution, Caleb’s
                  doubt somehow emerges as a <em>more</em> ethical response to judgment under uncertainty, the reader’s sense that Caleb’s doubt
                  is grounded in illegitimate desire—which remains even after Falkland confesses—makes
                  it difficult to attribute any ethical or legal value to his discovery. The ethical
                  dilemma manages to exceed the mutually exclusive logic of ethical judgment in a way
                  that evacuates it of its meaning. In this context it seems possible to say that Caleb’s
                  doubt is somehow unethical yet ethical, but to say this is to say nothing at all about
                  Caleb’s doubt. Instead, it is to demonstrate the insufficiency of these categories
                  themselves to respond to the complexity introduced by uncertainty. But it seems equally
                  important that this dissatisfaction—that is, the reader’s conviction that Caleb’s
                  doubt is somehow motivated by illegitimate desire—remains even as the reader has no
                  means of resolving the indeterminacy surrounding Caleb’s doubt-as-desire, no means
                  of confirming this suspicion. It reflects the extent to which the reader’s doubt is
                  itself unreasonable, propelled but also compromised by the desire to judge Caleb’s
                  actions finally as ethical or unethical, interested or disinterested. In this way,
                  the novel embraces the ethical dilemma presented by Caleb’s doubt as a productive
                  site of negativity and exploits it to sow a more fundamental doubt about the legitimacy
                  of ethical judgments, one captured in Caleb’s own progressive dissatisfaction with
                  his former belief that innocence and guilt were “things in the whole world most opposite
                  to each other” (243) as he discovers that such a belief is “impossible . . . to hold”
                  once one is “conversant with the passions and institutions of men” (404).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Coda: Romantic Doubt</span></h2>
               <p>While the striking deconstruction of eighteenth-century constructive skepticism <em>Caleb Williams</em> performs seems to be only a by-product of the novel’s more ambitious pursuit of the
                  destabilizing excesses of negativity, the presence and precision of that critique
                  suggest the potential for reading the form of doubt the novel recovers—what I have
                  characterized as doubt “before skepticism”—as a specifically “Romantic” form of doubt
                  that constitutes, to some extent, a Romantic reaction to the conservative and constructive
                  character of eighteenth-century rational skepticism. By characterizing this Romantic
                  doubt as a “reaction” to skepticism in this way, I expect readers to hear echoes of
                  Stanley Cavell’s interpretation of Romanticism as a response to Kant’s “settlement”
                  with skepticism. But, by recalling Cavell, my aim is also to demonstrate how this
                  form of Romantic doubt offers a significant challenge to Cavell’s thesis and, further,
                  reveals Cavell’s own conservative tendencies.</p>
               <p>To draw out this challenge, I want to focus on the way that Cavell constricts or limits
                  the possible forms that any Romantic “reaction” to—and, particularly, <em>against</em>—Kant’s settlement with skepticism might take. Cavell imagines the Romantic response
                  to Kant’s settlement to have two faces. One face, which Cavell calls “avoidance,”
                  registers a fundamental dissatisfaction with the limits Kant places on our ability
                  to access the thing-in-itself, while the other, which Cavell calls “acknowledgment,”
                  accepts the validity of and stability afforded by Kant’s limits on knowledge. In one
                  sense, Cavell sees these twin reactions as dynamically constructed and mutually reinforcing:
                  the Romantic “simultaneously craves [the] comfort [of Kant’s idea of limitation] and
                  crave[s] escape from its comfort . . . as if the one stance produced the wish for
                  the other” (32). But, in another, Cavell sees them as a two-phase progression that
                  amounts to a maturation. While Cavell empathizes with the Romantic response of “avoidance”
                  (“You don’t—do you?—have to be a romantic to feel sometimes about that settlement:
                  Thanks for nothing” [31]), it is evident that Cavell regards “acknowledgement” as
                  the more productive, mature, and theoretically interesting response. For whereas the
                  strategy of avoidance entails for Cavell pursuing the idle Romantic fantasies of animism
                  and solitude, the strategy of acknowledgement sets to the responsible tasks of accepting
                  and adjusting to the hard limits established by language as a social form and, further,
                  of working within these confines to remake and contribute to (ordinary) language so
                  that it reflects common interests and desires.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Cavell’s preferred project of acknowledgement and adjustment continues to influence
                     approaches to Romanticism in ways that testify to its critical sophistication and
                     potential. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                              (11)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a recent study informed by Cavell’s project of acknowledgment and adjustment,
                              see Nersessian, Utopia, Limited: Romanticism and Adjustment.</span></div>
                     </div> But one issue with Cavell’s interpretation is that, because he ultimately accepts
                     the philosophical authority of Kant’s settlement—he refers to it as “the most stable
                     philosophical settlement in the modern period” (31)—Cavell has a fairly limited conception
                     of what rejecting Kant’s settlement might entail. And he assumes, ultimately, that
                     Kant’s settlement sets the conditions for any response to it. Cavell’s strategy of
                     avoidance may have the Romantic reject the terms of Kant’s settlement, but only after
                     she has accepted Kant’s characterization of the problem of knowledge as valid and
                     authoritative (if only to overcome it on his terms). Yet, the negativity I have explored
                     in this essay points us to an alternative form the Romantic rejection of Kant’s settlement
                     might take. In this form, the Romantic’s dissatisfaction with Kant lies not with the
                     ways Kant’s limit cordons off certain knowledge or denies transcendence but in the
                     way that Kant’s settlement misrepresents the nature or extent of the threat to judgment
                     posed by uncertainty. Romantic doubt, as informed by negativity, does not reject Kant’s
                     limits themselves but rather rejects the false comfort with uncertainty and false
                     confidence in our ability to overcome its threat that those limits promote. Instead,
                     Romantic doubt would cultivate a discomfort with the risks uncertainty poses and sow
                     doubt about our ability to overcome or even know them. Romantic doubt is the “awful
                     doubt” (Shelley 77) of Shelley’s “Mont Blanc” that an unflinching view of Nature as
                     mystery recommends: a sense of doubt that is informed by an awe of uncertainty, that
                     stands in opposition to the mild “faith” in our ability to reconcile ourselves with
                     uncertainty through positive means, and that “but for such faith” would achieve this
                     (negative) reconciliation and likewise “. . . repeal / Large codes of fraud and woe”
                     (80–81). The discontent with “moral certainty” Romantic doubt names clarifies the
                     political and ethical charge of Keats’s formulation of negative capability as “being
                     in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and
                     reason” (492). From the perspective of Romantic doubt, Keats’s negative capability
                     does not recommend relinquishing our desire for absolute certainty or cultivating
                     an ease with uncertainty. Rather, it cautions against the “irritable,” false comfort
                     that follows from believing that we can conquer uncertainty through constructions
                     of fact and reason. It is a reminder that even to reach for fact or reason is to underestimate
                     the threat of uncertainty since our desire to overcome that threat always threatens
                     to persuade us we already have.</p>

               more with the novel’s engagement with legal epistemology rather than common law practice,
               its argument has affinities with Marshall’s claim that the novel’s legal preoccupations

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">After all, Kant’s aim is to reassure us that we can remain confident in our ability
               to employ our rational faculties to attain reliable knowledge about the phenomenal
               world of appearances as long as we accept our inability to know the world beyond appearances,
               in itself, as noumena. The formal parallels between Kant’s distinction between phenomena
               and noumena and the constructive skeptical distinction between moral and demonstrative
               certainty should be evident, as should be Kant’s parallel use of this distinction
               to justify judgment under uncertainty. Even the very tendency to contrast Kant’s critical
               project against Hume’s “radical” project reproduces precisely the same rhetoric I
               have identified with constructive skepticism above. And even though the exploratory
               and experimental nature of Hume’s skeptical philosophy affords many productive loose
               ends that may be pursued to more radical skeptical conclusions, Hume’s systematic
               project appears no less informed by constructive skepticism than Kant’s. Indeed, if
               we accept at face value Hume’s rejection of absolute or “academic” skepticism and
               his acceptance of a category of uncertain but indisputable knowledge (what Hume calls
               “proofs” as opposed to certain “demonstrations” or disputable “probabilities”), it
               seems plausible to suggest that no philosophical critique endemic to the eighteenth
               century remains untouched by the spirit of constructive skepticism.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Indeed, in his essayistic treatments of belief and doubt, Godwin does attempt to inject
               desire into rational skepticism, and briefly surveying the problems he encounters
               should illustrate how rational skepticism cannot accommodate the examination of doubt
               and desire the novel pursues. In “Essay of Skepticism,” for instance, Godwin works
               against the common assumption that skepticism must be “necessarily allied to coldness
               of character” and insists instead that skeptical inquiry must be imbued with an “ardour
               and animation” located between cold “indifference” and overheated “enthusiasm” (308).
               Even as the skeptic must be “careful not to suffer a predilection for one side of
               a question” (302) he is nonetheless “by no means inclined to hold himself in a state
               of equal indifference to all opinions” (304). Yet, Godwin seems well aware of problems
               of asserting the influence of interest or passion into rational skepticism in this
               way, a fact which comes through in his more downbeat essay, “On Belief.” There, the
               disinterested procedure posed as an ideal by skepticism seems to be inevitably thwarted
               by an insidious will to believe. For while Godwin insists that “we must be, at all
               times, and to the last hour of our existence, accessible to conviction built upon
               new evidence” (247) he also admits that when considering any consequential issue there
               appears to be “ever a secret influence urging me earnestly to desire to find one side
               of the question right and the other wrong” (249) and that “[t]hat which we wish to
               believe, we are already greatly in progress to embrace” (249).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               or “uncertainty” of evidence (Godwin <em>Political Justice </em>381, 401). For Godwin, since “[n]o principles of evidence have yet been laid down
               that are infallible” (78), the “veracity” and “competence” of witnesses as accurate
               and just observers must be subject to “continual doubt” (381).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
