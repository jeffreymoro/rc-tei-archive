            <p class="noCount">This article takes up the act of retreating or withdrawal as a way of reading the
               unpublished and published versions of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Christabel." Although
               Coleridge intended to publish "Christabel" in the second edition of the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> in 1800, the poem was withheld from publication until 1816 and further revised by
               Coleridge until 1834. Rather than reading revision as clarifying authorial intention,
               or seeing less revision as creating more indeterminacy, I see Coleridge's revisions
               to "Christabel" as representing revision in a third sense: considerable revision that
               appears insignificant but instead compounds the indeterminacy of the text's writing.
               Taking up Coleridge's addition of <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em> as well as the modifications to the primary scene of unreadability between Geraldine
               and Christabel, I argue that Coleridge's repeated retreating and returning to these
               scenes are symptomatic of a traumatic relation that cannot be read in terms of authorial
               intention, but rather, in the words of Catherine Malabou, as an involuntary retreat
               that "the psyche cannot stage . . . for itself" (Malabou 9).</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <p>The idea for this essay emerged because of an article by Catherine Malabou in the
                  journal <em>Public</em> entitled “Is Retreat a Metaphor?” (2014). Retreat, it is true, is an act, but a negative
                  one that negates even the decision to retreat, because “there can be no retreat,”
                  in Malabou’s words, “without a retreat of the retreat itself, no retreat without a
                  re-doubling, to the extent that the only gesture or move retreating can perform is
                  to perform nothing, that is, to retreat” (“Retreat” 35). For Malabou, the retreat
                  cannot be economized. Retreating does not, then, perform the move of withdrawing,
                  as in the negative ebb to the positive flow of the ocean, and neither is it a remove
                  from the profanity of the world towards some posited purity in absolute privacy. In
                  contrast, the retreat demonstrates effectively “what it is not, that is . . . [not]
                  a form of presence, be it God, substance, or reality” (“Retreat” 35). Much like what
                  Derrida says of literature, there is in the retreat, “a chance of saying everything
                  without touching upon the secret” of the retreat, for in the act of retreating, the
                  retreat itself remains perpetually barred (“Retreat” 29).</p>
               <p>Though not mentioned in Malabou’s article, Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe
                  had earlier theorized an alternative version of the retreat in <em>Le Retrait du Politique</em> (1997). Their position remains tentatively hopeful, for the “retreat,” according
                  to Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe, “makes something appear or sets something free,” not
                  “according to the rule of a nostalgic lamentation for what would have drawn back . . .
                  but according to the hypothesis that this retreat must allow, or even impose, the
                  tracing anew of the stakes of the political” (131). Rather than take a position, they
                  argue for a “<em>de</em>-<em>position</em>” as a sort of <span class="foreign">Aufhebung</span> that thinks the limits of the political and the philosophical while still holding
                  both in reserve for something yet to come (94). The hopefulness that is sketched out
                  by this idea of the retreat relies on the possibility of retracing a new ground for
                  the political, as both theorists argue in another essay, “The Jewish People Do Not
                  Dream”: “[t]o draw back [<span class="foreign">se retirer</span>] is not to disappear, and <em>is</em> not, strictly speaking, any mode of being. . . . [T]he <span class="foreign">retrait</span> is the action of disappearing appearing,” which means that one does not merely “appear
                  <em>in </em>disappearing,” but rather one “appear[s] <em>as</em> disappearance” (qtd. in Sparks x).</p>
               <p>In her own way, Malabou recognizes Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe by means of Derrida,
                  as she mentions that Derrida notes, in “The Retreat of Metaphor,” that the limits
                  that separate authenticity and inauthenticity have become “absolutely porous” (Malabou,
                  “Retreat” 37). Malabou continues that this results in an “aporia [that] does not equate
                  [to] an impossibility,” but rather allows for the possibility to “still invent a new
                  meaning for a retreat, . . . open a new possibility of withdrawing . . . [for] something
                  yet to come,” or as Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe would say, clear the ground for a new
                  encounter at “the incision” of the retreat (Malabou “Retreat” 37, Nancy &amp; Lacoue-Labarthe
                  133). However, Malabou herself withdraws performatively, as her text moves from the
                  conditional tense of the “I would have liked to dwell” towards, as she says, an other
                  Catherine, one enveloped involuntarily that “suddenly become[s] motionless and speechless,
                  “ one that “would lie in bed often with her eyes open but with a blank facial expression,”
                  only to return again to the anxious hopefulness of the conditional tense (“Retreat”
                  36). If Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy wish to retreat as a means towards de-positioning,
                  Malabou’s performance demonstrates the fragility that underscores de-position’s purposelessness;
                  the retreat cannot be intentional, according to Malabou, for from where would one
                  have the authority to withdraw, to retreat from the political in order to re-treat
                  it? </p>
               <p>While Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe are concerned with re-treating the political––which
                  Malabou categorizes along the lines of several voluntary and intentional retreats
                  of past figures such as Maurice Blanchot, Alexander Grothendiek, and Thomas Bernhard––Malabou’s
                  concern is with the retreat as something that is accidental, making retreat impossible
                  as a result of its traumatic immediacy. For Malabou, the retreat, then, is not something
                  chosen because the subject is indifferent to the retreat. She writes that “indifference”
                  is “undecided, unvoluntary, non-chosen,” while its “rhetoric comprises figures of
                  interruption, pauses, caesuras––the blank spaces that emerge when the network of connections
                  is shredded or when the circulation of energy is paralyzed” (“Retreat” 41). She further
                  elaborates this position of indifference in <em>Ontology of the Accident</em> (2012), where she distinguishes indifference from sorrow: indifference “is the suffering
                  caused by an absence of suffering,” a suffering in which pain “manifests as indifference
                  to pain, impassivity, forgetting, the loss of symbolic reference points” (Malabou,
                  <em>Ontology </em>18). Finally, in <em>The New Wounded</em> (2012), the retreat’s affective mode of indifference is linked to the indifference
                  that arises after neuronal trauma or the trauma of the accident, as distinct from
                  the definition of trauma offered by traditional psychoanalysis. Trauma, which is associated
                  with “permanent or temporary behaviors of <em>indifference </em>or <em>disaffection</em>,” “thus designates the wound that results from an effraction––an ‘effraction’ that
                  can be physical (a ‘patent’ wound) or psychical. In either case, trauma names a shock
                  that forces open or pierces a protective barrier” (Malabou, <em>New Wounded </em>10, 6). Whereas Freud may emphasize that trauma is endogenous to the psyche, Malabou
                  expands on Freud’s analysis by including the exogenous causes of trauma by integrating
                  recent studies in neurology. In this sense, Malabou’s definition of trauma recognizes
                  that the alterations to the ego that are caused by external trauma have the potential
                  to “manifest themselves as an <em>unprecedented metamorphosis </em>of the patient’s identity,” effectively creating a new person that is cut off from
                  their past selves (<em>New Wounded </em>15). Trauma, then, becomes something “the psyche cannot stage . . . for itself” (Malabou,
                  <em>New Wounded </em>9). Because of this change that results in an indifference or disaffection, any agency
                  linking the subject to the retreat has been shattered, so that there is no longer
                  any possibility for re-treating the political. In the case of the traumatic event
                  that is exogenous to the psyche, one cannot speak of the intentional retreat; rather,
                  one can only identify the involuntary retreat that is seen in the destructive negativity
                  and unproductivity of trauma, which nullifies the circulation of desire.</p>
               <p>Because Coleridge withheld “Christabel” from publication for seventeen years, it is
                  not only necessary to re-analyze the act of withholding as a retreat of a voluntary
                  kind, but also to consider the retreat as that which is indifferent with regard to
                  the imperative towards productivity implied by the act of publication. The non-publication
                  of “Christabel” poses a problem because it begs the question: what was Coleridge trying
                  to preserve by withholding “Christabel,” and from what was he retreating? Furthermore,
                  it leads us to ask: can we even read the decision to withhold a text from publication?
                  And if so, how can we read the negativity of that which appears only by not appearing,
                  that is the immaterial, which is and is not there? And yet, because we cannot read
                  that which is not there, I intend to read the different versions of “Christabel” before
                  and after publication as a way of developing the concept of the retreat; for, if Derrida
                  is correct to state that the line between the public and the private is absolutely
                  porous, the unpublished versions that come before the first published edition in 1816
                  mark a way of reading Coleridge’s retreat from publication in the sense of Malabou’s
                  failure of the retreat more than Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe’s re-treating the political.

               <h2><span class="head">A Practical and Theoretical Approach to Revision</span></h2>
               <p>Before turning to an analysis of “Christabel,” it is necessary to outline its textual
                  history. Thanks to the work of Jack Stillinger, whose <em>Coleridge and Textual Instability</em> (1994) lays the groundwork for all further studies on the versions of “Christabel,”
                  we have available the most well-composed textual and compositional history of the
                  poem. Stillinger outlines the poem’s textual history from its earliest stages all
                  the way to the final versions that Coleridge was involved in revising: <span class="quote">‘For “Christabel,” which Coleridge began writing in 1798, expanded in 1800, and then
                     tinkered with, but never completed, all the rest of his life, we have or can reconstruct
                     some eighteen versions, but almost certainly there once existed several more than
                     that in sources now lost. To begin with, we know of nine manuscript versions (or partial
                     versions earlier than the first printed text of 1816: a holograph fair copy of the
                     equivalent of 1–655 (that is, part 1, the conclusion to part 1, and part 2) at Victoria
                     College, Toronto (CoS 52); transcripts of the same span, 1–655, by Dorothy Wordsworth
                     and Mary Hutchinson among the Wordsworth papers at Dove Cottage, Grasmere (CoS 51),
                     Sara Hutchinson (at Yale, CoS 53), Sara Fricker Coleridge, the poet’s wife (at the
                     University of Texas, Collection, CoS 55 and 58), and an unidentified copyist (at the
                     Bodleian Library, CoS 59); readings from a now-lost holograph reported by John Payne
                     Collier in his preface to Coleridge’s <em>Seven Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton </em>(1856); and the quotation of 656–77, which later became the conclusion to part 2,
                     in Coleridge’s letter to Southey of 6 May 1801 (<em>CL</em>, 2:278). The first printed text, in the <em>Christabel</em> volume issued by Byron’s publisher, John Murrary, in May 1816 (<em>1816</em>), can count as the tenth version. There are at least five subsequent versions constituted
                     by changes and additions that Coleridge and others entered by hand in copies of 1816
                     [(CoS 60, CoS 61, CoS 62, CoS 63, CoS 64)]. The last three versions are the texts
                     in <em>1828</em>, <em>1829</em>, and <em>1834</em>. (<em>Coleridge</em> 79)’</span> Stillinger’s position regarding the versions is two-fold. First, because Coleridge
                  revised his texts so many times throughout his life, Stillinger argues that “the longstanding
                  practice of identifying definitiveness with ‘final authorial intention’ is no longer
                  defensible” (<em>Coleridge </em>10). Second, Stillinger suggests that a practical theory of versions should adopt
                  an approach of “textual pluralism,” which would make “every separate version” have
                  the right to “its [own] separate legitimacy,” so that “all authoritative versions
                  [would be] equally authoritative” (<em>Coleridge</em> 121). This position, similar to those propounded by “James Thorpe in the 1960s and
                  then developed and championed . . . in Germany by Hans Zeller, in the United States
                  by Jerome McGann, Donald Reiman, [and] Peter Shillingsburg,” would thus displace final
                  authorial intention, and finally take into account the fact that authors revise (<em>Coleridge </em>121).</p>
               <p>Revision, therefore, becomes a sign that allows one to read the differences in versions
                  as not better or worse, because these versions are legitimate, discrete authoritative
                  works in themselves. Stillinger compares writers who revise—such as Coleridge—to writers
                  who revise very little, for example John Keats. What is most remarkable about the
                  latter is “Keats’s facility in drafting upon, or for, an occasion” all at once, and
                  the fact that “there is practically no evidence that he wrote his longer or more ambitious
                  poems in any other way” (<em>Coleridge </em>102–03). On the other hand, Coleridge’s revisionary practice is a way for Stillinger,
                  according to his “Old Critical and . . . New Textual point of view,” to read authorial
                  intention into the revisions Coleridge made to his texts (<em>Coleridge </em>100). The spontaneity with which Keats wrote his poems stands in contrast, for Stillinger,
                  to Coleridge’s inveterate revising. For instance, Stillinger quotes a letter Coleridge
                  wrote to Joseph Cottle on February 1797: “‘I torture the poem, and myself, with corrections;
                  and what I write in an hour, I sometimes take two or three days in correcting,’ such
                  as is the case with ‘The Religious Musings, [which] I have altered monstrously’ (<em>CIL</em>, 1: 309)” (qtd. in Stillinger <em>Coleridge </em>104). In this sense, Coleridge’s mode of composition required of him to become both
                  “critic<em>and interpreter</em> of what he had initially created without a plan, and now, in these subsequent stages
                  of writing, <em>added authorial intention</em> that was not consciously present in the original composition” (Stillinger, <em>Coleridge </em>107). In order to account for revision while still maintaining authorial intention,
                  Stillinger thus states that one can read revision as adding in authorial intention
                  to a text that seemingly showed an unclear authorial intention at the outset of composition.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>That Coleridge revised “Christabel” many times is clear from the many versions before
                     and after publication. And yet, the revisions Coleridge made to “Christabel” were
                     so minimal, changing a word here, a comma there,

                              after the text is given over to the public. In this sense, Coleridge’s withholding
                              shows a markedly different form of revision that attempts to maintain a personal connection

                     Stillinger adds as he theorizes the revisions Coleridge made to “Christabel” and “Kubla
                     Khan”: <span class="quote">‘If there is a causal relationship––in Coleridge’s not rewriting the two poems [“Christabel”

                        a tentative generalization is in order: the more revision in a Coleridge poem, the
                        greater the likelihood of receiving determinate (authorial) meanings––and, conversely,
                        the less revision, the greater the indeterminacy. (<em>Coleridge </em>246)’</span> However, the differences and repetitions involved in returning, retracing, or re-treating
                     “Christabel” show that there is something that perhaps gripped Coleridge in a third
                     sense that even Stillinger, despite the modification he makes to his own argument,
                     has not yet taken into account. For if the quantity of revision in a Coleridge poem
                     should indicate more determinate authorial intention, and if less revision indicates
                     a more indeterminate intention, Stillinger does not account for the fact that in “Christabel”
                     there is considerable revision that appears <em>insignificant </em>but still compounds the indeterminacy of the text’s meaning. If we invert Stillinger’s
                     argument, this third sense of revision is defined by changes whose negativity turns
                     over and over again around an insoluble secret which retreats from the author, thereby
                     substituting the fetish of revision for clarification. Despite his claiming that he
                     had a clear intention in his mind, “Christabel” appeared to have a libidinal hold
                     on Coleridge that he could not quite shake, as can be seen in his inability to truly
                     revise the poem, that is, not until his first attempt to relinquish it by giving it
                     over to the public by means of its publication in 1816. In this manner, the endless
                     revisions delayed ever having to end the poem, and thus prolonged Coleridge’s libidinal
                     relation to the text, since, in the words of Žižek in <em>Looking Awry</em> (1991), desire “does not consist in its being ‘fulfilled,’‘fully satisfied,’” but
                     “coincides rather with the reproduction of desire as such, with its circular movement”

                  <p>Coleridge, as many know, had at best an ambivalent relationship with the public sphere
                     in England. “The word ‘public,’ he claimed, was ‘of pernicious effect by habituating
                     every Reader to consider himself as the Judge &amp; therefore Superior of the Writer,’”
                     and Coleridge believed, in the words of Lucy Newlyn, that “readers were . . . appealed

                              generally in terms of Romanticism and its relation to “publics” and “counter-publics.”
                              For instance, the intentional act of withholding a work from publication shows that
                              the unpublished is at times dialectically related to the published in the same way
                              that spheres of the counter-public attempt to respond to the hegemony of the public

                     </div> can seemingly be read as a dismissal of his early communitarian ideals such as his
                     scheme with Robert Southey to establish a Pantisocracy; this dismissal, it would seem,
                     is further reinforced by his later desire for the establishment of the “clerisy” class
                     in <em>On the Constitution of Church and State</em> (1829). As Jon Klancher notes in <em>The Making of English Reading Audiences</em> (1980), Coleridge’s “clerics were meant to be . . . masters of interpretation,” that
                     is, they were meant to take possession of what could be read, “to rule in and rule
                     out the possible readings of social and cultural discourse,” effectively mirroring
                     Coleridge’s relationship with his own texts as simultaneous critic and interpreter
                     (5, 136). However, as Newlyn argues, “[i]f Coleridge’s ideas about literary ownership
                     reflected his political ambivalence, more generally, towards the idea of property,
                     they can also be read as paradigmatic of the transitional status of the author at
                     the time <em>Biographia </em>was published” (69). What Newlyn shows is that Coleridge’s anxiety over the reader
                     is not merely an anxiety concerning his work’s reception by the public sphere; his
                     anxiety was both internal and external. The unpublishability of “Christabel” directly
                     threatens Coleridge’s idea of a class of readers that have the ability to judge and
                     interpret texts, and, therefore, represents a danger to himself and to the very community
                     of the clerisy that he envisions. Coleridge’s retreat can then be read as symptomatic
                     of his growing anxiety over the poet’s failure to critically engage with and direct
                     the constitution of that public sphere, because “Christabel” is as much about a neurotic
                     obsession over an unconstitutable negativity as it is a repression of that negativity,
                     confronting its readers with a poem that remains consumed with an anxiety regarding
                     its own publishability. Taken this way, Coleridge’s decision to finally publish the
                     poem in 1816 may be read not only as a historical fact, but can be read through the
                     lens of Lacanian anxiety, as Žižek argues, because “it is not the lack of the object
                     that gives rise to anxiety but, on the contrary, the danger of our getting too close
                     to the object and thus losing the lack itself”; taken this way, Coleridge’s anxious
                     revisions provide insight into the complex relation that anxiety has to desire at
                     the level of publication, as “[a]nxiety is brought on by the disappearance of desire”

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Through withholding a work from publication, the negative right to retreat not only
                     disturbs the notion of work as a material object, but also deconstructs the insistence
                     of public sphere theorists––such as Jürgen Habermas and Clifford Siskin––that literature
                     must be interpreted as a work of writing under a discourse of the professionalization
                     of the author. Even in its early conception, “Christabel” was defined by its own unpublishability.
                     The poem was originally planned for the second volume of the 1800 version of the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, but instead was replaced with Wordsworth’s “Michael,” which Wordsworth quickly finished
                     off in order to fill in the gap. The reason for the replacement is not known, but
                     we do know that Wordsworth, in a letter to his publishers, Longman and Rees, stated,
                     “upon mature deliberation I found that the Style of this Poem was so discordant from
                     my own that it could not be printed along with my poems with any propriety” (qtd.
                     in Gamer and Porter 31). After 1800, Coleridge circulated and performed versions of
                     “Christabel” for friends and family, and, as Christopher Laxer notes, the poem gained
                     popularity among the British reading public due to the fact that Coleridge “controlled
                     all access to his poem and could frame the perception of it in any way he liked” (169).
                     However, while Laxer argues that Coleridge held on to “Christabel” because “publication
                     itself shines a destructive and leveling sort of light” (176), one could argue that
                     Coleridge began to lose control over “Christabel” well before its publication, at
                     both the level of writing as well as at the level of performance. Indeed, Walter Scott
                     did not hear it first from Coleridge, but from Sarah Stoddart in 1802, showing that
                     well before its publication the poem had already begun to circulate outside of Coleridge’s
                     immediate control. Furthermore, the impression that “Christabel” left on Scott was
                     seen not only in its metrical resonances in <em>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</em>, but also in Scott’s recitation of the poem, which, it turns out, was how Lord Byron
                     had “first heard the poem . . . at his publisher Murray’s house on Albermale street,”
                     which in turn is the reason for Byron’s involvement in putting Coleridge in touch
                     with Murray, who later published the poem in 1816 (Laxer 170). Indeed, Coleridge,
                     when he first wrote the <em>Preface</em> to “Christabel” for its initial publication, “feared his own work would appear derivative
                     of precisely those poems and poetic identities that it had helped to shape” (28),
                     as Tilar Mazzeo notes in <em>Plagiarism and Literary Property in the Romantic Period</em> (2007). Mazzeo continues, “Christabel” “had been widely circulated in manuscript among
                     the literary coterie, and, as Coleridge knew, the poem had influenced the compositions
                     of some of his more celebrated contemporaries, including Lord Byron and Walter Scott”
                     (27). For this reason, Coleridge ends his preface to “Christabel” with a “doggerel
                     version of two monkish Latin hexameters”:

                     </blockquote> From one perspective, Coleridge’s decision to withhold “Christabel” from publication
                     can be read as an attempt to preserve a relationship between author and text. But
                     every time Coleridge returns to the text, it signals a further loss of authority.
                     It is important to note that the decision to remove the poem from <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> arose out of an agreement between Coleridge and Wordsworth, allowing us to read this
                     decision to quarantine the poem not only as a means to preserve Wordsworth’s style,
                     but also to preserve Coleridge’s own. While “Wordsworth’s exclusion” of the poem,
                     argues Jerome Christensen, “registers the threat that [“Christabel”] represented as <em>text</em> (and, in the character of Geraldine as performative theory of the rhetorical power
                     of texts) to the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> as book,” the non-publication of “Christabel” was also extended to Coleridge’s other
                     publications, when Coleridge did not include the poem in the quarto volume containing
                     “Fears in Solitude” (217). And when “Christabel” was finally published alongside “Kubla
                     Khan” and “The Pains of Sleep,” it is telling that Coleridge did not try to publish
                     the poems as a book, but rather, as Stillinger has called it in <em>Romantic Complexity</em>, “a pamphlet,” a medium of print that, ever since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
                     because of the influence of Calvin and Luther, was overwhelmingly political (<em>Romantic Complexity </em>163). The pamphlet, as Laurel Brake argues, is profoundly dialogic and in “dialogue
                     with other agents of print and speech,” and to quote Orwell in Brake’s essay, “it
                     is written because there is something that one wants to say now . . . in essence it
                     is always a protest” (3).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>And yet, the pamphlet is also closer to the fragment

                              to mention some of the most important work on the Romantic fragment, such as Marjorie
                              Levinson’s The Romantic Fragment Poem: A Critique of a Form (1978) and Thomas McFarland’s

                              that “Christabel” evokes the externally unintended, unanticipated, and traumatic sense
                              of Malabou’s use of the term “effraction,” which requires a shift of f…</span></div>
                     </div> or even the manuscript than to the serialized publication or the book, since pamphlets
                     were “normally unbound . . . [and] not always aimed at public, or <em>wide circulation</em>” (Brake 8). Indeed, as is shown in a letter Coleridge wrote to Sarah Stoddart in
                     1803, Coleridge’s intention to publish “Christabel” remained always in flux. Insofar
                     as he considered publishing it, his plan was at least never to put it in a “guinea
                     volume,” as Karen Swann notes: Coleridge “[refused] Sotheby and the ten gentlemen
                     [that accompanied him], [so that] Coleridge [stood] on his literary principles” and
                     would rather have “Christabel” published on Ballad paper (397). Thus on the one hand,
                     the pamphlet, like the ballad sheet, is still aligned with the publicity of print
                     and is categorically different from the private circulation of manuscript culture.
                     But, on the other hand, if the pamphlet remains a medium of print that is devoted
                     to protest, it also troubles the Habermasian conception of the public sphere, which,
                     as Lee Morrissey argues, is based on the false “presumption of a mutually reinforcing
                     relationship between literary criticism and democracy” (2). Instead, the publication
                     of “Christabel” in the form of a pamphlet participates in and simultaneously questions
                     the very form in which the public sphere is constituted, inasmuch as Coleridge attempts
                     to publish a text that thematizes its own retreat from the circulation of a symbolic
                     order. The medium of the pamphlet invites readers to consider the relationship between
                     literature and the public sphere as one that is not mutually reinforcing, but rather
                     unstable and even antagonistic, since the pamphlet’s engagement with the political
                     does not have the transparency of a Habermasian communicative rationality. Much like
                     de Man’s conception of language, which “combines a logical side, which it is possible
                     to decode, and a ‘tropological’ or metaphorical side, which stays as a ‘residue of
                     indetermination’ after a decoding of the grammar has occurred,” Morrissey argues that
                     literature opens the political to that which is left unread, which results in the
                     paradox: “the avoidance of one side of the meaning is unavoidable” (9). As opposed
                     to Coleridge’s hope that the clerisy would be able to become critic and interpreter
                     for the public sphere, the revisions he made to “Christabel” before and after publication
                     thus commit him to a different conception of the political and the public sphere that
                     remains under erasure. Because of the act of revision, as well as the choice of publishing
                     in the form of the pamphlet, the boundary between the published and the unpublished,
                     or the public sphere and the (un)public sphere remains in question, leaving open the
                     indeterminacy that ungrounds them both.</p>

                     comes in the form of <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em>, which was originally from a letter addressed to Robert Southey dated May 6th, 1801,
                     and which was later transposed into the first published version in 1816. <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em> of “Christabel” is so strangely placed that it somehow appears out of place. Indeed,
                     if we compare the 1816 version of the poem with its prior versions, there is no Conclusion
                     of any kind, so that the <span class="foreign">avant-texte</span> provides us with a more formally fragmentary and unstable poem; even the first of
                     two transcripts by Sarah Stoddart ends with the words, “A fragment” (Stillinger, <em>Coleridge</em> 214). In a poem so obscurely uncertain of itself, the <em>Conclusion</em> appears as yet another failed attempt made by Coleridge to close off the poem and
                     make it ready for the public. And yet, this crossing-out or repression of the poem’s
                     fragmentary condition indicates an attempt at “a mechanism of production” (Bellemin-Noël
                     6), because “[negation],” as Freud has noted, “is a way of taking cognizance of what
                     is repressed; indeed it is already a lifting of the repression, though not, of course,
                     an acceptance of what is repressed” (235–36). Because the transcripts leave the reader
                     with Sir Leoline leading forth Geraldine, and because the narrator of <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em> appears unwilling to admit the psychological trauma that is central to the text yet
                     exceeds the limits that <em>The Conclusion </em>attempts to impose, Christabel seems more abjected in the first published version
                     of 1816 than in the various earlier versions. Rather than concluding the poem, then, <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second </em>disfigures the very possibility of completion, for it replaces the thematic of the
                     mother and daughter relationship found in <em>The Conclusion to Part the First</em> and substitutes the Wandering Mother for the Name of the Father. When Christabel confronts
                     Sir Leoline, entreating him to send Geraldine away, we do not see a resolution, but
                     instead the Baron is revolted by his own daughter, as the narrator explains, “[i]f
                     thoughts, like these, had any share, / They only swell’d his rage and pain, / And
                     did but work confusion there” (“Christabel” 625–27). This rage Sir Leoline feels is
                     fueled by Christabel’s perceived incongruity with the symbolic order, which the father
                     wishes to establish by means of exchanging Geraldine for the renewed friendship of
                     Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine, a friendship long lost that left a hole in both
                     men’s hearts “[l]ike cliffs which had been rent asunder” (“Christabel” 410). Since
                     “never either found another / [t]o free the hollow heart from paining” (“Christabel”
                     407–08), Geraldine functions as a means of re-establishing discourse between the two
                     men, and thereby restoring the homosocial bond with Lord Roland by means of the feminine
                     signifier. As Kristeva says of the father’s relation to the abject in <em>Powers of Horror</em> (1982), “a representative of the paternal function takes the place of the good maternal
                     object that is wanting,” resulting in discourse “being substituted for maternal care”
                     (45). What <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em> effectively represses is not merely Christabel, but the conflict that is staged at
                     the end of <em>Part the Second</em>, that is the conflict between speech and the unspeakable. Taken this way, the repression
                     of Christabel’s inability to speak results in the text’s missed opportunity to engage
                     with the retreating retreat, which then haunts the poem in Coleridge’s repeated attempts
                     to revise the poem.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Arguably the narrator of <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em> is “Coleridge,” inserting himself to limit the poem by means of form and genre, and
                  is separate from the narration that is present throughout <em>Part the First</em>, <em>The Conclusion to Part the First</em>, and <em>Part the Second</em>. While both narrators are characterized by a tendency to repress that which they
                  cannot accept, the first narrator appears at least willing to show but not tell, while
                  the second narrator appears to downplay the experience of Christabel altogether, and
                  instead shifts the perspective to the experience of the father as a kind of substitute
                  for the authority of the writer. That <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em> also originates from a letter Coleridge wrote to Southey is yet another indication
                  of Coleridge’s new presence at the end of the poem. Much like the way <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em> focuses on the role of the father as a means of further shifting focus away from
                  “Christabel”’s unfinished ending, the fact that Coleridge replaces the more descriptive
                  narration of the first narrator with a theorization on the “words of unmeant bitterness”
                  (“Christabel” 652) indicates a retreat away from the unconscious of the text; for
                  even in <em>The Conclusion to Part the First</em>, the narrator appears unwilling to tell but still knows of the “sorrow and shame”
                  (“Christabel” 296) that had taken place between Christabel and Geraldine. Even in
                  the <em>Biographia</em>, Coleridge attempts to downplay the spectral presence of the unknown in “Christabel”,
                  describing it rather as a “work . . . that pretended to be nothing more than a common
                  Faery Tale” (238). <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em> also presents Coleridge explicitly attempting to impose the generic form of the fairy
                  tale to “Christabel,”</p>

               <p> But what is it that Christabel finds? On the contrary, is she not seeking something
                  at the beginning of the poem? One can see the split in the narration between that
                  which comes before and after <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em>, as the first narrator even admits his confusion as to why Christabel is seeking
                  something that “makes her in the wood so late, / A furlong from the castle gate” (“Christabel”
                  25–26), while the second narrator, “Coleridge,” seems to have a slightly sadistic
                  relation to Christabel’s desolation, as can be gleaned from the assertion that it
                  is “tender too and pretty / [a]t each wild word to feel within / A sweet recoil of
                  love and pity” (“Christabel” 672–74). But while the narrators of the poem fail to
                  recognize that Christabel seeks recognition––which she finds in the figure of Geraldine,
                  though negatively––they, along with Geraldine as “A sight to dream of, not to tell!”
                  (“Christabel” 248), and the Wandering Mother that only Geraldine seems capable of
                  seeing and interacting with, are symptoms of Coleridge’s repression of the absence
                  that the text does not or cannot speak. For the first narrator describes the traumatic
                  encounter but does not seem to realize that it has taken place, whereas the second
                  narrator attempts to sentimentalize the poem as a means of containing the trauma that
                  comes through at the level of writing; for the second narrator is not willing to give
                  voice to the trauma of the text, though it is recognized negatively by means of the
                  addition of <em>The Conclusion to Part the Second</em>, which represses the ending of <em>Part the Second</em> . This traumatic absence comes through, and “even contrives,” to quote J.C.C. Mays,
                  “to become a metrical event” in the tale, so “that the true subject of the poem is
                  only part-contained in words” (72). For instance, the em-dash that occurs when Christabel
                  first hears the moan on the other side of the old oak tree, “It moan’d as near, as
                  near can be, / But what it is, she cannot tell,—” (“Christabel” 41–42) the break in
                  narration at line 42 implies the unknown known of the text, that is, in the words
                  of Joel Faflak, the “de-humanizing generation of affect that resists intellectual
                  or textual containment” (145).</p>
               <p>Whereas Coleridge’s non-publication of “Christabel” could be read as a voluntary retreat,
                  a decision to withhold the poem from the public as a means to contain its fragmentary
                  condition, the publication of the poem presents the reading public with the involuntary
                  retreat of Christabel as subject. This involuntary retreat clashes with the assumed
                  Romantic retreat of the poet from the world of politics into nature, as Christabel
                  does not retreat as a placeholder or reserve to re-treat the political “world of death”
                  (Coleridge 321). Christabel’s withdrawal signals a way of reading the retreat at a
                  further remove from historicist narratives that read Romanticism as an intentional
                  retreat away from the public, because “Christabel” as text and Christabel as character
                  both present specifically involuntary examples of the retreat that do not conform
                  to preconceived Romantic shelters in the natural or the transcendental, thus forcing
                  us to re-think these issues more generally. Consequently, the difference between the
                  voluntary and involuntary here shows that the initial retreat of non-publication still
                  implies a will to power, a hope for completion, and for an end to the infinite project
                  of writing that is implied in Coleridge’s <em>Preface</em> to the poem. There, he writes, <span class="quote">‘But as, in my very first conception of the tale, I had the whole present to my mind,
                     with the wholeness, no less than with the liveliness of a vision; I trust that I shall
                     be able to embody in verse the three parts yet to come, in the course of the present
                     year. (<em>Preface</em> 161)’</span> It is telling that by the last version that Coleridge revised, which was printed
                  in 1834, this sentence was not included in the text’s <em>Preface</em>. Instead, what we are left with is Christabel’s involuntary withdrawal from language
                  “in the touch” of Geraldine’s “bosom” that becomes the “lord of [Christabel’s] utterance”
                  (“Christabel” 255–56).</p>
               <p>This scene has its parallel with Hegel’s description of the master-slave dialectic
                  in <em>The Phenomenology of Spirit</em> (1807). There, Hegel argues that once the difference between master and slave is
                  achieved, the dialectic gives way to a new moment when “servitude in its consummation
                  will really turn into the opposite of what it immediately is; [because] as a consciousness
                  forced back into itself, it will withdraw into itself and be transformed by independent
                  consciousness” (117). It is then that the difference is negated once again, resulting
                  in a negation of the previous negation, which is meant to provide the grounds for
                  liberated consciousness. Christabel’s withdrawal, on the other hand, appears to show
                  that the involuntariness of that retreat presents itself as an effraction that results
                  in disaffection, neutrality, and the inevitability of abjection. Instead of the liberation
                  of consciousness Hegel describes, Geraldine is not present for her, because she is
                  rather another symptom of absence, so that Christabel’s encounter with Geraldine eliminates
                  and voids recognition as evidenced by the effect of Geraldine’s “serpent’s eye” upon
                  Christabel.</p>

               <p> Rather than interiorizing Geraldine as other in the way that Hegel expects, Christabel
                  internalizes Geraldine’s absence, because Geraldine represents in the text an absence
                  in the form of the Lacanian <span class="foreign">objet petit a</span>. In Žižek’s words: <span class="quote">‘[T]he object <span class="foreign">a</span> is always by <em>definition</em>, perceived in a distorted way, because outside this distortion, “in itself,” <em>it does not exist</em>, since it is <em>nothing but </em>the embodiment, the materialization of this very distortion, of this surplus of confusion
                     and perturbation introduced by desire into so-called “object-reality. (Žižek 12)’</span> It is for this reason that the narrator shies away from telling the reader what Christabel
                  herself sees, because Geraldine must never be looked at directly; for if seen, Geraldine
                  could no longer be the “lord of thy utterance” and the mechanism by which language
                  continues to circulate and thus perpetuate the symbolic (“Christabel” 256).</p>

               <p>“Geraldine,” as Coleridge told Henry Nelson Coleridge in July of 1833, “so far as
                  she goes, is successful”; but the success, the achievement that is Geraldine, stands
                  in contrast to Coleridge’s failure to complete the three parts yet to come. <span class="quote">‘[T]he reason for my not finishing Christabel is not that I don’t know how to do it;
                     for I have, as I always had, the whole plan entire from beginning to end in my mind;
                     but I fear I could not carry on with equal success the execution of the Idea– the
                     most difficult, I think, that can be attempted to Romantic Poetry–I mean witchery
                     by daylight. (<em>Table Talk </em>1: 409–10)’</span> The missing parts to “Christabel” have become a kind of trope at the level of composition
                  for reading the poem as a failure, partly due to Coleridge’s habit of constantly telling
                  people that he had “the whole present to [his] mind, with the wholeness, no less than
                  with the liveliness of a vision” (<em>Preface </em>161). But the publication of “Christabel” alongside “Kubla Khan” and “The Pains of
                  Sleep” indicates a thematic ambivalence with respect to making known the unknown that
                  these texts seem to communicate at the level of affect. For instance, the affect in
                  “Kubla Khan” is nostalgic, as the narrative voice asks itself if it is possible to
                  accomplish its desire, the narrator questioning, “[c]ould I revive within me / Her
                  symphony and song / . . . I would build that dome in air” (“Kubla Khan” 42–43, 46);
                  and, in “The Pains of Sleep,” what is communicated is the affective anxiety that comes
                  from desiring to withdraw from “[d]eeds to be hid which were not hid, / Which all
                  confused I could not know, / Whether I suffered, or I did” (“The Pains of Sleep” 27–29).
                  Until the pamphlet’s first printing, one could read the retreat from publication as
                  a desire to withhold—to be with and to hold on to—these poems, both out of a desire
                  for completion and because of Coleridge’s fascination with the poem, for Coleridge
                  was in many ways compelled to recite “Christabel” “in societies of the most different
                  kinds” (<em>Biographia</em> 238). And yet the act of publication, if we take the verb “to publish” literally
                  in its meaning “to make something public” or “to make something known,” can be read
                  as Coleridge’s attempt to retreat from his relation to the poem, as he literally gives
                  over “Christabel” to the public, which would be in line with Peter Melville’s approach
                  to reading Coleridge’s poetics “through the fort-da mechanism” (107). If the figure
                  of Geraldine is the success of “Christabel,” perhaps the failure to write the next
                  three parts is due to the effect of representing that “witchery by daylight,” resulting
                  in a text that is mesmerized by but can never actually speak its desire. As <span class="foreign">objet petit a</span>, Geraldine stands for the absolute negativity of the Real, but, by the same token,
                  remains a part of the text so as to generate desire in all its manifestations. In
                  this sense, Geraldine guarantees the libidinal economy of the text, but one that,
                  as Kristeva argues, “maintains the symbolic order through exclusion” (Kristeva 10).
                  Coleridge’s pleasure in reading aloud can then be read against the grain as the pleasurable
                  pain of <span class="foreign">jouissance</span>, as he even remarks in the <em>Biographia Literaria</em> concerning the experience of the “enkindling Reciter,” that it “is equally possible”
                  that “a reader left to himself should sink below the poem, as that the poem left to
                  itself should flag beneath the feelings of the reader” (<em>Biographia </em>239–40). As Coleridge was well aware, it was possible for a reader to be enlivened
                  by the performance of a poem, but the affective potential of a poem may be too overwhelming
                  in solitude; as such, Coleridge’s decision to publish comes from the need for the
                  distance of publication, of relinquishing the text to a public, to preserve the desire
                  for completion by retreating from the poem itself, in the same way that he discusses
                  the possibility of pleasurable pain at the end of the poem: </p>

               <p> However, the act of publication does not rid Coleridge of his relation to “Christabel,”
                  as is shown in the revisions that he makes in the versions after publication, specifically
                  those found in the five marked copies of the 1816 version, and furthermore from the
                  eleventh version to the eighteenth version. For none of these additions clarify the
                  text. Significantly, the prose glosses, like those added to “The Rime of the Ancient
                  Mariner” (1798), further obscure and contribute to the fantastic elements of the text:
                  for instance, the annotations that Coleridge made to lines 249–55 in 1824, “As soon
                  as the wicked Bosom, with the mysterious sign of Evil stamped thereby, touches Christabel,
                  she is deprived of the power of disclosing what has occurred” (169). Indeed, Coleridge’s
                  lifelong revision of the poem exemplifies a relationship to the text that is emblematic
                  of what Tilottama Rajan calls the “textual abject” (45). In her article, “Mary Shelley’s
                  ‘Mathilda’: Melancholy and the Political Economy of Romanticism” (1994), Rajan distinguishes
                  the “textual abject” from Kristeva’s concept of the abject, thereby transposing it
                  into a means of reading Romanticism’s tendency to re-cover, “both in the sense of
                  redeeming and of covering up, the abject by absorbing its affect into narrative and
                  explanatory structures” (45). The textual abject, as opposed to the Kristevan abject,
                  is introjected instead of being cast out, because the relation becomes internal to
                  the subject in contrast to the way that Christabel at the end of the poem is left
                  abjected from the text’s libidinal economy. Indeed, the text itself retreats from
                  the abject by casting it out in so many unreadable moments, and repeats Coleridge’s
                  lifelong return and rejection of the poem, whose traumatic core he cannot confront
                  except by retreating from the facticity of Christabel’s final abjection.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While the primary scene of unreadability wherein Geraldine reveals herself to Christabel
                     has been “read” many times as a lesbian fantasy or as a demonic enchantment which
                     threatens Christabel’s purity and innocence, these prurient readings arguably remain
                     under the same fantasy that Coleridge himself perpetuates by re-turning and re-treating
                     the text so as to re-cover a relationship to the symbolic order, to quote Žižek once
                     again, which spares him “the encounter with the real of [his] desire” (60). Prior
                     to publication, Coleridge never changed the scene, but neither could he narrate Geraldine’s
                     body. Instead, he leaves us with a fragmented body, “Behold! her bosom and half her
                     side—” (“Christabel” 246), but somehow this body should be “full in view” (“Christabel”
                     245). Another em-dash gives rise to the narrator’s decision to cover over the encounter,
                     so that this is a “sight to dream of, not to tell” although one that “is to sleep
                     by Christabel” (“Christabel” 247–48). It is here, after the publication of the 1816
                     version, that Coleridge makes one of the most substantive changes to the poem, as
                     is shown in marginal and interlinear annotations in copies of the 1816 version of
                     the text, where he replaces on “And she is to sleep by Christabel” with “O shield
                     her! shield sweet Christabel!” (Stillinger <em>Coleridge</em> 85). In later additions

                        </div>
                     </blockquote> The most common interpretation of these changes is that they result from a public
                     outcry against the poem; however, if we read the published text against its<span class="foreign">avant-texte</span>, the dramatic interruption of the narrator, “shield sweet Christabel,” covers over
                     the indifference present in the punctuation of earlier versions in the lines such
                     as “And she is to sleep by Christabel,” as well as “And lay down by the maiden’s side”
                     (“Christabel” 248, 250). In contrast to the earlier versions, the later versions intimate
                     a much more dramatic and anxious narration, the lines cut vertically with multiple
                     exclamation marks, which constantly interrupt the text. However, the exclamation marks
                     interrupt in a way that is different from the horizontal em-dashes, which present
                     moments of unspeakable silence, in much the same way that Derrida describes the secret
                     as that which “is without content, without a content separable from its performative
                     experience” (24). Reading the versions genetically from the earliest versions before
                     publication to those after publication allows readers to see the changes Coleridge
                     makes to the passage as not merely with a view to the public’s reception of the poem.
                     Rather, the revisions themselves stand in for Coleridge’s failed attempts at solving
                     the problem that arises from keeping the encounter of Christabel and Geraldine in
                     reserve. This foreclosure that prevents Coleridge from disclosing this moment of the
                     text is thus performative of the economy of the text, an economy ungrounded by its
                     own recourse to negativity, and which retreats from that thing which cannot be re-invested
                     in the economy: the secret as absolute reserve.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This absolute reserve remains a “sight to dream of, not to tell” and thus arrests
                  Coleridge in such a way that he spends most of the second part of the poem trying
                  to de-mystify the foreclosed disclosure. Unlike Christabel and Bard Bracy, where the
                  former can see but cannot tell while the latter can tell but cannot see Geraldine
                  for what she is not, Sir Leoline sees “this Geraldine,” and deems “her sure a thing
                  divine” (“Christabel” 463–64). For the Baron, Geraldine becomes the empty signifier
                  upon which he can re-constitute a relation to the public sphere with Lord Roland,
                  and forget the loss of his wife and a present life that he calls explicitly, “a world
                  of death” (“Christabel” 321). Whereas Coleridge, in <em>On the Constitution of Church and State</em> (1829), outlines the balance of the State by means of three estates, specifically
                  the Barons (the land-owners), the merchants (the distributive class), and the clerics
                  (those in charge of the cultivation of civilization), “Christabel” offers a narrative
                  that shows the limits of reason in the prose text, showing a much more affective and
                  repressive imbalance foregrounded in the later political text. In <em>Church and State</em>, Coleridge argues that the state relies on the “balance of the two great correspondent,
                  at once supporting and counterpoising, interests of the state, its <em>permanence</em> and its <em>progression</em>” (<em>Church and State </em>21; my emphasis). For Coleridge, this harmony plays itself out between the two houses,
                  “the first consisting wholly of barons or landholders, permanent and hereditary senators”
                  and “the second comprising the merchants, the manufacturers, free artizans, and the
                  distributive class” (<em>Church and State </em>21, 33). The copula that ties these two together, according to Coleridge, is the clergy
                  or clerisy. The national clerisy are to be made up of people who are to “remain at
                  the fountain heads of the humanities, in cultivating and enlarging the knowledge they
                  already possessed, and in watching over the interests of physical and moral science,”
                  and this community is to be distributed throughout the country, as was previously
                  stated above (<em>Church and State </em>34).</p>
               <p>If we use Coleridge’s schemata from <em>Church and State</em> as an optic for the characters of “Christabel,” we can see corresponding figures
                  of permanence and clerisy in Sir Leoline and Bard Bracy respectively. Indeed, Bard
                  Bracy’s position in the text is to interpret in the same way Coleridge describes the
                  objectives of the clerisy: “to preserve the stores, to guard the treasures, of past
                  civilization, and thus to bind the present with the past; to perfect and add to the
                  same, and thus to connect the present with the future” (<em>Church and State</em> 34). In contrast with the “custom and law” (“Christabel” 326) that Sir Leoline represents,
                  Bard Bracy’s interpretation of his dreams positions him as a proto-analyst of the
                  internal state of the psyche, but at the same time, his role seems to extend towards
                  the external as well, as is evident in his desire to delay Sir Leoline’s order to
                  seek out Lord Roland so as to go out and investigate the woods. As Bracy states, “[t]his
                  day my journey should not be,” (“Christabel” 528) because the dream is a sign that
                  there is something wrong with the world. </p>

               <p> When Sir Leoline only “Half-listening hear[s]” (“Christabel” 553) Bard Bracy’s dream
                  interpretation, his indifference to the Bard’s request represses the role of the clerisy
                  as analyst of the mind and of the world, and, in fact, goes further by mistaking Bracy’s
                  interpretation to mean that Geraldine was “Lord Roland’s beauteous dove,” and vows
                  “With arms more strong than harp or song, / Thy sire and I will crush the snake” (“Christabel”
                  557–59), the snake being his actual daughter, Christabel. As opposed to the ideal
                  of the clerisy Coleridge sets out in <em>Church and State</em>, “The bard obey[s]” (“Christabel” 640) the orders of Sir Leoline, and thus represses
                  the role that balances the order of permanence with that of progress, which leaves
                  a world out of balance and Christabel alone and silent at the end of the text. That
                  Bracy is able to interpret the dream but fails to intervene in the world demonstrates
                  that the clerisy and the poet alike assume a politics of the future like that of the
                  narrator of the poem, “That saints will aid if men will call: / For the blue sky bends
                  over all” (“Christabel” 318–19). However, if it is a prayer, it is one that does not
                  inspire hope, but that echoes out into a poem characterized by what Malabou calls
                  the theatre of absence, “the privileged expression of affective impoverishment and
                  destructive metamorphosis” (“Retreat” 41). The invocation of the social at the end
                  of “Christabel” reveals, on the one hand, an incapacity to move beyond the fantasy
                  that relies on a future-oriented return to a public sphere, and on the other hand,
                  it shows that this attachment requires a sacrifice to the future that Christabel represents
                  as the abject that must be excluded. But, like the prayer that echoes out into nowhere,
                  Coleridge’s three parts yet to come fail to materialize because “Christabel” returns
                  Coleridge back to the point of abjection, and provokes his return to the unspeakable
                  moment at the end of <em>Part the First</em> instead of proceeding further into the fantasy of the social. This unspeakable moment,
                  the trauma from which Christabel withdraws, enacts Coleridge’s desire to go back into
                  the past of the text rather than keep moving forward, for indifference destroys the
                  possibility of fantasy, as a result of the deep effraction, the wound from which Christabel
                  suffers but cannot communicate. It is perhaps, for this reason, that so many readers
                  return to “Christabel” because, in the words of Bard Bracy, it “would not pass away––”
                  and “seems to live upon [the] eye” (“Christabel” 546–47).</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">In fact, Coleridge’s modifications only become more aggressive after publication,
               after the text is given over to the public. In this sense, Coleridge’s withholding
               shows a markedly different form of revision that attempts to maintain a personal connection
               in the unpublished versions that is separate from and yet still attempts to maintain
               a connection with the symbolic order. The effect of publication shows revisionary
               practices that are more concerned with impersonal pronouns, and increasingly shifts
               towards a more mediated and generic gothic poem that attempts to retreat from the
               destructive limits the poem transgresses before publication.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Coleridge’s intentional withholding of “Christabel” from publication can be read more
               generally in terms of Romanticism and its relation to “publics” and “counter-publics.”
               For instance, the intentional act of withholding a work from publication shows that
               the unpublished is at times dialectically related to the published in the same way
               that spheres of the counter-public attempt to respond to the hegemony of the public
               sphere. Andrew Franta’s argument in <em>Romanticism and the Rise of the Mass Public</em> (2007), “that the regime of publicity could be employed to manipulate the very notion
               of representation—not by transforming debate into consumption but by bypassing debate
               altogether,” signals that Coleridge’s anxiety over the public’s power to bypass interpretation
               altogether was an all too common concern (33). For more research concerning the relation
               of the public sphere and Romantic authors see the special forum issue on Romanticism
               and its Publics in <em>Studies in Romanticism,</em> vol. 33, no. 4,Winter 1994; Bennett, Andrew. <em>Romantic Poets and the Culture of Posterity</em>.

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">All quotations of Coleridge’s poetry are from Nicholas Halmi’s edition of <em>Coleridge’s Poetry and Prose: A Norton Critical Edition </em>(2003), unless otherwise indicated.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Because Romanticists have long approached “Christabel” as a fragment poem, it is important
               to mention some of the most important work on the Romantic fragment, such as Marjorie
               Levinson’s <em>The Romantic Fragment Poem: A Critique of a Form</em> (1978) and Thomas McFarland’s <em>Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin: Wordsworth, Coleridge, the Modalities of Fragmentation
                  </em>(1981). However, rather than considering the fragment as an intentional form, I argue
               that “Christabel” evokes the externally unintended, unanticipated, and traumatic sense
               of Malabou’s use of the term “effraction,” which requires a shift of focus away from
               the fragment as an unfinished project towards something more akin to the project’s
               disintegration, which is radically more negative.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">The <em>avant-texte</em> is, according to the work of Jean Bellemin-Noël, “the totality of the material written
               for any project that was first made public” (31), so that any return to those pieces
               that remained unpublished represents an attempt to read the collection of manuscripts,
               notebooks, and other texts in the space surrounding a published text psychoanalytically
               rather than for continuity. The concept of the <em>avant-texte</em> is related more generally to the field of genetic criticism, a mode of textual studies
               and textual history that moves the study of manuscripts away from merely establishing
               a fair or accurate copy of a text. Reading genetically moves one away from reading
               for the “final” text, and provides readers a way of dialectically relating the <em>avant-texte</em> to the published or public text in order to re-construct the writing process.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
