                <p rend="noCount"> This essay outlines the approach, rationale, construction,
                    management, and results of a digital annotated poem project assigned in an
                    upper-level course on “Green Romanticism,” which I designed and taught during
                    Spring 2015. Students in this class created a website devoted to a particular
                    author and text using Weebly website creator. In this essay, I include
                    narratives of some of the best projects (including links to students’ sites), as
                    well as reflections on the assignment’s constraints and affordances. In doing
                    so, I urge teachers of Romanticism to adopt digital research projects as
                    alternatives and complements to traditional research papers, especially in
                    interdisciplinary programs and at schools where students’ career goals do not

                    <p>Interdisciplinarity is a Romantic convention. When Erasmus Darwin writes in
                        the Advertisement to <title level="m">The Loves of the Plants</title> (1791)
                        that the “general design” of his multi-layered scientific poem “is to inlist
                        Imagination under the banner of Science” (ix), he announces his
                        composition’s commitment to a variety of genres and technologies. In
                        addition to verse, <title level="m">The Loves of the Plants</title> is full
                        of extensive scientific footnotes, visual images, and philosophical prose
                        interludes on aesthetic theory. In order to fully understand and represent
                        the natural world, Darwin implies, we must draw from myriad disciplines and
                        technologies. As recent scholarship demonstrates, Darwin’s polymathic
                        approach to research and writing anticipates literary trends in the Romantic
                            period.<note place="foot">For the seminal study of Darwin’s influence on
                            Romanticism, see King-Hele. For more recent work, see Jackson; Nichols;
                            and Kelley.</note> The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
                        witnessed the emergence not only of what we now call ecology but also of a
                        range of authors who studied and drew from various disciplines and
                        technologies in their work. William Blake’s famous illuminated printing
                        fused the technologies of printing, painting, and industrialism in his
                        democratic poetry. Percy Shelley used hot air balloons to distribute
                        political pamphlets. Mary Shelley frequently infused her novels with new
                        scientific and technological ideas. William Wordsworth and John Clare often
                        wrote poems that opposed industrial technologies, such as railroads and
                        enclosure. Importantly, all of these poets were influenced by Darwin, and
                        for this reason he serves as a model for both Green Romanticism and
                        Technological Romanticism.<note place="foot">Courses on “Green Romanticism”
                            have become more prevalent since the Fall 1996 special issue of <title
                                level="m">Studies in Romanticism </title>on “Green Romanticism.”
                            While many scholars prefer the label of “Romantic Ecology”—for example,
                            in the <title level="m">Romantic Circles Praxis Series </title>volume on
                                “<ref
                                target="http://romantic-circles.org/praxis/ecology/index.html"
                                >Romanticism &amp; Ecology</ref>”—I used “Green Romanticism” for my
                            course as a more accessible term for students who are not familiar with
                            Romanticism or Ecology. “Technological Romanticism,” on the other hand,
                            is not so much a formal movement as a reference to the growing body of
                            scholarship that links science, technology, and art in the study of
                            Romanticism.</note></p>
                    <p>How can we engage the overlapping scientific, ecological, and technological
                        elements of Romanticism in the classroom? How can we incorporate these
                        elements alongside the canonical literature often required for introductory
                        courses and advanced surveys? How can we help students to understand the
                        exchange between imagination and science, during the Romantic period and in
                        the twenty-first century? These questions lie at the heart of recent
                        discussions in Romantic ecocriticism and pedagogy, and they are the focus of
                        this essay.<note place="foot">See, for example, the <title level="m"
                                >Romantic Circles Praxis</title> volume on “<ref
                                target="http://romantic-circles.org/praxis/ecology/index.html"
                                >Romanticism, Ecology, and Pedagogy</ref>”; Sobel; Orr; Louv; and
                            Garrard.</note> Scholars such as David Orr advocate place-based
                        education in the teaching of ecocriticism, in contrast to classroom reliance
                        on digital media and technology, which, as he and others suggest,
                        facilitates what Richard Louv calls “nature-deficit disorder” in our
                        students. As David Sobel argues, instructors often use “electronic media” to
                        connect students “with endangered animals and ecosystems around the globe.”
                        While motivated by good intentions, these changes ultimately “disconnect”
                        students “from the world outside their doors” (3). However, other scholars
                        and teachers have utilized digital technology successfully in teaching
                        Romantic-era literature: nearly every volume of the <title level="m"
                            >Romantic Circles Pedagogies Edititions</title>, including this one, features
                        digital pedagogy, and the most recent winners and finalists for the <title
                            level="m">Romantic Circles</title> Pedagogy
                            Contest developed courses with a central digital component. In
                        this essay, I argue that we can do the same with ecocriticism: rather than
                        exacerbating nature-deficit disorder, digital technology can facilitate
                        students’ engagement with Green Romanticism by allowing them to think
                        outside of the classroom and to develop the kinds of interdisciplinary
                        approaches demanded by ecocriticism.</p>
                    <p>In my upper-level seminar on “Green Romanticism,” which I designed and taught
                        during Spring 2015, I ask my students to adopt a Darwinian-interdisciplinary
                        approach in understanding Romantic-era texts, including <title level="m">The
                            Loves of the Plants</title>. The culminating project of the course is a
                        hybrid website-digital edition of an assigned poem, which students create
                        using <ref target="http://weebly.com/">Weebly</ref>, a free website design
                        program. (<ref target="http://greenromanticism.weebly.com/">You can find the
                            course “hub” here</ref>, which includes the course description,
                        syllabus, bibliography, and listening list.)This website project, described
                        in detail below, mirrors the kind of approach modeled by Darwin and other
                        Romantic authors, fusing “imagination” and “science” through modern digital
                        technology. The project lends itself especially well to the study of Green
                        Romanticism, as this subfield focuses on advances in science and technology
                        related to Romantic ecology. Indeed, one overarching principle of my course
                        is to chart the various ways Romantic writers and artists attempted to
                        represent “nature”—through literature, music, visual art, science, and
                        industry. Similarly, in their website projects, students engage the multiple
                        genres and media that characterize Green Romanticism through the
                        multimodality of digital media.</p>
                    <p>The website project affords students an opportunity to shape the
                        still-evolving field of Green Romanticism. While there has been important
                        work on the ecological elements in Blake, Wordsworth, the Shelleys, and, to
                        a lesser extent, Clare, recent advances in ecocriticism, science and
                        technology studies, affect studies, and the cognitive humanities have
                        renewed and revitalized discussions of Romantic ecology. These advances
                        allow us to rethink not only the role of “nature” in the works of canonical
                        poets but also the role of Darwin and other prominent scientists in
                        Romanticism itself. After the first wave of ecocriticism in the early 1990s,
                        which emerged in part as a response to the dominance of new historicism
                        throughout the 1980s, Romantic ecocriticism has increasingly focused on the
                        complex interplay of science, literature, and philosophy that informs
                        Romantic-era ecology.<note place="foot">For a useful essay on the major
                            waves of ecocriticism, see Buell.</note> Timothy Morton thus
                        investigates the “dark ecology” of Shelley and Clare. Noel Jackson, Richard
                        Sha, and Robert Mitchell reveal the scientific and medical bases of major
                        Romantic poetry. Alan Richardson and Lisa Zunshine have pioneered Cognitive
                        Romanticism. Theresa Kelley and Janelle Schwartz trace the influence of
                        botany and taxonomy in Romantic literature and culture. This new and
                        exciting scholarship gives us fresh perspectives from which to read Romantic
                        literature, and it offers students a new model for the study of Green
                            Romanticism.<note place="foot">See Morton; Jackson; Sha; Mitchell;

                    <p>If we no longer read all forms of Romantic “nature” as “Nature”—that is, as

                        with Darwinian neuroscience and Romantic-era ecology, how do we reread poems
                        like “Tintern Abbey” and <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>? If we add
                        Erasmus Darwin, Humphry Davy, and Luke Howard to the canon of Romanticism,
                        how do we re-envision <title level="m">The Botanic Garden</title>, or the
                        cloud studies of Constable and Turner, or the bird poems of Shelley, Keats,
                        and Clare? If “the English Romantics were the first full-fledged ecological
                        writers in the Western literary tradition” (19), as James McKusick famously
                        observed, how do we distinguish Green Romanticism from Romanticism? Such
                        questions framed my course on “Green Romanticism,” and they informed my
                        students’ website projects. Throughout the semester, we read poets and
                        novelists alongside scientists, artists, and Romantic scholars, and, by
                        drawing from these various texts and discourses in the creation of their
                        websites, my students were able to contribute to the ongoing reassessments
                        of Romanticism and of scholarly research and output.<note place="foot"
                            >Jerome McGann coined the term “Romantic Ideology” in his important 1983
                            study of the same name, to which ecocritics such as Jonathan Bate
                            responded in the early 1990s. After a fruitful decade of scholarship on
                            Green Romanticism, James McKusick established the Romantics as
                            foundational ecological writers, and since 2000 scholars have developed
                            and tested his claim. Many historicists have critiqued what they see as
                            the Romantics’ transcendent and idealized vision of Nature, while
                            McKusick and others have emphasized the material interconnectedness of
                            Romantic ecology. In recent years, studies on the relationship between
                            Romantic-era literature and science have moved scholarly discussions
                            beyond debates between ecocriticism and new historicism to questions
                            concerning the nature of Romantic ecology. Students in my class pick up
                            with this third wave of Romantic ecocriticism. For new historicist work,
                            see McGann; Levinson; Garrard; Morton; and Hess. For ecocritical
                            responses to new historicism, see Bate; McKusick; Nichols; Oerlemans;
                            and Rigby. For recent work in literature and science, see Sha; Schwartz;
                            Kelley; Faflak and Sha; Ottum and Reno; and Mitchell.</note></p>

                    <head>The Assignment</head>
                    <p>This digital project begins on the first day of class when I distribute the
                        assignment prompt [see Appendix A], and students work on the project
                        throughout the semester. Thus, from day one, students explore Green
                        Romanticism through various media; they envision their work for the class as
                        part of the online public sphere rather than the perceived private space of
                        the classroom (where work is exchanged between students and teachers only);
                        and they conceive of their research as an ongoing process that spans the
                        entire term. Moreover, students are generally more excited about starting
                        this project than a traditional research paper. This excitement helps to
                        establish student engagement with Romanticism. </p>
                    <p>As I point out in the assignment prompt, one fundamental practice of literary
                        scholarship is annotating a text: as literary readers and scholars, we take
                        notes in the margins, we underline, we make connections, we pose questions,
                        we engage with the text in order to understand it in a more sophisticated
                        and enriching manner. In our increasingly digital world, these kinds of
                        annotations have naturally moved to the digital sphere. In class, I show the
                            <ref target="http://romantic-circles.org/editions">digital editions</ref> on
                            <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> as representative examples, as
                        well as models for what students will do in their own digital projects. Once
                        I establish this rationale for the assignment, I outline the major
                        requirements. Students’ website projects must include: (1) a home page
                        containing a brief introduction to the poem and the site; (2) a separate
                        page containing the full text of the poem; and (3) at least ten hyperlinks
                        in the poem that take readers to separate pages on the site and to other
                        websites, sources, videos, paintings, and related texts. These hyperlinks, I
                        explain, are the digital annotations. They could include: biographical and
                        historical details; definitions and explanations of Romantic-era
                        terminology; references to and summaries of scholarly articles on a specific
                        aspect the poem; links to scholarly sites on the poem; paintings or other
                        visual media directly related to the poem (along with students’ commentary);
                        and whatever else is helpful in understanding and explaining the poem.</p>
                    <p>After explaining the project on the first day of class and giving students a
                        brief overview of the course Weebly site, I provide a step-by-step handout
                        on how to set up their own site [see Appendix B]. I also disperse a
                        “milestone checklist” to assess their progress throughout the semester. This
                        checklist is meant to keep students on track throughout the term: by week
                        six, students must select a text for the project; by week ten, they must
                        schedule a thirty-minute workshop with me to discuss their project, at which
                        time they must have completed the home page and at least two hyperlinks; by
                        week fifteen they must complete the project and give a brief presentation in
                        class; and by week sixteen (finals week) they must finalize their website
                        based on my written feedback and suggestions.</p>
                    <p>For assessment and grading, I use a general rubric with three mandatory
                        requirements and three broader categories [see Appendix C]. I assign
                        students a holistic letter grade for the project rather than assign points
                        for each category, but the point system could work as well. The first three
                        requirements—a home/introductory page, a page with the full text of the
                        poem, and at least ten hyperlinks—cover the nuts-and-bolts of the project,
                        while the second three categories—visual appeal, readability, and
                        research—cover the website’s content. These broader categories allow me to
                        provide specific feedback and guidance for each student’s site: during week
                        fifteen, I write a paragraph assessment for each category and provide
                        detailed suggestions for revision for each student. I also assign a letter
                        grade based on the current state of the project. Students then have one week
                        to revise and submit the final version of their project.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Project Rationale</head>
                    <p>The digital project has three major goals. First, it aims to engage a diverse
                        group of students in research on Romantic-era literature and culture. This
                        goal works especially well for students at Auburn University Montgomery: all
                        upper-level courses at AUM are “split-level,” meaning the students are a mix
                        of upper-level undergraduates and graduate students in our interdisciplinary
                            <ref
                            target="http://www.cas.aum.edu/academic-programs/graduate-programs/mla"
                            >Master of Liberal Arts program</ref>. In this particular course, the
                        class was composed of three graduate students, seven undergraduate English
                        majors (two of whom were in the Honors program), and one undergraduate
                        Psychology major. The website project allows students to engage in research
                        without the “high stakes” of a fifteen- to twenty-page research paper—though
                        this digital project does require substantial research, time, and attention.
                        Similar to a traditional research paper, the website assignment develops
                        close reading skills, research skills, organization and logic, and
                        fundamental principles of proper citation and scholarly attribution. For
                        instance, in order to create the hyperlinks, students must have a detailed
                        and sophisticated understanding of the poem and its scholarly reception, and
                        they must decide what pages to include and in what order. Additionally, most
                        students are already comfortable with digital technology and online writing,
                        so they are more willing to jump into a website project than what may be
                        perceived as a daunting research paper.</p>
                    <p>A second goal is that students envision their research and thinking as part
                        of a broader community; the open access of many digital editions makes for a
                        poignant example. By creating a public website, students can both speak to
                        scholars and teach general readers. Like many online scholarly editions of
                        texts—and like Darwin’s poetry—students must navigate a dual audience while
                        constructing their projects: they must write for specialists and the general
                        public. Accordingly, the third goal is for students to model the kind
                        of “blended approach” taken up by Darwin in <title level="m">The Loves of
                            the Plants</title> and by many other Romantic authors that we study:
                        Blake, Darwin, Wordsworth, and the Shelleys all envisioned their works at
                        the intersections of poetry, prose, visual art, science, and/or music. The
                        digital annotated poem project allows students to bring together a range of
                        technologies in understanding their selected poems and in modeling the
                        interdisciplinary nature of the poems themselves.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Student Websites: Construction, Management, and Results</head>
                    <p>Most students were excited about the website project from the start. Many of
                        them had created personal blogs and websites in the past, and a few even had
                        experience with computer programming. Weebly is straightforward and has a
                        low learning threshold for use, making it accessible even for students with
                        limited computer skills. Students with more advanced skills were not
                        challenged by the interface itself, and they were able to concentrate more
                        on creating exciting content. In this sense, Weebly is especially helpful at
                        leveling the playing field in a blended graduate/undergraduate course, since
                        each student can adapt the project to accommodate their own interests and
                        different levels of academic skills. Several students also enjoyed the
                        creative nature of the project, which was apparent from the continual
                        changes to their home pages during the first few weeks of the semester. For
                        example, one student, Juanita Barrett, included <ref
                            target="http://jbarret5.weebly.com">original photographs</ref>
                        documenting the different kinds of clouds in Percy Shelley’s “The Cloud.”
                        This kind of creative work, which many students produced, enhanced
                        engagement with the material and allowed students to become more invested in
                        their projects.<note place="foot"> I should note that not everyone was
                            thrilled with the assignment. One student was not comfortable with
                            computers at all, and she decided to drop the course because of the
                            digital project. This is a potential drawback: even with the
                            instructor’s offer to provide individual help and attention at each
                            stage in the process, some students are simply averse to digital
                            assignments.</note></p>
                    <p>Developing quality content proved more difficult for students than initial
                        construction and visual design. After creating the introductory home page
                        and the poem page, several students hit a wall halfway through the semester.
                        As one student asked in class, “I have the homepage and poem, so what do I
                        do now?” This question allowed me to connect the website project to
                        fundamental aspects of every literature course: close reading, research, and
                        writing. As a class, we modeled these moves on the day’s assigned readings:
                        Wordsworth’s “Composed upon Westminster Bridge,” Dorothy Wordsworth’s
                        journals, and a chapter from Ashton Nichols’s <title level="m">Beyond
                            Romantic Ecocriticism</title>. I began by asking students what they
                        thought about Nichols’s claim that Wordsworth’s sonnet was “[o]ne of the
                        greatest nature poems in English, by one of the greatest nature poets in the
                        language” (11). A few students said they were skeptical at first—this was a
                        poem about London, after all—but that Nichols’s subsequent close reading,
                        which illustrates his concept of “urbanature,” persuaded them. We then
                        worked through a close reading of the sonnet alongside Nichols’s analysis,
                        eventually bringing in the textual links to Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals,
                        Darwin’s writings, and other forms of Romantic natural history (all
                        discussed in Nichols’s chapter). I then asked students how these connections
                        and links might take the form of hyperlinks in a digital version of the
                        poem. (I also displayed Nichols’s site on <ref
                            target="http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat/">Romantic Natural
                            History</ref> as another model for how students might construct their
                        own sites.) To illustrate these points, we collaboratively built a rough
                        digital version of the sonnet on Weebly, inserting hyperlinks on specific
                        words and phrases that would link to these intertextual connections. The
                        classroom had a built-in projector for the instructor’s computer (this was
                        not a computer lab), so students suggested hyperlinks that I would then
                        insert for everyone to see. This process gave students a better
                        understanding of how to approach their projects, and it allowed them to
                        connect in-class discussions and activities with their websites. </p>
                    <p>The following week, we viewed and discussed a student example of the website
                        project. Funmi Stephens, one of the graduate students, volunteered to share
                        her site with the class, which provided some of the undergraduates with a
                        model to which they could aspire. Funmi was constructing <ref
                            target="http://ode2night.weebly.com">her site</ref> on John Keats’s “Ode
                        to a Nightingale,” and she had created several perceptive hyperlinks/pages.
                        For example, a hyperlink on the nightingale’s “self-same song” takes reader
                        to a page entitled “<ref target="http://ode2night.weebly.com/ballad.html"
                            >Ballad</ref>,” which contains a video recording of a nightingale
                        singing, details on the bird’s taxonomy, and a brief explanation of the
                        nightingale’s poetic roots in Greek mythology. This page connects the
                        literary resonances of the nightingale with the bird itself, which was
                        common in nineteenth-century England. By doing so, Funmi reveals why Keats
                        writes about this specific bird and how the nightingale relates to the
                        poem’s focus on the juxtaposition of death and immortality. Another page on
                            “<ref target="http://ode2night.weebly.com/immortal.html">Ruth</ref>”
                        further examines this juxtaposition. Funmi explains this Biblical reference
                        in the poem and provides an external link to a scholarly article on religion
                        and psychoanalysis. Although we wouldn’t read Keats’s poem as a class for
                        several more weeks, these hyperlinks revealed connections similar to those
                        that Nichols had charted in the readings from the previous week. Providing
                        this example in class inspired many students and helped them to envision
                        their own sites.</p>
                    <p>In general, though, there was not a vast difference in the quality of the
                        sites between the undergraduate and graduate students. As none of the
                        students were specializing in eighteenth- or nineteenth-century British
                        literature, they all had more or less the same investment in Romanticism.
                        Also, most graduate students at AUM go into secondary education or community
                        college teaching programs, so research in British Romanticism is not a
                        central focus of their studies. I imagine things might be different in a
                        doctoral program, where students would be at much different stages in their
                        programs of study, but in my class, there was only a one- or two-year
                        separation between the first-year Master’s students and the junior and
                        senior undergraduates. </p>
                    <p>Indeed, an undergraduate created one of the best projects of the course. In
                            <ref target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com">her site</ref> on
                        Blake’s “All Religions Are One,” Leslie Rewis has insightful pages on
                        Biblical references, Freud, Ghandi, Yann Martel’s <title level="m">Life of
                            Pi</title>, and Romantic scholarship, among other things. This site had
                        the most hits (something you can track on Weebly), and Leslie was even
                        contacted by a scholar whom she cites. Her site exemplifies the broad range
                        of scholarly engagement afforded by the digital project. For instance,
                        Leslie links the first line of Blake’s poem—“The Voice of one crying in the
                        Wilderness”—to a <ref
                            target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/isaiah-40-1-5.html"
                            >page</ref> that explains the Biblical allusion to Isaiah 40:1-5. By
                        teasing out this allusion, Leslie performs what we may call “classical”
                        literary scholarship. However, she also draws from High Theory: in a <ref
                            target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/freud.html">page</ref> on
                        Freud’s theory of personality, she uses psychoanalytic theory to interpret
                        Blake’s concept of the Poetic Genius. Additionally, Leslie created pages on
                            <ref target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/life-of-pi.html"
                                ><title level="m">Life of Pi</title></ref> and <ref
                            target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/gandhi.html">Gandhi</ref>
                        to explore Blake’s unconventional religious thought. These pages contain
                        quotations, videos, and links to other sites on religion.</p>
                    <p>Another undergraduate, Sonni Gunnels, created an <ref
                            target="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com">excellent site</ref> on Shelley’s
                            <title level="m">A Vindication of Natural Diet</title>, bringing
                        together information, images, and statistics on anatomy, crime, disease,
                        medicine, and ethics in relation to animals and meat eating. Like Leslie,
                        Sonni’s site illustrates a broad range of scholarly engagement, from a <ref
                            target="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/meatless-edens.html">page</ref> on
                        the religious and mythological bases of vegetarianism to a <ref
                            target="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/fermented-liquors.html">page</ref>
                        on Shelley’s references to “fermented liquors” to a <ref
                            target="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/meat-and-crime.html">page</ref> on
                        contemporary statistical analyses linking meat consumption and crime. Sonni
                        successfully “modernizes” Shelley’s treatise by drawing from twentieth- and
                        twenty-first-century science to vindicate vegetarianism. Her
                        multidisciplinary approach parallels those of Shelley and Darwin, and her
                        site connects Shelley’s text to the present day, which was a major goal of
                        the assignment.</p>
                    <p>Despite these successes, there were two major difficulties related to the
                        project: time management and plagiarism. As is often the case with final
                        essays, a few students put off the majority of the work until the final week
                        of the semester, which resulted in less-than-polished websites. I gave
                        students freedom to complete the project on their own schedule, as long as
                        they followed the milestone checklist outlined earlier. The required week
                        ten meeting proved especially crucial to students’ success. During this
                        face-to-face meeting, I was able to assess each student’s progress, and we
                        had positive discussions on possible hyperlinks and timelines for
                        completion. However, approximately half of the students had completed only
                        the home page and poem page. This required lots of brainstorming, which was
                        also helpful for many students. One possible solution to this problem would
                        be to break the project into multiple stages throughout the semester, with
                        multiple deadlines and grades for each stage.</p>
                    <p>The second difficulty involved plagiarism. When I reviewed students’ sites
                        during the week ten meeting, many hyperlink pages contained instances of
                        direct plagiarism. Several students had copied and pasted whole paragraphs
                        from external sites on specific places, author biographies, and scientific
                        details. Some students had included a link at the bottom of the page—but no
                        indication that the writing was not their own—while others did not. As far
                        as I could tell, these were not instances of intentional plagiarism:
                        students simply thought they could do this kind of “reposting” in the online
                        environment (we see it all the time on news sites and blogs, right?). This
                        problem generated fruitful discussions about academic research and citation
                        methods, both in an online environment and in “traditional” modes of
                        scholarship. I likened hyperlinks to footnotes in literature anthologies and
                        scholarly articles, stressing to my students that even on websites, they
                        should always make a clear distinction between their writing and that of
                        others. This may seem like a basic point to stress in an upper-level
                        literature seminar, but I think many students have a much different sense of
                        the “rules” pertaining to online writing and paper-based writing. I plan to
                        add a lesson about online plagiarism and citation rules when I assign this
                        project in the future.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>Overall, the website project was a success. Students enjoyed building and
                        sharing their sites, were able to perform significant research and to engage
                        with Romantic texts without the perceived pressure of a formal research
                        paper, and have a permanent testament to the work they did throughout the
                        semester. What’s more, their fusion of “imagination” and “science” enabled
                        them to make creative <emph>and</emph> scholarly connections with Green
                        Romanticism. This is a major reason why the website worked so well for this
                        class: students learned about and explored the multidisciplinarity of Green
                        Romanticism through a digital assignment that required them to adopt a
                        similarly multidisciplinary approach. My students were able to contribute
                        genuinely to the ongoing shaping of the field, providing new ideas and
                        insights to me, to their classmates, to scholars, and to the general
                        public.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, I urge teachers of Romanticism to adopt digital research projects
                        as alternatives and complements to traditional research papers, especially
                        in interdisciplinary programs and at schools where students’ career goals do
                        not include academia. In fact, <emph>most</emph> of our students will not
                        pursue an academic career. A digital website project provides students with
                        skills applicable to a wide range of professions: digital composition,
                        visual design, careful research and writing, and creative thinking are core
                        skills in a number of fields. Moreover, website design—even the simple
                        design process of Weebly—is certainly something many students will encounter
                        after they leave college, and having even a brief experience with website
                        design in a literature course could prove a valuable asset. Assigning a
                        website project has the added benefit of engaging students who otherwise
                        have no commitment to or special interest in Romanticism as a field of
                        study. For many students, an upper-level course in Romanticism will be their
                        only exposure to the literature and art of this period, so the website will
                        stand as a lasting testament to their work—and perhaps will inspire a
                        lifelong love of literature. And, while I have argued that the project works
                        especially well for Green Romanticism, I believe this project could be
                        adapted successfully for other thematic approaches or to Romanticism more
                        broadly. </p>
                    <p>I also think this project could be tailored for students pursuing a doctoral
                        degree in English: a more sophisticated version of the project utilizing
                        advanced software would be quite appropriate for students at a Research I
                        institution, whose future careers will most likely involve work in the
                        digital humanities. The MLA Job Information Lists from the last few years
                        show that institutions are increasingly interested in hiring recent PhDs
                        with either a focus in digital humanities or a secondary specialization in
                        some form of digital studies. Additionally, digital projects such as the
                            <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org"><title level="m">Blake
                                Archive</title></ref>, the <ref
                            target="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org"><title level="m">Shelley-Godwin
                                Archive</title></ref>, and <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org"
                                ><title level="m">Romantic Circles</title></ref>—not to mention the
                        explosion of online journals and open-access scholarly sites—indicate one of
                        the central directions our profession is headed. Such digital projects
                        afford our students not only opportunities to access important texts and
                        research on canonical figures like Blake and the Shelleys but also to
                        explore lesser-known figures such as Erasmus Darwin. Technology and Green
                        Romanticism go hand in hand, and emphasizing this connection in the
                        classroom has the benefit not only of bringing scientist-poets like Darwin
                        into the fold of Romanticism but also of drawing in more students to an
                        intensive study of Romanticism itself.</p>

                <head>Appendix A: Annotated Poem Project: Assignment Prompt</head>
                <p rend="noCount">As literary scholars, we annotate texts as we read: we take notes
                    in the margins, we underline, we make connections, we pose questions, we engage
                    with the text in order to understand it in a more sophisticated and enriching
                    manner. In our increasingly digital world, these kinds of annotations have
                    naturally moved to the digital sphere. Every year, there are more and more
                    digital editions of literary works, and more sites dedicated to sharing
                    scholarship with a broader audience (see, for example, the <title level="m"
                        >Romantic Circles</title> site, <ref target="http://romantic-circles.org"
                        >http://romantic-circles.org</ref>, especially its digital editions: <ref
                        target="http://romantic-circles.org/editions"
                    >http://romantic-circles.org/editions</ref>). For this project, you will contribute to
                    this developing digital world of scholarship by creating an online annotated
                    edition of an assigned poem using Weebly (<ref target="http://www.weebly.com"
                        >http://www.weebly.com</ref>). Using Weebly is free and quite easy: the
                    website is generated for you, so all you need to do is upload material and
                    customize design elements.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">Here’s the assignment: you will create your own Weebly website
                    dedicated to one assigned poem, which you will sign up for during the first half
                    of the semester. You will send me the url for your site, and I’ll post a link on
                    our shared course site (<ref target="http://greenromanticism.weebly.com"
                        >http://greenromanticism.weebly.com</ref>). On your site, which you can
                    design in any way you see fit, you must include: (1) a home page containing a
                    brief Introduction to the poem and overview of your digital edition; (2) a
                    separate page containing the full text of the poem; and (3) at least 10
                    hyperlinks in the poem that take readers to separate pages on your site and to
                    other websites, sources, videos, paintings, and related texts. These hyperlinks
                    are the digital annotations. They could include: biographical and historical
                    details; definitions and explanations of Romantic-era terminology; references to
                    and summaries of scholarly articles on a specific aspect the poem; links to
                    scholarly sites on the poem; paintings or other visual media directly related to
                    the poem (along with your commentary); and whatever else is helpful in
                    understanding and explaining the poem. Your project is due by our last class
                    session, and we’ll share those in class.</p>

                    <item>Select a “theme,” which you can change later.</item>
                    <item>Select to “Use a Subdomain of Weebly.com” and enter whatever you’d like

                    the URL, your site will appear. Of course, at this point your site is
                    essentially empty, but you will build, design, and create pages for your project
                    throughout the semester. Once you decide the poem for your project, come talk to
                    me and then begin to build your site.</p>

                <head>Appendix C: Annotated Poem Project: Rubric</head>
                <p rend="noCount">Name:</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><emph>Introductory Page</emph></p>
                <p rend="noCount">Your Introductory Page should clearly and concisely establish the
                    content and purpose of your site, as well as provide appropriate background
                    information and images. Links to the various pages on your site should be easily
                    accessible.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><emph>Poem Page</emph></p>
                <p rend="noCount">The full text of the poem should appear exactly as it was
                    published/reprinted in our anthology. Font style and size should be easy to
                    read.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><emph>Hyperlinks</emph></p>
                <p rend="noCount">The poem should have a minimum of ten hyperlinks that take your
                    reader to specific pages on your site and/or to appropriate external sites. The
                    hyperlinks should provide readers with detailed information to help them
                    understand the poem—that is, the information you provide should not be obvious,
                    but rather should require some deal of research and specialized knowledge on
                    your part.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><emph>Visual Appeal</emph></p>
                <p rend="noCount">Think carefully about the overall design of your site as well as
                    the interplay of image and text on each individual page. We read both image and
                    text on websites, so the two should complement each other. Avoid cluttered
                    pages, fonts that are difficult to read, and blurry images.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><emph>Readability</emph></p>
                <p rend="noCount">Your writing should be clear and concise, and it should be easy to
                    navigate through the site. As you are writing for a public audience, you should
                    avoid academic jargon and highly-specialized terminology. If you do use an
                    unfamiliar term or concept, explain it clearly for your readers.</p>
                <p rend="noCount"><emph>Research</emph></p>
                <p rend="noCount">Your site should contain appropriate outside research from
                    scholarly, peer-reviewed publications and sites. There is no minimum research
                    requirement, but your site should reflect months of research and work on your
                    text. You must provide appropriate citations for all outside sources. </p>
