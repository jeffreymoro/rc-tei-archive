            <p class="noCount">This collaborative essay explores some of the opportunities and challenges faced by
               instructors and students when digital projects are integrated into the Romantic classroom.
               It is based on our experience with two iterations of a course on literary manuscripts
               of the period, and is written by the instructor of course and two students, who returned
               for the second iteration of the course, a year later, as ‘digital coaches.’ We discuss
               the excitement and creativity afforded by working in a digital medium, as well as
               its utility when working with digitized objects like literary manuscripts. We also
               address the pitfalls, as some students struggle with the demands of mastering new
               technologies and with writing for digital dissemination. We found that student success
               was improved by explicit guidance, throughout the course, in how to construct a digital
               project. We share a set of how-to resources we have developed for other instructors
               wishing to integrate digital pedagogy into their classes, including video tutorials,
               assignments, grading rubrics, and links to student digital projects. We also address
               questions of platform selection, sustainability, assignment design and student evaluation.

               <p>This essay comes out of our collective experience as an instructor (Michelle Levy)
                  and two students (Ashley Morford and Lindsey Seatter) in a blended class (consisting
                  of undergraduate students and graduate students) taught at Simon Fraser University
                  in the summer of 2014, a course that was redesigned, and retaught, in the summer of
                  2015. This course, “Reading the Literary Manuscripts of the Romantics,” required students
                  to complete a final digital project. In what follows, we explore the reasons for assigning
                  a digital project as well as the opportunities and challenges that we encountered.
                  Throughout the essay and in our conclusion, we provide a series of pedagogical guidelines
                  based on our experience that we believe can improve student learning. We have also
                  developed a companion website, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/"><em>Digital Projects in the Romantic Classroom</em></a> which we hope will be of use to instructors contemplating integrating digital projects
                  within their own pedagogy. The website includes descriptions and links to <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/model-projects/">model projects</a> created in both the 2014 and 2015 iterations of the course, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/video-tutorials/">video tutorials</a> that demonstrate the basics of digital site design, various <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/course-materials/">course materials</a>, and an extensive <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/secondary-sources/bibliography/">bibliography</a>.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Course Objectives</span></h2>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">ML: </span>“Reading the Literary Manuscripts of the Romantics” is an upper-division course focused
                  primarily on five authors (Jane Austen, Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary Shelley, and
                  Dorothy Wordsworth, with some attention to Percy Shelley and William Wordsworth as
                  well). The course readings are designed to engage students with questions of textuality
                  and textual migration, to study how literary works transitioned from one media (usually
                  script) to another (usually print). We also read texts (such as Dorothy Wordsworth’s<em>Grasmere Journals</em> and Jane Austen’s juvenilia) that were not published during the authors’ lifetimes
                  to ask why they were withheld from print, or better yet (and to quote Margaret Ezell),
                  what are authors “attempting to do” by disseminating their works in handwritten form
                  (23).</p>
               <p>My own research in media history, and in particular the varieties of media by which
                  literary texts were disseminated in the period, informs the nature of the investigations
                  we undertake in the course. Students are asked to interrogate the texts they read
                  in their anthologies and critical editions, to reconstruct the complex textual history
                  that is usually omitted in student editions, and thus to consider how the material
                  forms in which these texts circulated affect meaning. In other words, I want students
                  to think about the interactions between linguistic and bibliographical codes (McGann
                  56-57). </p>
               <p>Although we typically associate the Romantic period with the technology of print,
                  manuscript production was ongoing, and not only in the sense that almost every print
                  work necessarily began as a handwritten document. Manuscript production and circulation
                  continued as it had for generations, as an alternative to print—for material that
                  was intended for a social readership, or otherwise too risky for print. Scholars like
                  Peter Stallybrass have in fact argued that print created more opportunities for manuscript
                  production—a dramatic rewriting of the narrative of media succession, whereby a new
                  technology (like print) is seen as replacing an older technology (like manuscript).
                  Very recently, we have seen that digital media, contrary to expectations and predictions,
                  has not replaced the printed book. Rather, print and manuscript, like print and digital
                  media, are interdependent, though in the Romantic period the abundance of print has
                  meant that we often lose sight of how authors persisted in their use of the older
                  technology of script. </p>
               <p>Digital media offers great promise because it makes the study of manuscripts far more
                  accessible to researchers (including students) than they ever have been. Furthermore,
                  digital resources and digital assignments allow students to represent manuscript far
                  better than is possible in the print essay, as linking and screen shots enable students
                  to draw the original manuscripts into their own projects in new and exciting ways.</p>
               <p>The Romantic period offers rich opportunities for the exploration of these questions
                  of textuality and mediation. It is no accident that many of the leading textual theorists
                  of the last fifty years—Jerome McGann, Donald Reiman, Jack Stillinger, and Kathryn
                  Sutherland, to name only a few—have developed their theoretical interventions through
                  the study of the physical manuscripts and printed books of Romantic authors. Their
                  editions, as well as their theoretical work in the field of textual scholarship, are
                  a result of the extensive manuscript (and print) record that survives. Romantic authors
                  were one of if not the first generation of writers for which manuscript witnesses
                  survive in profusion, allowing for the reconstruction of textual history in ways that
                  are impossible for previous generations of authors. Further, many of our period’s
                  authors were inveterate tinkerers, both in manuscript and print: Wordsworth, for example,
                  constantly revised his texts over his fifty-plus-year career; Mary Shelley substantially
                  re-revised <em>Frankenstein</em> thirteen years after its first appearance; and, according to Jack Stillinger, some
                  eighteen versions survive of Coleridge’s “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” (v).</p>
               <p>In addition, authors of the Romantic period were acutely aware of their audiences,
                  and how medium affected the reception of literary works. Robert Southey’s comments
                  on the piracies of <em>Don Juan </em>expresses this understanding perfectly: “‘“Don Juan” in quarto and on hot-pressed
                  paper would have been almost innocent--in a whitish-brown duodecimo, it was one of
                  the worst of the mischievous publications that have made the press a snare” (Senior
                  128). I want students to grapple with the understanding that Southey expresses—that
                  a text published in one format (expensive quarto) could be perceived to be “almost
                  innocent,” whereas the appearance of the identical text in another format (cheap duodecimo)
                  was deemed “mischievous,” even dangerous. Countless other examples could be found:
                  the effect of reading a poem in the author’s autograph offers a different experience
                  from than reading the identical poem in a newspaper, a print collection, or an author’s
                  collected works. I also want students to engage with the reasons why authors might
                  elect to circulate their literary texts in handwritten form, and to explore patterns
                  of textual movement. A poem might, for example, be first exchanged in manuscript within
                  a coterie, and then subsequently printed. Alternatively, it might be printed and circulated
                  in manuscript simultaneously, or the reverse might be true, as when poems were copied
                  from print. Authors also often shuttled their texts between different print forms
                  – consider Charles Lamb’s “Elia” essays. They first appeared in the <em>London Magazine</em>, and then were collected for separate publication in book form. The two versions
                  are not only textually different, but they also carry different bibliographical signification
                  as well. Ultimately, the course aims to involve students as much as possible in reconstructing
                  the linguistic and bibliographical codes that imbue texts with meaning.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Benefits of a Final Digital Project:</span></h2>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">ML</span>: In previous undergraduate courses, I had offered students the option to submit a
                  final project in digital form rather than as a standard print essay, and I had always
                  been pleased with the results. As the digital project was not required, it was taken
                  up by interested students but passed over by most. This result is not surprising,
                  since I offered little formal instruction, with students mostly forced to fend for
                  themselves in the construction of a digital project.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>With the summer 2014 iteration of “Reading the Literary Manuscripts of the Romantics,”
                     taught in the summer of 2014, I decided to make the final digital project required.
                     There were several reasons why I thought the time was ripe for such an approach. In
                     the first place, although the course is focused on literary manuscripts of the Romantic
                     period, my students would not be in a position to view, in person, a single physical
                     manuscript discussed in the course. Indeed, a course like this is only possible because
                     of the release of digital facsimiles and editions of manuscript material, particularly <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.amdigital.co.uk/m-collections/collection/romanticism-life-literature-and-landscape/detailed-information/">Romanticism: Life, Landscape, and Literature</a> (featuring the Wordsworths’ manuscripts), the <a class="link_ref" href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>, and the <a class="link_ref" href="http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou00062">Harvard Keats Collection</a>.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>All of these sites, with the exception of Romanticism: Life, Landscape, and Literature,
                              are freely accessible. For a survey of the teaching opportunities presented by Jane
                              Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts, see Michelle Levy, “Teaching Jane Austen’s (Digitized)
                              Manuscripts.”</span></div>
                     </div> These sites all provide access to photofacsimiles of manuscripts of major authors,
                     some with transcriptions. Thus, by necessity, students would be using digital materials
                     and, as a consequence, students would have to be taught to become conscious and critical
                     of the effects of digital remediation. Asking students to construct their projects
                     within a digital medium seemed a natural outgrowth of this engagement with media history
                     and digital material. As we explored the ways that texts historically migrated across
                     media platforms, students were primed to explore how their own writing could be disseminated
                     and might be transformed by the use of digital platforms. Finally, because their primary
                     source material was in digital form, and because manuscripts are expressively visual,
                     a digital platform would enable students to incorporate these resources in a digital
                     project far more easily than in a traditional print essay.</p>
               </div>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">AM and LS</span>: As graduate students, we found that one of the most substantive benefits of creating
                  a multimodal digital project was that it could serve as the foundation for an evolving
                  research portfolio. Instead of drafting a standalone final essay, which is generally
                  the culminating assessment for courses taught in the humanities, a digital project
                  provides a space for creating and collecting scholarly research over an extended period
                  of time. This means that the assignment has a life beyond the initial classroom evaluation
                  and can become a platform for showcasing our work in alternative academic and non-academic
                  settings (Hess 34). Conceptualizing digital projects as evolving portfolios can also
                  serve as a springboard to graduate studies or to work opportunities both within and
                  beyond the academy.</p>
               <p>Another benefit beyond the classroom is that students can make digital projects more
                  widely accessible. For instance, if a student makes their digital project public (as
                  with a website), their work is openly accessible to larger populations and subject
                  positions. The visitor statistics for Ashley’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://frankensteinandtheother.wordpress.com/">Frankenstein: Troubling Understandings of the Other</a> project offer a small example: in the first year that the project whas been up and
                  running, it has received a wide range of visitors from Australia, Canada, France,
                  Germany, Ireland, Qatar, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
                  Many of these visitors have discovered the website through search engines. Some visitors
                  have been professors, others have been students working on <em>Frankenstein</em>-related class projects, and the subject positions of many other visitors remains
                  unknown. Even if a student does not make their project public, they can control access
                  by inviting others to view it. Thus parents, friends, fellow students, admission committees,
                  and potential employers can observe and engage in student research and writing that
                  is usually confined to the classroom, thereby making visible (if only to a confined
                  circle) the benefits and skills associated with our discipline.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>By design, the format of a digital assignment—its fluid, easily mutable existence—invites
                     students to continue editing, revising, and enhancing the material presented online,
                     even after the course is complete. This invitation—coupled with the strong sense of
                     ownership students feel over work that has evolved directly from their own research
                     interests—can motivate the continual development of the project. This has been our
                     collective experience. For example, Ashley has continued to re-imagine, edit, and
                     alter her site during her doctoral studies. For example, Ashley is now developing
                     her site into a doctoral project. Lindsey’s project, <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdigitizingliterature.wordpress.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDvc4I7fB2NDEYzGbdcbFv8w-6vA">Digitizing Literature</a>, has evolved from a classroom assignment into a culminating Master’s project and,
                     more recently, into a professional portfolio that showcases a history of academic
                     work. Looking back on the development of these projects demonstrates an evolution
                     of student-led research.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)

                              website.</span></div>
                     </div> When students direct their own research, they gain a sense of ownership over their
                     work and leadership over their academic program. Our digital projects have been key
                     components of our admission to doctoral programs and our hiring into research positions.
                     We have found that showcasing a digital project as part of a curriculum vitae evidences
                     that a student possesses skills as both a traditionally-trained and digitally-literate
                     scholar.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Because digital projects have the potential for a life beyond the scope of a semester,
                  they can serve as a bridge towards professionalization. Working in the Romantic period,
                  we are lucky to inherit a prestigious lineage of innovative digital scholarship. Aggregatione
                  project sites such as Jerome McGann’s <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.nines.org/">NINES</a> and Laura Mandell’s <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.18thconnect.org/">18thConnect</a> represent the vast and varied multimodal projects taking place in Romantic literary
                  studies. For students who pursue their digital projects beyond the classroom—evolving
                  their work into honor’s theses, graduate projects, or professional research interests—preserving
                  their work under an umbrella such as the Advanced Research Consortium (ARC) may be
                  held as the ultimate goal. Not only do these sites provide opportunities for peer
                  review, they also enable connections between individual projects, promote standards,
                  enforce professional practices, and perpetuate an online identity of rigorous scholarship.
                  Professionalization can be neglected as an objective of academic coursework but by
                  creating assignments that develop the “skills, identities, norms and values” associated
                  with quality digital work, the classroom can become an arena for digital humanities
                  credentialing (Rockwell and Sinclair 177-178). The professionalization skills gained
                  in the creation of digital projects can offer opportunities outside of the academy
                  as well. For instance, both Lindsey’s and Ashley’s digital projects have resulted
                  in opportunities to build WordPress sites outside of academia.</p>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">ML</span>: Students who do not continue into graduate work (who and these students comprise
                  the majority of our my students) also benefit from their involvement in digital projects.
                  If one of our strengths as a discipline is teaching our students how to read and write
                  critically, we must also recognize that as the media ecology we inhabit shifts and
                  print loses its former dominance, “print, essayistic literacy” will also have to adapt
                  (Williams xii). Written communication increasingly takes place in digital forms, and
                  we can take the lead in not only teaching our students how to read and engage with
                  online materials, but in how to produce them. Indeed, it seems that it should be part
                  of our mission to teach students how to write—cogently and expressively—for online
                  media, skills that they will need “if they hope to communicate successfully within
                  the digital communication networks that characterize workplaces, schools, civil life,
                  and span traditional, national, and geopolitical borders” (Takayoshi and Selfe 3).</p>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">AM and LS</span>: In addition to providing a life beyond the classroom, we believe that digital projects
                  provide students with the opportunity to pursue their own research interests, to approach
                  familiar texts with a fresh perspective, and to experiment with new methodologies.
                  While these pursuits are attainable within a traditional print essay, there is an
                  aspect of play and experimentation with digital project creation. As Bonds suggests,
                  digital experimentation and play allow students to develop more fully, to discover
                  and produce their own knowledge rather than simply mimic the knowledge of a teacher,
                  which can happen when students write traditional essays (Bonds 150).</p>
               <p>The initial experience of creating in a digital space can be disorienting for traditionally
                  trained humanities students. However, learning to work within a new digital platform
                  like <em>WordPress</em> and having to approach a research project through a new medium can be exhilarating,
                  leading to revitalized engagement with the material being studied and expanding the
                  methods that students can draw on to present and communicate ideas. As the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/model-projects/">model projects</a> demonstrate, the opportunities to play with, experiment with, and incorporate the
                  digital through hyperlinking, adding multimedia, and personalizing design aspects
                  (like header images) give these assignments more scope for creativity and for engagement
                  with primary materials than is typical in traditional assessments. Additionally, the
                  digital platform offers students the opportunity to oscillate between creative and
                  critical work as they face the new challenges of site design and media integration
                  alongside the more familiar tasks of close reading and scholarly commentary. This
                  balance is often missing from traditional assessments where students are limited to
                  working within a word processing document that will be printed on paper.</p>
               <p>Yet it must be acknowledged that the print essay continues to have some benefits over
                  the digital platform. There is the familiar argument that reading from a printed text
                  allows for better retention of information than reading from a digital text does,
                  that “the physicality of a printed page may matter for those reading experiences when
                  you need a firmer grounding in the material. The text you read on a Kindle or computer
                  simply doesn’t have the same tangibility” (Konnikova para. 5). Additionally, in terms
                  of the writing process, digital platforms like <em>WordPress</em> lack simple, clean ways to incorporate footnotes or endnotes; while MLA formatting
                  helps to alleviate this issue, as it encourages in-text parenthetical citations, the
                  ability to incorporate discursive footnotes or endnotes remains a challenge. Further,
                  while it is easy to continue to develop digital projects on platforms like <em>WordPress</em>, the print essay is, of course, by no means stagnant; class essays can develop into
                  conference papers, which can develop into honors theses or (for those few students
                  who continue on in academia) graduate capstone papers, which can develop into journal
                  articles, and so on. Indeed, <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/first-paper-guidelines.docx">the first assignment </a>of this course is a traditional print essay, which students were encouraged to use
                  as a springboard foundation into for their digital project.</p>
               <p>The ability to work directly with a range of online materials—digitized manuscripts
                  and rare books, video clips and images—can also help reorient the usual instructor-student
                  hierarchies by refiguring the student as the creator, instead of merely the receiver,
                  of information. In our course experience, the ability to work directly with digitized
                  versions of unique primary sources moved us from the position of student to the position
                  of researcher. Interacting with these materials, which are locked in exclusive manuscript
                  vaults thousands of miles away from our classroom, would have been impossible without
                  leveraging our access to their digital surrogates. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">Pedagogical Challenges of Digital Assignments:</span></h2>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">ML</span>: When I began to teach courses with digital projects, I had fairly rigid expectations
                  of what they would look like: a digital edition of literary text. Practically speaking,
                  students were advised to select a short text that had been somewhat overlooked in
                  the scholarship (so that they could master the critical background). Ironically, given
                  what I thought to be my attentiveness to possibilities of new media, I imagined students
                  creating digital editions that were based on a model of the print edition; specifically,
                  I had Broadview Press’s literary editions in mind. Having edited a critical edition
                  for Broadview, I was familiar with this format and esteemed it as a pedagogical model,
                  with its richly historicized introductions, annotations, and appendices of primary
                  material. Several students followed this model, choosing to develop editions of shorter
                  works (such as short pieces from <a class="link_ref" href="https://digitizingliterature.wordpress.com/category/austen-the-history-of-england/">Austen’s juvenilia</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://compilingsanditon.wordpress.com">Austen’s </a><a class="link_ref" href="https://compilingsanditon.wordpress.com">later </a><a class="link_ref" href="https://compilingsanditon.wordpress.com">manuscript </a>fiction, or little-studied essays by Anna <a class="link_ref" href="https://digitizingliterature.wordpress.com/category/barbauld-letter-from-grimalkin-to-selima/">Barbauld</a>).</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, I realize now that, in imagining the output to be a digital edition,
                  I was inadvertently applying a print-based model, and one that imposinged unnecessary
                  limitations on the kinds of projects students could pursue. I also overestimated my
                  ability to provide students with adequate instruction on editorial theory, which proved
                  too difficult to teach with proper rigor in a course with so many other balls in the
                  air. Fortunately, most of the students navigated (or circumnavigated) this aspect
                  of the project. Some did so by selecting texts that exist in only one version, a highly
                  sensible solution that avoided many thorny editorial issues. Others, who were dealing
                  with texts that survive in multiple versions, rather than fixing on (or creating)
                  a single edition, instead sought to study those very issues of migration and change
                  between versions. Thus, many of the final projects were not editions at all, but essays
                  constructed in digital space that analyzed different versions of a text. For example,
                  Ashley’s project considers Percy Shelley’s revisions to the draft manuscript of <em>Frankenstein</em>; others, such as Lindsey’s, examined the transition of Dorothy Wordsworth’s <em>Grasmere Journals</em> from their manuscript sources to the early print editions (edited by William Knight
                  and Ernest De Selincourt) and into excerpts used in current teaching anthologies.
                  Many of these projects succeeded in enabling students to think critically about textuality.
                  And projects can also emerge that are less textually-focused but rather seek to curate
                  and thus explore critically <a class="link_ref" href="https://naturalromanticism.wordpress.com/">a small selection of related poems</a>, such as Byron’s separation poems, or Percy Shelley’s poems to Jane Williams.</p>
               <p>In teaching the course for the first time in 2014, I still did not fully overcome
                  the false assumption of digitally-savvy students. Jim Mussell debunks this common
                  assumption, explaining that “the technical competence of the young is routinely overstated”
                  (203). By treating the digital assignment as similar to a print essay, I failed to
                  realize that students would need more guidance at each stage of the process and would
                  require more time to prepare their final digital project than was necessary for a
                  print essay. I had invited Matt Huculuk, from the University of Victoria, to offer
                  a workshop on the use of <em>WordPress</em>, but that was about halfway through the semester: had it been held earlier, it may
                  have assuaged student anxiety about the technical aspects of the project. Unlike a
                  print paper, which students (at this stage in their academic career) can draft very
                  quickly (if circumstances require), a digital project requires a longer timeline,
                  with more opportunities for experimentation and failure, and with more time for planning
                  and design.</p>
               <p>In the second iteration of the course, in 2015, more time was devoted to technical
                  skill development. I was fortunate enough to have Lindsey and Ashley serve as “digital
                  coaches” (see Branscum and Toscano 95-96) for my students, and we are hoping, with
                  the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/">Digital Projects in the Romantic Classroom</a> website we have created, to offer this kind of digital coaching to other instructors
                  and students. One other way in which we have attempted to overcome the technical learning
                  curve has been to reconceive the course as a series of cumulative assignments that
                  build towards the final digital project. The challenge has also been to convince students
                  to take a longer view of their coursework; from the instructor’s perspective, I had
                  to overcome the practice of conceptualizing assignments as discrete units, a practice
                  driven in part by a concern that the students should not be able allowed to reuse
                  work from a previous assignments.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One other pressing issue that arose in contemplating the assignment of a digital project
                     was the question of what platform to use, and with that, of sustainability. Originally
                     (and as part of my edition-based thinking), I wanted to find a platform that was oriented
                     to scholarly digital editions, one that might even allow for students to use TEI-XML
                     for their projects. Although there are a few platforms in development that will allow
                     for the implementation of TEI markup—including <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.cwrc.ca/projects/infrastructure-projects/technical-projects/cwrc-writer/">CRWC-Writer</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_critical_edition">Islandora Critical Edition</a>—none are currently available for implementation. <em>WordPress</em>—being extremely easy to use, open source, and free—had much to recommend it. It had
                     been successfully used by <a class="link_ref" href="http://matthuculak.com/teaching/english-4620/">Matt Huculuk in his undergraduate courses</a>, and these projects were viewable by my students as potential models.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>When re-teaching the course, I had the added benefit of being able to share students
                              projects from the previous iteration of the course, which allowed students to visualize
                              what could be done, and to concretize expectations.</span></div>
                     </div> Additionally, I was using <em>WordPress</em> for the course website, so students would necessarily become familiar with how to
                     use its basic features. I also made my peace with the issue of sustainability; for
                     reasons already articulated by Ashley and Lindsey, a digital project built in <em>WordPress</em> is likely to be more durable and extensible than the ephemeral student essay, which
                     has little hope of reaching an audience beyond the original instructor, and no expectation
                     of survival beyond that term, or, at most, the life of the computer hardware on which
                     it is written. Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, <em>WordPress</em> might offer a more stable archival structure than its traditional counterpart.</p>
               </div>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">AM and LS</span>: For many students in the “Reading the Literary Manuscripts of the Romantics” class,
                  <em>WordPress</em> was an unknown and, therefore, unexplored platform. Reflecting on the summer 2014
                  course, key aspects of a <span style="font-style:italic">WordPress</span> project— such as <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fromanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com%2Fvideo-tutorials%2Fcreating-a-page%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDESu-vzjPss2Gt08zTVOlc5T4Ag">the ability to make static pages, parent pages, and child pages</a>—were confusing for some of us to learn, and extra time, care, and external research/reading
                  of online documentation or user message boards was needed to ensure that we understood
                  these components. The intense anticipation of the technical learning curve that precedes
                  the development of a successful digital project is often enough to discourage experimentation
                  within this new medium. In addition to the learning curve, a digital platform, like
                  a website, will often not reflect the same linear structure of a traditional essay
                  through its mandatory introduction, body, and conclusion. As humanities students,
                  many of us have years of experience composing argumentative papers for print and the
                  vast majority of, at least, upper division students find great success and enjoyment
                  in working within this genre of assessment. While the standard academic essay has
                  proven over time to be a useful argumentative tool and an appropriate vessel for student
                  evaluation, multimodal projects have yet to achieve this same clout. Therefore, students
                  may approach the challenges of a digital project with apprehension regarding its usefulness
                  or relevance to their humanities education.</p>
               <p>We believe that these fears may be overcome by providing students with hands-on instruction
                  to ensure that they possess the ability skills to purposefully navigate through, and
                  successfully create with, these platforms. This necessitates that class time and instructor
                  attention must be devoted to teaching the technical side of working within digital
                  media. We hope that the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/video-tutorials/">video tutorials</a> we have developed to provide step-by-step guides to key aspects of <em>WordPress</em> can be used by others to enable students in the digital humanities classroom to utilize
                  <em>WordPress</em> with confidence. One other strategy is to provide students with <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fromanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com%2Fmodel-projects%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG84lyaRDaMidP3luRagbcvmkfa4A">models of digital projects</a> prepared by students in past courses. Being able to explore different projects allows
                  students to see what is possible, and concretizes the different set of expectations
                  between a print essay and a digital project.</p>
               <p>Additionally, given the initial challenges that working in a digital environment presents
                  for many students, it is important that proponents of this type of assessment clearly
                  illustrate what can be done “with digital media that we [can] not do otherwise” (Kuhn,
                  Johnson, and Lopez 1). In their article and interview series “Speaking with Students,”
                  Kuhn, Johnson, and Lopez identify some of the value-added learning experiences of
                  born-digital work, including acquiring the skills of “advanced digital literacy”;
                  “deploying the registers of text, image and interactivity”; and creating a space to
                  actively engage an academic audience in “unprecedented ways” (1). By showcasing the
                  unique value of digital scholarship, a niche can be created for this type of work
                  as an acceptable humanities assessment. We have tried to exhibit these valuable learning
                  opportunities by creating <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/video-tutorials/">video tutorials</a> that help teach students how to work with both text and media, and by creating a
                  space that showcases <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/model-projects/">past projects</a>, visualizing the possibilities of a digital project and encouraging future students
                  to engage in these scholarly conversations.</p>
               <p>Another challenge is learning to integrate media and hyperlinks in a purposeful and
                  meaningful way. During the course of creating our digital projects for the 2014 semestercourse,
                  we were encouraged to provide embedded images and hyperlinks in order to embrace the
                  multimodal advantages of a digital space. So too does one of the <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/video-tutorials/integrating-media-hyperlinks/">video tutorials</a> created for the 2015 course strive to equip students with the tools to hyperlink
                  and embed images, video, and audio so that the student projects can successfully interact
                  with other digital platforms. Yet while it may be easy to think that connecting different
                  sources of information to one another (as a website may hyperlink to another related
                  website) is an interactive act, Lev Manovich emphasizes that interactivity is deeper:
                  true interactivity is a psychological or mental process (71). In “The Myth of Interactivity”
                  (from <a class="link_ref" href="http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Manovich-LangNewMedia-excerpt.pdf">The Language of New Media</a>), he argues that “the concept of interactivity” as used with regard to digital media
                  “is a tautology” (71). As he says, “Once an object is represented in a computer, it
                  automatically becomes interactive” (71). Thus, while instructors may encourage students
                  to hyperlink and embed, it is important for us to be guided to do so with careful
                  consideration and intent. Instructors should ensure that students are made aware that
                  hyperlinks and embedded images may connect their site to other sites, but that this
                  act does not guarantee that their digital project will be intellectually stimulating.
                  If the hyperlink or embedded image is not a key source or component of the project’s
                  main idea or argument, or if it does not help to guide, develop, or build the project’s
                  idea or argument, then the hyperlink or embedded image is probably unnecessary.</p>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">AM and LS</span>: Because <em>WordPress </em>is designed as a personal blogging platform, many of its features and its fundamental
                  structure are not conducive to building a digital literary project. Unfortunately,
                  at this time, there are no open source digital edition builders available, so students
                  must learn to work within the limitations of this program or one like it. One potential
                  problem for students is that the free version of <em>WordPress</em> does not provide any plugins for annotations. If students are inclined to build a
                  text-based edition, being unable to efficiently markup the text is a serious limitation.
                  <em>Digitizing Literature</em> ran into this problem and navigated around it by embedding site-internal hyperlinks,
                  but this solution is less than ideal.</p>
               <p>Additionally, <em>WordPress</em> lacks the coded search capability of a custom TEI-XML site. This means that while
                  the <em>WordPress</em> search engine can identify the words displayed on each webpage, it is unable to access
                  information that could be embedded in humanistic markup. For example, if TEI-XML were
                  used to encode place names or person names in a document then a site user, who was
                  interested in this type of information, would be able to call up all the encoded instances
                  instead of having to search individually for each proper name. This type of categorical
                  searching opens up an entirely new way of accessing or using the text at hand. Furthermore,
                  as TEI-XML is a discipline standard in the humanities, this incompatibility is a significant
                  loss, though <em>WordPress</em>’s ease of use makes it an acceptable trade-off, at least when working with undergraduate
                  students.</p>
               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">ML, AM, LS</span>: Evaluation of students’ digital projects presents challenges, both from the instructor’s
                  and the students’ point of view. The expectation of most students at this later stage
                  in their academic career is that a research essay will be graded based on: the competence
                  of their research; the soundness and originality of their argumentation; the persuasiveness
                  of their close reading; and the clarity and elegance of their writing. With a digital
                  project, all of these components persist as requirements, but with the additional
                  burden of students being asked to translateing their research into (what will likely
                  be) a new digital medium. In essence, students are being asked to use a new language
                  to present their research and writing, and this can cause anxiety on the part of students
                  and the instructor, who rightly may be concerned that they are demanding too much.
                  Many students have worked for years to craft arguments for and present textual evidence
                  on the printed page; therefore, transitioning the print-based essay into digital form
                  requires thought and planning. Further, students may find basic tasks, such as editing
                  and proofreading, more difficult within a digital environment. For all of these reasons,
                  assessment provides a new set of challenges problems to the instructor, who wishes
                  to encourage experimentation and creativity while at the same time maintaining high
                  standards for argumentation, analysis, and composition. One way to address this problem
                  is by providing students with explicit grading rubrics, and staging feedback throughout
                  the course through peer review and both formative and summative assessment (the former
                  providing feedback to students while they are still working on their projects, and
                  the later provided after they have completed and submitted the project). Example materials
                  for these various forms of feedback are available on our <a class="link_ref" href="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/course-materials/">companion site</a>.</p>
               <p>Although many issues were resolved by the second iteration of the course, some remain.
                  In particular, argumentation that spans many web pages can be difficult to sustain.
                  Students have been encouraged to include introductions and conclusions that state
                  and restate their overarching claims, but a digital project seems tomay require a
                  different style of argumentation. Further, students use images and moving pictures
                  far more than in print-based essays, and literature students must therefore develop
                  analytical skills appropriate to those visual media. Of course, the inclusion of images
                  and video often raise issues of copyright and proper citation. One strategy used in
                  the second iteration of the course was to require students to include a works cited
                  for images, but thorny issues, such as whether students can take screenshots and otherwise
                  use images from other resources, persist. </p>

               <p><span style="font-weight:bold">ML, AM, LS</span>: In the list of best practices that follows, we offer a series of suggestions that
                  address many of the pedagogical challenges we have identified. Our main recommendations
                  are (1) that the students be given explicit guidance, throughout the course, in how
                  to construct a digital project, through the use of hands-on workshops and video tutorials,
                  the provision of written documentation, and the presentation of previous student projects
                  as models; (2) that the course assignments be understood cumulatively, such that students
                  are encouraged to re-use material from previous assignments in the final project;
                  and (3) that the timeline for producing the digital project be staged over the course
                  of several weeks.</p>
               <p>The following table discusses a series of pedagogical interventions over the course
                  of the term, to help guide students through the development of the project. Links

               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>We would like to concluding by reporting on results of student evaluations of the
                  course. The students in both the 2014 and 2015 iterations of the course were asked
                  to complete an anonymous online survey following the conclusion of the course this
                  summerin the fall of 2015. The purpose of the survey was to determine how the students
                  found the course material and structure, specifically the integration of technology
                  through assignments and evaluations. </p>
               <p>Fourteen students completed the survey: five from the inaugural class of 2014 and
                  nine from the second iteration in 2015. While three of the students originally hesitated
                  in registering for the course because of the digital element, all of the students
                  enjoyed learning to use the digital tools and agreed that they were helpful for studying
                  English (Q.13, Q.9, Q.10).</p>
               <p>Overall, the students felt that their technological skills improved over the duration
                  of the course; the students also felt more confident in their use of <em>WordPress</em> at the course’s culmination (Q.15, Q.16). On average, the students in the 2014 class
                  felt less confident in the explanation of digital tools than the 2015 class: of the
                  five students in the 2014 class, three answered this statement with “agreed”, one
                  with “somewhat agreed”, and one with “somewhat disagreed.” By comparison, the 2015
                  students answered either “strongly agreed” or “agreed” (Q.17).</p>
               <p>As these survey results suggest, the exploration and suggestions made in this paper
                  are not only based on pedagogy theory and our reflections, but also on participant
                  evaluations. The changes made to the course had a positive impact on the students’
                  confidence in both using digital tools and in their mastery of <em>WordPress</em> as a content management system. The resounding agreement that the digital tools provided
                  meaningful strategies for understanding were a useful window into English literature
                  both supports our objective for this course and bolsters our argument for the importance
                  of integrating humanistic research with technological innovation.</p>
