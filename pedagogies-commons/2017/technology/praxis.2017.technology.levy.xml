                <p rend="noCount"> This collaborative essay explores some of the opportunities and
                    challenges faced by instructors and students when digital projects are
                    integrated into the Romantic classroom. It is based on our experience with two
                    iterations of a course on literary manuscripts of the period, and is written by
                    the instructor of course and two students, who returned for the second iteration
                    of the course, a year later, as ‘digital coaches.’ We discuss the excitement and
                    creativity afforded by working in a digital medium, as well as its utility when
                    working with digitized objects like literary manuscripts. We also address the
                    pitfalls, as some students struggle with the demands of mastering new
                    technologies and with writing for digital dissemination. We found that student
                    success was improved by explicit guidance, throughout the course, in how to
                    construct a digital project. We share a set of how-to resources we have
                    developed for other instructors wishing to integrate digital pedagogy into their
                    classes, including video tutorials, assignments, grading rubrics, and links to
                    student digital projects. We also address questions of platform selection,
                    sustainability, assignment design and student evaluation. </p>

                    <p>This essay comes out of our collective experience as an instructor (Michelle
                        Levy) and two students (Ashley Morford and Lindsey Seatter) in a blended
                        class (consisting of undergraduate students and graduate students) taught at
                        Simon Fraser University in the summer of 2014, a course that was redesigned,
                        and retaught, in the summer of 2015. This course, “Reading the Literary
                        Manuscripts of the Romantics,” required students to complete a final digital
                        project. In what follows, we explore the reasons for assigning a digital
                        project as well as the opportunities and challenges that we encountered.
                        Throughout the essay and in our conclusion, we provide a series of
                        pedagogical guidelines based on our experience that we believe can improve
                        student learning. We have also developed a companion website, <ref

                        hope will be of use to instructors contemplating integrating digital
                        projects within their own pedagogy. The website includes descriptions and

                    <p><hi rend="bold">ML: </hi>“Reading the Literary Manuscripts of the Romantics”
                        is an upper-division course focused primarily on five authors (Jane Austen,
                        Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary Shelley, and Dorothy Wordsworth, with some
                        attention to Percy Shelley and William Wordsworth as well). The course
                        readings are designed to engage students with questions of textuality and
                        textual migration, to study how literary works transitioned from one media
                        (usually script) to another (usually print). We also read texts (such as
                        Dorothy Wordsworth’s<title level="m"> Grasmere Journals</title> and Jane
                        Austen’s juvenilia) that were not published during the authors’ lifetimes to
                        ask why they were withheld from print, or better yet (and to quote Margaret
                        Ezell), what are authors “attempting to do” by disseminating their works in
                        handwritten form (23).</p>
                    <p>My own research in media history, and in particular the varieties of media by
                        which literary texts were disseminated in the period, informs the nature of
                        the investigations we undertake in the course. Students are asked to
                        interrogate the texts they read in their anthologies and critical editions,
                        to reconstruct the complex textual history that is usually omitted in
                        student editions, and thus to consider how the material forms in which these
                        texts circulated affect meaning. In other words, I want students to think
                        about the interactions between linguistic and bibliographical codes (McGann
                        56-57). </p>
                    <p>Although we typically associate the Romantic period with the technology of
                        print, manuscript production was ongoing, and not only in the sense that
                        almost every print work necessarily began as a handwritten document.
                        Manuscript production and circulation continued as it had for generations,
                        as an alternative to print—for material that was intended for a social
                        readership, or otherwise too risky for print. Scholars like Peter
                        Stallybrass have in fact argued that print created more opportunities for
                        manuscript production—a dramatic rewriting of the narrative of media
                        succession, whereby a new technology (like print) is seen as replacing an
                        older technology (like manuscript). Very recently, we have seen that digital
                        media, contrary to expectations and predictions, has not replaced the
                        printed book. Rather, print and manuscript, like print and digital media,
                        are interdependent, though in the Romantic period the abundance of print has
                        meant that we often lose sight of how authors persisted in their use of the
                        older technology of script. </p>
                    <p>Digital media offers great promise because it makes the study of manuscripts
                        far more accessible to researchers (including students) than they ever have
                        been. Furthermore, digital resources and digital assignments allow students
                        to represent manuscript far better than is possible in the print essay, as
                        linking and screen shots enable students to draw the original manuscripts
                        into their own projects in new and exciting ways.</p>
                    <p>The Romantic period offers rich opportunities for the exploration of these
                        questions of textuality and mediation. It is no accident that many of the
                        leading textual theorists of the last fifty years—Jerome McGann, Donald
                        Reiman, Jack Stillinger, and Kathryn Sutherland, to name only a few—have
                        developed their theoretical interventions through the study of the physical
                        manuscripts and printed books of Romantic authors. Their editions, as well
                        as their theoretical work in the field of textual scholarship, are a result
                        of the extensive manuscript (and print) record that survives. Romantic
                        authors were one of if not the first generation of writers for which
                        manuscript witnesses survive in profusion, allowing for the reconstruction
                        of textual history in ways that are impossible for previous generations of
                        authors. Further, many of our period’s authors were inveterate tinkerers,
                        both in manuscript and print: Wordsworth, for example, constantly revised
                        his texts over his fifty-plus-year career; Mary Shelley substantially
                        re-revised <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> thirteen years after its
                        first appearance; and, according to Jack Stillinger, some eighteen versions
                        survive of Coleridge’s “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” (v).</p>
                    <p>In addition, authors of the Romantic period were acutely aware of their
                        audiences, and how medium affected the reception of literary works. Robert
                        Southey’s comments on the piracies of <title level="m">Don Juan
                        </title>expresses this understanding perfectly: “‘“Don Juan” in quarto and
                        on hot-pressed paper would have been almost innocent--in a whitish-brown
                        duodecimo, it was one of the worst of the mischievous publications that have
                        made the press a snare” (Senior 128). I want students to grapple with the
                        understanding that Southey expresses—that a text published in one format
                        (expensive quarto) could be perceived to be “almost innocent,” whereas the
                        appearance of the identical text in another format (cheap duodecimo) was
                        deemed “mischievous,” even dangerous. Countless other examples could be
                        found: the effect of reading a poem in the author’s autograph offers a
                        different experience from than reading the identical poem in a newspaper, a
                        print collection, or an author’s collected works. I also want students to
                        engage with the reasons why authors might elect to circulate their literary
                        texts in handwritten form, and to explore patterns of textual movement. A
                        poem might, for example, be first exchanged in manuscript within a coterie,
                        and then subsequently printed. Alternatively, it might be printed and
                        circulated in manuscript simultaneously, or the reverse might be true, as
                        when poems were copied from print. Authors also often shuttled their texts
                        between different print forms – consider Charles Lamb’s “Elia” essays. They
                        first appeared in the <title level="m">London Magazine</title>, and then
                        were collected for separate publication in book form. The two versions are
                        not only textually different, but they also carry different bibliographical
                        signification as well. Ultimately, the course aims to involve students as
                        much as possible in reconstructing the linguistic and bibliographical codes
                        that imbue texts with meaning.</p>

                    <head>Benefits of a Final Digital Project:</head>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">ML</hi>: In previous undergraduate courses, I had offered
                        students the option to submit a final project in digital form rather than as
                        a standard print essay, and I had always been pleased with the results. As
                        the digital project was not required, it was taken up by interested students
                        but passed over by most. This result is not surprising, since I offered
                        little formal instruction, with students mostly forced to fend for
                        themselves in the construction of a digital project.</p>
                    <p> With the summer 2014 iteration of “Reading the Literary Manuscripts of the
                        Romantics,” taught in the summer of 2014, I decided to make the final
                        digital project required. There were several reasons why I thought the time
                        was ripe for such an approach. In the first place, although the course is
                        focused on literary manuscripts of the Romantic period, my students would
                        not be in a position to view, in person, a single physical manuscript
                        discussed in the course. Indeed, a course like this is only possible because
                        of the release of digital facsimiles and editions of manuscript material,

                            Austen’s (Digitized) Manuscripts.”</note> These sites all provide access
                        to photofacsimiles of manuscripts of major authors, some with
                        transcriptions. Thus, by necessity, students would be using digital
                        materials and, as a consequence, students would have to be taught to become
                        conscious and critical of the effects of digital remediation. Asking
                        students to construct their projects within a digital medium seemed a
                        natural outgrowth of this engagement with media history and digital
                        material. As we explored the ways that texts historically migrated across
                        media platforms, students were primed to explore how their own writing could
                        be disseminated and might be transformed by the use of digital platforms.
                        Finally, because their primary source material was in digital form, and
                        because manuscripts are expressively visual, a digital platform would enable
                        students to incorporate these resources in a digital project far more easily
                        than in a traditional print essay.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">AM and LS</hi>: As graduate students, we found that one of
                        the most substantive benefits of creating a multimodal digital project was
                        that it could serve as the foundation for an evolving research portfolio.
                        Instead of drafting a standalone final essay, which is generally the
                        culminating assessment for courses taught in the humanities, a digital
                        project provides a space for creating and collecting scholarly research over
                        an extended period of time. This means that the assignment has a life beyond
                        the initial classroom evaluation and can become a platform for showcasing
                        our work in alternative academic and non-academic settings (Hess 34).
                        Conceptualizing digital projects as evolving portfolios can also serve as a
                        springboard to graduate studies or to work opportunities both within and
                        beyond the academy. </p>
                    <p>Another benefit beyond the classroom is that students can make digital
                        projects more widely accessible. For instance, if a student makes their
                        digital project public (as with a website), their work is openly accessible
                        to larger populations and subject positions. The visitor statistics for
                        Ashley’s <ref target="https://frankensteinandtheother.wordpress.com/"
                            >Frankenstein: Troubling Understandings of the Other</ref> project offer
                        a small example: in the first year that the project whas been up and
                        running, it has received a wide range of visitors from Australia, Canada,
                        France, Germany, Ireland, Qatar, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and
                        the United States. Many of these visitors have discovered the website
                        through search engines. Some visitors have been professors, others have been
                        students working on <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>-related class
                        projects, and the subject positions of many other visitors remains unknown.
                        Even if a student does not make their project public, they can control
                        access by inviting others to view it. Thus parents, friends, fellow
                        students, admission committees, and potential employers can observe and
                        engage in student research and writing that is usually confined to the
                        classroom, thereby making visible (if only to a confined circle) the
                        benefits and skills associated with our discipline.</p>
                    <p>By design, the format of a digital assignment—its fluid, easily mutable
                        existence—invites students to continue editing, revising, and enhancing the
                        material presented online, even after the course is complete. This
                        invitation—coupled with the strong sense of ownership students feel over
                        work that has evolved directly from their own research interests—can
                        motivate the continual development of the project. This has been our
                        collective experience. For example, Ashley has continued to re-imagine,
                        edit, and alter her site during her doctoral studies. For example, Ashley is
                        now developing her site into a doctoral project. Lindsey’s project, <ref
                            target="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdigitizingliterature.wordpress.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDvc4I7fB2NDEYzGbdcbFv8w-6vA"
                            >Digitizing Literature</ref>, has evolved from a classroom assignment
                        into a culminating Master’s project and, more recently, into a professional
                        portfolio that showcases a history of academic work. Looking back on the
                        development of these projects demonstrates an evolution of student-led
                            research.<note place="end">To see other student-created digital

                        direct their own research, they gain a sense of ownership over their work
                        and leadership over their academic program. Our digital projects have been
                        key components of our admission to doctoral programs and our hiring into
                        research positions. We have found that showcasing a digital project as part
                        of a curriculum vitae evidences that a student possesses skills as both a
                        traditionally-trained and digitally-literate scholar.</p>
                    <p>Because digital projects have the potential for a life beyond the scope of a
                        semester, they can serve as a bridge towards professionalization. Working in
                        the Romantic period, we are lucky to inherit a prestigious lineage of
                        innovative digital scholarship. Aggregatione project sites such as Jerome
                        McGann’s <ref target="http://www.nines.org/">NINES</ref> and Laura Mandell’s
                            <ref target="http://www.18thconnect.org/">18thConnect</ref> represent
                        the vast and varied multimodal projects taking place in Romantic literary
                        studies. For students who pursue their digital projects beyond the
                        classroom—evolving their work into honor’s theses, graduate projects, or
                        professional research interests—preserving their work under an umbrella such
                        as the Advanced Research Consortium (ARC) may be held as the ultimate goal.
                        Not only do these sites provide opportunities for peer review, they also
                        enable connections between individual projects, promote standards, enforce
                        professional practices, and perpetuate an online identity of rigorous
                        scholarship. Professionalization can be neglected as an objective of
                        academic coursework but by creating assignments that develop the “skills,
                        identities, norms and values” associated with quality digital work, the
                        classroom can become an arena for digital humanities credentialing (Rockwell
                        and Sinclair 177-178). The professionalization skills gained in the creation
                        of digital projects can offer opportunities outside of the academy as well.
                        For instance, both Lindsey’s and Ashley’s digital projects have resulted in
                        opportunities to build WordPress sites outside of academia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">ML</hi>: Students who do not continue into graduate work (who
                        and these students comprise the majority of our my students) also benefit
                        from their involvement in digital projects. If one of our strengths as a
                        discipline is teaching our students how to read and write critically, we
                        must also recognize that as the media ecology we inhabit shifts and print
                        loses its former dominance, “print, essayistic literacy” will also have to
                        adapt (Williams xii). Written communication increasingly takes place in
                        digital forms, and we can take the lead in not only teaching our students
                        how to read and engage with online materials, but in how to produce them.
                        Indeed, it seems that it should be part of our mission to teach students how
                        to write—cogently and expressively—for online media, skills that they will
                        need “if they hope to communicate successfully within the digital
                        communication networks that characterize workplaces, schools, civil life,
                        and span traditional, national, and geopolitical borders” (Takayoshi and
                        Selfe 3). </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">AM and LS</hi>: In addition to providing a life beyond the
                        classroom, we believe that digital projects provide students with the
                        opportunity to pursue their own research interests, to approach familiar
                        texts with a fresh perspective, and to experiment with new methodologies.
                        While these pursuits are attainable within a traditional print essay, there
                        is an aspect of play and experimentation with digital project creation. As
                        Bonds suggests, digital experimentation and play allow students to develop
                        more fully, to discover and produce their own knowledge rather than simply
                        mimic the knowledge of a teacher, which can happen when students write
                        traditional essays (Bonds 150). </p>
                    <p>The initial experience of creating in a digital space can be disorienting for
                        traditionally trained humanities students. However, learning to work within
                        a new digital platform like <title level="m">WordPress</title> and having to
                        approach a research project through a new medium can be exhilarating,
                        leading to revitalized engagement with the material being studied and
                        expanding the methods that students can draw on to present and communicate
                        ideas. As the <ref
                            target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/model-projects/"
                            >model projects</ref> demonstrate, the opportunities to play with,
                        experiment with, and incorporate the digital through hyperlinking, adding
                        multimedia, and personalizing design aspects (like header images) give these
                        assignments more scope for creativity and for engagement with primary
                        materials than is typical in traditional assessments. Additionally, the
                        digital platform offers students the opportunity to oscillate between
                        creative and critical work as they face the new challenges of site design
                        and media integration alongside the more familiar tasks of close reading and
                        scholarly commentary. This balance is often missing from traditional
                        assessments where students are limited to working within a word processing
                        document that will be printed on paper.</p>
                    <p>Yet it must be acknowledged that the print essay continues to have some
                        benefits over the digital platform. There is the familiar argument that
                        reading from a printed text allows for better retention of information than
                        reading from a digital text does, that “the physicality of a printed page
                        may matter for those reading experiences when you need a firmer grounding in
                        the material. The text you read on a Kindle or computer simply doesn’t have
                        the same tangibility” (Konnikova para. 5). Additionally, in terms of the
                        writing process, digital platforms like <title level="m">WordPress</title>
                        lack simple, clean ways to incorporate footnotes or endnotes; while MLA
                        formatting helps to alleviate this issue, as it encourages in-text
                        parenthetical citations, the ability to incorporate discursive footnotes or
                        endnotes remains a challenge. Further, while it is easy to continue to
                        develop digital projects on platforms like <title level="m"
                            >WordPress</title>, the print essay is, of course, by no means stagnant;
                        class essays can develop into conference papers, which can develop into
                        honors theses or (for those few students who continue on in academia)
                        graduate capstone papers, which can develop into journal articles, and so

                    <p>The ability to work directly with a range of online materials—digitized

                        the usual instructor-student hierarchies by refiguring the student as the
                        creator, instead of merely the receiver, of information. In our course
                        experience, the ability to work directly with digitized versions of unique
                        primary sources moved us from the position of student to the position of
                        researcher. Interacting with these materials, which are locked in exclusive
                        manuscript vaults thousands of miles away from our classroom, would have
                        been impossible without leveraging our access to their digital surrogates.

                    <head>Pedagogical Challenges of Digital Assignments:</head>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">ML</hi>: When I began to teach courses with digital projects,
                        I had fairly rigid expectations of what they would look like: a digital
                        edition of literary text. Practically speaking, students were advised to
                        select a short text that had been somewhat overlooked in the scholarship (so
                        that they could master the critical background). Ironically, given what I
                        thought to be my attentiveness to possibilities of new media, I imagined
                        students creating digital editions that were based on a model of the print
                        edition; specifically, I had Broadview Press’s literary editions in mind.
                        Having edited a critical edition for Broadview, I was familiar with this
                        format and esteemed it as a pedagogical model, with its richly historicized
                        introductions, annotations, and appendices of primary material. Several
                        students followed this model, choosing to develop editions of shorter works
                        (such as short pieces from <ref

                            >Barbauld</ref>). </p>
                    <p> Nevertheless, I realize now that, in imagining the output to be a digital
                        edition, I was inadvertently applying a print-based model, and one that
                        imposinged unnecessary limitations on the kinds of projects students could
                        pursue. I also overestimated my ability to provide students with adequate
                        instruction on editorial theory, which proved too difficult to teach with
                        proper rigor in a course with so many other balls in the air. Fortunately,
                        most of the students navigated (or circumnavigated) this aspect of the
                        project. Some did so by selecting texts that exist in only one version, a
                        highly sensible solution that avoided many thorny editorial issues. Others,
                        who were dealing with texts that survive in multiple versions, rather than
                        fixing on (or creating) a single edition, instead sought to study those very
                        issues of migration and change between versions. Thus, many of the final
                        projects were not editions at all, but essays constructed in digital space
                        that analyzed different versions of a text. For example, Ashley’s project
                        considers Percy Shelley’s revisions to the draft manuscript of <title
                            level="m">Frankenstein</title>; others, such as Lindsey’s, examined the
                        transition of Dorothy Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Grasmere
                            Journals</title> from their manuscript sources to the early print
                        editions (edited by William Knight and Ernest De Selincourt) and into
                        excerpts used in current teaching anthologies. Many of these projects
                        succeeded in enabling students to think critically about textuality. And
                        projects can also emerge that are less textually-focused but rather seek to
                        curate and thus explore critically <ref
                            target="https://naturalromanticism.wordpress.com/">a small selection of
                            related poems</ref>, such as Byron’s separation poems, or Percy
                        Shelley’s poems to Jane Williams.</p>
                    <p>In teaching the course for the first time in 2014, I still did not fully
                        overcome the false assumption of digitally-savvy students. Jim Mussell
                        debunks this common assumption, explaining that “the technical competence of
                        the young is routinely overstated” (203). By treating the digital assignment
                        as similar to a print essay, I failed to realize that students would need
                        more guidance at each stage of the process and would require more time to
                        prepare their final digital project than was necessary for a print essay. I
                        had invited Matt Huculuk, from the University of Victoria, to offer a
                        workshop on the use of <title level="m">WordPress</title>, but that was
                        about halfway through the semester: had it been held earlier, it may have
                        assuaged student anxiety about the technical aspects of the project. Unlike
                        a print paper, which students (at this stage in their academic career) can
                        draft very quickly (if circumstances require), a digital project requires a
                        longer timeline, with more opportunities for experimentation and failure,
                        and with more time for planning and design. </p>
                    <p>In the second iteration of the course, in 2015, more time was devoted to
                        technical skill development. I was fortunate enough to have Lindsey and
                        Ashley serve as “digital coaches” (see Branscum and Toscano 95-96) for my
                        students, and we are hoping, with the <ref
                            target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/">Digital Projects
                            in the Romantic Classroom</ref> website we have created, to offer this
                        kind of digital coaching to other instructors and students. One other way in
                        which we have attempted to overcome the technical learning curve has been to
                        reconceive the course as a series of cumulative assignments that build
                        towards the final digital project. The challenge has also been to convince
                        students to take a longer view of their coursework; from the instructor’s
                        perspective, I had to overcome the practice of conceptualizing assignments
                        as discrete units, a practice driven in part by a concern that the students
                        should not be able allowed to reuse work from a previous assignments. </p>
                    <p>One other pressing issue that arose in contemplating the assignment of a
                        digital project was the question of what platform to use, and with that, of
                        sustainability. Originally (and as part of my edition-based thinking), I
                        wanted to find a platform that was oriented to scholarly digital editions,
                        one that might even allow for students to use TEI-XML for their projects.
                        Although there are a few platforms in development that will allow for the
                        implementation of TEI markup—including <ref

                        implementation. <title level="m">WordPress</title>—being extremely easy to
                        use, open source, and free—had much to recommend it. It had been
                        successfully used by <ref
                            target="http://matthuculak.com/teaching/english-4620/">Matt Huculuk in
                            his undergraduate courses</ref>, and these projects were viewable by my
                        students as potential models.<note place="foot">When re-teaching the course,
                            I had the added benefit of being able to share students projects from
                            the previous iteration of the course, which allowed students to
                            visualize what could be done, and to concretize expectations.</note>
                        Additionally, I was using <title level="m">WordPress</title> for the course
                        website, so students would necessarily become familiar with how to use its
                        basic features. I also made my peace with the issue of sustainability; for
                        reasons already articulated by Ashley and Lindsey, a digital project built
                        in <title level="m">WordPress</title> is likely to be more durable and
                        extensible than the ephemeral student essay, which has little hope of
                        reaching an audience beyond the original instructor, and no expectation of
                        survival beyond that term, or, at most, the life of the computer hardware on
                        which it is written. Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, <title level="m"
                            >WordPress</title> might offer a more stable archival structure than its
                        traditional counterpart.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">AM and LS</hi>: For many students in the “Reading the
                        Literary Manuscripts of the Romantics” class, <title level="m"

                        Reflecting on the summer 2014 course, key aspects of a <hi rend="italic"
                            >WordPress</hi> project— such as <ref

                        pages</ref>—were confusing for some of us to learn, and extra time, care,
                        and external research/reading of online documentation or user message boards
                        was needed to ensure that we understood these components. The intense
                        anticipation of the technical learning curve that precedes the development
                        of a successful digital project is often enough to discourage
                        experimentation within this new medium. In addition to the learning curve, a
                        digital platform, like a website, will often not reflect the same linear
                        structure of a traditional essay through its mandatory introduction, body,
                        and conclusion. As humanities students, many of us have years of experience
                        composing argumentative papers for print and the vast majority of, at least,
                        upper division students find great success and enjoyment in working within
                        this genre of assessment. While the standard academic essay has proven over
                        time to be a useful argumentative tool and an appropriate vessel for student
                        evaluation, multimodal projects have yet to achieve this same clout.
                        Therefore, students may approach the challenges of a digital project with
                        apprehension regarding its usefulness or relevance to their humanities
                        education. </p>
                    <p>We believe that these fears may be overcome by providing students with
                        hands-on instruction to ensure that they possess the ability skills to
                        purposefully navigate through, and successfully create with, these
                        platforms. This necessitates that class time and instructor attention must
                        be devoted to teaching the technical side of working within digital media.
                        We hope that the <ref

                        Being able to explore different projects allows students to see what is
                        possible, and concretizes the different set of expectations between a print
                        essay and a digital project.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, given the initial challenges that working in a digital
                        environment presents for many students, it is important that proponents of
                        this type of assessment clearly illustrate what can be done “with digital
                        media that we [can] not do otherwise” (Kuhn, Johnson, and Lopez 1). In their
                        article and interview series “Speaking with Students,” Kuhn, Johnson, and
                        Lopez identify some of the value-added learning experiences of born-digital
                        work, including acquiring the skills of “advanced digital literacy”;
                        “deploying the registers of text, image and interactivity”; and creating a
                        space to actively engage an academic audience in “unprecedented ways” (1).
                        By showcasing the unique value of digital scholarship, a niche can be
                        created for this type of work as an acceptable humanities assessment. We
                        have tried to exhibit these valuable learning opportunities by creating <ref
                            target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/video-tutorials/"
                            >video tutorials</ref> that help teach students how to work with both
                        text and media, and by creating a space that showcases <ref
                            target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/model-projects/"
                            >past projects</ref>, visualizing the possibilities of a digital project
                        and encouraging future students to engage in these scholarly conversations. </p>
                    <p>Another challenge is learning to integrate media and hyperlinks in a
                        purposeful and meaningful way. During the course of creating our digital
                        projects for the 2014 semestercourse, we were encouraged to provide embedded
                        images and hyperlinks in order to embrace the multimodal advantages of a
                        digital space. So too does one of the <ref

                            >video tutorials</ref> created for the 2015 course strive to equip
                        students with the tools to hyperlink and embed images, video, and audio so
                        that the student projects can successfully interact with other digital
                        platforms. Yet while it may be easy to think that connecting different
                        sources of information to one another (as a website may hyperlink to another
                        related website) is an interactive act, Lev Manovich emphasizes that
                        interactivity is deeper: true interactivity is a psychological or mental
                        process (71). In “The Myth of Interactivity” (from <ref
                            target="http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Manovich-LangNewMedia-excerpt.pdf"
                            >The Language of New Media</ref>), he argues that “the concept of
                        interactivity” as used with regard to digital media “is a tautology” (71).
                        As he says, “Once an object is represented in a computer, it automatically
                        becomes interactive” (71). Thus, while instructors may encourage students to
                        hyperlink and embed, it is important for us to be guided to do so with
                        careful consideration and intent. Instructors should ensure that students
                        are made aware that hyperlinks and embedded images may connect their site to
                        other sites, but that this act does not guarantee that their digital project
                        will be intellectually stimulating. If the hyperlink or embedded image is
                        not a key source or component of the project’s main idea or argument, or if
                        it does not help to guide, develop, or build the project’s idea or argument,
                        then the hyperlink or embedded image is probably unnecessary.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">AM and LS</hi>: Because <title level="m">WordPress </title>is
                        designed as a personal blogging platform, many of its features and its
                        fundamental structure are not conducive to building a digital literary
                        project. Unfortunately, at this time, there are no open source digital
                        edition builders available, so students must learn to work within the
                        limitations of this program or one like it. One potential problem for
                        students is that the free version of <title level="m">WordPress</title> does
                        not provide any plugins for annotations. If students are inclined to build a
                        text-based edition, being unable to efficiently markup the text is a serious
                        limitation. <title level="m">Digitizing Literature</title> ran into this
                        problem and navigated around it by embedding site-internal hyperlinks, but
                        this solution is less than ideal. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, <title level="m">WordPress</title> lacks the coded search
                        capability of a custom TEI-XML site. This means that while the <title
                            level="m">WordPress</title> search engine can identify the words
                        displayed on each webpage, it is unable to access information that could be
                        embedded in humanistic markup. For example, if TEI-XML were used to encode
                        place names or person names in a document then a site user, who was
                        interested in this type of information, would be able to call up all the
                        encoded instances instead of having to search individually for each proper
                        name. This type of categorical searching opens up an entirely new way of
                        accessing or using the text at hand. Furthermore, as TEI-XML is a discipline
                        standard in the humanities, this incompatibility is a significant loss,
                        though <title level="m">WordPress</title>’s ease of use makes it an
                        acceptable trade-off, at least when working with undergraduate students. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">ML, AM, LS</hi>: Evaluation of students’ digital projects
                        presents challenges, both from the instructor’s and the students’ point of
                        view. The expectation of most students at this later stage in their academic
                        career is that a research essay will be graded based on: the competence of
                        their research; the soundness and originality of their argumentation; the
                        persuasiveness of their close reading; and the clarity and elegance of their
                        writing. With a digital project, all of these components persist as
                        requirements, but with the additional burden of students being asked to
                        translateing their research into (what will likely be) a new digital medium.
                        In essence, students are being asked to use a new language to present their
                        research and writing, and this can cause anxiety on the part of students and
                        the instructor, who rightly may be concerned that they are demanding too
                        much. Many students have worked for years to craft arguments for and present
                        textual evidence on the printed page; therefore, transitioning the
                        print-based essay into digital form requires thought and planning. Further,
                        students may find basic tasks, such as editing and proofreading, more
                        difficult within a digital environment. For all of these reasons, assessment
                        provides a new set of challenges problems to the instructor, who wishes to
                        encourage experimentation and creativity while at the same time maintaining
                        high standards for argumentation, analysis, and composition. One way to
                        address this problem is by providing students with explicit grading rubrics,
                        and staging feedback throughout the course through peer review and both
                        formative and summative assessment (the former providing feedback to
                        students while they are still working on their projects, and the later
                        provided after they have completed and submitted the project). Example
                        materials for these various forms of feedback are available on our <ref
                            target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/course-materials/"
                            >companion site</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Although many issues were resolved by the second iteration of the course,
                        some remain. In particular, argumentation that spans many web pages can be
                        difficult to sustain. Students have been encouraged to include introductions
                        and conclusions that state and restate their overarching claims, but a
                        digital project seems tomay require a different style of argumentation.
                        Further, students use images and moving pictures far more than in
                        print-based essays, and literature students must therefore develop
                        analytical skills appropriate to those visual media. Of course, the
                        inclusion of images and video often raise issues of copyright and proper
                        citation. One strategy used in the second iteration of the course was to
                        require students to include a works cited for images, but thorny issues,
                        such as whether students can take screenshots and otherwise use images from
                        other resources, persist. </p>

                        construct a digital project, through the use of hands-on workshops and video
                        tutorials, the provision of written documentation, and the presentation of
                        previous student projects as models; (2) that the course assignments be
                        understood cumulatively, such that students are encouraged to re-use
                        material from previous assignments in the final project; and (3) that the
                        timeline for producing the digital project be staged over the course of
                        several weeks.</p>

                        of the course this summerin the fall of 2015. The purpose of the survey was
                        to determine how the students found the course material and structure,

                        agreed that they were helpful for studying English (Q.13, Q.9, Q.10).</p>
                    <p>Overall, the students felt that their technological skills improved over the
                        duration of the course; the students also felt more confident in their use
                        of <title level="m">WordPress</title> at the course’s culmination (Q.15,
                        Q.16). On average, the students in the 2014 class felt less confident in the
                        explanation of digital tools than the 2015 class: of the five students in
                        the 2014 class, three answered this statement with “agreed”, one with
                        “somewhat agreed”, and one with “somewhat disagreed.” By comparison, the
                        2015 students answered either “strongly agreed” or “agreed” (Q.17).</p>
                    <p>As these survey results suggest, the exploration and suggestions made in this
                        paper are not only based on pedagogy theory and our reflections, but also on
                        participant evaluations. The changes made to the course had a positive
                        impact on the students’ confidence in both using digital tools and in their
                        mastery of <title level="m">WordPress</title> as a content management
                        system. The resounding agreement that the digital tools provided meaningful
                        strategies for understanding were a useful window into English literature
                        both supports our objective for this course and bolsters our argument for
                        the importance of integrating humanistic research with technological
                        innovation.</p>
