               <p rend="noCount"> This collection came together as the result of the annual
                    Romantic Circles-NASSR (North American Society for the Study of Romanticism)
                    Pedagogy Prize. Lindsey Eckert and Lissette Lopez Szwydky, co-winners of the
                    2014 prize, separately submitted projects that included technology as central
                    components of their courses. Together, the six essays in this volume speak to
                    the value of collaboration, interdisciplinary teaching, and public humanities.
                    Underscoring all of the contributions is a belief that Romantic literature is
                    uniquely suited to innovate pedagogical approaches that embrace new technologies
                    because the historical period itself was characterized by questions about
                    technology, its consequences, and its possibilities. As scholars and educators
                    of Romanticism, we see strong parallels between the period that we teach and the
                    age in which we live. Using multimedia projects, the essays in this collection
                    approach themes central to Romanticism—nature, rights, collaboration, reading,
                    the public sphere—through the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the
                    nineteenth century and the digital revolution at the turn of the twenty-first
                    century. This volume provides practical overviews of technical and digital
                    alternative assignments that can be incorporated into Romantic-period courses,
                    including critical reflection about the value of digital projects in the
                    humanities. </p>

               <p>Technology preoccupies us as scholars and, in particular, as teachers. <title level="m">The Chronicle of Higher Education</title>’s blog <ref target="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/">
                     <title level="m">ProfHacker</title>
                  </ref> often features material dedicated to digital
                    pedagogy. The open-access journal <ref target="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com">Hybrid Pedagogy</ref> provides important practical and theoretical articles
                    that help educators meet the new possibilities and challenges of digital and
                    online pedagogy. Most recently, the forthcoming collection <title level="m">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and
                        Experiments</title> promises to be an important text that helps us think
                    practically and theoretically about how digital technologies are changing what
                    and how we teach in the humanities classroom. (The editors of <title level="m">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</title> have made keyword entries
                    available for <ref target="https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org/keywords/">open review on MLA Commons</ref>.) These examples are just the tip of the
                    iceberg. </p>
               <p>A reader might rightly wonder what a special issue on “Romanticism and
                    Technology” might add to this growing body of material. Indeed, this special
                    issue of <title level="m">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> is not, like
                    other previous issues, organized by genre or author. Yet underscoring all of the
                    contributions here is a belief that Romantic literature is uniquely suited to
                    innovate pedagogical approaches that embrace new technologies because the
                    historical period itself was characterized by questions about technology and its
                    consequences. Herein lies the strength of the collection. Despite the broad
                    range of approaches and interpretations contained in these essays, there exists
                    an uncanny cohesion. As scholars and educators of Romanticism, we see strong
                    parallels between the period that we teach and the age in which we live. Through
                    new lines of interdisciplinary and multimedia inquiry, the essays in this
                    collection ask us to reimagine themes central to Romanticism—nature, rights,
                    collaboration, reading, the public sphere—through the industrial Revolution at
                    the turn of the nineteenth century and the digital revolution at the turn of the
                    twenty-first century. </p>
               <p>The link between the Romantic period and today spurs our own individual pedagogy,
                    and it was for that reason that after the 2014 <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/contest">NASSR/Romantic Circles
                        Pedagogy Contest</ref> we were asked to co-edit a special issue on this
                    topic. Lissette Lopez Szwydky’s submission for the contest, “<ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/contest/2014.szwydky">Mary Shelley
                        in Context(s): Wikis and Blogs in Romanticism Courses</ref>,” uses
                    open-access digital platforms to reimagine the spirit of collaboration that
                    characterizes the texts and careers of many Romantic-period writers. Through a
                    publicly accessible wiki, her students participate in modes of conversation and
                    scholarship that are themselves more analogous to Romantic modes of thought than
                    pedagogical products like the traditional five-page essay. Moreover, by creating
                    an open-access resource that can be used by multiple courses over a series of
                    years, students’ work also points toward the Godwin-Shelley circle’s emphasis on
                    collaboration, revision, and public education. Lindsey Eckert’s entry, based on
                    the graduate course “<ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/contest/2014.eckert">Romanticism
                        and Technologies of Information</ref>,” emphasizes how debates about access
                    to and the circulation of information represented in Romantic literature,
                    particularly by members of the Godwin-Shelley circle, anticipate current debates
                    about the circulation of (digital) information. In addition to reading Romantic
                    literature, students in the course explore new approaches to literary
                    studies—TEI encoding, data mining, and platforms for making digital
                    editions—that reflect the changing face of scholarship in our own information
                    age. While students can produce research essays, they are also invited to
                    produce collaborative projects.</p>
               <p>Beyond ideas of community so crucial to our own pedagogy, collaboration also
                    grounds the pairing of “Romanticism” and “technology” throughout the essays in
                    this collection. Although a major thread of Romanticism championed individualism
                    and ideas of the solitary genius, the lived experience of many of the period’s
                    authors and readers complicate these notions. Writers at the center of
                    Romanticism formed elaborate social networks whose reach and relationship to
                    technological innovations remain impressive today. They exchanged manuscripts
                    and edited each other’s work. They corresponded regularly, taking advantage of
                    Britain’s growing mail system. They loaned books from circulating libraries and
                    discussed the latest periodicals in coffee shops. They published collaboratively
                    and competed for visibility. They employed emerging technologies to print their
                    works: steam presses, increased use of stereotype plates, and mechanized paper
                    production. They reconsidered the importance of education not only for the
                    individual but also for the masses. </p>
               <p>Similarly, this collection of essays emphasizes the possibilities opened by
                    collaboration and technology despite how much our profession continues to value
                    individual research, authorship, and teaching that privileges the essay genre.
                    Several of the contributions in this issue are collaboratively written, often as
                    the result of co-taught courses. The individually authored essays, too, show the
                    importance of collaborative discourse (in the classroom and among different
                    areas of specialization) and cooperative assignments (through peer review or
                    public sharing). </p>
               <p>In many ways, the technological and collaborative dimensions of the assignments
                    discussed in this collection mirror the material practices of Romantic-era
                    writing and publishing. Literary production (both then and now) relies on
                    period-specific technology to reimagine the audiences and aims of literature.
                    Romantic literary culture anticipates the frenetic and disjointed spirit of
                    internet publishing, social media, and educational practices. Not only was
                    “authority” a questionable category politically, but it was also one complicated
                    by historical authorship and editorial practices. As William St Clair reminds
                    us, “anonymity seems to have been normal, particularly for first books,” and
                    anonymous and pseudonymous publication was also used to escape the authority of
                    libel laws, with Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan </title>being the most famous
                    example (173).<note place="foot">For a more comprehensive view of anonymous
                        publication in the Romantic period see Peter Garside, James Raven, and
                        Rainer Schöwerling’s bibliography of English novels.</note> The slipperiness
                    of authorship—exemplified by the publication history of John William Polidori’s
                    “The Vampyre: A Tale,” originally attributed to Byron—complicated the authority
                    one had over one’s name, copyright, and literary style. Moreover, Romantic
                    writers revised frequently, and many of the period’s most famous works exist in
                    multiple versions or editions (i.e., William Blake’s illuminated books,
                    Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>, Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, and Byron’s <title level="m">The
                        Giaour</title>). Fragmentary and unstable texts unsettled conceptions of
                    literary coherence and authority. These issues, prevalent in the Romantic
                    literary marketplace, are further complicated today by modern “authoritative
                    editions” that attempt to untangle them. </p>
               <p>Such shifts in the literary marketplace concerned contemporaries. Scholarship
                    reevaluating the Romantic public sphere, such as Paul Keen’s <title level="m">The Crisis of Literature in the 1790s: Print Culture and the Public
                        Sphere</title> and Andrew Franta’s <title level="m">Romanticism and the Rise
                        of the Mass Public</title>, has shown that the conditions of writing,
                    publishing, and reading in the period were overshadowed by uneasy feelings about
                    the unknowable, uncontrollable aspects of a rapidly expanding and largely
                    anonymous public. Indeed, much of what is deemed suspicious about online
                    publishing today (textual instability, anonymity, lack of authority) reflects
                    similar criticisms that coincided with the rise of the novel, the explosion of
                    radical periodicals, the anonymous mass of writers who produced them, and
                    readers who consumed them. </p>
               <p>In this light, the essays collected here maintain technology’s centrality to
                    Romanticism and its continued legacy in the present. The themes and projects
                    discussed in this volume were not developed with the aim of imposing
                    anachronistic models of technological engagement for the sake of engaging
                    students in the study of literary history on their own terms. We maintain that
                    the pedagogical and scholarly possibilities afforded by today’s technology are a
                    natural progression of Romanticism’s emergence in the age of revolutions:
                    technological and political, literary and social. The essays here present an
                    implicit argument that Romantic technology and mediation are key precursors to
                    our own contemporary multimedia-driven culture. Thus, they support previous
                    claims that “the modern technological age” actually “began with the industrial
                    revolution and romanticism” and that “Romantic poetry is both strikingly
                    illuminated by, and capable of illuminating, our multi-mediated situation” (Ong
                    1; Langan and McLane 239). We see parallels here of Clifford Siskin and William
                    Warner’s edited collection <title level="m">This is Enlightenment</title>, which
                    resituates what is sometimes understood as a singular moment in modern history
                    as “an event in the history of mediation” characterized by the rise of distinct
                    models for organizing information, tools and techniques for disseminating
                    knowledge, and practices for operating under new philosophical, economic, and
                    political systems (1). If, as Siskin and Warner’s volume suggests,
                    eighteenth-century writers were the Enlightenment’s architects, then the
                    Romantics (and their twenty-first-century successors) were its practitioners,
                    introducing new models of critique and technique as the proliferation of new
                    media turned to saturation. </p>
               <p>Like Sisken and Warner, we see clear parallels between the technological
                    revolutions of the turn of the nineteenth century and “the tale now being retold
                    by the early twenty-first-century advent of electronic and digital media. . . .
                    [E]veryone has the sense that there is nowhere to hide from [technology’s]
                    mediating powers; in fact, the desire to hide is itself an index to saturation
                    and confirmation of difference becoming a new norm” (19). As educators, we
                    recognize that the saturation of new media in our students’ lives both in and
                    outside of the classroom requires new modes of engagement as we teach students
                    to consume, critique, and produce knowledge. We also hear echoes of excitement
                    and mistrust among our colleagues and students that resonate with the critical
                    questions that Romantic literature poses. The period’s thinkers and artists
                    employed the newest technologies to communicate with growing audiences and
                    expanding publics while remaining skeptical of its increasing presence in daily
                    life. This, too, is a value that students today can take from the Romantics and
                    the scholars who serve as mediators between the past and the present; as
                    technology becomes ubiquitous, there is a need for understanding both its uses
                    and its limitations. Since many Romantic texts themselves thematize technology’s
                    limits and possibilities as well as the changing nature of the public sphere,
                    Romanticism is especially well-situated to help students become critical users
                    of technology. One way to do this is to teach practices that ask students to use
                    the technologies available to them as a way of rethinking how they too can
                    become historical mediators for a range of audiences with varying levels of
                    exposure to the content covered in the classroom.</p>
               <p>Questions of access also offer a common thread amongst in the present collection
                    much like they informed Mary Wollstonecraft’s call for a national system of
                    education, the democratic language of “the new poetry” spearheaded by William
                    Wordsworth and Coleridge’s <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, and Percy
                    Bysshe Shelley’s excitement for the public’s increasing access to print. All of
                    the digital projects described in this issue draw on open-access resources and
                    platforms. Romantic-era literature, history, and technology are imagined for a
                    broad cross-section of students at different points in their academic careers.
                    Our decision to highlight access in our original call for papers reflects the
                    material conditions and restrictions of teaching today as budget cuts dominate
                    higher education and the value of the humanities is increasingly questioned. The
                    innovative assignments with public-engagement components outlined in several of
                    these essays demonstrate how we might use pedagogy to convey the relevance of
                    humanistic inquiry beyond the academy. By adding to Wikipedia or creating
                    original open-access editions, students of Romanticism add to a body of
                    knowledge that crosses the boundaries between town and gown. A related goal of
                    this collection is to reflect the range of institutions where Romanticism is
                    taught, the different levels of access afforded to each, and the distinctive
                    needs of students. These essays represent teaching and research environments
                    from across North America, from online courses at state institutions to small
                    classes at liberal arts colleges. </p>
               <p>Despite diverse institutions, common questions arise. What might graduate
                    students in English gain from digital projects on the Romanticism? How do
                    undergraduate English majors who will move on to a range of careers after
                    graduation benefit from non-traditional assignments? How is the study of
                    Romanticism beneficial for biology and computer engineering majors as well as
                    those in English? One significant conclusion presented by these essays is that
                    employing innovative technologies and assignments build the same skills that we
                    have traditionally valued in our discipline: close reading, analytical thinking,
                    and rigorous (well-cited) research. Moreover, these essays suggest that as
                    Romanticists we are uniquely positioned to “encourage the transfer of print
                    reading abilities to digital and vice versa” that, according to Katherine
                    Hayles, is absent in many literary courses (63). Together these essays offer
                    practical plans and course materials that will help readers confidently adopt
                    them for their own classroom. Beyond modeling innovative classroom practices,
                    the authors of these essays also help us reflect theoretically about how
                    teaching Romantic literature alongside (historical) questions of technology,
                    ethics, and humanity can help prepare students for future academic work as well
                    as for being more reflective people generally. All of the digital assignments
                    covered here require students to consider the crossover from the classroom into
                    the public sphere not as a “secondary” learning outcome but instead as a primary
                    mode of engagement that highlights practical uses and ethical effects of
                    humanistic study in the twenty-first century.</p>
               <p>Interdisciplinary thinking and action drive Seth Reno’s “‘Imagination under the
                    banner of Science’: Teaching Green Romanticism with Weebly.” Reno fuses “Green
                    Romanticism” and “Technological Romanticism” through web-based assignments where
                    students create digital editions. These editions bring together text-based
                    readings, authoritative sources, and multimedia elements that illustrate each
                    poem’s text alongside its landscapes, ecological references, and visual frames
                    of reference. Thus, Reno asks his students to model “the interdisciplinary
                    nature of the [Romantic] poems” that they study, achieving a “place-based”
                    literacy of the poems’ texts and environmental contexts. Undergraduate and
                    graduate students in this split-level course use traditional skills (close
                    reading, logical organization, and scholarly support and attribution) to create
                    digital projects that connect the ecological concerns of Romantic texts to
                    current ethical debates in a medium aimed at a public audience. Reno ends with a
                    refreshingly honest reflection about the challenges that multimedia projects
                    present, yet he also argues that, despite their challenges, these projects are
                    particularly good at providing students with skills applicable to careers both
                    in and outside of the academy.</p>
               <p>In “‘A Sound but half its own’: A Collaborative, Cross-Disciplinary Exploration
                    of Poetic Sounds in Literature and Electrical Engineering Classrooms,” Andrew
                    Burkett and Palmyra Catravas detail their innovative collaboration between the
                    humanities and the applied sciences. They show us how modern technology can be
                    used to better understand Romantic poetics. Separate groups of students from
                    English and Engineering collaborate on semester-long projects that visualize
                    sound waves created by an Aeolian harp and recite poems to “measure poetic sound
                    with scientific instrumentation.” The engineering students write papers
                    according to standards of scientific writing, and the literature students add
                    historical and literary details while also gaining experience in technical
                    writing and editing. While the individual courses each focus primarily on the
                    terms and tools of their respective disciplines, the students simultaneously
                    experience how cross-disciplinary work enhances each area of study.</p>
               <p>New approaches to semester-long projects and scholarly editions unfold from the
                    perspectives of both instructor and students in “Digital Projects in the
                    Romanticism Classroom: A Practical Guide to Student Use of WordPress,”
                    collaboratively written by Michelle Levy and two graduate students, Ashley
                    Morford and Lindsey Seatter. Along with the detailed rationale and pedagogical
                    planning that Levy relates, the student perspective adds an important voice to
                    the educational experience, arguing for the “use-value” of digital projects in
                    literature classes. Their essay challenges us to reconsider the research essay’s
                    prominence in literary courses, and it celebrates the range of outcomes possible
                    when students are afforded flexibility to experiment with new formats. The piece
                    also provides a primer for instructors who are relatively new to digital
                    projects, and it discusses numerous examples of web resources, open-access
                    archives, and a <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/">companion website</ref> with clear tutorials and links to several
                    successful projects. Additionally, Morford and Seatter describe how they have
                    used their projects as foundations for ongoing graduate work, remaking the final
                    project for Levy’s course into the first step in a larger research agenda that
                    advances Romanticism’s relevance to digital humanities.</p>
               <p>Andrea Rehn’s “Digital Communities, Embodied Learning, and Material Culture in
                    Jane Austen” invites readers to consider the parallels between social identity
                    in the Regency period and the digital age. The social networks described in
                    Austen’s works come into relief through assignments that emphasize embodied
                    practices including reading, dancing, and socializing. Students use online tools
                    such as Tumblr and YouTube to capture, create, and distribute cultural artifacts
                    and customs from the Romantic period. For Rehn and her students, technology
                    enables a multisensory understanding of the relevant historical context. Whether
                    collecting recipes for bread pudding, creating video guides, or throwing a
                    Regency-themed ball, students demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the social
                    codes that guided Austen’s characters. At the same time they are asked to
                    consider questions of subjectivity and performance as they develop their own
                    online identities, and Rehn shows how contemporary social media theories of
                    “context collapse” and “participatory culture” provide students with a framework
                    for exploring the social mores of Regency country gentry.</p>
               <p>In a different take on the more ephemeral aspects of Romantic culture so distant
                    to many students, “Digital Experiments in Romantic-era Commonplace Books”
                    contrasts the ways that audiences in different historical periods manage
                    “information overload.” Working with <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu">Harvard University Library’s Open Collections Program</ref>’s open-access
                    digital manuscripts, Shelley AJ Jones stresses the connections between
                    eighteenth-century periodicals, nineteenth-century commonplace books, and
                    contemporary technology. Padlet provides a digital platform where students
                    create their own virtual commonplace books. Students use John Locke’s indexing
                    system to “synthesize the wealth of material . . . gathered over the course of
                    the semester into manageable pieces that suggest larger questions of
                    categorizing the Romantic period.” Students curate and preserve the most
                    relevant information according to a combination of personal interests as well as
                    historical models of knowledge organization in a digital environment. Students
                    work individually and collaboratively on projects that teach them as much about
                    information management in the Romantic period as in the digital age. Readers
                    interested in data management will find useful parallels with Ann Blair and
                    Peter Stallybrass’s “Mediating Information, 1450-1800,” a concise survey of
                    techniques and technologies of storing and retrieving information from the
                    medieval period through the Enlightenment.</p>
               <p>Concluding the volume, Mark Crosby and Alex Stinson ask how collaborative writing
                    models and existing public knowledge repositories can be harnessed in the
                    Romantic literature classroom. “William Blake, Wikipedia, and a Public Pedagogy”
                    tackles the challenges of creating credible information for one of the most
                    popular sites on the internet. For Crosby and Stinson, Blake and Wikipedia are a
                    natural pairing. Both are media phenomena built on democratic ethos. More
                    importantly, they identify an opportunity for student work to shape public
                    discourse. Especially helpful in this essay is the discussion of Wikipedia’s
                    established standards for quality assessment. While many scholars question the
                    credibility of the site (especially with regard to students’ overreliance on
                    Wikipedia as a source), Crosby and Stinson show us that Wikipedia’s standards
                    are actually quite stringent—perhaps even more so than the standards to which
                    undergraduate literary students are often held. Their discussion reveals how we
                    might better align pedagogical expectations for evaluation, scholarly standards
                    for publication, and the public need for quality information. Students are thus
                    situated in a unique and empowered position to supply this need and increase the
                    visibility of the humanities in the public sphere. </p>
               <p>At their core, all of the essays here gesture toward the need to extend the
                    discourses of the humanities in general, and Romanticism in particular, beyond
                    classroom and disciplinary boundaries. Technology offers an effective toolkit to
                    accomplish these goals. One of our biggest challenges as Romanticists lies in
                    demonstrating to our students the parallels between past and present as well as
                    the value of humanities versus straightforward professional training. Technology
                    provides a bridge between concepts that may seem distinctive or perhaps even
                    incompatible to our students through practices that reflect their material and
                    virtual realities.</p>
               <p>Beyond pedagogy, the work presented in this collection has larger implications
                    for research, scholarship, and disciplinary innovation. Explicit connections
                    between technology and literature are critical to contemporary literary studies.
                    Much in the same way that Romanticists were central to the development of
                    literary theories shaping the pedagogical frameworks that underscore our own
                    training, digital humanities and pedagogy fosters not only interdisciplinary
                    work, but also <emph>intra</emph>-disciplinary discussion. What do we share in
                    common with colleagues who specialize in historical periods or theoretical
                    approaches different from our own? How can asking our own students to reimagine
                    their scholarly research and practice encourage us to do the same? How can we
                    find opportunities to connect the work in our individual courses to the broader
                    implications of literary study in the twenty-first century? The essays collected
                    here provide models for technology’s ability to reimagine Romanticism as the
                    springboard for critical pedagogy and public humanities. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> This essay outlines the approach, rationale, construction,
                    management, and results of a digital annotated poem project assigned in an
                    upper-level course on “Green Romanticism,” which I designed and taught during
                    Spring 2015. Students in this class created a website devoted to a particular

                    narratives of some of the best projects (including links to students’ sites), as
                    well as reflections on the assignment’s constraints and affordances. In doing
                    so, I urge teachers of Romanticism to adopt digital research projects as
                    alternatives and complements to traditional research papers, especially in
                    interdisciplinary programs and at schools where students’ career goals do not

                  <p>Interdisciplinarity is a Romantic convention. When Erasmus Darwin writes in
                        the Advertisement to <title level="m">The Loves of the Plants</title> (1791)
                        that the “general design” of his multi-layered scientific poem “is to inlist
                        Imagination under the banner of Science” (ix), he announces his
                        composition’s commitment to a variety of genres and technologies. In
                        addition to verse, <title level="m">The Loves of the Plants</title> is full
                        of extensive scientific footnotes, visual images, and philosophical prose
                        interludes on aesthetic theory. In order to fully understand and represent
                        the natural world, Darwin implies, we must draw from myriad disciplines and
                        technologies. As recent scholarship demonstrates, Darwin’s polymathic
                        approach to research and writing anticipates literary trends in the Romantic
                            period.<note place="foot">For the seminal study of Darwin’s influence on
                            Romanticism, see King-Hele. For more recent work, see Jackson; Nichols;
                            and Kelley.</note> The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
                        witnessed the emergence not only of what we now call ecology but also of a
                        range of authors who studied and drew from various disciplines and
                        technologies in their work. William Blake’s famous illuminated printing
                        fused the technologies of printing, painting, and industrialism in his
                        democratic poetry. Percy Shelley used hot air balloons to distribute
                        political pamphlets. Mary Shelley frequently infused her novels with new
                        scientific and technological ideas. William Wordsworth and John Clare often
                        wrote poems that opposed industrial technologies, such as railroads and
                        enclosure. Importantly, all of these poets were influenced by Darwin, and
                        for this reason he serves as a model for both Green Romanticism and
                        Technological Romanticism.<note place="foot">Courses on “Green Romanticism”
                            have become more prevalent since the Fall 1996 special issue of <title level="m">Studies in Romanticism </title>on “Green Romanticism.”
                            While many scholars prefer the label of “Romantic Ecology”—for example,
                            in the <title level="m">Romantic Circles Praxis Series </title>volume on
                                “<ref target="http://romantic-circles.org/praxis/ecology/index.html">Romanticism &amp; Ecology</ref>”—I used “Green Romanticism” for my
                            course as a more accessible term for students who are not familiar with
                            Romanticism or Ecology. “Technological Romanticism,” on the other hand,
                            is not so much a formal movement as a reference to the growing body of
                            scholarship that links science, technology, and art in the study of
                            Romanticism.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>How can we engage the overlapping scientific, ecological, and technological
                        elements of Romanticism in the classroom? How can we incorporate these
                        elements alongside the canonical literature often required for introductory
                        courses and advanced surveys? How can we help students to understand the
                        exchange between imagination and science, during the Romantic period and in
                        the twenty-first century? These questions lie at the heart of recent
                        discussions in Romantic ecocriticism and pedagogy, and they are the focus of
                        this essay.<note place="foot">See, for example, the <title level="m">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> volume on “<ref target="http://romantic-circles.org/praxis/ecology/index.html">Romanticism, Ecology, and Pedagogy</ref>”; Sobel; Orr; Louv; and
                            Garrard.</note> Scholars such as David Orr advocate place-based
                        education in the teaching of ecocriticism, in contrast to classroom reliance
                        on digital media and technology, which, as he and others suggest,
                        facilitates what Richard Louv calls “nature-deficit disorder” in our
                        students. As David Sobel argues, instructors often use “electronic media” to
                        connect students “with endangered animals and ecosystems around the globe.”
                        While motivated by good intentions, these changes ultimately “disconnect”
                        students “from the world outside their doors” (3). However, other scholars
                        and teachers have utilized digital technology successfully in teaching
                        Romantic-era literature: nearly every volume of the <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogies Edititions</title>, including this one, features
                        digital pedagogy, and the most recent winners and finalists for the <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> Pedagogy
                            Contest developed courses with a central digital component. In
                        this essay, I argue that we can do the same with ecocriticism: rather than
                        exacerbating nature-deficit disorder, digital technology can facilitate
                        students’ engagement with Green Romanticism by allowing them to think
                        outside of the classroom and to develop the kinds of interdisciplinary
                        approaches demanded by ecocriticism.</p>
                  <p>In my upper-level seminar on “Green Romanticism,” which I designed and taught
                        during Spring 2015, I ask my students to adopt a Darwinian-interdisciplinary
                        approach in understanding Romantic-era texts, including <title level="m">The
                            Loves of the Plants</title>. The culminating project of the course is a
                        hybrid website-digital edition of an assigned poem, which students create
                        using <ref target="http://weebly.com/">Weebly</ref>, a free website design
                        program. (<ref target="http://greenromanticism.weebly.com/">You can find the
                            course “hub” here</ref>, which includes the course description,
                        syllabus, bibliography, and listening list.)This website project, described
                        in detail below, mirrors the kind of approach modeled by Darwin and other
                        Romantic authors, fusing “imagination” and “science” through modern digital
                        technology. The project lends itself especially well to the study of Green
                        Romanticism, as this subfield focuses on advances in science and technology
                        related to Romantic ecology. Indeed, one overarching principle of my course
                        is to chart the various ways Romantic writers and artists attempted to
                        represent “nature”—through literature, music, visual art, science, and
                        industry. Similarly, in their website projects, students engage the multiple
                        genres and media that characterize Green Romanticism through the
                        multimodality of digital media.</p>
                  <p>The website project affords students an opportunity to shape the
                        still-evolving field of Green Romanticism. While there has been important
                        work on the ecological elements in Blake, Wordsworth, the Shelleys, and, to
                        a lesser extent, Clare, recent advances in ecocriticism, science and
                        technology studies, affect studies, and the cognitive humanities have
                        renewed and revitalized discussions of Romantic ecology. These advances
                        allow us to rethink not only the role of “nature” in the works of canonical
                        poets but also the role of Darwin and other prominent scientists in
                        Romanticism itself. After the first wave of ecocriticism in the early 1990s,
                        which emerged in part as a response to the dominance of new historicism
                        throughout the 1980s, Romantic ecocriticism has increasingly focused on the
                        complex interplay of science, literature, and philosophy that informs
                        Romantic-era ecology.<note place="foot">For a useful essay on the major
                            waves of ecocriticism, see Buell.</note> Timothy Morton thus
                        investigates the “dark ecology” of Shelley and Clare. Noel Jackson, Richard
                        Sha, and Robert Mitchell reveal the scientific and medical bases of major
                        Romantic poetry. Alan Richardson and Lisa Zunshine have pioneered Cognitive
                        Romanticism. Theresa Kelley and Janelle Schwartz trace the influence of
                        botany and taxonomy in Romantic literature and culture. This new and
                        exciting scholarship gives us fresh perspectives from which to read Romantic
                        literature, and it offers students a new model for the study of Green
                            Romanticism.<note place="foot">See Morton; Jackson; Sha; Mitchell;

                  <p>If we no longer read all forms of Romantic “nature” as “Nature”—that is, as
                        instantiations of the Romantic Ideology—but rather as potential engagements
                        with Darwinian neuroscience and Romantic-era ecology, how do we reread poems
                        like “Tintern Abbey” and <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>? If we add
                        Erasmus Darwin, Humphry Davy, and Luke Howard to the canon of Romanticism,
                        how do we re-envision <title level="m">The Botanic Garden</title>, or the
                        cloud studies of Constable and Turner, or the bird poems of Shelley, Keats,
                        and Clare? If “the English Romantics were the first full-fledged ecological
                        writers in the Western literary tradition” (19), as James McKusick famously
                        observed, how do we distinguish Green Romanticism from Romanticism? Such
                        questions framed my course on “Green Romanticism,” and they informed my
                        students’ website projects. Throughout the semester, we read poets and
                        novelists alongside scientists, artists, and Romantic scholars, and, by
                        drawing from these various texts and discourses in the creation of their
                        websites, my students were able to contribute to the ongoing reassessments
                        of Romanticism and of scholarly research and output.<note place="foot">Jerome McGann coined the term “Romantic Ideology” in his important 1983
                            study of the same name, to which ecocritics such as Jonathan Bate
                            responded in the early 1990s. After a fruitful decade of scholarship on
                            Green Romanticism, James McKusick established the Romantics as
                            foundational ecological writers, and since 2000 scholars have developed
                            and tested his claim. Many historicists have critiqued what they see as
                            the Romantics’ transcendent and idealized vision of Nature, while
                            McKusick and others have emphasized the material interconnectedness of
                            Romantic ecology. In recent years, studies on the relationship between
                            Romantic-era literature and science have moved scholarly discussions
                            beyond debates between ecocriticism and new historicism to questions
                            concerning the nature of Romantic ecology. Students in my class pick up
                            with this third wave of Romantic ecocriticism. For new historicist work,
                            see McGann; Levinson; Garrard; Morton; and Hess. For ecocritical
                            responses to new historicism, see Bate; McKusick; Nichols; Oerlemans;
                            and Rigby. For recent work in literature and science, see Sha; Schwartz;
                            Kelley; Faflak and Sha; Ottum and Reno; and Mitchell.</note>

                  <head>The Assignment</head>
                  <p>This digital project begins on the first day of class when I distribute the
                        assignment prompt [see Appendix A], and students work on the project
                        throughout the semester. Thus, from day one, students explore Green
                        Romanticism through various media; they envision their work for the class as
                        part of the online public sphere rather than the perceived private space of
                        the classroom (where work is exchanged between students and teachers only);
                        and they conceive of their research as an ongoing process that spans the
                        entire term. Moreover, students are generally more excited about starting
                        this project than a traditional research paper. This excitement helps to
                        establish student engagement with Romanticism. </p>
                  <p>As I point out in the assignment prompt, one fundamental practice of literary
                        scholarship is annotating a text: as literary readers and scholars, we take
                        notes in the margins, we underline, we make connections, we pose questions,
                        we engage with the text in order to understand it in a more sophisticated
                        and enriching manner. In our increasingly digital world, these kinds of
                        annotations have naturally moved to the digital sphere. In class, I show the
                            <ref target="http://romantic-circles.org/editions">digital editions</ref> on
                            <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> as representative examples, as
                        well as models for what students will do in their own digital projects. Once
                        I establish this rationale for the assignment, I outline the major
                        requirements. Students’ website projects must include: (1) a home page
                        containing a brief introduction to the poem and the site; (2) a separate
                        page containing the full text of the poem; and (3) at least ten hyperlinks
                        in the poem that take readers to separate pages on the site and to other
                        websites, sources, videos, paintings, and related texts. These hyperlinks, I
                        explain, are the digital annotations. They could include: biographical and
                        historical details; definitions and explanations of Romantic-era
                        terminology; references to and summaries of scholarly articles on a specific
                        aspect the poem; links to scholarly sites on the poem; paintings or other
                        visual media directly related to the poem (along with students’ commentary);
                        and whatever else is helpful in understanding and explaining the poem.</p>
                  <p>After explaining the project on the first day of class and giving students a
                        brief overview of the course Weebly site, I provide a step-by-step handout
                        on how to set up their own site [see Appendix B]. I also disperse a
                        “milestone checklist” to assess their progress throughout the semester. This
                        checklist is meant to keep students on track throughout the term: by week
                        six, students must select a text for the project; by week ten, they must
                        schedule a thirty-minute workshop with me to discuss their project, at which
                        time they must have completed the home page and at least two hyperlinks; by
                        week fifteen they must complete the project and give a brief presentation in
                        class; and by week sixteen (finals week) they must finalize their website
                        based on my written feedback and suggestions.</p>
                  <p>For assessment and grading, I use a general rubric with three mandatory
                        requirements and three broader categories [see Appendix C]. I assign
                        students a holistic letter grade for the project rather than assign points
                        for each category, but the point system could work as well. The first three
                        requirements—a home/introductory page, a page with the full text of the
                        poem, and at least ten hyperlinks—cover the nuts-and-bolts of the project,
                        while the second three categories—visual appeal, readability, and
                        research—cover the website’s content. These broader categories allow me to
                        provide specific feedback and guidance for each student’s site: during week
                        fifteen, I write a paragraph assessment for each category and provide
                        detailed suggestions for revision for each student. I also assign a letter
                        grade based on the current state of the project. Students then have one week
                        to revise and submit the final version of their project.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Project Rationale</head>
                  <p>The digital project has three major goals. First, it aims to engage a diverse
                        group of students in research on Romantic-era literature and culture. This
                        goal works especially well for students at Auburn University Montgomery: all
                        upper-level courses at AUM are “split-level,” meaning the students are a mix
                        of upper-level undergraduates and graduate students in our interdisciplinary
                            <ref target="http://www.cas.aum.edu/academic-programs/graduate-programs/mla">Master of Liberal Arts program</ref>. In this particular course, the
                        class was composed of three graduate students, seven undergraduate English
                        majors (two of whom were in the Honors program), and one undergraduate
                        Psychology major. The website project allows students to engage in research
                        without the “high stakes” of a fifteen- to twenty-page research paper—though
                        this digital project does require substantial research, time, and attention.
                        Similar to a traditional research paper, the website assignment develops
                        close reading skills, research skills, organization and logic, and
                        fundamental principles of proper citation and scholarly attribution. For
                        instance, in order to create the hyperlinks, students must have a detailed
                        and sophisticated understanding of the poem and its scholarly reception, and
                        they must decide what pages to include and in what order. Additionally, most
                        students are already comfortable with digital technology and online writing,
                        so they are more willing to jump into a website project than what may be
                        perceived as a daunting research paper.</p>
                  <p>A second goal is that students envision their research and thinking as part
                        of a broader community; the open access of many digital editions makes for a
                        poignant example. By creating a public website, students can both speak to
                        scholars and teach general readers. Like many online scholarly editions of
                        texts—and like Darwin’s poetry—students must navigate a dual audience while
                        constructing their projects: they must write for specialists and the general
                        public. Accordingly, the third goal is for students to model the kind
                        of “blended approach” taken up by Darwin in <title level="m">The Loves of
                            the Plants</title> and by many other Romantic authors that we study:
                        Blake, Darwin, Wordsworth, and the Shelleys all envisioned their works at
                        the intersections of poetry, prose, visual art, science, and/or music. The
                        digital annotated poem project allows students to bring together a range of
                        technologies in understanding their selected poems and in modeling the
                        interdisciplinary nature of the poems themselves.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Student Websites: Construction, Management, and Results</head>
                  <p>Most students were excited about the website project from the start. Many of
                        them had created personal blogs and websites in the past, and a few even had
                        experience with computer programming. Weebly is straightforward and has a
                        low learning threshold for use, making it accessible even for students with
                        limited computer skills. Students with more advanced skills were not
                        challenged by the interface itself, and they were able to concentrate more
                        on creating exciting content. In this sense, Weebly is especially helpful at
                        leveling the playing field in a blended graduate/undergraduate course, since
                        each student can adapt the project to accommodate their own interests and
                        different levels of academic skills. Several students also enjoyed the
                        creative nature of the project, which was apparent from the continual
                        changes to their home pages during the first few weeks of the semester. For
                        example, one student, Juanita Barrett, included <ref target="http://jbarret5.weebly.com">original photographs</ref>
                        documenting the different kinds of clouds in Percy Shelley’s “The Cloud.”
                        This kind of creative work, which many students produced, enhanced
                        engagement with the material and allowed students to become more invested in
                        their projects.<note place="foot"> I should note that not everyone was
                            thrilled with the assignment. One student was not comfortable with
                            computers at all, and she decided to drop the course because of the
                            digital project. This is a potential drawback: even with the
                            instructor’s offer to provide individual help and attention at each
                            stage in the process, some students are simply averse to digital
                            assignments.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Developing quality content proved more difficult for students than initial
                        construction and visual design. After creating the introductory home page
                        and the poem page, several students hit a wall halfway through the semester.
                        As one student asked in class, “I have the homepage and poem, so what do I
                        do now?” This question allowed me to connect the website project to
                        fundamental aspects of every literature course: close reading, research, and
                        writing. As a class, we modeled these moves on the day’s assigned readings:
                        Wordsworth’s “Composed upon Westminster Bridge,” Dorothy Wordsworth’s
                        journals, and a chapter from Ashton Nichols’s <title level="m">Beyond
                            Romantic Ecocriticism</title>. I began by asking students what they
                        thought about Nichols’s claim that Wordsworth’s sonnet was “[o]ne of the
                        greatest nature poems in English, by one of the greatest nature poets in the
                        language” (11). A few students said they were skeptical at first—this was a
                        poem about London, after all—but that Nichols’s subsequent close reading,
                        which illustrates his concept of “urbanature,” persuaded them. We then
                        worked through a close reading of the sonnet alongside Nichols’s analysis,
                        eventually bringing in the textual links to Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals,
                        Darwin’s writings, and other forms of Romantic natural history (all
                        discussed in Nichols’s chapter). I then asked students how these connections
                        and links might take the form of hyperlinks in a digital version of the
                        poem. (I also displayed Nichols’s site on <ref target="http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat/">Romantic Natural
                            History</ref> as another model for how students might construct their
                        own sites.) To illustrate these points, we collaboratively built a rough
                        digital version of the sonnet on Weebly, inserting hyperlinks on specific
                        words and phrases that would link to these intertextual connections. The
                        classroom had a built-in projector for the instructor’s computer (this was
                        not a computer lab), so students suggested hyperlinks that I would then
                        insert for everyone to see. This process gave students a better
                        understanding of how to approach their projects, and it allowed them to
                        connect in-class discussions and activities with their websites. </p>
                  <p>The following week, we viewed and discussed a student example of the website
                        project. Funmi Stephens, one of the graduate students, volunteered to share
                        her site with the class, which provided some of the undergraduates with a
                        model to which they could aspire. Funmi was constructing <ref target="http://ode2night.weebly.com">her site</ref> on John Keats’s “Ode
                        to a Nightingale,” and she had created several perceptive hyperlinks/pages.
                        For example, a hyperlink on the nightingale’s “self-same song” takes reader
                        to a page entitled “<ref target="http://ode2night.weebly.com/ballad.html">Ballad</ref>,” which contains a video recording of a nightingale
                        singing, details on the bird’s taxonomy, and a brief explanation of the
                        nightingale’s poetic roots in Greek mythology. This page connects the
                        literary resonances of the nightingale with the bird itself, which was
                        common in nineteenth-century England. By doing so, Funmi reveals why Keats
                        writes about this specific bird and how the nightingale relates to the
                        poem’s focus on the juxtaposition of death and immortality. Another page on
                            “<ref target="http://ode2night.weebly.com/immortal.html">Ruth</ref>”
                        further examines this juxtaposition. Funmi explains this Biblical reference
                        in the poem and provides an external link to a scholarly article on religion
                        and psychoanalysis. Although we wouldn’t read Keats’s poem as a class for
                        several more weeks, these hyperlinks revealed connections similar to those
                        that Nichols had charted in the readings from the previous week. Providing
                        this example in class inspired many students and helped them to envision
                        their own sites.</p>
                  <p>In general, though, there was not a vast difference in the quality of the
                        sites between the undergraduate and graduate students. As none of the
                        students were specializing in eighteenth- or nineteenth-century British
                        literature, they all had more or less the same investment in Romanticism.
                        Also, most graduate students at AUM go into secondary education or community
                        college teaching programs, so research in British Romanticism is not a
                        central focus of their studies. I imagine things might be different in a
                        doctoral program, where students would be at much different stages in their
                        programs of study, but in my class, there was only a one- or two-year
                        separation between the first-year Master’s students and the junior and
                        senior undergraduates. </p>
                  <p>Indeed, an undergraduate created one of the best projects of the course. In
                            <ref target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com">her site</ref> on

                            Pi</title>, and Romantic scholarship, among other things. This site had
                        the most hits (something you can track on Weebly), and Leslie was even
                        contacted by a scholar whom she cites. Her site exemplifies the broad range
                        of scholarly engagement afforded by the digital project. For instance,
                        Leslie links the first line of Blake’s poem—“The Voice of one crying in the
                        Wilderness”—to a <ref target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/isaiah-40-1-5.html">page</ref> that explains the Biblical allusion to Isaiah 40:1-5. By
                        teasing out this allusion, Leslie performs what we may call “classical”
                        literary scholarship. However, she also draws from High Theory: in a <ref target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/freud.html">page</ref> on
                        Freud’s theory of personality, she uses psychoanalytic theory to interpret
                        Blake’s concept of the Poetic Genius. Additionally, Leslie created pages on
                            <ref target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/life-of-pi.html">
                        <title level="m">Life of Pi</title>
                     </ref> and <ref target="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/gandhi.html">Gandhi</ref>
                        to explore Blake’s unconventional religious thought. These pages contain
                        quotations, videos, and links to other sites on religion.</p>
                  <p>Another undergraduate, Sonni Gunnels, created an <ref target="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com">excellent site</ref> on Shelley’s
                            <title level="m">A Vindication of Natural Diet</title>, bringing
                        together information, images, and statistics on anatomy, crime, disease,
                        medicine, and ethics in relation to animals and meat eating. Like Leslie,
                        Sonni’s site illustrates a broad range of scholarly engagement, from a <ref target="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/meatless-edens.html">page</ref> on
                        the religious and mythological bases of vegetarianism to a <ref target="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/fermented-liquors.html">page</ref>
                        on Shelley’s references to “fermented liquors” to a <ref target="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/meat-and-crime.html">page</ref> on
                        contemporary statistical analyses linking meat consumption and crime. Sonni
                        successfully “modernizes” Shelley’s treatise by drawing from twentieth- and
                        twenty-first-century science to vindicate vegetarianism. Her
                        multidisciplinary approach parallels those of Shelley and Darwin, and her
                        site connects Shelley’s text to the present day, which was a major goal of
                        the assignment.</p>
                  <p>Despite these successes, there were two major difficulties related to the
                        project: time management and plagiarism. As is often the case with final
                        essays, a few students put off the majority of the work until the final week
                        of the semester, which resulted in less-than-polished websites. I gave
                        students freedom to complete the project on their own schedule, as long as
                        they followed the milestone checklist outlined earlier. The required week
                        ten meeting proved especially crucial to students’ success. During this
                        face-to-face meeting, I was able to assess each student’s progress, and we
                        had positive discussions on possible hyperlinks and timelines for
                        completion. However, approximately half of the students had completed only
                        the home page and poem page. This required lots of brainstorming, which was
                        also helpful for many students. One possible solution to this problem would
                        be to break the project into multiple stages throughout the semester, with
                        multiple deadlines and grades for each stage.</p>
                  <p>The second difficulty involved plagiarism. When I reviewed students’ sites
                        during the week ten meeting, many hyperlink pages contained instances of
                        direct plagiarism. Several students had copied and pasted whole paragraphs
                        from external sites on specific places, author biographies, and scientific
                        details. Some students had included a link at the bottom of the page—but no
                        indication that the writing was not their own—while others did not. As far
                        as I could tell, these were not instances of intentional plagiarism:
                        students simply thought they could do this kind of “reposting” in the online
                        environment (we see it all the time on news sites and blogs, right?). This
                        problem generated fruitful discussions about academic research and citation
                        methods, both in an online environment and in “traditional” modes of
                        scholarship. I likened hyperlinks to footnotes in literature anthologies and
                        scholarly articles, stressing to my students that even on websites, they
                        should always make a clear distinction between their writing and that of
                        others. This may seem like a basic point to stress in an upper-level
                        literature seminar, but I think many students have a much different sense of
                        the “rules” pertaining to online writing and paper-based writing. I plan to
                        add a lesson about online plagiarism and citation rules when I assign this
                        project in the future.</p>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>Overall, the website project was a success. Students enjoyed building and
                        sharing their sites, were able to perform significant research and to engage
                        with Romantic texts without the perceived pressure of a formal research
                        paper, and have a permanent testament to the work they did throughout the
                        semester. What’s more, their fusion of “imagination” and “science” enabled
                        them to make creative <emph>and</emph> scholarly connections with Green
                        Romanticism. This is a major reason why the website worked so well for this
                        class: students learned about and explored the multidisciplinarity of Green
                        Romanticism through a digital assignment that required them to adopt a
                        similarly multidisciplinary approach. My students were able to contribute
                        genuinely to the ongoing shaping of the field, providing new ideas and
                        insights to me, to their classmates, to scholars, and to the general
                        public.</p>
                  <p>Ultimately, I urge teachers of Romanticism to adopt digital research projects
                        as alternatives and complements to traditional research papers, especially
                        in interdisciplinary programs and at schools where students’ career goals do
                        not include academia. In fact, <emph>most</emph> of our students will not
                        pursue an academic career. A digital website project provides students with
                        skills applicable to a wide range of professions: digital composition,
                        visual design, careful research and writing, and creative thinking are core
                        skills in a number of fields. Moreover, website design—even the simple
                        design process of Weebly—is certainly something many students will encounter
                        after they leave college, and having even a brief experience with website
                        design in a literature course could prove a valuable asset. Assigning a
                        website project has the added benefit of engaging students who otherwise
                        have no commitment to or special interest in Romanticism as a field of
                        study. For many students, an upper-level course in Romanticism will be their
                        only exposure to the literature and art of this period, so the website will
                        stand as a lasting testament to their work—and perhaps will inspire a
                        lifelong love of literature. And, while I have argued that the project works
                        especially well for Green Romanticism, I believe this project could be
                        adapted successfully for other thematic approaches or to Romanticism more
                        broadly. </p>
                  <p>I also think this project could be tailored for students pursuing a doctoral
                        degree in English: a more sophisticated version of the project utilizing
                        advanced software would be quite appropriate for students at a Research I
                        institution, whose future careers will most likely involve work in the
                        digital humanities. The MLA Job Information Lists from the last few years
                        show that institutions are increasingly interested in hiring recent PhDs
                        with either a focus in digital humanities or a secondary specialization in
                        some form of digital studies. Additionally, digital projects such as the
                            <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org">

                        <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>
                     </ref>—not to mention the
                        explosion of online journals and open-access scholarly sites—indicate one of
                        the central directions our profession is headed. Such digital projects
                        afford our students not only opportunities to access important texts and
                        research on canonical figures like Blake and the Shelleys but also to
                        explore lesser-known figures such as Erasmus Darwin. Technology and Green
                        Romanticism go hand in hand, and emphasizing this connection in the
                        classroom has the benefit not only of bringing scientist-poets like Darwin
                        into the fold of Romanticism but also of drawing in more students to an
                        intensive study of Romanticism itself.</p>

               <head>Appendix A: Annotated Poem Project: Assignment Prompt</head>
               <p rend="noCount">As literary scholars, we annotate texts as we read: we take notes
                    in the margins, we underline, we make connections, we pose questions, we engage
                    with the text in order to understand it in a more sophisticated and enriching
                    manner. In our increasingly digital world, these kinds of annotations have
                    naturally moved to the digital sphere. Every year, there are more and more
                    digital editions of literary works, and more sites dedicated to sharing
                    scholarship with a broader audience (see, for example, the <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> site, <ref target="http://romantic-circles.org">http://romantic-circles.org</ref>, especially its digital editions: <ref target="http://romantic-circles.org/editions">http://romantic-circles.org/editions</ref>). For this project, you will contribute to
                    this developing digital world of scholarship by creating an online annotated
                    edition of an assigned poem using Weebly (<ref target="http://www.weebly.com">http://www.weebly.com</ref>). Using Weebly is free and quite easy: the
                    website is generated for you, so all you need to do is upload material and
                    customize design elements.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">Here’s the assignment: you will create your own Weebly website
                    dedicated to one assigned poem, which you will sign up for during the first half
                    of the semester. You will send me the url for your site, and I’ll post a link on
                    our shared course site (<ref target="http://greenromanticism.weebly.com">http://greenromanticism.weebly.com</ref>). On your site, which you can
                    design in any way you see fit, you must include: (1) a home page containing a
                    brief Introduction to the poem and overview of your digital edition; (2) a
                    separate page containing the full text of the poem; and (3) at least 10
                    hyperlinks in the poem that take readers to separate pages on your site and to
                    other websites, sources, videos, paintings, and related texts. These hyperlinks
                    are the digital annotations. They could include: biographical and historical
                    details; definitions and explanations of Romantic-era terminology; references to
                    and summaries of scholarly articles on a specific aspect the poem; links to
                    scholarly sites on the poem; paintings or other visual media directly related to
                    the poem (along with your commentary); and whatever else is helpful in
                    understanding and explaining the poem. Your project is due by our last class
                    session, and we’ll share those in class.</p>

                        it!</item>
                  <item>Watch the “how-to” video or click on “Build My Site.”</item>
                  <item>Give your site a name at the top of the homepage (you can also change this

                  <item>Click “Publish” in the upper right hand corner of the page.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>A box will appear telling you your website has been published, and it will
                        ask if you’d like to upgrade to a .com website. <hi rend="bold">Do not
                            upgrade</hi>. Simply close the dialogue box.</item>

               <p rend="noCount">Congratulations, your site is now live! That means if you type in
                    the URL, your site will appear. Of course, at this point your site is
                    essentially empty, but you will build, design, and create pages for your project
                    throughout the semester. Once you decide the poem for your project, come talk to
                    me and then begin to build your site.</p>

                    the site before signing out, or your changes will not be saved. Every time you
                    click “Publish,” Weebly will ask if you’d like to upgrade: simply close this
                    dialogue box (we’re using the free account, and Weebly wants you to upgrade to
                    an account with a monthly fee).</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Name:</p>
               <p rend="noCount">
                  <emph>Introductory Page</emph>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount">Your Introductory Page should clearly and concisely establish the
                    content and purpose of your site, as well as provide appropriate background
                    information and images. Links to the various pages on your site should be easily
                    accessible.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">
                  <emph>Poem Page</emph>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount">The full text of the poem should appear exactly as it was
                    published/reprinted in our anthology. Font style and size should be easy to
                    read.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">
                  <emph>Hyperlinks</emph>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount">The poem should have a minimum of ten hyperlinks that take your
                    reader to specific pages on your site and/or to appropriate external sites. The
                    hyperlinks should provide readers with detailed information to help them
                    understand the poem—that is, the information you provide should not be obvious,
                    but rather should require some deal of research and specialized knowledge on
                    your part.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">
                  <emph>Visual Appeal</emph>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount">Think carefully about the overall design of your site as well as
                    the interplay of image and text on each individual page. We read both image and
                    text on websites, so the two should complement each other. Avoid cluttered
                    pages, fonts that are difficult to read, and blurry images.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">
                  <emph>Readability</emph>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount">Your writing should be clear and concise, and it should be easy to
                    navigate through the site. As you are writing for a public audience, you should
                    avoid academic jargon and highly-specialized terminology. If you do use an
                    unfamiliar term or concept, explain it clearly for your readers.</p>
               <p rend="noCount">
                  <emph>Research</emph>
               </p>
               <p rend="noCount">Your site should contain appropriate outside research from
                    scholarly, peer-reviewed publications and sites. There is no minimum research
                    requirement, but your site should reflect months of research and work on your
                    text. You must provide appropriate citations for all outside sources. </p>

                  <p>In a recent cross-disciplinary project aimed at bridging courses in English
                        and Electrical Engineering at Union College, we conducted a dual exploration
                        of the role of sound in Romantic literature, culture, and technology by the
                        incorporation of Electrical Engineering practices and technologies into a
                        Romanticism course, on the one hand, and, on the other, the introduction of
                        Romantic poetry, theory, and technology into a course on digital signal
                        processing. The collaboration brought together two intermediate-level
                        courses: “The Romantic Revolution” and “Discrete Systems.” More
                        specifically, we devised an interdisciplinary team experience bringing
                        humanities and engineering approaches to the analysis of the phenomenon of
                        sound as represented in poetry and technology of the Romantic period. We
                        used contemporary technology from Phasor Lab (a state-of-the-art facility
                        located at Union College’s Peter Irving Wold Center for Science and
                        Engineering) to measure poetic sound with scientific instrumentation. This
                        trans-disciplinary lab required English students to work in conjunction with
                        their peers who specialize in signal processing for a dual investigation of
                        the conceptual, aesthetic, and technological contexts of Romantic sound—not
                        only of the poetry but also the age’s beloved Aeolian lyre. </p>
                  <p>Students first examined the spectral content of an Aeolian harp, an
                        instrument that fascinated Romantic-period poets and inspired many lyrical
                        poems, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Effusion 35” (1795) (later
                        titled “The Eolian Harp” [p. 1796]) as well as Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “Mont
                        Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamouni” (1817). In addition,
                        engineering students recorded, processed, and analyzed student recitations
                        of Romantic poetry related to the Aeolian harp; these students then
                        collaborated with their peers from the Romanticism course to label formal
                        aspects of the poetry (e.g., assonance, alliteration, rhyme, meter, poetic
                        feet, etc.), using forms specific to each discipline. Student teams from the
                        two courses offered simultaneously by the English and Electrical and
                        Computer Engineering (ECE) Departments ultimately produced co-authored term
                        papers in the style of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics
                        Engineers) conference papers (intended for an engineering audience). While
                        writing the reports, engineering students focused on composing the technical
                        aspects of the project, while literature students provided prose related to
                        literary and historical aspects of Romanticism. The literature students took
                        the lead in the peer-editing process and also became familiar with aspects
                        of technical writing.</p>
                  <p>In this essay, we detail the various technologies and techniques—including
                        binaural recording and the Short-time Fourier Transform—that we have
                        employed in this collaboration, as well as the vital functions that Romantic
                        poetic and sound technologies played in the classroom and lab environments
                        at our liberal arts institution during this multi-year project. We focus on
                        the role of Romanticism in the hybrid humanities-engineering classroom at a
                        small undergraduate college and foreground the value of contemporary
                        technologies in the study of historical understandings of sound.</p>

                  <head>Introduction: Interdisciplinary Collaborations</head>
                  <p>This collaboration began as a result of several boot camps that occurred at
                        the 2013 The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp), “Humanities +
                        Engineering” at Union College. We required students from our respective core
                        sophomore-level courses in British Romantic studies and ECE to attend a
                        session on “Music + Engineering,” where the engineering students delivered
                        an interactive demonstration on signal processing techniques to a diverse
                        group of non-experts from various disciplines and fields. As an example, the
                        students described the concepts of time and frequency domain analysis and
                        the use of the Fourier Transform to decompose sound into its composite
                        frequencies. The student populations enrolled in these two courses spanned
                        several majors and minors including English, Art History, Bioengineering,
                        and Music. The ECE course on digital signal processing, for example, is
                        required by three engineering programs at Union College (Electrical,
                        Computer, and Bioengineering), and all majors and minors at our academic
                        institution enroll in sophomore-level courses offered by the English
                        Department. </p>
                  <p>During the dynamic and engaging question-and-answer session that followed
                        this THATCamp event, we began discussing the possibilities of recording and
                        analyzing natural sounds occurring outside of human structures and
                        institutions. For instance, we pondered the differences between
                        environmental and musical sounds as well as the types of sounds created
                        during the recitation of poetry. This conversation led us to think about the
                        nature and function of the Aeolian harp, a wind harp placed outside in
                        fields but most often during the Romantic period in open window casements or
                        in other domestic settings in which natural breezes impact the tuned strings
                        of the harp, thus setting them harmonically into motion. While the Aeolian
                        harp was invented in an earlier period, it is well known that the device
                        became an absolute fascination during the Romantic era, and poets such as
                        Coleridge and Shelley often employed the trope of the harp in both poetry
                        and prose. In fact, Timothy Morton has noted that the Aeolian harp “became a
                        household item as popular and familiar in the long eighteenth century as
                        sound systems are today” (313). “The Aeolian harp is an environmental
                        instrument,” writes Morton, “[o]ne places the harp in a window, so that it
                        will catch the undulations of wind” (313). As “a form of recording or
                        monitoring” of the environment, the Aeolian harp is actually closer
                            <quote>to science than to art, nearer to modern sensors and seismographs
                            . . . than to the idea of an “art object,” something in a frame, in an
                            exhibition space or in an anthology, discrete, separated, isolated, and
                            focused. Such instruments modulate one wave (wind in the case of the
                            Aeolian harp) in terms of another wave (sound waves produced by the
                            strings). (Morton 313)</quote> Through an internal grant, we were able
                        to purchase not only a contemporary, commercially manufactured wind harp for
                        use outdoors but also the type of period-specific casement harp described by
                        Morton—a replica harp that was hand-crafted by a professional luthier and
                        modeled upon Romantic-period originals.<note place="foot">The authors would
                            like to thank Union College for its generous funding of this project
                            through both the Humanities Faculty Research Fund (HFRF) as well as the
                            Internal Education Foundation (IEF) grants. The measurement

                        following question: given late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
                        interests in this instrument as well as its function in verse as a lyrical
                        trope, what about Romanticism might particularly lend itself to
                        technologically infused or enhanced pedagogical approaches and assignments
                        related to this device and some of the poetry it helped to inspire? </p>
                  <p>Despite the fact that the Romantics are often perceived as critiquing rampant
                        industrialization, technological questions and concerns can be found
                        throughout even the most celebrated and foundational texts of the period.
                        Shelley, for instance, compared the human body—and especially the human
                        sensorium—to something like a radically complex machine akin to the Aeolian
                        harp. He famously writes in the opening paragraphs of his “A Defence of
                        Poetry” (c. 1821) that <quote>[m]an is an instrument over which a series of
                            external and internal impressions are driven, like the alternations of
                            an ever-changing wind over an Æolian lyre, which move it by their motion
                            to ever-changing melody. But there is a principle within the human
                            being, and perhaps within all sentient beings, which acts otherwise than
                            in the lyre, and produces not melody alone, but harmony, by an internal
                            adjustment of the sounds or motions thus excited to the impressions
                            which excite them. (Shelley 511)</quote> Shelley here revises and
                        extends his earlier understanding and interpretation of the nature and
                        function of the Aeolian lyre as treated in poems such as “Mutability (‘We
                        are as clouds’)” (1816) and, perhaps more significantly, “Mont Blanc.” The
                        prompting of human cognitive functions through sensory stimuli might be
                        analogous to environmental winds shocking into life an Aeolian harp, Shelley
                        suggests in the “Defence,” but this analogy goes far beyond any simple,
                        one-to-one correspondence because “within the human being” there exists “an
                        internal adjustment” to external stimuli—an adjustment that is best
                        understood as not only self-reflexive but also as existing in dialectical
                        relation with the “impressions” from an external world. For Shelley, then,
                        analysis of the Aeolian harp ultimately leads to a conception of
                        subject-object relations as existing in complex feedback loops, or perhaps
                        better stated, human subject and external environment are always already
                        deeply interfused for Shelley. This is a sentiment that the poet expressed
                        just a few years earlier in “Mont Blanc”: <quote>

                  <p>Reconsidering his earlier statement in this poem that the “everlasting
                        universe of things / Flows through the mind” (1-2), Shelley suggests in the
                        lines above that human cognitive functions might very well “passively . . .
                        receiv[e] fast influencings” from external environments, but cognitive
                        functions also very much <emph>render</emph> their environments as well.
                        According to Shelley, minds and worlds thus exist in reciprocal
                        relationships akin to what William Wordsworth famously describes as that
                        “mighty world / Of eye and ear, both what they half-create, / And what
                        perceive” (106-108). </p>
                  <p>Extending Shelley’s Romantic-era understanding of the human-environment
                        dialectic to the technological, John Tresch contrasts the “classical
                        machine,” “[e]xemplified by the clock, the lever, or the balance” and “seen
                        as a passive transmitter of external forces, as a symbol of balance and
                        eternal order” representative of “a stable, determinist nature and . . .
                        associated with an epistemology of rational, unfeeling detachment” (12),
                        with what he terms the “Romantic machine,” epitomized by, for example, the
                        Aeolian harp: <quote>The exemplary machines of the romantic era . . . could
                            be seen to have their own motive force within them; they were presented
                            as ambiguously alive. . . . In the early nineteenth century, machines
                            were not exclusively associated with detachment, rationality, and
                            fixity, but with the conversions, imaginative flights, and metamorphoses
                            of the fantastic. They drew forth invisible powers, converted them, and
                            put them to use. Unlike the classical machine, the romantic machine did
                            not stand alone; it involved the active participation of the observer
                            and articulated a spontaneous, living, and constantly developing nature;
                            it produced aesthetic effects and emotional states. (12)</quote>
                        Romantic-era intellectuals like Coleridge and Shelley were drawn to the
                        Aeolian harp and gave treatment to the device repeatedly in their writings
                        because this instrument represented at first an analogue but ultimately a
                        metaphor for the type of “active participation” that they each envisioned
                        human subjects experiencing while moving through dynamic and vital (if also
                        deeply unpredictable) external environments. For these reasons, “[t]he
                        Aeolian harp looks backwards to a poetics of place and of the genius of
                        place; and forwards to a poetics of automation, an uncanny foreknowledge in
                        the cultural imaginary of recording technologies,” as Morton has
                        persuasively explained (327). </p>

                  <head>Data Acquisition and Analysis: Binaural Recordings</head>
                  <p>Inspired by not only the Romantic preoccupation with this “recording” device
                        but also by contemporary investigations of the Aeolian harp as both
                        technological instrument and literary trope in recent Romantic criticism and
                        theory, students in the Romanticism course studied the basic elements of
                        poetic rhyme and meter as well as other related matters pertaining to the
                        study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century poetics (e.g.,
                        assonance, consonance, enjambment, varieties of poetic feet, etc.) in poems
                        such as “The Eolian Harp,” “Mutability,” and “Mont Blanc.” A unique setup
                        awaited the English students in the ECE Department’s laboratory, where
                        poetic readings were recorded binaurally so that the recordings would
                        reproduce an uncanny, three-dimensional sense of sound directionality as
                        perceived by a listener at a particular position. In order to prepare to
                        collaborate during our cross-disciplinary laboratory investigation, we
                        selected “Mont Blanc” as our focus text due to the poem’s emphasis on the
                        nature and function of sound as well as its various engagements with themes
                        and concepts related to the Aeolian lyre. During the first three weeks of
                        the course in Romanticism, students were introduced to a range of basic
                        poetic devices, techniques, and terms studied during close readings and
                        critical investigations of a range of other canonical Romantic-era texts
                        (e.g., Wordsworth’s 1799 edition of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>).
                        In addition to the formal aspects of poetry, students in the English course
                        simultaneously explored the conceptual and historical foundations of
                        Romanticism. </p>
                  <p>Meanwhile across campus, engineering students learned fundamentals of digital
                        signal processing, including sampling and quantization, the Nyquist Theorem,
                        the concepts of time and frequency domain, the Fourier Transform, as well as
                        spectrogram and digital filtering techniques. The Nyquist Theorem provides
                        guidance on how to acquire a signal (such as a recorded sound) without
                        artifacts, and the time and frequency domain, the Fourier Transform, and
                        spectrogram and digital filtering permit the study and processing of the
                        signal’s spectral content. Students also learned a technique for filtering
                        signals to remove selected frequency components, which can potentially
                        separate a signal with two or more simultaneously occurring contributions
                        into independent components. In order to emphasize to the students that the
                        signal processing techniques are general and can be applied to the
                        investigation of signals acquired from a range of sources—poetic, musical,
                        environmental, and otherwise—the students performed a blind analysis of data
                        from a “mystery source.” Only after completing the assignment was it
                        revealed that a neurobiologist had provided the data. </p>
                  <p>Having briefly introduced both groups of students to Coleridge’s
                        representation of the Aeolian harp as “that simplest lute” which “by the
                        desultory breeze caressed” produces “long sequacious notes / [that] [o]ver
                        delicious surges sink and rise” and which create, in effect, “a soft
                        floating witchery of sound” (13, 15, 19-20, 21), we chose to auralize (and
                        therefore literalize) for the group during laboratory time the sound that,
                        in part, evoked Romantic poets’ imaginative literary descriptions of this
                        device’s sounds. We first sampled a recording made from a contemporary,
                        commercially manufactured wind harp. This modern interpretation of the
                        Aeolian harp is shown below (Figure 1) against an ominous, late-October
                        Schenectady sky, and a recording of it being played by the wind (audible as
                        background noise underneath the sustained, eerie sounds of the harp) can be

                        (Figure 2). Listening to the type of technology that excited the
                        imaginations of several Romantic poets added a new dimension to the
                        students’ exposure to this work. We then asked the engineering students to
                        use their repertoire of digital signal processing techniques to add yet
                        another dimension to the group’s collective understanding of the harp and

                  <p>During the next phase of collaboration, students from the English course were
                        asked to recite for the engineering students previously assigned lines from
                        Shelley’s “Mont Blanc,” a poem that, as noted earlier, grapples in part with
                        conceptual concerns related to the Aeolian harp and its functions.
                        Engineering students recorded the recited poetry with binaural technology in
                        Phasor Lab, a specialized, soundproof laboratory equipped for experiments at
                        the intersections of Electrical Engineering and Music.<note place="foot">

                  <p>Before the binaural recording activity, we paired up students in the
                        Romanticism course, assigned roughly ten lines from “Mont Blanc,” and
                        required them to practice together to improve poetic recitation techniques
                        taught in class and through assignments. To improve recitation of their
                        assigned sections of verse, we asked students to separate out each line of
                        poetry into its five feet by identifying a given line’s ten syllables of
                        iambic pentameter and to divide those syllables into pairs of two. Once
                        students divided the assigned lines into feet, they then marked up lines for
                        patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables (please click <ref target="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/burkett-catravas-DOCUMENT1.pdf">here</ref> for an example of this type of marking assignment).<note place="foot">To create this document for our students, we employed
                            Herbert Tucker’s very helpful “Mont Blanc ll. 1-11” from his <title level="m">For Better for Verse</title> project, hosted at the

                        and marking techniques greatly assisted these students in better
                        understanding the rhythm and meter of assigned lines and allowed them to
                        sound out the poetry when practicing recitations. During the lab day
                        recording, one individual from each pair of students volunteered to recite
                        aloud assigned selections of Shelley’s verse. </p>
                  <p>Following these activities, the engineering students returned to the ECE
                        Department with the recordings of both the Aeolian harp and poetry and
                        plotted their recordings in the time and frequency domain (using Short-time
                        Fourier Transform, or spectrogram) (Proakis and Menolakis). They compared
                        and contrasted the wind-excited harp data with the data collected from the
                        recited poetry. To analyze the harp data further, the students also
                        considered possible algorithms for separating the sound of the wind from
                        that of the harp. Moving on to the recited poetry, once students identified
                        the onset of words and/or specific syllables within the spectrogram, they
                        entered the next phase of the interdisciplinary collaboration, which
                        required the expertise of their peers from the Romantic poetry class. </p>
                  <p>We arranged a meeting between the two classes, with each group of students
                        arriving with their respective forms of individually prepared data analysis
                        (e.g., marked, prepared lines; spectrograms, etc.). In order to obtain
                        insight into the interpretation of spectrograms, the students listened to an
                        audio recording of an Aeolian harp (included at the end of this paragraph) and identified the signature of various aural features as
                        they appear within the spectrogram (shown in Figure 4). By listening to the
                        audio of the harp excited by the wind, one hears the harp’s overtones
                        sustained in time (which correspond to the long, horizontal lines in the
                        spectrogram in Figure 4) and abrupt flapping of the wind (which corresponds
                        to the vertical lines in the spectrogram, because the duration of the wind’s
                        noise is short in time). The harp is initially excited in the lower portion
                        of the frequency range, and a burst of higher frequency overtones begins
                        about halfway through the sample, rising briefly to frequencies above 1,500
                        Hz in the upper portion of the figure.<note place="foot">All spectrograms in

                        verse, students from the ECE course guided their peers studying literature
                        in interpreting the technical visualizations. In effect, each group’s
                        respective expertise fused to produce interdisciplinary interpretations of

                        side (Figure 6), revealing differences in recitational tempo, caesura,
                        stress placement within poetic feet, and features of the natural timbre of
                        each reader’s voice.</p>

                  <p>Pedagogically speaking, having students perform analyses such as those shown
                        in the figures above and build such evidence into technical papers provided
                        another opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration. The students in the
                        English course had writing-based techniques to share with the engineering
                        students, but these humanities students were generally unfamiliar with the
                        constraints of writing for a professional technical journal. Starting the
                        first week of the term, the engineering students prepared for this aspect of
                        the collaboration by performing a detailed analysis of several
                        representative technical papers in professional engineering
                        journals—stripping content until the papers were distilled into skeletal
                        forms. In one exercise, the students analyzed high-impact papers for
                        language usage and style, including variation in sentence length and
                        structure. In another, they focused on how the authors of transformative
                        papers incorporated engaging language into objective descriptions of
                        material not typically intended to evoke the kind of visceral response that
                        lends itself perhaps more naturally to imaginative prose. The resulting
                        templates included such information as the core elements of an abstract,
                        typical structure for an introduction, efficient presentation techniques for
                        the results of a literature search, and interesting ways to present a slew
                        of mathematical equations. Armed with these skeletal templates by the end of
                        the term’s first week, the engineering students prepared to flesh out their
                        templates with prose, section by section, as relevant materials were learned
                        during class time (e.g., mathematical theory, data, etc.). By the time that
                        the interdisciplinary group meeting on data analysis occurred, the
                        engineering students were able to prepare a draft of the theory,
                        experimental setup, and results sections of their papers, which they then
                        sent to their peers in the Romanticism course. </p>
                  <p>Having received their collaborators’ drafts, students in the English course
                        began the peer-editing process with the goal of helping their collaborators
                        to articulate and explain in greater detail the results of their
                        experiments. For example, students focused on inserting a range of
                        appositive phrases to qualify such things as definitions for consonance,
                        iambic pentameter, the different forms of poetic feet found in “Mont Blanc,”
                        caesura, alliteration, assonance, and so on. Using Microsoft Word’s “Track
                        Changes” function, these students were asked to focus their editorial
                        attention on matters related to the engineering student’s rhetoric and logic
                        as well as their articulation of ideas in sentence form (e.g., language,
                        diction, structure, etc.). The engineering students were not often familiar
                        with poetic terminology. In effect, students in the Romanticism course
                        helped their peers to qualify and expand upon definitions and explanations
                        of such things as depictions of Shelley’s biography, lyric poetry, and the
                        Aeolian harp. Each editing process was unique and depended on what each
                        engineering student found in his or her results, and so these student
                        collaborators could not fully predict what would become the focus of an
                        individual argument or set of evidence. In this way, students studying
                        English literature provided something like a real-world example of
                        collaborative, technical editing. Additionally, students in the Romanticism
                        course faced unfamiliar language, ideas, and results from a discipline far
                        removed from their own and to which they were assigned to add their own
                        knowledge about and expertise in Romantic-era poetry in order to help their
                        peers explain experimental results and articulate arguments in the form of
                        term papers. </p>
                  <p>Upon return of the peer-edited papers, the engineering students analyzed
                        their revised texts (using the template shown at the following <ref target="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/burkett-catravas-DOCUMENT5.pdf">link</ref>) and checked editorial changes for technical accuracy,
                        accepting or rejecting edits and suggestions as needed. However, it was
                        found in a number of cases that suggested changes, although often
                        beautifully written, had to be set aside because they introduced technical
                        inaccuracies—from the engineering perspective—into the final report. As a
                        final class-time exercise, the engineering students participated in a
                        contest focused on the production of pithy writing. The winning entry
                        consisted of the sentence reduced by the largest percentage in word count
                        without changing its informational content or meaning. We read aloud to the
                        class both the initial and the revised versions of the five entries that had
                        claimed the largest percentage reductions in word count, and our students
                        voted on whether each improved sentence retained all of the original
                        information, disqualifying those that did not. </p>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>We have aimed with this collaborative project to achieve a high level of
                        clearly <emph>interdisciplinary </emph>synthesis that bridges the
                        departments of English and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Union
                        College. In doing so, we follow Alan Bewell’s recent call for collaborations
                        that go beyond single author or disciplinary boundaries. “Nowadays, one
                        would be hard-pressed to find a term that is more frequently espoused and
                        valued in the humanities than ‘interdisciplinarity.’ These days, it seems
                        that everybody does interdisciplinary work,” writes Bewell, <quote>A strange
                            aspect of the manner in which English professors think about
                            interdisciplinarity . . . is that it does not usually involve
                            collaboration with people outside of our discipline. Whereas elsewhere
                            in the university, interdisciplinarity usually involves bringing people
                            from different disciplines together in order to address a common issue
                            that extends beyond disciplinary boundaries, English interdisciplinary
                            research is usually done by loners. Most academics in the humanities
                            engage with other disciplines through books. They rarely write
                            collaboratively, preferring instead to write single-authored articles
                            and monographs. (393-94) </quote> Our collaboration has been envisioned
                        from the start as uniting students and faculty from departments that are
                        very rarely thought of together for either contemporary research or
                        pedagogical projects. We did so in the space of the experimental laboratory
                        environment instead of a conventional literature classroom in order to
                        promote intimate intellectual interactions and experiments among students
                        studying vastly different topics, concepts, techniques, and procedures.<note place="foot">We furthermore follow Alan Bewell’s following
                            clarification: “In saying that English interdisciplinarity is different
                            from other forms of this activity at the university, I am not making a
                            complaint, but instead stressing the limitations of what English
                            interdisciplinarity usually entails” (394). That is, our lab-based,
                            collective group investigation is not meant to be understood as
                            undermining the relevance or importance of interdiscursive work but,
                            rather, is enacted as a way of expanding research and teaching-based
                            activities beyond traditional horizons. </note> This study thus allows
                        us to promote interdisciplinary skills and approaches as opposed to what
                        Linda Hutcheon and Michael Hutcheon have referred to as “interdiscursive”
                        work, a “term to describe people who remain, inevitably, disciplinarily
                        trained but borrow from other disciplines” (1371). Further clarifying this
                        concept, Alan Richardson has recently observed that “interdiscursive”
                        research often involves “reading across disciplinary boundaries and
                        selectively incorporating elements of another discipline’s vocabulary,
                        without placing one’s home disciplinary perspective into sustained, mutually
                        vulnerable, and potentially transformative dialogue with the rival
                        perspectives of colleagues trained in significantly different areas, with
                        different methods and aims” (x). By prompting our students to understand
                        that their research is not only cooperative but also that no single disciple
                        may actually lay an exclusive claim to the types of questions, issues, and
                        ideas under investigation during these group activities, we have sought to
                        encourage a type of critical thinking that moves beyond the tired binaries
                        of, for example, “humanities” <emph>versus </emph>“sciences” in favor of
                        seeking rigor while pursuing interdisciplinarity. </p>
                  <p>This cross-disciplinary investigation showed all involved in the
                        collaboration the ways that contemporary technologies can assist in seeing
                        anew what were already Romantic forms and formulations of technology.
                        Ultimately, modern technology enabled historical recovery. Listening to the
                        Aeolian harp excited our imaginations to ask new questions about Shelley’s
                        poetry in particular and, more generally, about a previous historical epoch
                        often perceived as far removed from our own. The act of listening to the
                        sounds of this Romantic device served as a gateway into investigation of the
                        dramatic variety of sounds found in Shelley’s poetry in its historical
                            context.<note place="foot">In a related example, binaural recording has
                            rich potential for both the study and performance of Romantic lyric
                            falling under the category of closet drama. Dramatic works like <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound </title>(1820), for instance,
                            intentionally make use of the inner ear of the human imagination, given
                            that Shelley’s lyrical drama was most likely intended for private
                            recitation. As Suzanne L. Barnett has recently noted in her review of
                            the 2013 “performance” of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound </title>as
                            a staged reading at New York City’s Lucille Lortel Theatre, this
                            generally “unstageable” work poses significant challenges when executed
                            via stage performances (Barnett). Binaural technology may be uniquely
                            suited for realizing and archiving such dramatic interpretations of
                            ostensibly “unstageable” poetic dramas, given that audiences can
                            actively experience the work largely devoid of physical forms. This
                            technology provides opportunities to integrate the insights of scholarly
                            work with creative impulses to produce dynamic performances touching
                            both general audiences and research communities.</note> Furthermore, the
                        recordings of “Mont Blanc” made in Phasor Lab allowed students to practice a
                        host of recitational techniques important for understanding further English
                        Romantic verse, and the three-dimensional nature of the binaural recordings
                        (as opposed to, say, recordings made via smartphones) prompted students to
                        recite Shelley’s poetry to the binaural head as if they were communicating
                        with a placeholder for a future audience to listen to these lines of verse.
                        In this way, the harp directed us to a set of Romantic poetic concerns (both
                        formal and conceptual) that assisted our students in their literary as well
                        as media archaeological reconstructions of an open range of potential ways
                        in which, on the one hand, “Mont Blanc” might have been intended by Shelley
                        to be sounded out while also exploring, on the other hand, how contemporary
                        recitations of the poem might be inherently delimited by Shelley’s original
                        poetic devices. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> This collaborative essay explores some of the opportunities and
                    challenges faced by instructors and students when digital projects are
                    integrated into the Romantic classroom. It is based on our experience with two
                    iterations of a course on literary manuscripts of the period, and is written by
                    the instructor of course and two students, who returned for the second iteration
                    of the course, a year later, as ‘digital coaches.’ We discuss the excitement and
                    creativity afforded by working in a digital medium, as well as its utility when
                    working with digitized objects like literary manuscripts. We also address the
                    pitfalls, as some students struggle with the demands of mastering new
                    technologies and with writing for digital dissemination. We found that student
                    success was improved by explicit guidance, throughout the course, in how to
                    construct a digital project. We share a set of how-to resources we have
                    developed for other instructors wishing to integrate digital pedagogy into their
                    classes, including video tutorials, assignments, grading rubrics, and links to
                    student digital projects. We also address questions of platform selection,
                    sustainability, assignment design and student evaluation. </p>

                  <p>This essay comes out of our collective experience as an instructor (Michelle
                        Levy) and two students (Ashley Morford and Lindsey Seatter) in a blended
                        class (consisting of undergraduate students and graduate students) taught at
                        Simon Fraser University in the summer of 2014, a course that was redesigned,
                        and retaught, in the summer of 2015. This course, “Reading the Literary
                        Manuscripts of the Romantics,” required students to complete a final digital
                        project. In what follows, we explore the reasons for assigning a digital
                        project as well as the opportunities and challenges that we encountered.
                        Throughout the essay and in our conclusion, we provide a series of
                        pedagogical guidelines based on our experience that we believe can improve
                        student learning. We have also developed a companion website, <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/">

                     <hi rend="bold">ML: </hi>“Reading the Literary Manuscripts of the Romantics”
                        is an upper-division course focused primarily on five authors (Jane Austen,
                        Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary Shelley, and Dorothy Wordsworth, with some
                        attention to Percy Shelley and William Wordsworth as well). The course
                        readings are designed to engage students with questions of textuality and
                        textual migration, to study how literary works transitioned from one media
                        (usually script) to another (usually print). We also read texts (such as
                        Dorothy Wordsworth’s<title level="m"> Grasmere Journals</title> and Jane
                        Austen’s juvenilia) that were not published during the authors’ lifetimes to
                        ask why they were withheld from print, or better yet (and to quote Margaret
                        Ezell), what are authors “attempting to do” by disseminating their works in
                        handwritten form (23).</p>
                  <p>My own research in media history, and in particular the varieties of media by
                        which literary texts were disseminated in the period, informs the nature of
                        the investigations we undertake in the course. Students are asked to
                        interrogate the texts they read in their anthologies and critical editions,
                        to reconstruct the complex textual history that is usually omitted in
                        student editions, and thus to consider how the material forms in which these
                        texts circulated affect meaning. In other words, I want students to think
                        about the interactions between linguistic and bibliographical codes (McGann
                        56-57). </p>
                  <p>Although we typically associate the Romantic period with the technology of
                        print, manuscript production was ongoing, and not only in the sense that
                        almost every print work necessarily began as a handwritten document.
                        Manuscript production and circulation continued as it had for generations,
                        as an alternative to print—for material that was intended for a social
                        readership, or otherwise too risky for print. Scholars like Peter
                        Stallybrass have in fact argued that print created more opportunities for
                        manuscript production—a dramatic rewriting of the narrative of media
                        succession, whereby a new technology (like print) is seen as replacing an
                        older technology (like manuscript). Very recently, we have seen that digital
                        media, contrary to expectations and predictions, has not replaced the
                        printed book. Rather, print and manuscript, like print and digital media,
                        are interdependent, though in the Romantic period the abundance of print has
                        meant that we often lose sight of how authors persisted in their use of the
                        older technology of script. </p>
                  <p>Digital media offers great promise because it makes the study of manuscripts
                        far more accessible to researchers (including students) than they ever have
                        been. Furthermore, digital resources and digital assignments allow students
                        to represent manuscript far better than is possible in the print essay, as
                        linking and screen shots enable students to draw the original manuscripts
                        into their own projects in new and exciting ways.</p>
                  <p>The Romantic period offers rich opportunities for the exploration of these
                        questions of textuality and mediation. It is no accident that many of the
                        leading textual theorists of the last fifty years—Jerome McGann, Donald
                        Reiman, Jack Stillinger, and Kathryn Sutherland, to name only a few—have
                        developed their theoretical interventions through the study of the physical
                        manuscripts and printed books of Romantic authors. Their editions, as well
                        as their theoretical work in the field of textual scholarship, are a result
                        of the extensive manuscript (and print) record that survives. Romantic
                        authors were one of if not the first generation of writers for which
                        manuscript witnesses survive in profusion, allowing for the reconstruction
                        of textual history in ways that are impossible for previous generations of
                        authors. Further, many of our period’s authors were inveterate tinkerers,
                        both in manuscript and print: Wordsworth, for example, constantly revised
                        his texts over his fifty-plus-year career; Mary Shelley substantially
                        re-revised <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> thirteen years after its
                        first appearance; and, according to Jack Stillinger, some eighteen versions
                        survive of Coleridge’s “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” (v).</p>
                  <p>In addition, authors of the Romantic period were acutely aware of their
                        audiences, and how medium affected the reception of literary works. Robert
                        Southey’s comments on the piracies of <title level="m">Don Juan
                        </title>expresses this understanding perfectly: “‘“Don Juan” in quarto and
                        on hot-pressed paper would have been almost innocent--in a whitish-brown
                        duodecimo, it was one of the worst of the mischievous publications that have
                        made the press a snare” (Senior 128). I want students to grapple with the
                        understanding that Southey expresses—that a text published in one format
                        (expensive quarto) could be perceived to be “almost innocent,” whereas the
                        appearance of the identical text in another format (cheap duodecimo) was
                        deemed “mischievous,” even dangerous. Countless other examples could be
                        found: the effect of reading a poem in the author’s autograph offers a
                        different experience from than reading the identical poem in a newspaper, a
                        print collection, or an author’s collected works. I also want students to
                        engage with the reasons why authors might elect to circulate their literary
                        texts in handwritten form, and to explore patterns of textual movement. A
                        poem might, for example, be first exchanged in manuscript within a coterie,
                        and then subsequently printed. Alternatively, it might be printed and
                        circulated in manuscript simultaneously, or the reverse might be true, as
                        when poems were copied from print. Authors also often shuttled their texts
                        between different print forms – consider Charles Lamb’s “Elia” essays. They
                        first appeared in the <title level="m">London Magazine</title>, and then
                        were collected for separate publication in book form. The two versions are
                        not only textually different, but they also carry different bibliographical
                        signification as well. Ultimately, the course aims to involve students as
                        much as possible in reconstructing the linguistic and bibliographical codes
                        that imbue texts with meaning.</p>

                  <head>Benefits of a Final Digital Project:</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">ML</hi>: In previous undergraduate courses, I had offered
                        students the option to submit a final project in digital form rather than as
                        a standard print essay, and I had always been pleased with the results. As
                        the digital project was not required, it was taken up by interested students
                        but passed over by most. This result is not surprising, since I offered
                        little formal instruction, with students mostly forced to fend for
                        themselves in the construction of a digital project.</p>
                  <p> With the summer 2014 iteration of “Reading the Literary Manuscripts of the
                        Romantics,” taught in the summer of 2014, I decided to make the final
                        digital project required. There were several reasons why I thought the time
                        was ripe for such an approach. In the first place, although the course is
                        focused on literary manuscripts of the Romantic period, my students would
                        not be in a position to view, in person, a single physical manuscript
                        discussed in the course. Indeed, a course like this is only possible because
                        of the release of digital facsimiles and editions of manuscript material,

                            Austen’s (Digitized) Manuscripts.”</note> These sites all provide access
                        to photofacsimiles of manuscripts of major authors, some with
                        transcriptions. Thus, by necessity, students would be using digital
                        materials and, as a consequence, students would have to be taught to become
                        conscious and critical of the effects of digital remediation. Asking
                        students to construct their projects within a digital medium seemed a
                        natural outgrowth of this engagement with media history and digital
                        material. As we explored the ways that texts historically migrated across
                        media platforms, students were primed to explore how their own writing could
                        be disseminated and might be transformed by the use of digital platforms.
                        Finally, because their primary source material was in digital form, and
                        because manuscripts are expressively visual, a digital platform would enable
                        students to incorporate these resources in a digital project far more easily
                        than in a traditional print essay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">AM and LS</hi>: As graduate students, we found that one of
                        the most substantive benefits of creating a multimodal digital project was
                        that it could serve as the foundation for an evolving research portfolio.
                        Instead of drafting a standalone final essay, which is generally the
                        culminating assessment for courses taught in the humanities, a digital
                        project provides a space for creating and collecting scholarly research over
                        an extended period of time. This means that the assignment has a life beyond
                        the initial classroom evaluation and can become a platform for showcasing
                        our work in alternative academic and non-academic settings (Hess 34).
                        Conceptualizing digital projects as evolving portfolios can also serve as a
                        springboard to graduate studies or to work opportunities both within and
                        beyond the academy. </p>
                  <p>Another benefit beyond the classroom is that students can make digital
                        projects more widely accessible. For instance, if a student makes their
                        digital project public (as with a website), their work is openly accessible
                        to larger populations and subject positions. The visitor statistics for
                        Ashley’s <ref target="https://frankensteinandtheother.wordpress.com/">Frankenstein: Troubling Understandings of the Other</ref> project offer
                        a small example: in the first year that the project whas been up and
                        running, it has received a wide range of visitors from Australia, Canada,
                        France, Germany, Ireland, Qatar, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and
                        the United States. Many of these visitors have discovered the website
                        through search engines. Some visitors have been professors, others have been
                        students working on <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>-related class
                        projects, and the subject positions of many other visitors remains unknown.
                        Even if a student does not make their project public, they can control
                        access by inviting others to view it. Thus parents, friends, fellow
                        students, admission committees, and potential employers can observe and
                        engage in student research and writing that is usually confined to the
                        classroom, thereby making visible (if only to a confined circle) the
                        benefits and skills associated with our discipline.</p>
                  <p>By design, the format of a digital assignment—its fluid, easily mutable
                        existence—invites students to continue editing, revising, and enhancing the
                        material presented online, even after the course is complete. This
                        invitation—coupled with the strong sense of ownership students feel over
                        work that has evolved directly from their own research interests—can
                        motivate the continual development of the project. This has been our
                        collective experience. For example, Ashley has continued to re-imagine,
                        edit, and alter her site during her doctoral studies. For example, Ashley is
                        now developing her site into a doctoral project. Lindsey’s project, <ref target="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdigitizingliterature.wordpress.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDvc4I7fB2NDEYzGbdcbFv8w-6vA">Digitizing Literature</ref>, has evolved from a classroom assignment
                        into a culminating Master’s project and, more recently, into a professional
                        portfolio that showcases a history of academic work. Looking back on the
                        development of these projects demonstrates an evolution of student-led
                            research.<note place="end">To see other student-created digital
                            projects, visit the <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/model-projects/">model projects</ref> page on our website.</note> When students
                        direct their own research, they gain a sense of ownership over their work
                        and leadership over their academic program. Our digital projects have been
                        key components of our admission to doctoral programs and our hiring into
                        research positions. We have found that showcasing a digital project as part
                        of a curriculum vitae evidences that a student possesses skills as both a
                        traditionally-trained and digitally-literate scholar.</p>
                  <p>Because digital projects have the potential for a life beyond the scope of a
                        semester, they can serve as a bridge towards professionalization. Working in
                        the Romantic period, we are lucky to inherit a prestigious lineage of
                        innovative digital scholarship. Aggregatione project sites such as Jerome
                        McGann’s <ref target="http://www.nines.org/">NINES</ref> and Laura Mandell’s
                            <ref target="http://www.18thconnect.org/">18thConnect</ref> represent
                        the vast and varied multimodal projects taking place in Romantic literary
                        studies. For students who pursue their digital projects beyond the
                        classroom—evolving their work into honor’s theses, graduate projects, or
                        professional research interests—preserving their work under an umbrella such
                        as the Advanced Research Consortium (ARC) may be held as the ultimate goal.
                        Not only do these sites provide opportunities for peer review, they also
                        enable connections between individual projects, promote standards, enforce
                        professional practices, and perpetuate an online identity of rigorous
                        scholarship. Professionalization can be neglected as an objective of
                        academic coursework but by creating assignments that develop the “skills,
                        identities, norms and values” associated with quality digital work, the
                        classroom can become an arena for digital humanities credentialing (Rockwell
                        and Sinclair 177-178). The professionalization skills gained in the creation
                        of digital projects can offer opportunities outside of the academy as well.
                        For instance, both Lindsey’s and Ashley’s digital projects have resulted in
                        opportunities to build WordPress sites outside of academia.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">ML</hi>: Students who do not continue into graduate work (who
                        and these students comprise the majority of our my students) also benefit
                        from their involvement in digital projects. If one of our strengths as a
                        discipline is teaching our students how to read and write critically, we
                        must also recognize that as the media ecology we inhabit shifts and print
                        loses its former dominance, “print, essayistic literacy” will also have to
                        adapt (Williams xii). Written communication increasingly takes place in
                        digital forms, and we can take the lead in not only teaching our students
                        how to read and engage with online materials, but in how to produce them.
                        Indeed, it seems that it should be part of our mission to teach students how
                        to write—cogently and expressively—for online media, skills that they will
                        need “if they hope to communicate successfully within the digital
                        communication networks that characterize workplaces, schools, civil life,
                        and span traditional, national, and geopolitical borders” (Takayoshi and
                        Selfe 3). </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">AM and LS</hi>: In addition to providing a life beyond the
                        classroom, we believe that digital projects provide students with the
                        opportunity to pursue their own research interests, to approach familiar
                        texts with a fresh perspective, and to experiment with new methodologies.
                        While these pursuits are attainable within a traditional print essay, there
                        is an aspect of play and experimentation with digital project creation. As
                        Bonds suggests, digital experimentation and play allow students to develop
                        more fully, to discover and produce their own knowledge rather than simply
                        mimic the knowledge of a teacher, which can happen when students write
                        traditional essays (Bonds 150). </p>
                  <p>The initial experience of creating in a digital space can be disorienting for
                        traditionally trained humanities students. However, learning to work within
                        a new digital platform like <title level="m">WordPress</title> and having to
                        approach a research project through a new medium can be exhilarating,
                        leading to revitalized engagement with the material being studied and
                        expanding the methods that students can draw on to present and communicate
                        ideas. As the <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/model-projects/">model projects</ref> demonstrate, the opportunities to play with,
                        experiment with, and incorporate the digital through hyperlinking, adding
                        multimedia, and personalizing design aspects (like header images) give these
                        assignments more scope for creativity and for engagement with primary
                        materials than is typical in traditional assessments. Additionally, the
                        digital platform offers students the opportunity to oscillate between
                        creative and critical work as they face the new challenges of site design
                        and media integration alongside the more familiar tasks of close reading and
                        scholarly commentary. This balance is often missing from traditional
                        assessments where students are limited to working within a word processing
                        document that will be printed on paper.</p>
                  <p>Yet it must be acknowledged that the print essay continues to have some
                        benefits over the digital platform. There is the familiar argument that
                        reading from a printed text allows for better retention of information than
                        reading from a digital text does, that “the physicality of a printed page
                        may matter for those reading experiences when you need a firmer grounding in
                        the material. The text you read on a Kindle or computer simply doesn’t have
                        the same tangibility” (Konnikova para. 5). Additionally, in terms of the
                        writing process, digital platforms like <title level="m">WordPress</title>
                        lack simple, clean ways to incorporate footnotes or endnotes; while MLA
                        formatting helps to alleviate this issue, as it encourages in-text
                        parenthetical citations, the ability to incorporate discursive footnotes or
                        endnotes remains a challenge. Further, while it is easy to continue to
                        develop digital projects on platforms like <title level="m">WordPress</title>, the print essay is, of course, by no means stagnant;
                        class essays can develop into conference papers, which can develop into
                        honors theses or (for those few students who continue on in academia)
                        graduate capstone papers, which can develop into journal articles, and so
                        on. Indeed, <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/first-paper-guidelines.docx">the first assignment </ref>of this course is a traditional print essay,
                        which students were encouraged to use as a springboard foundation into for
                        their digital project.</p>
                  <p>The ability to work directly with a range of online materials—digitized
                        manuscripts and rare books, video clips and images—can also help reorient
                        the usual instructor-student hierarchies by refiguring the student as the
                        creator, instead of merely the receiver, of information. In our course
                        experience, the ability to work directly with digitized versions of unique
                        primary sources moved us from the position of student to the position of
                        researcher. Interacting with these materials, which are locked in exclusive
                        manuscript vaults thousands of miles away from our classroom, would have
                        been impossible without leveraging our access to their digital surrogates.

                  <head>Pedagogical Challenges of Digital Assignments:</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">ML</hi>: When I began to teach courses with digital projects,
                        I had fairly rigid expectations of what they would look like: a digital
                        edition of literary text. Practically speaking, students were advised to
                        select a short text that had been somewhat overlooked in the scholarship (so
                        that they could master the critical background). Ironically, given what I
                        thought to be my attentiveness to possibilities of new media, I imagined
                        students creating digital editions that were based on a model of the print
                        edition; specifically, I had Broadview Press’s literary editions in mind.
                        Having edited a critical edition for Broadview, I was familiar with this
                        format and esteemed it as a pedagogical model, with its richly historicized
                        introductions, annotations, and appendices of primary material. Several
                        students followed this model, choosing to develop editions of shorter works
                        (such as short pieces from <ref target="https://digitizingliterature.wordpress.com/category/austen-the-history-of-england/">Austen’s juvenilia</ref>, <ref target="https://compilingsanditon.wordpress.com">Austen’s </ref>
                     <ref target="https://compilingsanditon.wordpress.com">later </ref>
                     <ref target="https://compilingsanditon.wordpress.com">manuscript
                        </ref>fiction, or little-studied essays by Anna <ref target="https://digitizingliterature.wordpress.com/category/barbauld-letter-from-grimalkin-to-selima/">Barbauld</ref>). </p>
                  <p> Nevertheless, I realize now that, in imagining the output to be a digital
                        edition, I was inadvertently applying a print-based model, and one that
                        imposinged unnecessary limitations on the kinds of projects students could
                        pursue. I also overestimated my ability to provide students with adequate
                        instruction on editorial theory, which proved too difficult to teach with
                        proper rigor in a course with so many other balls in the air. Fortunately,
                        most of the students navigated (or circumnavigated) this aspect of the
                        project. Some did so by selecting texts that exist in only one version, a
                        highly sensible solution that avoided many thorny editorial issues. Others,
                        who were dealing with texts that survive in multiple versions, rather than
                        fixing on (or creating) a single edition, instead sought to study those very
                        issues of migration and change between versions. Thus, many of the final
                        projects were not editions at all, but essays constructed in digital space
                        that analyzed different versions of a text. For example, Ashley’s project
                        considers Percy Shelley’s revisions to the draft manuscript of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>; others, such as Lindsey’s, examined the
                        transition of Dorothy Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Grasmere
                            Journals</title> from their manuscript sources to the early print
                        editions (edited by William Knight and Ernest De Selincourt) and into
                        excerpts used in current teaching anthologies. Many of these projects
                        succeeded in enabling students to think critically about textuality. And
                        projects can also emerge that are less textually-focused but rather seek to
                        curate and thus explore critically <ref target="https://naturalromanticism.wordpress.com/">a small selection of
                            related poems</ref>, such as Byron’s separation poems, or Percy
                        Shelley’s poems to Jane Williams.</p>
                  <p>In teaching the course for the first time in 2014, I still did not fully
                        overcome the false assumption of digitally-savvy students. Jim Mussell
                        debunks this common assumption, explaining that “the technical competence of
                        the young is routinely overstated” (203). By treating the digital assignment
                        as similar to a print essay, I failed to realize that students would need
                        more guidance at each stage of the process and would require more time to
                        prepare their final digital project than was necessary for a print essay. I
                        had invited Matt Huculuk, from the University of Victoria, to offer a
                        workshop on the use of <title level="m">WordPress</title>, but that was
                        about halfway through the semester: had it been held earlier, it may have
                        assuaged student anxiety about the technical aspects of the project. Unlike
                        a print paper, which students (at this stage in their academic career) can
                        draft very quickly (if circumstances require), a digital project requires a
                        longer timeline, with more opportunities for experimentation and failure,
                        and with more time for planning and design. </p>
                  <p>In the second iteration of the course, in 2015, more time was devoted to
                        technical skill development. I was fortunate enough to have Lindsey and
                        Ashley serve as “digital coaches” (see Branscum and Toscano 95-96) for my
                        students, and we are hoping, with the <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/">Digital Projects
                            in the Romantic Classroom</ref> website we have created, to offer this
                        kind of digital coaching to other instructors and students. One other way in
                        which we have attempted to overcome the technical learning curve has been to
                        reconceive the course as a series of cumulative assignments that build
                        towards the final digital project. The challenge has also been to convince
                        students to take a longer view of their coursework; from the instructor’s
                        perspective, I had to overcome the practice of conceptualizing assignments
                        as discrete units, a practice driven in part by a concern that the students
                        should not be able allowed to reuse work from a previous assignments. </p>
                  <p>One other pressing issue that arose in contemplating the assignment of a
                        digital project was the question of what platform to use, and with that, of
                        sustainability. Originally (and as part of my edition-based thinking), I
                        wanted to find a platform that was oriented to scholarly digital editions,
                        one that might even allow for students to use TEI-XML for their projects.
                        Although there are a few platforms in development that will allow for the
                        implementation of TEI markup—including <ref target="http://www.cwrc.ca/projects/infrastructure-projects/technical-projects/cwrc-writer/">CRWC-Writer</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_critical_edition">Islandora Critical Edition</ref>—none are currently available for
                        implementation. <title level="m">WordPress</title>—being extremely easy to
                        use, open source, and free—had much to recommend it. It had been
                        successfully used by <ref target="http://matthuculak.com/teaching/english-4620/">Matt Huculuk in
                            his undergraduate courses</ref>, and these projects were viewable by my
                        students as potential models.<note place="foot">When re-teaching the course,
                            I had the added benefit of being able to share students projects from
                            the previous iteration of the course, which allowed students to
                            visualize what could be done, and to concretize expectations.</note>
                        Additionally, I was using <title level="m">WordPress</title> for the course
                        website, so students would necessarily become familiar with how to use its
                        basic features. I also made my peace with the issue of sustainability; for
                        reasons already articulated by Ashley and Lindsey, a digital project built
                        in <title level="m">WordPress</title> is likely to be more durable and
                        extensible than the ephemeral student essay, which has little hope of
                        reaching an audience beyond the original instructor, and no expectation of
                        survival beyond that term, or, at most, the life of the computer hardware on
                        which it is written. Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, <title level="m">WordPress</title> might offer a more stable archival structure than its
                        traditional counterpart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">AM and LS</hi>: For many students in the “Reading the
                        Literary Manuscripts of the Romantics” class, <title level="m">WordPress</title> was an unknown and, therefore, unexplored platform.
                        Reflecting on the summer 2014 course, key aspects of a <hi rend="italic">WordPress</hi> project— such as <ref target="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fromanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com%2Fvideo-tutorials%2Fcreating-a-page%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDESu-vzjPss2Gt08zTVOlc5T4Ag">the ability to make static pages, parent pages, and child
                        pages</ref>—were confusing for some of us to learn, and extra time, care,
                        and external research/reading of online documentation or user message boards
                        was needed to ensure that we understood these components. The intense
                        anticipation of the technical learning curve that precedes the development
                        of a successful digital project is often enough to discourage
                        experimentation within this new medium. In addition to the learning curve, a
                        digital platform, like a website, will often not reflect the same linear
                        structure of a traditional essay through its mandatory introduction, body,
                        and conclusion. As humanities students, many of us have years of experience
                        composing argumentative papers for print and the vast majority of, at least,
                        upper division students find great success and enjoyment in working within
                        this genre of assessment. While the standard academic essay has proven over
                        time to be a useful argumentative tool and an appropriate vessel for student
                        evaluation, multimodal projects have yet to achieve this same clout.
                        Therefore, students may approach the challenges of a digital project with
                        apprehension regarding its usefulness or relevance to their humanities
                        education. </p>
                  <p>We believe that these fears may be overcome by providing students with
                        hands-on instruction to ensure that they possess the ability skills to
                        purposefully navigate through, and successfully create with, these
                        platforms. This necessitates that class time and instructor attention must
                        be devoted to teaching the technical side of working within digital media.
                        We hope that the <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/video-tutorials/">video tutorials</ref> we have developed to provide step-by-step guides
                        to key aspects of <title level="m">WordPress</title> can be used by others
                        to enable students in the digital humanities classroom to utilize <title level="m">WordPress</title> with confidence. One other strategy is to
                        provide students with <ref target="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fromanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com%2Fmodel-projects%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG84lyaRDaMidP3luRagbcvmkfa4A">models of digital projects</ref> prepared by students in past courses.
                        Being able to explore different projects allows students to see what is
                        possible, and concretizes the different set of expectations between a print
                        essay and a digital project.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, given the initial challenges that working in a digital
                        environment presents for many students, it is important that proponents of
                        this type of assessment clearly illustrate what can be done “with digital
                        media that we [can] not do otherwise” (Kuhn, Johnson, and Lopez 1). In their
                        article and interview series “Speaking with Students,” Kuhn, Johnson, and
                        Lopez identify some of the value-added learning experiences of born-digital
                        work, including acquiring the skills of “advanced digital literacy”;
                        “deploying the registers of text, image and interactivity”; and creating a
                        space to actively engage an academic audience in “unprecedented ways” (1).
                        By showcasing the unique value of digital scholarship, a niche can be
                        created for this type of work as an acceptable humanities assessment. We
                        have tried to exhibit these valuable learning opportunities by creating <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/video-tutorials/">video tutorials</ref> that help teach students how to work with both
                        text and media, and by creating a space that showcases <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/model-projects/">past projects</ref>, visualizing the possibilities of a digital project
                        and encouraging future students to engage in these scholarly conversations. </p>
                  <p>Another challenge is learning to integrate media and hyperlinks in a
                        purposeful and meaningful way. During the course of creating our digital
                        projects for the 2014 semestercourse, we were encouraged to provide embedded
                        images and hyperlinks in order to embrace the multimodal advantages of a
                        digital space. So too does one of the <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/video-tutorials/integrating-media-hyperlinks/">video tutorials</ref> created for the 2015 course strive to equip
                        students with the tools to hyperlink and embed images, video, and audio so
                        that the student projects can successfully interact with other digital
                        platforms. Yet while it may be easy to think that connecting different
                        sources of information to one another (as a website may hyperlink to another
                        related website) is an interactive act, Lev Manovich emphasizes that
                        interactivity is deeper: true interactivity is a psychological or mental
                        process (71). In “The Myth of Interactivity” (from <ref target="http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Manovich-LangNewMedia-excerpt.pdf">The Language of New Media</ref>), he argues that “the concept of
                        interactivity” as used with regard to digital media “is a tautology” (71).
                        As he says, “Once an object is represented in a computer, it automatically
                        becomes interactive” (71). Thus, while instructors may encourage students to
                        hyperlink and embed, it is important for us to be guided to do so with
                        careful consideration and intent. Instructors should ensure that students
                        are made aware that hyperlinks and embedded images may connect their site to
                        other sites, but that this act does not guarantee that their digital project
                        will be intellectually stimulating. If the hyperlink or embedded image is
                        not a key source or component of the project’s main idea or argument, or if
                        it does not help to guide, develop, or build the project’s idea or argument,
                        then the hyperlink or embedded image is probably unnecessary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">AM and LS</hi>: Because <title level="m">WordPress </title>is
                        designed as a personal blogging platform, many of its features and its
                        fundamental structure are not conducive to building a digital literary
                        project. Unfortunately, at this time, there are no open source digital
                        edition builders available, so students must learn to work within the
                        limitations of this program or one like it. One potential problem for
                        students is that the free version of <title level="m">WordPress</title> does
                        not provide any plugins for annotations. If students are inclined to build a
                        text-based edition, being unable to efficiently markup the text is a serious
                        limitation. <title level="m">Digitizing Literature</title> ran into this
                        problem and navigated around it by embedding site-internal hyperlinks, but
                        this solution is less than ideal. </p>
                  <p>Additionally, <title level="m">WordPress</title> lacks the coded search
                        capability of a custom TEI-XML site. This means that while the <title level="m">WordPress</title> search engine can identify the words
                        displayed on each webpage, it is unable to access information that could be
                        embedded in humanistic markup. For example, if TEI-XML were used to encode
                        place names or person names in a document then a site user, who was
                        interested in this type of information, would be able to call up all the
                        encoded instances instead of having to search individually for each proper
                        name. This type of categorical searching opens up an entirely new way of
                        accessing or using the text at hand. Furthermore, as TEI-XML is a discipline
                        standard in the humanities, this incompatibility is a significant loss,
                        though <title level="m">WordPress</title>’s ease of use makes it an
                        acceptable trade-off, at least when working with undergraduate students. </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">ML, AM, LS</hi>: Evaluation of students’ digital projects
                        presents challenges, both from the instructor’s and the students’ point of
                        view. The expectation of most students at this later stage in their academic
                        career is that a research essay will be graded based on: the competence of
                        their research; the soundness and originality of their argumentation; the
                        persuasiveness of their close reading; and the clarity and elegance of their
                        writing. With a digital project, all of these components persist as
                        requirements, but with the additional burden of students being asked to
                        translateing their research into (what will likely be) a new digital medium.
                        In essence, students are being asked to use a new language to present their
                        research and writing, and this can cause anxiety on the part of students and
                        the instructor, who rightly may be concerned that they are demanding too
                        much. Many students have worked for years to craft arguments for and present
                        textual evidence on the printed page; therefore, transitioning the
                        print-based essay into digital form requires thought and planning. Further,
                        students may find basic tasks, such as editing and proofreading, more
                        difficult within a digital environment. For all of these reasons, assessment
                        provides a new set of challenges problems to the instructor, who wishes to
                        encourage experimentation and creativity while at the same time maintaining
                        high standards for argumentation, analysis, and composition. One way to
                        address this problem is by providing students with explicit grading rubrics,
                        and staging feedback throughout the course through peer review and both
                        formative and summative assessment (the former providing feedback to
                        students while they are still working on their projects, and the later
                        provided after they have completed and submitted the project). Example
                        materials for these various forms of feedback are available on our <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/course-materials/">companion site</ref>.</p>
                  <p>Although many issues were resolved by the second iteration of the course,
                        some remain. In particular, argumentation that spans many web pages can be
                        difficult to sustain. Students have been encouraged to include introductions
                        and conclusions that state and restate their overarching claims, but a
                        digital project seems tomay require a different style of argumentation.
                        Further, students use images and moving pictures far more than in
                        print-based essays, and literature students must therefore develop
                        analytical skills appropriate to those visual media. Of course, the
                        inclusion of images and video often raise issues of copyright and proper
                        citation. One strategy used in the second iteration of the course was to
                        require students to include a works cited for images, but thorny issues,
                        such as whether students can take screenshots and otherwise use images from

                     <hi rend="bold">ML, AM, LS</hi>: In the list of best practices that follows,
                        we offer a series of suggestions that address many of the pedagogical
                        challenges we have identified. Our main recommendations are (1) that the
                        students be given explicit guidance, throughout the course, in how to
                        construct a digital project, through the use of hands-on workshops and video
                        tutorials, the provision of written documentation, and the presentation of
                        previous student projects as models; (2) that the course assignments be
                        understood cumulatively, such that students are encouraged to re-use
                        material from previous assignments in the final project; and (3) that the
                        timeline for producing the digital project be staged over the course of
                        several weeks.</p>
                  <p>The following table discusses a series of pedagogical interventions over the
                        course of the term, to help guide students through the development of the
                        project. Links are provided to our web-based tutorial guides and course

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>We would like to concluding by reporting on results of student evaluations of
                        the course. The students in both the 2014 and 2015 iterations of the course
                        were asked to complete an anonymous online survey following the conclusion
                        of the course this summerin the fall of 2015. The purpose of the survey was
                        to determine how the students found the course material and structure,
                        specifically the integration of technology through assignments and
                        evaluations. </p>
                  <p>Fourteen students completed the survey: five from the inaugural class of 2014
                        and nine from the second iteration in 2015. While three of the students
                        originally hesitated in registering for the course because of the digital
                        element, all of the students enjoyed learning to use the digital tools and
                        agreed that they were helpful for studying English (Q.13, Q.9, Q.10).</p>
                  <p>Overall, the students felt that their technological skills improved over the
                        duration of the course; the students also felt more confident in their use
                        of <title level="m">WordPress</title> at the course’s culmination (Q.15,
                        Q.16). On average, the students in the 2014 class felt less confident in the
                        explanation of digital tools than the 2015 class: of the five students in
                        the 2014 class, three answered this statement with “agreed”, one with
                        “somewhat agreed”, and one with “somewhat disagreed.” By comparison, the
                        2015 students answered either “strongly agreed” or “agreed” (Q.17).</p>
                  <p>As these survey results suggest, the exploration and suggestions made in this
                        paper are not only based on pedagogy theory and our reflections, but also on
                        participant evaluations. The changes made to the course had a positive
                        impact on the students’ confidence in both using digital tools and in their
                        mastery of <title level="m">WordPress</title> as a content management
                        system. The resounding agreement that the digital tools provided meaningful
                        strategies for understanding were a useful window into English literature
                        both supports our objective for this course and bolsters our argument for
                        the importance of integrating humanistic research with technological
                        innovation.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay will describe a multi-modal, collaborative,
                    project-based approach to teaching Jane Austen’s novels through a focus on
                    remixing and material history. Assignments that engage students in collectively
                    remixing Austen’s novels meld individual students into a community,
                    strengthening the classroom’s “little social commonwealth” by connecting
                    classroom and digital learning spaces in a single learning ecosystem (Persuasion
                    31). Key elements of such project-based community-building include an ongoing,
                    weekly participant-creation assignment posted to Tumblr, a short exploration of
                    textual materiality connected to a close reading assignment focusing on
                    historical word shifts, a physical making assignment, and a student-led
                    collaborative project that brings all class members together into a
                    participatory final experience. Transgressing distinctions between popular and
                    scholarly reading communities by sharing their classwork openly online in turn
                    empowers undergraduate students to realize that their own scholarship
                    participates in, benefits from, and may eventually even reshape the networks
                    that characterize our current digital social commonwealths.</p>

                  <p>A joyous energy often pervades the first day of class in my upper division
                        seminar on Jane Austen.<note place="foot"> I am grateful to the following
                            students for their creativity and willingness to share digital
                            commonplace books they created during “Jane Austen in Context,” Fall
                            2013, Whittier College (full citations above):Barkats, Nikolai.
                            Clifford, Erica. Koffi, Sara. Sanchéz, Elizabeth. Shephard,
                            Terrileigh.</note> Upon entering the room, I will overhear discussions
                        about how many, and which, Austen novels students have already read. Another
                        group, frequently the most spirited, will be debating the relative merits of
                        various film adaptations of the novels. Such rapport among students derives
                        from their shared enthusiasm for the topic, which in turn creates an instant
                        sense of community among many class members. Even those who are not fans
                        often find themselves invigorated by the happy anticipation of their peers.
                        Because of this, my central pedagogical question when teaching an Austen
                        seminar becomes how to enrich and support this peer-to-peer energy and make
                        legible to students the ways that Austen’s popularity reflects continuities,
                        as well as differences, between the sociality of the English country gentry
                        and our own increasingly networked online communities and identities.</p>
                  <p>By reading Austen as a member of a seminar that is also a peer-to-peer
                        learning community, students get to experience a twenty-first-century
                        version of the social bonds that structure relationships among Austen’s
                        characters. This style of teaching, in which digital and embodied
                        experiential learning methods cross-fertilize each other as part of a
                        single, integrated approach, is my version of what Jesse Stommel and others
                        term “critical digital pedagogy:”</p>

                  <p>This essay will describe a multi-modal, collaborative, project-based approach
                        to teaching Jane Austen’s novels through a focus on remixing and material
                        history. Assignments that engage students in collectively remixing Austen’s
                        novels meld individual students into a community, strengthening the
                        classroom’s “little social commonwealth” by connecting classroom and digital
                        learning spaces in a single learning ecosystem (<title level="m">Persuasion
                        </title>31). Key elements of such project-based community-building include
                        an ongoing, weekly participant-creation assignment posted to Tumblr, a short
                        exploration of textual materiality connected to a close reading assignment
                        focusing on historical word shifts, a physical making assignment, and a
                        student-led collaborative project that brings all class members together
                        into a participatory final experience. The choice of the social networking
                        site Tumblr as a central course platform has special resonance in an Austen
                        classroom, as a lively Austen fan community already exists on Tumblr.
                        Through networking, reposting, and remixing, students’ classwork thus
                        organically becomes part of wider conversations about Romantic-era culture
                        among some of the many virtual communities of Austen’s readers today.
                        Transgressing distinctions between popular and scholarly reading communities
                        by sharing their classwork openly online in turn empowers undergraduate
                        students to realize that their own scholarship participates in, benefits
                        from, and may eventually even reshape the networks that characterize our
                        current digital social commonwealths.</p>

                  <p>The backbone of my remixing approach to teaching Austen is a digital
                        commonplace book assignment that scaffolds student interaction throughout
                        the course. A quick search will turn up a number of useful models for
                        commonplacing assignments in the literature classroom. In <ref target="http://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2014/10/ThecommonplacebookSP14.pdf">a recent article</ref> in the <title level="m">Journal of Interactive
                            Technology and Pedagogy</title>, for example, Vimala Pasupath details an
                        assignment using Pinterest to make visible the labor and insights of close
                        reading. Another <ref target="http://andrewgoldstone.com/teaching/lf2/common.html">assignment</ref> by Andrew Goldstone sets up a single shared,
                        password-protected Tumblr blog for the whole class. My assignment asks
                        students not only to build their own Tumblr blogs, but also to follow and
                        interact with class members’ blogs, extending educational discourse beyond
                        the campus. <ref target="http://olc.onlinelearningconsortium.org/conference/2015/et4online/perforating-classroom-how-hacking-online-game-tvsz-60-brings-together-facu">Elsewhere</ref>, I’ve talked about this teaching approach as
                        “perforating the classroom,” a term to describe the value of teaching openly
                        on the web rather than in the “walled” spaces of learning management systems
                        (LMS) like Moodle or Blackboard. Such LMSs have their uses—to keep grades
                        confidential, for example—but the fact that they are deliberately isolated
                        from the web reduces their utility both as tools for student lifelong
                        learning and as analogies to Romantic-era literary culture. My pedagogical
                        approach highlights connection—between students, between ideas, between
                        historical periods, between Austen and her readers, between elite and
                        popular cultures, between technologies of reading. As Juliette Wells argues
                        in a recent <ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/praxis/austen/pedagogies.commons.2015.wells.html">article</ref>, I want to encourage my students to connect with Austen
                        fandom and popular culture as well as the many resources available online
                        for scholarly study. </p>
                  <p>On that note, I cannot fail to point out the wonderful resources and teaching
                        ideas in the recent <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogy
                            Commons</title> special issue “<ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/commons/austen">Teaching Jane
                            Austen</ref>,” edited by Devoney Looser and Emily Friedman. One of the
                        signal contributions of this openly available journal issue is the “<ref target="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/commons/austen/pedagogies.commons.2015.looserzarka.html">Annotated Bibliography on the Scholarship of Teaching Jane
                        Austen</ref>,” compiled by Emily Zarka and Devoney Looser. Annotated
                        bibliographies like theirs are scholarly versions of the kind of curation
                        that my students undertook in their commonplace books, and offer a useful
                        touchstone for understanding the value of curation as a social-intellectual
                        practice that can yield networked scholarly communities in this era of
                        digital connectivity. This essay benefits from the resources, articles, and
                        ideas compiled by Looser and Friedman, and adds to them a critical digital
                        pedagogy approach to scaffolding a Jane Austen seminar which integrates both
                        digital and embodied learning.</p>
                  <p>To foster such communal scholarship, I ask students to create digital
                        commonplace books in which they engage with other readers of Romantic-era
                        literature via remixing not only their own collection of quotations but also
                        the bits of Austen culture online that attract their interest. Tumblr, a
                        free and open blogging platform, has the advantages of being familiar to
                        most students, very simple to use, and popular with a huge community of
                        users who regularly reblog media objects in a twenty-first century version
                        of commonplacing. Tumblr also has an active Austen fan population who share
                        memes, movie references, news about new games, products, travel
                        opportunities, and so much more. Encouraging students to interact with
                        Austen fandom and popular culture for a class assignment brings enormous
                        energy into classroom discussions and challenges the unspoken barrier
                        between reading for pleasure and reading for class that so often frames
                        academic discussions of even the most beloved literary works. </p>
                  <p>My commonplacing assignment was initially inspired by a blog post on a
                        wonderful academic blog titled <ref target="https://thisgaudygildedstage.wordpress.com/2007/09/24/teaching-with-commonplace-books/">
                        <title level="m">This Gaudy Gilded Stage</title>
                     </ref>, and adapts
                        categories and language from Patricia Taylor’s <ref target="https://www.academia.edu/9458734/Assignment_Guide_for_Finding_Paradise_Lost_">Electronic Commonplace Book</ref> assignment as posted on the
                        University of Connecticut freshman English blog in 2014. The key
                        requirements are that each student add three elements to their Tumblr blog
                        each week, that they tag their posts according to an organizational method
                        that represents their particular interests, that they follow each other’s
                        blogs, that they design their blogs according to their own taste, and that
                        across the semester they include a variety of different types of posts. Here
                        is an excerpt from the assignment, which enumerates various types of posts. </p>
                  <p>Tumblr commonplace books must include at least one example of the following:

                  <p>Students begin their commonplace books the first week of class after a brief
                        introduction to the Enlightenment intellectual practice of commonplacing, a
                        tutorial on setting up their Tumblr accounts, and, most importantly, a
                        discussion about how they will choose to craft their online identities for
                        the course. Fortuitously, our class was reading Austen’s early epistolary
                        novella <title level="m">Lady Susan </title>while we were also getting the
                        Tumblr blogs launched, and so questions of rhetorical stance, audience
                        awareness, and reputation construction cross-pollinated our discussion of
                        both the novella and student choices about their own online identities for
                        the course. Students always enjoy reading the letters through which
                            <foreign>femme fatale</foreign> Lady Susan manipulates her daughter, her
                        lover, her intended fiancé and others through a carefully plotted rhetorical
                        campaign. As a character, Lady Susan is unlike other Austen protagonists in
                        both class status and conduct, and may seem quite simplistically wicked at
                        first read. While discussing this novel, students consider how to craft
                        their own social media identities. The activity prompts students to think
                        through this plot crisis as an eighteenth-century version of what theorists
                        of social media today call “context collapse,” in which distinct audiences
                        combine and create unexpected (and often, unwanted) interpretations (boyd
                        31). </p>
                  <p>Students’ increasing awareness of the wide implications, and often unforeseen
                        consequences, of their own social media self-expression sets the stage for a
                        richly intercontextual discussion of this first person epistolary fiction.
                        Like Lady Susan, they realize that their plans and hopes can be undermined
                        if information intended for one audience (photographs taken at college
                        parties, for example) crosses over to other audiences (future employers).
                        While many students initially condemn Lady Susan, agreeing with Facebook
                        founder Mark Zuckerberg that “[h]aving two identities for yourself is an
                        example of a lack of integrity” (boyd 31), they quickly complicate this
                        sentiment when they consider their own online identity decisions. Social
                        media “context collapse,” which is especially prevalent on Facebook and
                        other platforms that are part of the “real name web,” is a useful analogy to
                        help modern urban readers comprehend the social dynamics of
                        eighteenth-century English country gentry. Students immediately grasp the
                        identity complexities introduced by the possibility of such context
                        collapse, and tend to brim with stories about when their aunt or grandfather
                        misunderstood something they posted on social media for an intended audience
                        of peers. Seeing Lady Susan’s letter-writing practice in this light helps
                        them interpret her character more sympathetically, since many have grown up
                        learning painful lessons about reputational identity in social media. For
                        this same reason, it is a key learning goal of my course to increase
                        students’ expertise at shaping and managing their own online identities. My
                        feminist pedagogy seeks to encourage student agency online so that they can
                        be, as one student pointed out in a moment of delightfully ironic
                        realization, <emph>more like</emph> Lady Susan—in rhetorical artistry, if
                        not morality.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, before students create their Tumblr blogs, we thoroughly discuss
                        their choices about how much identifying information they will choose to
                        reveal in their Tumblr accounts. Students then decide to create their Tumblr
                        blogs with either their real names, a durable pseudonym which they maintain
                        across platforms, or an entirely anonymous, disposable moniker chosen for
                        one use only. In our course LMS, which is password protected, we all share
                        our Tumblr blog identities so that we can all follow each other’s blogs. But
                        on the Tumblr platform itself, I discourage students from publishing
                        identifying information (including photographs or nicknames) about other
                        students, even if they choose to use their own real names for their own
                        blog. As students gain more control over their own social media personas,
                        they also gain richer appreciation of the context of <title level="m">Lady
                            Susan</title> or <title level="m">Emma</title>, novels which feature
                        long-established, deeply interconnected communities of families. For
                        example, this student, <ref target="http://janereigns.tumblr.com/">Erica
                            Clifford</ref>, chose to identify herself by her full name in her course
                        project, but students are free to choose how much identifying information
                        they wish to include. </p>

                  <p>Once student blogs are launched with a few initial quotations from the early
                        readings on the syllabus, we start thinking about the commonplace books as
                        not only a useful analogy for self-aware identity construction, but also as
                        a knowledge technology with specific resonances to eighteenth century and
                        Romantic-era culture. Although we read most of Austen’s published novels as
                        well as many excerpted critical studies in this course, we do not have time
                        for a deep exploration of eighteenth-century book history and publishing
                        practices. However, even a brief consideration of the material history of
                        the eighteenth-century book can help students begin to appreciate the
                        economic conditions that configure Austen’s characters’ opportunities and
                        choices as well as Austen’s own various publishing strategies. To this end,
                        while reading Edward Copeland’s “Money” from the <title level="m">Cambridge
                            Companion to Jane Austen,</title> the class visits special collections,
                        where students get to handle a number of Regency-era texts and learn how
                        printing processes, materials, and costs influenced readership and the rise
                        of circulating libraries, and we also get to view an early edition Johnson’s
                            <title level="m">Dictionary</title> as well as some manuscript
                        commonplace books. </p>
                  <p>The archival visit is always one of the highlights of the semester, and two
                        assignments build on it: a short reflection piece about reading and writing
                        by candlelight, and a close-reading of a passage from an Austen novel
                        comparing Johnson’s definition of a word to our modern usage. Many students
                        put one or both of these assignments into their Tumblr commonplace books, as
                        in this <ref target="http://universaltruthsrevealed.tumblr.com/search/dictionary">example</ref>. The other technology of the text assignment,
                        reading/writing by candlelight, pairs very well with <title level="m">Sense
                            and Sensibility, </title>and helps students appreciate Austen’s careful
                        equation between Marianne’s cramped postures and her desperate emotions
                        while she writes letters to Willoughby in the second volume. The assignment
                        also offers context for thinking through the trope of the flickering candle,
                        that durable device of gothic fiction, which Austen exploits and satirizes
                        in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>. The assignment asks students
                        to read at least one chapter of a novel and then handwrite a reflection
                        about the experience—both by candlelight. Students then take a digital
                        photograph of their study area and post it to their commonplace book
                        alongside their reflection, as in this <ref target="http://universaltruthsrevealed.tumblr.com/image/60908380109">example</ref> by Terrileigh Shepherd. Notice the layers of textual
                        technology represented in this single image: the student is hand-writing
                        after reading by candlelight from a Norton Critical Edition of <title level="m">Emma,</title> then using a cell phone camera to digitally
                        photograph her text and post it to her twenty-first-century version of an
                        eighteenth-century commonplace book. In this particular case, the assignment
                        offered Terri an opportunity to tell the class about growing up in Zimbabwe,
                        where frequent power outages made candlelight a familiar homework resource.
                        Access to technology is not only temporally but also geographically
                        differential, a topic that the class explored again when we watched Patricia
                        Rozema’s adaptation of <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> and discussed
                        Said’s argument about Austen’s implication in English imperialism. </p>
                  <p>These simple assignments yield remarkable results, since they defamiliarize
                        reading itself by transforming it into a consciously embodied role-playing
                        activity that can bring the Regency period to life. As students orient
                        themselves to the physical postures and technological challenges of reading
                        and writing by candlelight, they begin to imagine how material culture
                        pervades and situates our lived experience. Students reflect on issues
                        including the height of the candle, troublesome drafts, the smell and heat
                        of candlelight, the physical cramps or eyestrain they experience, and their
                        sense of embodying Marianne’s Romantic sensibility. The opportunity to
                        imagine themselves into the physicality of the Regency period can open a
                        series of realizations about gender, age, class position, social occasion,
                        affect, and the body itself as a historically-constructed aspect of
                        character. After this initial assignment, and because students find this
                        kind of experiential learning so dynamic, the class engaged in a series of
                        role playing activities that focus on material culture, including a Jane
                        Austen dancing session, a sketching exercise where we copied a profile using
                        shadow-tracing, a Commerce card-party, and a Regency-style potluck. For many
                        of these activities, students added entries to their digital commonplace
                        books not only collecting but also reflecting on the experience itself; in
                        other words, their commonplace books became, in many instances, not only
                        collections of remediated objects and phrases, but also of reflective
                        writing about their own learning processes.</p>
                  <p>Role playing and other game-like activities involve students in active
                        learning that yields rich readings, close attention to nuances of the text,
                        and melds students into an engaged learning community. Such an atmosphere
                        provides a useful context from which to address Romantic individualism,
                        gender, and class in the novels. My students, in twenty-first-century Los
                        Angeles, find it difficult to appreciate the power of unfamiliar social
                        conventions, from Anne Elliot’s frustrating inability to voice her desire in
                            <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, to Fanny’s moral certainties in

                        and can therefore begin to teach each other about contemporary material

                  <p>Student-designed digital commonplace books both enable shared research and
                        discovery and embody individual student’s various relationships to Regency
                        culture. One example of a commonplace book that led through pop culture
                        references to an exploration of material culture, in this case fabric and
                        fashion, is the commonplace book “<ref target="http://bonnetenvy.tumblr.com/">Bonnet Envy</ref>.” Elizabeth
                        Sanchéz, who initially titled her commonplace book “My Dear Miss Elizabeth,”
                        became fascinated by masculine fashion, and at the final (which was a ball
                        thrown by the students for the campus community) she welcomed guests to the
                        ball with a display of her watercolor fashion plates (see Figure 1). She
                        also explained how to tie a cravat and offered guests a choice to wear
                        either gloves or a cravat for the dancing, so that all guests could freely
                        choose and signal their gender role for the dancing<note place="foot">This
                            ball emerged as a student initiative, and they organized it themselves,
                            including seeking funding from student government, assigning each other
                            organizational responsibilities, learning dances to teach attendees, and
                            sending out invitations. </note>. The posts and aesthetics of her blog
                        together embody her interest in period history, and her careful research, as

                  <p>In contrast, student Nikolai Barkats’s commonplace book displays a widely
                        different aesthetic and set of intellectual preoccupations. “<ref target="http://darcysintown.tumblr.com/">Darcy’s in Town</ref>” focuses
                        on pulp fiction, gaming, and modern Austen rewritings. This student became
                        the class expert on Austen mashups, with a playful focus on gender and
                        masculinity in the novels and their filmic and textual afterlives. Like
                        Elizabeth Sanchéz, this student was also interested in masculinity in the
                        novels, but his approach was quite distinct, as his choice of topics and
                        format makes clear. Note the eye-popping background color, the pulp-fiction
                        title and cover art, and the fascination with video games and other remix
                        forms:</p>

                  <p>Another student’s site, Sara Koffi’s “<ref target="http://austen-not-texas.tumblr.com/">Austen-not-Texas</ref>,”
                        demonstrates a more traditional commonplace book structure, offering
                        primarily quotations from novels and criticism and short, informal
                        reactions. <note place="foot">This student chose to create an anonymous
                            commonplace book, but, like all other students cited in this article,
                            has since given me authorization to cite her by name for this

                        class for their insight and helpfulness. For example, here is Sara

                        community at a small liberal arts college might be similar to the Longbourn
                        neighborhood: </p>

                  <p>Finally, Erica Clifford’s blog <ref target="http://janereigns.tumblr.com/">“Jane Reigns”</ref> integrates all these aspects of the digital
                        commonplace book, and culminates in a final digital essay exploring one
                        aspect of material culture in Austen’s era. Erica’s work integrates popular
                        culture references, historical and archival sources, quotations from novels
                        and criticism, and, at the bottom of each blog page, a scrolling list of the
                        posts by other students and other bloggers that she favorited or commented
                        on. Her digital essay, posted near the top of her book, is a video published
                        on YouTube and titled <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkHsQo4vCL0">“Bread Pudding: A
                            Socioeconomic Cultural Portrait.”</ref> This video exemplifies a
                        possibility for undergraduate work that traditional essays often don’t
                        achieve: undergraduate scholarship that is rigorous and wide-ranging while
                        being potentially useful to an audience that goes far beyond her classmates.
                        It is, therefore, a student research project that may have a life after
                        being graded, as it offers an entry point into its topic for future readers,
                        bakers, and/or students. Since Erica chose to make it publicly available on
                        her Tumblr as well as YouTube, it will be only a browser search away for
                        anyone with an interest in Jane Austen’s love of bread pudding. </p>

                  <p>The aspect of Erica’s book that most excites me, beyond her rather wonderful
                        essay on dessert, is the scrolling feed of other students’ posts with whom
                        she interacted. The Tumblr platform, a popular social media site favored by
                        slightly more women than men, actively encourages bloggers to share each
                        other’s posts with the simple dashboard button “Quote.” Using this platform
                        affordance, many individual Tumblr users produce very little original
                        material but build extensive collections of reblogged materials that
                        represent their own individual interests and tastes. In this sense, Tumblr
                        is a modern, social commonplace book, adding the Web 2.0 culture of
                        connection to John Locke’s conception of commonplacing. The many Tumblr
                        themes available include citational links, so that when a blogger reshares
                        another blogger’s post, the software automatically includes that link in the
                        post, and alerts the original author. This creates a network of users who
                        quickly form interest communities. Since I asked all my students to “follow”
                        each other’s blogs, they also received notifications of each other’s posts,
                        which further encouraged active sharing, and, at times, created real-time
                        virtual communities of readers. Such real-time sharing was especially useful
                        when students were reading critical articles. Finding a key passage, they
                        would post it to their commonplace books with a brief commentary or an image
                        from a film or other source. Other students also reading the article
                        (usually the night before class discussion) would read and reshare the
                        posted quotations as a study aid, so that by the time we were all sitting in
                        the room together preparing to discuss the article, the class had already
                        established a foothold for themselves from which to begin our consideration.
                        In general, I participate in such discussions only by posting, or
                        reblogging, or “liking”, content, as any other members of the class would
                        do. My role is therefore to <emph>participate</emph>, or lead by example,
                        rather than to guide or direct. </p>
                  <p>Such social reading can happen, of course, with other kinds of informal
                        reflective writing due before class. But what really excited me about this
                        instance was that I had not explicitly <emph>assigned</emph> students to
                        discuss the article ahead of time, and they saw their interactions on Tumblr
                        as helpful for their own reading process rather than as an obligatory
                        exercise. Sometimes students would write about the passage, as Sara Koffi
                        does <ref target="http://austen-not-texas.tumblr.com/post/62909623347/most-of-us-now-correctly-understand-a-question">here</ref>. Sometimes they would share helpful study tools, as
                        Elizabeth Sanchéz does <ref target="http://bonnetenvy.tumblr.com/post/64020209635/a-handy-little-guide-to-the-relationships-in-pride">here</ref>. The sense of community endeavor this shared blogging
                        inspired brought the class together into a learning community connected by
                        helpfulness and shared interests. It is, I think, no accident that this was
                        the same group that collectively decided to throw a ball for the campus. I
                        won’t describe the ball, as <ref target="http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol34no2/wilson.html">Cheryl Wilson</ref> and others have already written usefully about
                        teaching dancing as a part of a course on Jane Austen, but the fact that the
                        class chose, as a group, to create this event is probably my single favorite
                        teaching experience ever, one that I do believe is connected to students’
                        Tumblr community building throughout the semester.</p>

                  <head>Tumblr Design, Participatory Culture, and Commonplacing as Curation</head>
                  <p>This community building was facilitated by the time we spent in class
                        referring to and learning from other’s Tumblr blogs. As their blogs grew,
                        students’ expertise with different aspects of Tumblr became clear, and we
                        often had short student-led technical discussions during class. One student
                        explained the citational practices of the Tumblr community (it is bad form
                        to reblog a modified meme without acknowledgement, for instance), which led
                        naturally and usefully to a discussion of both academic citational practices
                        and Austen’s own dense network of textual allusions, particularly in <title level="m">Persuasion </title>and <title level="m">Northanger Abbey.
                        </title>Other students showed the class how they achieved certain design
                        aspects of their blogs, which increased the range of aesthetic possibilities
                        among the blogs. Note the differing design aesthetics of Nikolai Barkats’
                        pulp-fiction inspired “Darcy’s In Town” versus the embowered “Jane Reigns”
                        or the self-consciously antiqued “Universal Truths.” The students’ design
                        freedom elevated this assignment over other familiar reading response
                        assignments they might post to an LMS forum, and resulted in a sense of
                        ownership of the assignment that created energy, community, and moved
                        discussions into the realm of what network theorist Henry Jenkins calls
                        “participatory culture,” which includes the following characteristics:</p>
                  <list type="ordered">
                     <item>relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic
                            engagement,</item>
                     <item>strong support for creating and sharing creations with others, </item>
                     <item>types of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most
                            experienced is passed along to novices,</item>
                     <item>members who believe that their contributions matter, and</item>
                     <item>members who feel some degree of social connection with one another (at
                            the least, they care what other people think about what they have
                            created). (Jenkins 5-6)</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Here, Jenkins is describing what he believes is a significant cultural shift
                        associated with Web 2.0 practice. Unlike broadcasting, print media
                        authorship, or even early hard-coded HTML websites, Web 2.0 applications
                        such as Tumblr, Twitter, and WordPress overlay one-to-many networks like
                        books or traditional classrooms with the many-to-many networks of social
                        media. In this kind of distributed network, all participants have not only
                        the opportunity but the motivation to produce as well as consume, since
                        their contribution embodies their individuality to the class community.</p>
                  <p>Like today’s socially networked readers, gentry women of Austen’s period were
                        not only consumers but also the producers of much artistic and domestic
                        culture. Characters such as Georgiana Darcy or Jane Fairfax exemplify the
                        accomplished woman in Austen’s work, in contrast to protagonists whose more
                        modest accomplishments are much thematized in the novels. However, while
                        Elizabeth Bennet or Emma Woodhouse may not play and sing as well as others,
                        they, like other women of their class and period, were valued for their
                        “society,” the contribution that their presence would make to a gathering.
                        Of course, we still delight in witty or wise friends, but we rarely think of
                        ourselves now as valuable primarily for how our creative contribution adds
                        to a collective whole. The press of such gendered obligation on Austen’s
                        characters is one of the most important, and most subtle, aspects of the
                        novels for modern students to grasp, precisely because it is so pervasive
                        and so internalized. And, like any other disciplinary technology, this
                        social obligation to contribute manifests itself by empowering characters to
                        act accordingly—some more than others, of course. Similarly, when students
                        form their own commonplacing digital community, they experience both the
                        empowerment and the constraints of the technology that facilitates their
                        community. Tumblr becomes a material manifestation of Foucault’s
                        power/knowledge, with the affordances of the technology channeling student
                        contributions and empowering them to create and share digital objects that
                        amaze and delight them with their own accomplishments.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the semester, the class would consult members’ commonplace books
                        to find references, research topics, and design inspiration. To enhance this
                        sense of student ownership of the assignment, I asked students to evaluate
                        each other’s commonplace books twice during the semester, working from a
                        rubric that we collectively developed early in the semester. We contrasted
                        these activities to Emma’s tutelage of Harriet Smith in <title level="m">Emma, </title>to Henry Tilney’s relationship to Catherine Morland in
                            <title level="m">Northanger Abbey, </title>and to the themes of romance
                        and moral education that intertwine in so many of Austen’s novels. The
                        students’ commonplace books tend to exhibit vitality, energy, and good will
                        that embodies many aspects of Jenkins’ participatory culture, a hallmark of
                        our networked, Web 2.0 era, and a distinct contrast to the more hierarchical
                        and elite publishing practices of Austen’s era. </p>
                  <p>Digital pedagogies succeed at community-creation because they are, in fact,
                        embodied learning practices, as I hope this article has shown. Hybrid
                        assignments can illuminate forms of technology and labor precisely because
                        they foreground the material conditions of reading and writing, including
                        physical place, textuality, temporality, and economics. When students remix
                        and otherwise make canonical texts their own, they open spaces to
                        historicize technologies of textuality and in the process discover for
                        themselves some differences between late eighteenth and early twenty-first
                        century modes of life. Today, unlike Regency-era people, students rarely
                        expect to produce the intellectual and recreational artifacts that occupy
                        their time. Many of us are today passive consumers of cultural merchandise,
                        but that is changing. Tumblr and other Web 2.0 platforms that encourage
                        remixing and sharing cultural artifacts are part of a transformation that is
                        taking place in parts of our society. While I distance myself from
                        techno-utopians who imagine that internet technology is an unmixed social
                        good, I do find that students bloom when their learning is connected to each
                        other and to others on the web who share their interests. They also discover
                        commonalities between Regency-era culture and their own lives that might
                        otherwise remain unacknowledged. </p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount"> The Romantic period saw an explosion of printed material, ushered
                    in by the end of perpetual copyright in 1774, new technologies that led the
                    charge toward mass production, and the nearly insatiable appetite of a newly
                    formed reading public. The concept of information overload far predates that
                    contemporary term; in the Romantic period, like today, expanded access made the
                    feeling more acute. Many Romantic readers felt the need, with the surfeit of
                    information, to make their engagement more lasting. One way Romantic readers—and
                    our students—could meet this need is through collection, and later indexing and
                    reflection, in commonplace books. This article explores adopting a sustained
                    practice of commonplacing in online classes as a way for students to position
                    themselves as best they can as Romantic readers, confronting in the internet age
                    a similar expansion of ideas and information. It details a semester-long project
                    that pushes students to move from collection and organization to synthesis and
                    reflection. Students keep individual commonplace books, contribute to a
                    class-wide commonplace book, and reorganize and reflect upon their shared
                    commonplace book in place of a traditional final exam. The purpose of these
                    assignments is to foster students’ understanding of the historical and personal
                    value of the commonplace book as a genre and to ensure students’ engagement with
                    thematic threads within the Romantic period. Assignment sheets and “quick start”
                    guides for students are made available with this article, along with a reference
                    aid for those interested in incorporating these assignments in their classrooms.

                        see unprecedented heights, Samuel Johnson invented a figurative use for the
                        term ephemera in his <ref target="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004772607.0001.005/1:5.3?rgn=div2;view=fulltext">
                        <title level="m">Rambler</title> 145</ref>. The insect whose life
                        spans a mere day becomes equivalent in Johnson’s terms to newspapers, “the
                            <emph>Ephemerae </emph>of learning,” those “productions . . . seldom
                        intended to remain in the world longer than a week” (Johnson). Despite his
                        defense of these writers of ephemera, Johnson’s turn of phrase nonetheless
                        carries notions of death and decay. The printed page loses its value when it
                        loses its immortality, Johnson reports, and when its production outstrips
                        its longevity. </p>
                  <p>Johnson’s claim, though intended solely for periodical publications, presages
                        the publishing boom to come. The Romantic period saw an explosion of printed
                        material, ushered in by the end of perpetual copyright in 1774, new
                        technologies that led the charge toward mass production, and the nearly
                        insatiable appetite of a newly formed reading public.<note place="foot">See
                            H.J. Jackson’s Introduction to <hi rend="italic">Romantic Readers</hi>,
                            pages 7-9 in particular. Matthew Taunton’s article “Print Culture” for
                            the British Library provides accessible information on Romantic and
                            Victorian print technologies.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is debate over the extent to which this “reading revolution” is
                        particularly Romantic, with H. J. Jackson making the case that literacy
                        rates were on the rise before the Romantic period and mass production would
                        not come until the Victorian age. Even if these technologies had not
                        practically realized the boom in production and distribution of knowledge,
                        their presence and promise changed the conversation about reading and
                        publishing. We can reconsider the term “revolution” without denying there
                        was considerably more print for Romantic readers and that readers’
                        engagement with any material could now be ephemeral. The concept of
                        information overload far predates that contemporary term; in the Romantic
                        period, like today, expanded access made the feeling more acute. Many
                        Romantic readers felt the need, with the surfeit of information, to make
                        their engagement more lasting. One way Romantic readers—and our
                        students—could meet this need is through collection, and later indexing and
                        reflection, in commonplace books. </p>
                  <p>Commonplace books allowed Romantic readers to confront the overload of
                        printed pages by editing their own volumes, pushing back against the new
                        technology through a deliberately antiquated and painstaking form of
                        collection and transcription revived, as William St. Clair notes, from “the
                        manuscript miscellanies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries” (226).
                        The desire to order information is not foreign to traditional student
                        populations, millennials who are digital natives, or even the population I
                        teach, nontraditional students in online and distance degree completion
                        programs. The world is one where Buzzfeed has perfected the art of the
                        listicle, programs like Pinterest and Tumblr allow users simple forums
                        through which to bookmark, follow, and find. As the most popular search
                        engine, Google’s <ref target="https://www.google.com/about/">stated
                            mission</ref> is “to organize the world’s information and make it
                        universally accessible and useful.” Through adopting a sustained practice of
                        commonplacing, my students and I position ourselves as best we can as
                        Romantic readers, confronting in the internet age a similar expansion of
                        ideas and information. </p>
                  <p>Asking students to inhabit the genre through an integrated and sustained set
                        of hands-on activities that reimagine the means of traditional recall,
                        synthesis, and analysis expands their grasp of the historical factors that
                        condition texts. Commonplacing literally and figuratively collapses the
                        distance between texts, drawing them into a conversation that resembles the
                        way Romantic readers met these same works. We encounter our readings, not as
                        discrete works of genius huddled under authors’ names in anthologies, but as
                        part of a larger cultural conversation integrally tied to those who produce
                        literature and to those who consumed and still consume these works. There is
                        something powerful in confronting the materiality of texts—even,
                        paradoxically, through digital means—that, at its best, empowers students as
                        readers, collapsing the distance between their experience and what can seem
                        so foreign. </p>
                  <p>I developed the “Commonplacing Our Semester” project for an online course,
                        English 411: British Romantic Literature, to be offered to students in an
                        interdisciplinary degree completion program. The semester-long project
                        pushes students to move from collection and organization to synthesis and
                        reflection. Students keep individual commonplace books, contribute to a
                        class-wide commonplace book, and reorganize and reflect upon their shared
                        commonplace book in place of a traditional final exam. The purpose of these
                        assignments is to foster students’ understanding of the historical and
                        personal value of the commonplace book as a genre and to ensure students’
                        engagement with thematic threads within the Romantic period. I prescribe
                        fixed parameters for the class-wide commonplace book, leaving the individual
                        assignment more fluid and open to creative, yet still historically relevant,
                        interpretations. As our commonplacing is a sustained project, I take pains
                        to create continuity in style and structure across teaching materials,
                        including assignment sheets and “quick start” guides for students (which are
                        made available with this article, along with a reference aid for those
                        interested in incorporating these assignments in their classrooms).<note place="foot">PDFs of my teaching materials are available under figures

                  </p>
                  <p>Students initiate their understanding of the genre though archival research
                        of commonplace books housed in the <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu">Harvard University Library’s Open Collections Program</ref> and further
                        their understanding through adopting the practice themselves. Students’
                        research informs their choice of purpose and technology for their individual
                        commonplace books. The class-wide commonplace book takes John Locke as its
                        model. Commonplace books allowed readers to amass information, similar to
                        the way blogs and social media forums offer records or catalogs of
                        information. Some Romantic readers, influenced by Locke’s popular treatise
                            <ref target="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3209685">

                        (1706), used indexing to track commonalities. This added layer of
                        organization was not an end unto itself; it was meant to spur further
                        critical thought, with usefulness, according to Locke, the chief goal of
                        commonplacing. </p>

                        manipulate the page beyond sequential readings or targeted searches for
                        single items. Students transcribe weekly quotations, devising what Locke
                        called “heads” for the index, motifs or tags for each quotation. Students
                        refine their thinking in the final exam, which requires a further
                        reorganization of the collected quotations and heads into thematic threads.
                        To successfully complete the exam, students must return to our semester’s
                        work to find <emph>common places</emph> among what they collectively and
                        cumulatively have contributed. Looking back, they recognize patterns that
                        have emerged in our thinking about Romanticism and how we might define
                        Romanticism given our class’s concerns. Their accompanying essays take up
                        issues of process—how and why students chose the themes they did—and
                        consider Romanticism as both an intellectual movement and historical period.
                        The two parts of the exam help students synthesize the wealth of material we
                        have gathered over the course of the semester into manageable pieces that
                        suggest larger questions of categorizing the Romantic period.</p>

                  <head>Curating an Online Experience</head>
                  <p>Effective use of technology is essential to my teaching, as most of my
                        courses are taught either asynchronously and wholly online or through other
                        distance means. The online course is its own genre, dependent upon the
                        written word as its means of communication. In contrast to live discussion,
                        participants, both students and instructors, craft and (ideally) have time
                        to polish what it is they want to say. But reading 250 words is a different
                        experience than hearing 250 words. My most successful online courses avoid
                        attempting to replicate the experience of a live classroom. I attempt,
                        instead, to embrace the genre, working within the limitations and the
                        possibilities of the virtual classroom. </p>
                  <p>As online educators, we are curators of the learning experience. Embracing
                        the medium through which we communicate with students involves not simply
                        amassing information but reimagining it. The majority of my students are
                        taking full course loads online, in addition to their 9-to-5 jobs, which
                        require many more hours in front of a computer screen. Not only do I
                        organize learning modules with information overload in mind, but I also draw
                        this concept into the virtual classroom. With its dependence upon the
                        written word, our digital medium reflects commonplacers’ active engagement
                        with written text. Even the social aspects of commonplacing—circulating the
                        book among friends, transcribing a favorite line or penning an original
                        verse for its owner—use written modes of communication. We, too, rely on the
                        written word.</p>
                  <p>In my experience, providing students with as much detail as possible about
                        major assignments upfront—despite the potential for information
                        overload—assuages student fears in an online learning environment. I
                        introduce the semester-long engagement with commonplace books in the
                        course’s first learning module with a lengthy assignment sheet I title
                        “Commonplacing Our Semester.” (Link to the full document through Figure 1
                        below.) </p>

                  <p>The introductory sections of this assignment sheet link Romantic reading
                        experiences with our own, specifically through the “Consider while
                        Commonplacing” box on page 2. This part asks students to consider modern
                        equivalents of commonplacing through tagging, sharing to save, and
                        bookmarking, while introducing terms common in modern conversations about
                        technology—information overload fatigue and information literacy. The last
                        page of the assignment sheet reassures students that feeling information
                        overload is an intentional part of our learning experience. </p>
                  <p>After a brief introduction to commonplacing as a Romantic practice, the
                        assignment sheet details the four component parts of the semester-long
                        project: archival research of primary source material; an individual
                        commonplace book that students propose and keep throughout the semester; a
                        class-wide commonplace book they share digitally with their colleagues; and
                        a final exam that requires reorganization and reflection upon the shared
                        piece. Despite my desire for transparency, I leave off details of the final
                        exam until late in the semester so that students’ commonplacing stems from
                        their experience of the weekly readings and our exploratory discussions, not
                        from a prescribed end goal. These four components total a little over 40% of
                        students’ final grades, as explained in Figure 2 below, with the remainder
                        of the semester’s final grade divided among a close reading essay (20%),
                        researched argument (25%), and participation on discussion boards (15%). </p>

                  <p>I am keenly aware that assignment sheets, especially in a wholly online
                        format, can add to information overload. But a digital classroom does not
                        allow for asides and clarifications that occur when reviewing a document in
                        person. Structure is key to producing materials that are thorough yet
                        manageable. Repeated visual elements within and across the two assignments
                        sheets underscore significant requirements and guide students to see the
                        project as a whole. </p>

                        Harvard’s make the kind of work I propose here possible for larger
                        institutions and for students whose resources may be limited. Harvard’s
                        open-access resource offers millions of digitized pages, curated into six
                        themed projects. The project we use, the Reading collection, houses
                        manuscript and printed material related to reading as a solitary and social
                        practice, including a subsection for <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html">commonplace
                            books</ref>. But these projects themselves represent a glut of
                        information that can overwhelm the online learner accessing them on a home
                        PC. </p>
                  <p>To ease this potential information overload, I developed a <title level="m">Quick Start Guide to the Harvard Collections</title> (linked below in
                        Figure 3) with visual steps for accessing and navigating the archive, along
                        with explanations of Harvard’s terminology, tips for the site, and links to
                        pertinent Romantic materials. Harvard’s selections span the seventeenth to
                        the nineteenth centuries and five languages, in both printed and manuscript
                        forms. The database provides digital surrogates, often without
                        transcriptions or translations, which can be daunting for undergraduates.
                        Few of the books themselves are fully searchable, but the links on the
                        commonplace book <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html">homepage</ref> can focus students’ individual efforts. For example, as
                        shown in Figure 3 below, I direct students to read first the ten commonplace
                        books linked in the overview section on the homepage. I then ask that they
                        explore the <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/highlights/highlight1.html">Reading “Collection Highlights”</ref> (specifically pages <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/highlights/highlight9.html">nine</ref>, <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/highlights/highlight10.html">ten</ref>, and <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/highlights/highlight11.html">eleven</ref> which deal explicitly with commonplace books) before
                        searching by century, language, or type of publication and navigating one by
                        one the full list of items.<note place="foot">Another option might be to
                            limit to texts with direct ties to Romanticism, a list of which, though
                            not exhaustive, I provide in the <title level="m">Quick Start Guide to
                                the Harvard Collections</title>
                     </note> The purpose of this research
                        is not necessarily to engage the content of the commonplace books but to
                        recognize the forms these books take. The assignment sheet guides students’
                        research, asking specific questions, inset on page 5, to help them recognize
                        visual and organizational patterns. Even if students cannot always read the
                        language (or the handwriting), what comes into focus is that there is
                        variety within accepted formats. Students share their findings through
                        discussion board posts from which we craft a working definition of the
                        genre.</p>

                  <p>Students find that while all were repositories of information for later
                        reflection, some commonplace books were also scholarly tools, study aids, or
                        means for inspiration, both professional and personal. They contained <ref target="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3181283?n=55">clippings

                  <head>Applying the Theory: Individual and Shared Commonplace Books</head>
                  <p>Once we have compiled a rough definition of the genre, we move to practices
                        of commonplacing. The freedom within boundaries that characterizes Romantic
                        commonplace books is why I assign two forms: the individual and shared
                        commonplace books, both requiring weekly entries that engage that module’s
                        readings. The individual commonplace book’s grade is based on a brief
                        proposal and electronic submission of the commonplace book in full at the
                        end of the semester. Even if students wait to compile all entries at the
                        close of the semester, they will still meet the goals for this component:
                        self-directed engagement with assigned readings and parsing connections
                        between the historical facets of the genre and modern resonances of
                        commonplace books.</p>
                  <p>The assignment sheet’s section “To Consider When Writing Your Proposal”
                        suggests possible purposes, entries, and technologies to guide students’
                        proposals, but they are not bound by these suggestions. Students, like their
                        Romantic predecessors, may choose to collect only particular types of
                        material (poetry, for example, like this nineteenth-century <ref target="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3163259">collection of
                            ballads</ref>) or group their collections thematically, as did
                        eighteenth-century commonplacer Thomas Austen in separate manuscripts on
                            <ref target="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3685841">poetry and

                            literature and sermons</ref>. They may choose material related to their
                        area of study or future profession in the vein of <ref target="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.ARCH:3990555">Charles Sumner’s

                        nephew John Salusbury Piozzi. Students’ individual collections, like many

                            <emph>sententiae</emph>, whose quotations out of context comprise little
                        more than inspiration for the collector.<note place="foot">Adam Hooks

                        commonplace books—while they must engage Romanticism and our semester’s

                        choosing.</p>
                  <p>The students’ shared commonplace book, on the other hand, returns to one of
                        the original and more canonical uses of the genre—as study aid—and adopts a
                        prescribed format taken up by many commonplacers in the eighteenth and
                        nineteenth centuries, one adapted from John Locke’s <ref target="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3209685">

                     </ref>
                        (1706). This guide contains a letter written by Locke detailing his method
                        of commonplacing, along with the recipient, Jean Le Clerc’s, prefatory
                        advice for commonplacers, both of which I assign to students.<note place="foot">Although printed, the text can be challenging for
                            undergraduates unfamiliar with early printing practices. This is one of
                            the few texts for which Harvard includes a transcription, but clicking
                            through sequence by sequence in their Page Delivery System can be
                            cumbersome. The Harvard archive includes Ellis Gray Loring’s <ref target="https://www.google.com/about/">commonplace book</ref>
                            printed in 1821 with an “Illustration of the Common-Place Book” in
                            modern typeface based on Locke’s method that can act as a supplemental
                            text. See Page 2 of the <title level="m">Quick Start Guide to the
                                Harvard Collections</title>, which explains how to access
                            transcriptions.</note> This method became so popular that publishers
                        printed commonplace books “upon the plan recommended and practised by John
                        Locke,” such as the ones <ref target="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3196824">Ellis Gray

Francis</ref>, and <ref target="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~ag978/355/commonplace/single.html">Victor Hugo</ref>.</note> Locke and Le Clerc assert the usefulness
                        of commonplace books—that “it is of Service to have Collections of this
                        Kind, both that Students may learn the Art of putting Things in Order, as
                        also the better retain what they Read” (sequence 13). What Locke adds—and
                        what publishers later capitalize on—is a clear methodology for keeping an
                        index. </p>
                  <p>This organizational principle, in brief, involves an index with what Locke
                        calls “heads,” what literarily we would call motifs, or, on the internet,
                        tags. (I consciously use the term “heads” since a primary learning outcome
                        for this component is for students to apply practically Locke’s theory.)
                        Locke’s method, in its most simplified form, is as follows: at the beginning
                        or end of the book, the commonplacer designates blank pages with
                        alphabetical columns into which heads are accumulated, as seen below in
                        Figure 4. When adding content throughout the commonplace book, the
                        commonplacer keeps running heads in the margins of the pages that are then
                        cross-referenced in the index with the page number. Even in our simplified
                        form (explained in more detail in the next section), indexing requires
                        students to move beyond note taking to employing pattern recognition and
                        engagement with literary motifs. “Locke’s ‘New Method,’” Stephen Colclough
                        notes, “still encouraged readers to record extracts from their reading under
                        headings, but these were now to emerge from their reading rather than
                        dictate it” (33). My students, like the Romantics before them, engage in an
                        active process of reading and interacting with material collected that
                        results in an intentionally ordered book instead of a dizzying collection of
                        quotations with little use beyond their initial transcription. </p>

                            program.<note place="foot">I offer thanks to Aisha Haynes, Program
                            Manager for Distributed Learning at the University of South Carolina’s
                            Center for Teaching Excellence, for generously sharing her expertise on
                            technology tools.</note> Locke and Le Clerc argue that commonplace books
                        are not solely a repository of knowledge but are meant to be useful, with
                        that usefulness dependent on indexing. Padlet, unlike sequential
                        repositories of information like Tumblr or Pinterest, offers a more seamless
                        way to adapt Locke’s method. Padlet provides a digital notepad whose virtual
                        surface allows users to order more readily its contents.<note place="foot">Although the program itself is intuitive, their website is less so.

                        more. As with any new program, getting used to the interface provides
                        certain challenges, even for those who routinely take online classes. Like

                  <p>I recommend Padlet as well because any wall can be embedded into an online
                        learning management system (like Blackboard or Moodle) or class website to
                        better integrate the learning experience, especially for students who may be
                        accessing the class from multiple devices. I compiled a <title level="m">Quick Reference Guide for Instructors Using Padlet</title> (linked in
                        Figure 6 below) for <title level="m">Romantic Circles </title>readers who
                        may wish to incorporate parts or all of this assignment into their classes.
                        It explains general usability and describes Padlet’s features, while also
                        providing step-by-step visual instructions for how to prearrange and embed a
                        Padlet wall to use for the class-wide commonplace book assignment. Even if
                        students house their walls on Padlet’s site, instead of creating an embedded
                        wall in a course’s management system or website, there are multiple levels
                        of <ref target="http://blog.padlet.com/2013/01/even-better-privacy-settings.html">privacy</ref>, from password protected to public, with an unlimited

                  <p>After completing research into Locke’s method of indexing, specifically by
                        reading Locke’s guide and referencing commonplace books styled after his
                        method linked in the Commonplacing Our Semester assignment sheet, students
                        begin weekly entries on our Padlet wall. Each entry consists of two parts: a
                        single quotation from that week’s textbook reading and “heads” (Locke’s term
                        for motifs or tags) added to the index that the student generated for this
                        quotation. </p>
                  <p>To prepare for weekly entries to the class-wide commonplace book, I
                        prearrange and embed a Padlet wall with the index, consisting of separate
                        text boxes (what Padlet terms “posts”) for each letter of the alphabet,
                        followed by a subheading for weekly entries, as shown in Figures 7 and 8.
                        One shortcoming of Padlet is that the virtual surface stops immediately
                        after the last post, which impedes maneuverability. I add a “placeholder”
                        post, seen in Figure 8, dragging it down the page until there is ample space
                        for students to add entries. </p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>The basic form of an entry, seen in Figure 9, includes three parts: a
                        student’s name and module week number in the title line; the material from
                        that week’s reading the student wishes to contribute; and a list of running
                        heads, which are the motifs the student assigns to the passage quoted. I
                        limit the length of quotations (10 lines for poetry, 250 words for prose) to
                        keep the page manageable and to avoid another potential form of information
                        overload. I offer bonus points for students who add heads to their
                        classmates’ posts, denoted by their name in parentheses after the head, as
                        in the figure below where Student B has added “innocence” and “experience”
                        to another student’s entry. Padlet also offers an unobtrusive way to attach
                        documents to text box entries with explanations as to why students selected
                        the particular passage.<note place="foot">I only require explanations if
                            students wish to post a quotation that has already been chosen by a
                            fellow classmate. In this case, students would note “Duplicate Entry”
                            with their classmate’s name in the text box, along with a list of heads,
                            and attach a paragraph justifying their inclusion of this passage. The
                                <title level="m">Quick Start Guide for Padlet</title>, page 5,
                            includes an example of a duplicate entry. Although the first-come,
                            first-served nature might be a detraction, I do not disallow or
                            discourage duplicate entries since, as Adam Hooks <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html">notes</ref>, commonplaces tend to be <emph>common</emph>, both
                            familiar and quotable.</note>

                  <p>The second weekly requirement is to add the heads students have generated to
                        the alphabetical index at the top of the wall, along with entries for author
                        (in boldface) and title (styled according to MLA rules and followed by the
                        author’s name in parentheses), as in Figure 10. Students must be diligent
                        about checking the index so as to add heads created by classmates that they
                        might not have considered, but which are relevant to their contributions. </p>

                  <p>Whereas printed commonplace books allow for page numbers to be added to the
                        index, Padlet’s digital surface provides a continuous screen, unbroken by
                        discrete sections. To replicate the cross-referencing gained through
                        pagination, I ask students at the end of the semester to further organize
                        the class-wide commonplace book so that entries are grouped according to
                        larger thematic concerns germane to our ongoing discussions of Romanticism.
                        This final requirement of the semester-long commonplace book assignment
                        (which counts as the final exam) has two graded parts: the reorganization of
                        quotations and heads on Padlet and an accompanying essay explaining
                        students’ rationale for this new organization. The exam requires students to
                        choose thematic threads to act as umbrella concepts under which the
                        accumulated quotations and heads could be housed. I limit the exam to six to
                        eight thematic threads, with all heads distributed among the themes and only
                        five quotations assigned to each. The final exam assignment sheet, available
                        under Figure 1, explains this process in further detail. Steps for realizing
                        this assignment in Padlet are included in the <title level="m">Quick
                            Reference Guide for Instructors Using Padlet</title>. </p>

                  <p>One benefit of this assignment is its cumulative nature, which happens by way
                        of students returning to our class-wide commonplace, not for revision but
                        for reimagining, informed by the whole of the semester and the work of
                        classmates. In this, the assignment may realize the best of what we would
                        hope from all of our social media: the collection and distribution of
                        knowledge that gains from its communal nature new perspectives on that which
                        is shared.</p>

                  <head>A Common Reading Experience</head>
                  <p>In a digital age, we confront, as Romantic readers did, the limits of media.
                        How does—or should—one preserve ephemera? What does it mean to collect
                        within a digital medium—a repository that is intentionally not tangible,
                        unable to be physically held or even held in the promise of perpetuity? One
                        way to address these questions is to adopt a means of collection that is
                        less passive than the now familiar modes of bookmarking, sharing to save,
                        and tagging. </p>
                  <p>Reflecting a practice Romantic readers perfected, our commonplacing combats
                        information overload. It also allows for a sense of ownership over material
                        students often feel distanced from, a feeling shared by Romantic compilers,
                        many of whom were excluded from purchasing printed books but who could
                        fashion their own via commonplacing. Romantic commonplace books reflected
                        their compiler’s individual tastes but, paradoxically, were also “frequently
                        the work of multiple hands and circulated among multiple readers within
                        particular circles of friends” (Lynch 137). We, too, compile our own texts,
                        sharing not only insights gleaned from the texts but also the act of
                        creation. Using the means available to us in the digital age, we embody, as
                        best we can, the place of Romantic readers. </p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount"> When teaching British Romanticism, cultivating student interest
                    in the material often requires the educator to explain the relevance of texts
                    that for many seem historically and linguistically remote. One way to help
                    facilitate student engagement is to ask them to investigate the public impacts
                    of the assigned texts and communicate those impacts to a public audience.
                    Digital humanists often turn to established digital humanities projects or blogs
                    to provide students a platform for this kind of work; however, we trialed using
                    a public resource that didn’t require a curatorial investment or the development
                    of strict editorial oversight. Wikipedia provided that opportunity: despite
                    nearly 4.9 million articles and one of the most visited sites on the web, there
                    are a number of gaps in Wikipedia’s coverage of British Romantic literature,
                    including coverage of William Blake’s most taught collection of poems: <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>. For a series of
                    coursework assignments on Romantic poetry, we asked students to fill those gaps.
                    This essay details our implementation of Wikipedia article writing assignments
                    over two semesters of a British Romantic poetry class, including both the
                    digital pedagogy and design concerns shaping the assignment. We explore some of
                    the missteps regarding the implementation of digital assignments and discuss how
                    the experience not only provided our students with different types of learning
                    opportunities, but also how such an assignment can become a tool for shaping the
                    public reception of Blake, Romanticism, and humanities knowledge more generally.

                  <p>Teaching British Romanticism to undergraduate literature majors and
                        non-majors often necessitates an introductory discussion about the relevance
                        of texts that may seem historically and linguistically remote. One way to
                        facilitate student engagement is to ask them to investigate the public
                        impacts of the assigned texts and to communicate their importance to a
                        public audience. Digital humanists often turn to out of the box tools like
                            <ref target="http://www.omeka.org">Omeka</ref>, <ref target="http://www.scalar.usc.edu">Scalar</ref>, <ref target="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</ref>, <ref target="http://www.wix.com">WiX</ref>, or <ref target="http://www.anthologize.org">Anthologize</ref>, to provide
                        students with platforms for this kind of work.<note place="foot">For
                            example, see The Blake Archive (<ref target="https://blakearchive.wordpress.com">https://blakearchive.wordpress.com</ref>) and British Literature,

                        don’t have the time or resources to create their own digital projects or to
                        supervise the creation of student-led digital projects, we suggest adapting
                        and incorporating student Wikipedia assignments. </p>
                  <p>Wikipedia provides the ideal platform to encourage students to develop
                        editorial responsibility over the creation and publication of knowledge. The
                        website is a high-traffic and globally conspicuous public repository of
                        knowledge that expands in a user-generated, public-facing model that many
                        Romantic-period writers would perhaps have appreciated. For every Wikipedia
                        article created there is a step-by-step archiving process that creates a
                        self-reflective repository ripe for tracing the development and the
                        production of knowledge. Just as William Blake used printing technologies as
                        a testing ground for the expression of his creativity, experimenting with
                        etching and engraving techniques to develop his illuminated printing
                        process, student Wikipedia assignments can be used as a testing ground for
                        collaborative editorial expression (McGann 57). </p>
                  <p>Despite housing nearly 4.9 million articles and being one of the most visited
                        sites on the web, there are many gaps in Wikipedia’s coverage of British
                        Romantic literature, including coverage of Blake’s most taught collection of
                        poems: <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>. For a
                        series of undergraduate Wikipedia assignments, we asked our students to fill
                        in those gaps and imagine the broader arguments around Romantic literature.
                        We introduced them to the sort of conversation communities that have become
                        a hallmark of recent literary pedagogy. By using Blake and his illuminated
                        poetry as the focus of our Wikipedia assignments, we also challenged
                        students to navigate a complex, rapidly expanding print and digital
                        ecosystem that is, as recent critics have observed, “collaborative and
                        participatory” (Whitson and Whittacker 51).</p>

                  <p>During the last 150 years, Blake’s eclectic, experimental creative output has
                        been accessible to a much larger audience than during his own lifetime.
                        Despite the prophetic exhortations of his illuminated books, Blake was a
                        poet/artist with a limited readership. Alexander Gilchrist’s biography of
                        Blake (1863) and W.B. Yeats and Edwin J. Ellis’ edition of Blake’s poetry
                        (1893) did much to establish a broader audience, and by the mid-twentieth
                        century Blake was accorded canonical status. Transcending the academy, Blake
                        is a cultural mainstay for groups as diverse as the British Women’s
                        Institute, the Beat poets, and the far-right British National Party.<note place="foot">For a discussion of the various cultural appropriations of
                            Blake, see Dent 48-62.</note> On the internet, Blake’s presence has
                        grown to the point that Roger Whitson and Jason Whittacker consider that
                        with his remediated presence on sites such as <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query+william+blake">YouTube</ref>, <ref target="https://twitter.com/w_blakequotes">Twitter,</ref>
                     <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake">Wikipedia</ref>,
                        and <ref target="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/williamblake">Flickr</ref>, Blake “is a true mass media phenomenon” (Whitson and
                        Whittacker 24, 138-61). If we consider Blake’s presence on Wikipedia, for
                        instance, we see that in 2013 users made “about 5,477” editorial revisions
                        to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake">William
                            Blake Wikipedia page</ref> (Whitson and Whittacker 142). By July 13,
                        2015, the Blake Wikipedia page had 6,402 editorial revisions, an increase of
                        927 edits.<note place="foot">Retrieved using User:Hedonil’s XTools gadget

                            errors that likely underestimate pageviews; for example, in 2014 the
                            Wikimedia Foundation discovered that over 30% of pageviews on Wikipedia
                            from mobile viewers were not being counted in these numbers (see the

                  <p>Blake’s place in the cultural zeitgeist coupled with library shelves
                        straining under the ever-increasing weight of critical editions, facsimiles,
                        and critical analysis, as well as an array of digital resources (from
                        archival sites such as the <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org">William
                            Blake Archive</ref>, the <ref target="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106190.html">British
                            Library’s digital Notebook of William Blake,</ref> the <ref target="http://www.zoamorphosis.com">Blake 2.0 Cloud and Zoamorphosis
                            Blog</ref>, critical editions, and myriad homework help websites
                        analyzing his poems) indicate a diverse and expanding audience. New readers
                        of Blake are often confronted by a bewildering array of different versions
                        of Blake’s works accompanied by a daunting mountain of commentary,
                        accessible in numerous formats and on multiple platforms. </p>
                  <p>While this material about Blake continues to increase, creating an ecology of
                        print and electronic resources about and influenced by Blake, we have to
                        remember that the many “Blakes” that constitute this ecology aren’t
                        necessarily representative of the same William Blake, poet, painter, and
                        printmaker. Transferring Blake’s illuminated books to other formats
                        necessitates some form of loss for, as Wayne C. Ripley observes, to
                        translate a work “to a new medium . . . irrevocably changes its form,
                        context, circulation, and meaning” (Ripley para. 5). With the growth of this
                        Blakean ecology, there has also been concern about notions of authority and
                        that the many Blakes existing in print and digital media will confound what
                        is already confusing. Recent scholarship has addressed some of these
                        concerns. For example, Whitson and Whittacker see the proliferation of the
                        Blakean meme as a continuation of Blake’s own creative process, a process
                        that encourages collaboration and participation. Furthermore, the reception
                        of Blake from Gilchrist onward echoes the indeterminacy that Blake created
                        in his own illuminated books.<note place="foot">See, for example, Eaves
                            413-39 and Goode 115-37.</note> The <ref target="blakearchive.org">William Blake Archive</ref> has done much to ease scholarly anxiety
                        about Blakean indeterminacy, providing as many digital copies of the
                        illuminated books as are available, yet the abundance of critical editions
                        of Blake’s poetry and prose and the wealth of secondary criticism
                        problematizes notions of scholarly authority and textual stability.<note place="foot">There are various editions of Blake’s verbal and visual
                            work, from different publishers, all with different editorial agendas.
                            For example, in addition to David V. Erdman’s standard reference work:
                                <title level="m">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William

                        For undergraduate students engaging with Blake and his illuminated books for
                        the first time, such a disparate and growing corpus of work can pose a
                        significant challenge to negotiate.</p>
                  <p>In an attempt to cultivate student engagement with Blake’s illuminated books
                        via the digital environment, we developed an assignment that leveraged one
                        specific and popular component of the Blakean ecosystem: Wikipedia. Drawing
                        on the assignment model developed by the <ref target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_program">Wikipedia Education Program</ref>, our students investigated the
                        complexities of scholarly discourse for one unique collection of Blake’s
                        poems, synthesizing arguments from a variety of methodological approaches.
                        Additionally, as contributors to the larger digital humanities efforts
                        around Blake, our Wikipedia assignment allowed students an intervention in
                        how the public received Blake scholarship. </p>
                  <p>In two undergraduate courses focusing on British poetry, during the Fall 2013
                        and Spring 2015 semesters, we asked students to create Wikipedia articles
                        about poems in Blake’s most accessible illuminated book: <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>. As digital humanists, we
                        also wanted students to contribute to a public resource that wouldn’t
                        require significant curatorial investment that they weren’t trained for or
                        the development of a strict process of editorial oversight, yet would
                        require them to navigate the large, disparate corpus of secondary print and
                        digital scholarship on Blake. Wikipedia provided that opportunity. There are
                        significant lacunae in Wikipedia’s coverage of Blake’s work; for instance,
                        before our assignments about half of the poems from <title level="m">Songs
                            of Innocence and of Experience</title> had no <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Innocence_and_of_Experience">Wikipedia articles</ref>, and those that were covered rarely explored
                        secondary criticism. For our student Wikipedia assignments, we asked our
                        students to fill those gaps. The remainder of this essay details our
                        implementation of Wikipedia article writing assignments and sets out some of
                        our missteps regarding implementing digital assignments. We discuss how the
                        exercise not only provided our students with different types of learning
                        opportunities, but also how such an assignment can become a tool for shaping
                        the public reception of Blake, Romanticism, and humanities knowledge more
                        generally.</p>

                  <p>Wikipedia afforded an opportunity to create a digitally inflected assignment
                        for our students that in turn facilitates public access to humanistic
                        inquiry about Blake. The seventh most visited site on the internet,
                        Wikipedia was founded in 2001 as an outgrowth of the web’s early open and
                        contributory culture, as an attempt to create “the sum of all human
                        knowledge” in a crowd-sourced, collaborative environment.<note place="foot">See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Purpose</note>
                        Educators often misunderstand the multiple layers of editorial work that
                        happens on the site. Once editors add content to Wikipedia, the core
                        volunteer community wrangles this massive contributory activity by following
                        the community's founding <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">five
                            pillars</ref> that include <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines">policies and community best practices</ref> and the ability to track
                        every editorial intervention through the software’s revision history
                        tracking. Three mutually dependent core content policies regulate all the
                        content in Wikipedia:</p>
                  <list type="ordered">
                     <item n="1">

                  </list>
                  <p>These policies encourage all content to be tied to a citation from secondary
                        or tertiary sources and for contributors to remain neutral by equally
                        representing all of the major reputable opinions about the topic. In effect,
                        articles that best meet community expectations become thorough literature
                        reviews, where nearly every sentence is yoked to an authoritative citation.
                        When meeting these standards, Wikipedia’s content effectively weighs
                        different interpretive strategies, producing thorough, historiographically
                        rich literature reviews (though in reality only a fraction of Wikipedia
                        articles successfully meets the community's expectations of quality
                            content).<note place="foot">Wadewitz and Stinson show that the articles
                            that the community assess as the best quality, represent the kinds
                            comparative approaches used in academic historiography. These articles
                            only represent a tiny fraction of the historical articles present on
                            Wikipedia (Wadewitz and Stinson).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The utility of Wikipedia as a citable source in research is a keen topic of
                        discussion among academics. As recently as five years ago, treatment of
                        Wikipedia ranged from confusion and distrust to outright contempt, with one
                        observer describing Wikipedia as “scrappy, chaotic, dilettantish,
                        amateurish” (Glieck 380-81). For many critics, “the ability of users to add
                        and edit Wikipedia pages at will” is the resource’s most distinguishing
                        characteristic (Leitch 59). The democratization of knowledge production
                        inherent in the development of Web 2.0, and best embodied by Wikipedia,
                        allows any and all users to create and publish content electronically
                        without the supervisory presence of traditional loci of authority. This
                        decentering of authority not only destabilizes traditional conceptions of
                        knowledge production and dissemination but also raises issues regarding what
                        types of knowledge are suitable for scholarly consumption. For some of the
                        more forceful critics of Wikipedia, the outsourcing of knowledge production
                        results in a “truth by consensus” ethic and is akin to “the blind leading
                        the blind—infinite monkeys providing infinite information for infinite
                        readers, perpetuating the cycle of misinformation and ignorance” (Keen 4). </p>
                  <p>Despite the weaknesses created by this approach to knowledge production, the
                        scale and good faith of most contributions to Wikipedia has created an
                        indispensable digital resource. Wikipedia’s ubiquity and comprehensiveness
                        in many public topics has led to it becoming a common starting point (and
                        occasionally a source for citation). Effective use of Wikipedia as a
                        research tool and critical awareness of its process are, however, skills
                        sorely needed amongst undergraduates.<note place="foot">As a recent
                            undergraduate study found at Rutgers University, most students didn’t
                            use the references at the bottom of the article to start their research
                            into quality, but had a tendency to stop after reading the article and
                            search Google again (Todorinova 201-12).</note> To spread Wikipedia
                        literacy and create public-oriented scholars, a number of communities have
                        opted to have their students write Wikipedia articles. Major academic
                        associations, like the Association for Psychological Science, have been
                        encouraging students to improve their digital literacy by using Wikipedia to
                        create more authoritative public entry points for topics important to their
                            field.<note place="foot">See Farzan and Kraus. For information about
                            associations with Wikipedia editing initiatives, see <ref target="http://wikiedu.org/partnerships/">http://wikiedu.org/partnerships/</ref>.</note> This process also
                        gives students the opportunity to witness and partake in the construction of
                        Wikipedia’s knowledge base so as to be better able to reflect critically on
                        Wikipedia as a platform for synthesizing <emph>a priori</emph> knowledge and
                        the process by which authoritative sources of knowledge are created. As a
                        participant in a <ref target="https://www.k-state.edu/digitalhumanities/symposium/schedule.html">Teaching with Wikipedia</ref> workshop we hosted at Kansas State
                        University in Spring 2015 observed, ‘Wikipedia assignments highlight the
                        need for students to see how the knowledge sausage is made, so that they’re
                        careful about which sausage they consume.’</p>

                  <head>Wikipedia as Academic Practice Space</head>
                  <p>Having students contribute to Wikipedia requires an initial process of
                        acclimatization. For instance, we introduced our students to Wikipedia’s
                        community of practice expectations and then monitored them as they explored
                        this new and unfamiliar environment. Members of the Wikipedia community have
                        long recognized the challenges facing new contributors. Since 2010 the <ref target="https://wikimediafoundation.org">Wikimedia Foundation</ref>, the
                        nonprofit that undergirds the community and technology that Wikipedia runs
                        on, has supported a global Wikipedia Education Program that provides best
                        practices and tools to ease the learning curve of creating such
                            assignments.<note place="foot">For more, see Wadewitz, Geller, and
                            Beasley-Murray. </note> This framework has supported thousands of
                        classes globally, and, since 2013 additional resources, including mentoring
                        and assignment design support, have been available for educators in the
                        United States and Canada through a sister non-profit the <ref target="https://wikiedu.org/about-us/">Wiki Education Foundation</ref>.
                        Among the resources produced are <ref target="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education/Resources">instructional booklets for classroom instruction, targeted disciplinary
                            best practices and sample assignment guides</ref>. </p>
                  <p>Most assignments where students create Wikipedia articles capitalize on how
                        Wikipedia’s core content policies closely mirror the kinds of expectations
                        placed on student work for annotated bibliographies or literature reviews.
                        Wikipedia’s framework for creating and editing content actually trains
                        students in skillsets that humanities undergraduates often need to learn.
                        Humanities classrooms, particularly literature courses, tend to emphasize
                        original interpretation and students are often not taught scholarly
                        assessment skills until graduate school. As Thomas Leitch notes when talking
                        about the relationship between the kinds of knowledge mastery and that
                        emphasized by traditional canon-based learning in the field of English, the
                        ability to assess and compare original research, a literacy of secondary
                        sources, is missing from both academia and Web 2.0. Leitch goes on to claim
                        that “the more critical relationship between literature and literacy [is]
                        that a close consideration of Web 2.0 could foster seems essential to the
                        revitalizing, perhaps to the survival, of English studies and liberal
                        education generally” (Leitch 80). </p>
                  <p>We see our Wikipedia assignments providing, in part, a much-needed critical
                        space for our students to become better recognizers, assessors, and
                        communicators of the knowledge and skills they acquire in digitally
                        inflected humanities classes. Having students practice writing and research
                        on Wikipedia gives them the opportunity to investigate the complex layers of
                        secondary criticism that creates the academy’s authoritative knowledge base.
                        There is also an additional benefit: in developing and honing their digital
                        literacy, our students were concomitantly transforming Wikipedia’s
                        representation of Blake’s poems for casual readers, students, and
                        researchers, highlighting multiple contrasting readings of <ref target="https://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=songsie&amp;java=no">

                  <p>For those not familiar with assigning Wikipedia article writing in the
                        classroom, we would strongly recommend the use of materials provided by the

                        staff maintain these resources with the help of faculty and volunteers
                        experienced in running such assignments. The design wizard and standard
                        documentation of assignments have activities and staged assignment deadlines
                        that can be used in an eight to twelve week writing assignment akin to a
                        literature review or essay rubric used in upper division undergraduate or
                        graduate classes. These resources guide instructors and students through
                        selecting topics, developing familiarity with Wikipedia’s community of
                        practice, student research, engagement with library support, student peer
                        review, and final assessment projects. These materials are, however,
                        limiting because they require the Wikipedia assignment to be the core
                        written assignment of the semester. For our use of the Wikipedia assignment
                        model, we opted to modify the sample syllabus because we needed to include
                        other forms of written assessment, including poetry analysis. We created a
                        four to six week assignment that included using four evenly spaced “gates”
                        corresponding to the specific tasks we wanted to the students to undertake
                        and to focus the students on the Student Learning Objectives (SLOs) for the
                        course. The core SLOs for both courses are as follows: <list type="ordered">

                        The class consisted entirely of non-English majors, and we offered the
                        Wikipedia assignment as an alternative to a standard literature review. Ten
                        students out of twenty opted for the Wikipedia assignment and were grouped
                        in pairs and self-selected one of the following poems from Blake’s <title level="m">Songs of Innocence</title>: “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Boy_Lost">The Little
                            Boy Lost</ref>,” “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Boy_Found">The Little

                        assignment lasted six weeks. </p>

                  <p>The teamwork approach to writing the articles created a range in quality
                        according to Wikipedia’s taxonomy of quality (see Fig. 3).<note place="foot">Quality assessment is based on Wikipedia’s Quality scale, which goes
                            “Stub” (short, no or few sources), “Start” (few sources, basic coverage
                            of several main points), C (Significant Coverage, not exhaustive, some
                            problems), “B” (Significant Coverage, near exhaustive, not peer
                            reviewed) and GA and FA (Peer reviewed, top quality articles). For the
                            scheme, see the assessment criteria at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment</ref>.
                            Also, see Fig 3 above.</note> Three of the student articles, “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Boy_Lost">The Little
                            Boy Lost</ref>,” “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Boy_Found">The Little
                            Boy Found</ref>,” and “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_(Blake)">Night</ref>”
                        achieved Wikipedia’s C class of article assessment containing decent prose,
                        covering the main topical areas, and citing reliable sources. The other two
                        articles didn’t reach this standard. Instead, the students provided adequate
                        summaries of the poem, its structure, and a good textual foundation for
                        future article expansion, yet experienced some difficulty in finding
                        secondary research on the poems and so failed to meet <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment/Start-Class_criteria">Wikipedia’s Start Class Quality Assessment</ref> threshold. </p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Despite the variable quality, all of the articles have reached the top of
                        Google searches that return other commentary on the poems.<note place="foot">“The Little Boy Lost,” “The Little Boy Found” and “Laughing Song” all
                            show up with just title searches; both “Night” and “Spring” need Blake's
                            name to be in the search string.</note> In many teaching environments,
                        high visibility of student work can be a key motivator for encouraging
                        students to create high quality content: student work no longer dies at the
                        end of the semester, but rather has a lasting public impact. In one month,
                        the student articles had 1538 views (or an average 256 views per page),
                        reaching more readers in thirty days than many scholarly articles ever will,
                        even though their contributions don’t all meet Wikipedia’s own high quality
                        standards. After a year and a half, when the articles were able to increase
                        their position on Google, that average increased to 418 views, or a 60%
                        increase. Clearly there was a latent public demand for information about
                        these poems, when almost every month has that level of traffic. Moreover,
                        the student work fills omissions on Blake not previously addressed by
                        Wikipedia editors; in subsequent student work on the articles, only two of
                        the articles have been revised: “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Boy_Lost">The Little
                            Boy Lost</ref>” denuded superfluous background material related to Blake
                        and gained a gallery of images<note place="foot">See the Wikipedia

                        The other three articles, however, remain largely the same, a lasting legacy
                        of our students’ work that semester. Table 1 (below) offers a statistical
                        overview for the Wikipedia articles on Blake’s poems that the students
                        created for the first assignment.</p>

                  <p>After the first assignment, we realized that the quality of our students’
                        articles could be improved. When modifying the <ref target="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education">Wikipedia’s
                            Education Program’s model</ref> for the assignment, we chose to omit the
                        following elements: ensuring that peer review and meeting the “gates” were
                        graded; building in early research support for non-English-major students;
                        and placing more emphasis on quality rather than completion in the grading
                        rubric. While meeting the core SLOs for the poetry course, the articles
                        produced for the first iteration of the assignment may not impact public
                        Blake knowledge as strongly as they could and students didn’t get as
                        thorough an immersion in scholarship as we had intended.</p>

                  <p>Learning from our earlier experiences, we chose to run the next iteration of
                        the assignment in an upper-division British Literature class during Spring
                        2015. We made several revisions to the first iteration of the assignment.
                        Rather than have students write articles collaboratively, we assigned one
                        article per student and provided <ref target="https://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/bibliography.xq?b=specific&amp;targ_div=d1">a bibliography of secondary sources</ref>. We also shortened the
                        deadline to four weeks. We found that these changes, plus running the
                        assignment with a group of English majors, created a much better outcome for
                        the students and their contributions. Our students wrote most of the
                        remaining missing articles on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Innocence_and_of_Experience">
                        <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of
                        Experience</title>
                     </ref>, creating, on average, higher quality articles. The
                        best indicators for this improvement are the number and types of secondary
                        sources the students referenced in the articles and Wikipedia article
                        quality. But, in some respects, these are superficial indicators. “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_Boy">The School
                            Boy</ref>,” for instance, didn’t summarize all eleven of its sources,
                        instead relying on three while providing the others for future researchers
                        as a “Further reading,” whereas other articles like “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Girl_Lost">The Little
                            Girl Lost</ref>” do exemplary jobs focusing on the nuance of the three
                        scholarly interpretations. </p>
                  <p>With this iteration of the assignment, the students consistently added
                        greater publicly valuable content, with nuanced summaries of critical
                        readings of the poems. Thus far, except for some formatting and consistency
                        changes made by Alex Stinson and other Wikipedia editors, there have been no
                        significant revisions or changes to the articles. Table 2 (below) offers a
                        statistical overview for the Wikipedia articles on Blake’s poems that the
                        students created for the second version of our Wikipedia assignment.</p>

                  <p>For the second version of the assignment we also asked students to complete a
                        survey that contributed to their grade upon completion. In general, student
                        responses to the survey suggest that the assignment led to a new literacy
                        about how Wikipedia works: six of the students used Wikipedia weekly before
                        the assignment, yet only two of the students knew that they could edit prior
                        to the assignment. In an open-ended question about what they learned, almost
                        every student mentioned having a new understanding of what's “going on
                        behind the scenes in Wikipedia” with most of the students making reference
                        to Wikipedia’s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</ref> policy. Only two of the respondents had technical
                        concerns with editing Wikipedia.</p>
                  <p>When asked about difficulties of the assignment, students felt most
                        challenged by the research process required in creating Wikipedia articles.
                        Several of the responses mention a degree of nervousness about putting their
                        “best work” forward for Wikipedia and a public audience. In turn, the
                        challenge of doing research and having quality material available to the
                        public prompted students to consider who uses this information. Every
                        respondent answered questions about the impact of public spaces like
                        Wikipedia on poetry readers optimistically, hoping that they could make it
                        easier for new readers of poetry (including students like themselves) to
                        understand poems.<note place="foot">We asked, “What do you think is the role
                            of poetry in public digital spaces like Wikipedia? How important is it
                            to share academic knowledge about poetry with the public?”</note> For
                        six of the students, this was the first humanities course where they had
                        been asked to communicate to an audience beyond the instructor or their
                        classmates. As a skills-focused assignment, the research portion appears to
                        have developed their understanding and engagement with scholarly criticism
                        as well as prompted them to think critically about their own readers. In
                        terms of a public audience, we asked our students to consider the near
                        impossible: all potential global users of Wikipedia. Yet, with the
                        parameters set out by the Wikipedia editorial policy, specifically the
                        neutrality and citation requirements, students had clear editorial
                        guidelines to shape their respective public interventions in the Blakean
                        ecosystem. Furthermore, as users of Wikipedia prior to our classes, the
                        students were alert to the significance and relevancy of their assignments
                        as high-traffic gateways to other sources of knowledge about Blake. </p>

                  <head>Imagining Wikipedia Assignments Creating a Public entry to Romanticism </head>
                  <p>Overall, we found both iterations of the assignment to be successful, but we
                        also found ourselves questioning whether our two Wikipedia assignments
                        provided a suitable environment for students to engage with Blake’s creative
                        output. Part of Wikipedia’s radical vision of “anyone can edit” is
                        acknowledging that when you aren’t commissioning work from authorities (as
                        with traditional academic collections) much of the work is going to
                        incomplete or imperfect, especially in the first version. Thus, Wikipedia
                        is, and always will be, a “<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_work_in_progress">work in progress</ref>.” For a Wikipedia article, no scholarly
                        imperative demands the student work meet the <emph>best</emph> accuracy,
                        precision, and comprehensiveness of content; rather these concerns are ceded
                        to the community of practice supporting Wikipedia, and to the many voices
                        and eyes that edit it. Therefore, as assessors of student work, we didn’t
                        have an obligation to spend additional time increasing precision and
                        comprehensiveness of student work, rather we could focus on assessment and
                        teaching competencies. As long as our students created <emph>better
                        </emph>content than was previously on Wikipedia, and they provided citations
                        to authoritative secondary sources where the public can learn more about
                        Blake, the students created a <emph>better</emph> public portal to the poems
                        than the SparkNotes or GradeSaver type websites that tend to dominate Google
                        searches when Wikipedia articles aren’t present. Additionally, while the
                        articles created by our students were all outside the top echelon of
                        Wikipedia’s taxonomy of quality (fig. 3), the assignment nevertheless
                        satisfied the SLOs for our courses. From the first iteration of the
                        assignment it was apparent that Wikipedia’s highest standards of quality
                            <emph>exceeded</emph> expectations typically placed on undergraduates
                        for literature review assignments. </p>
                  <p>As we continue to develop our Wikipedia assignment and other scholars
                        implement similar assignments, we’ll witness the creation of more content
                        and its continuous improvement with articles becoming even better (if not
                        the <emph>best</emph>) representation of the authoritative knowledge
                        available on the internet about these poems. Wikipedia’s dominance on search
                        engines and in the public’s research practices allows us to leverage student
                        work to create a public representation of our field and guarantees the
                        students’ work reaches a large public audience. Digital student projects on
                        blogs and other digital humanities sites could never guarantee this kind of
                        public impact.</p>
                  <p>Both iterations of our Wikipedia assignment enabled students to create
                        critical gateways for public understanding of the humanities. The missing
                        articles and cursory coverage that we filled with our assignments exist in a
                        number of important literary subjects ranging from gaps in obscure or
                        eclectic areas with limited public interest, to some of the most
                        well-researched authors and topics in Romanticism. For example, there are
                        crucial gaps in many Romantic-period writers, including <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Hemans">Felicia
                            Hemans</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Turner_Smith">Charlotte
                            Smith</ref>. While Hemans has a Start Class rating and Smith a C Class
                        quality rating according to Wikipedia’s taxonomy of quality, as of October
                        30, 2015 there are <emph>no</emph> articles on their literary works. In
                        addition to these significant topical gaps, humanities on Wikipedia
                        frequently suffers from a form of knowledge popularism: the more popular the
                        subject, the more contributors write into the Wikipedia articles, while key
                        critical concerns are missed. </p>
                  <p>The seeming lack of scholarly rigor often evident in Wikipedia humanities
                        topics should not prevent scholars and students from using the platform to
                        communicate humanities topics to a public beyond the academy. There are
                        thousands of students in literature classrooms around the globe that can
                        fill the knowledge gaps in Wikipedia while providing a degree of scholarly
                        rigor. Wikipedia offers a collaborative space where scholars and their
                        students can actualize the Romantic ideal of bettering society through
                        enriching minds, providing a ready-made framework for exposing the public to
                        the complexities of scholarly discourse and encouraging them to participate
                        in knowledge production. With these two Wikipedia assignments, our students
                        became part of a broader Wikipedia community that shares an interest in
                        researching and disseminating the best knowledge to the public.</p>
