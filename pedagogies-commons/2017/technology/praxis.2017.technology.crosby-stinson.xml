            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount"> When teaching British Romanticism, cultivating student interest
                    in the material often requires the educator to explain the relevance of texts
                    that for many seem historically and linguistically remote. One way to help
                    facilitate student engagement is to ask them to investigate the public impacts
                    of the assigned texts and communicate those impacts to a public audience.
                    Digital humanists often turn to established digital humanities projects or blogs
                    to provide students a platform for this kind of work; however, we trialed using
                    a public resource that didn’t require a curatorial investment or the development
                    of strict editorial oversight. Wikipedia provided that opportunity: despite
                    nearly 4.9 million articles and one of the most visited sites on the web, there
                    are a number of gaps in Wikipedia’s coverage of British Romantic literature,
                    including coverage of William Blake’s most taught collection of poems: <title
                        level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>. For a series of
                    coursework assignments on Romantic poetry, we asked students to fill those gaps.
                    This essay details our implementation of Wikipedia article writing assignments
                    over two semesters of a British Romantic poetry class, including both the
                    digital pedagogy and design concerns shaping the assignment. We explore some of
                    the missteps regarding the implementation of digital assignments and discuss how
                    the experience not only provided our students with different types of learning
                    opportunities, but also how such an assignment can become a tool for shaping the
                    public reception of Blake, Romanticism, and humanities knowledge more generally.

                    <p>Teaching British Romanticism to undergraduate literature majors and
                        non-majors often necessitates an introductory discussion about the relevance
                        of texts that may seem historically and linguistically remote. One way to
                        facilitate student engagement is to ask them to investigate the public
                        impacts of the assigned texts and to communicate their importance to a
                        public audience. Digital humanists often turn to out of the box tools like

                        don’t have the time or resources to create their own digital projects or to
                        supervise the creation of student-led digital projects, we suggest adapting
                        and incorporating student Wikipedia assignments. </p>
                    <p>Wikipedia provides the ideal platform to encourage students to develop
                        editorial responsibility over the creation and publication of knowledge. The
                        website is a high-traffic and globally conspicuous public repository of
                        knowledge that expands in a user-generated, public-facing model that many
                        Romantic-period writers would perhaps have appreciated. For every Wikipedia
                        article created there is a step-by-step archiving process that creates a
                        self-reflective repository ripe for tracing the development and the
                        production of knowledge. Just as William Blake used printing technologies as
                        a testing ground for the expression of his creativity, experimenting with
                        etching and engraving techniques to develop his illuminated printing
                        process, student Wikipedia assignments can be used as a testing ground for
                        collaborative editorial expression (McGann 57). </p>
                    <p>Despite housing nearly 4.9 million articles and being one of the most visited
                        sites on the web, there are many gaps in Wikipedia’s coverage of British
                        Romantic literature, including coverage of Blake’s most taught collection of
                        poems: <title level="m">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>. For a
                        series of undergraduate Wikipedia assignments, we asked our students to fill
                        in those gaps and imagine the broader arguments around Romantic literature.
                        We introduced them to the sort of conversation communities that have become
                        a hallmark of recent literary pedagogy. By using Blake and his illuminated
                        poetry as the focus of our Wikipedia assignments, we also challenged
                        students to navigate a complex, rapidly expanding print and digital
                        ecosystem that is, as recent critics have observed, “collaborative and
                        participatory” (Whitson and Whittacker 51).</p>

                    <head>The Blakean Ecosystem</head>
                    <p>During the last 150 years, Blake’s eclectic, experimental creative output has
                        been accessible to a much larger audience than during his own lifetime.
                        Despite the prophetic exhortations of his illuminated books, Blake was a
                        poet/artist with a limited readership. Alexander Gilchrist’s biography of
                        Blake (1863) and W.B. Yeats and Edwin J. Ellis’ edition of Blake’s poetry
                        (1893) did much to establish a broader audience, and by the mid-twentieth
                        century Blake was accorded canonical status. Transcending the academy, Blake
                        is a cultural mainstay for groups as diverse as the British Women’s
                        Institute, the Beat poets, and the far-right British National Party.<note

                        grown to the point that Roger Whitson and Jason Whittacker consider that

                            >Flickr</ref>, Blake “is a true mass media phenomenon” (Whitson and
                        Whittacker 24, 138-61). If we consider Blake’s presence on Wikipedia, for
                        instance, we see that in 2013 users made “about 5,477” editorial revisions
                        to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake">William
                            Blake Wikipedia page</ref> (Whitson and Whittacker 142). By July 13,
                        2015, the Blake Wikipedia page had 6,402 editorial revisions, an increase of
                        927 edits.<note place="foot">Retrieved using User:Hedonil’s XTools gadget

                    <p>Blake’s place in the cultural zeitgeist coupled with library shelves
                        straining under the ever-increasing weight of critical editions, facsimiles,
                        and critical analysis, as well as an array of digital resources (from
                        archival sites such as the <ref target="http://www.blakearchive.org">William

                        of Blake are often confronted by a bewildering array of different versions
                        of Blake’s works accompanied by a daunting mountain of commentary,
                        accessible in numerous formats and on multiple platforms. </p>
                    <p>While this material about Blake continues to increase, creating an ecology of
                        print and electronic resources about and influenced by Blake, we have to
                        remember that the many “Blakes” that constitute this ecology aren’t
                        necessarily representative of the same William Blake, poet, painter, and
                        printmaker. Transferring Blake’s illuminated books to other formats
                        necessitates some form of loss for, as Wayne C. Ripley observes, to
                        translate a work “to a new medium . . . irrevocably changes its form,
                        context, circulation, and meaning” (Ripley para. 5). With the growth of this
                        Blakean ecology, there has also been concern about notions of authority and
                        that the many Blakes existing in print and digital media will confound what
                        is already confusing. Recent scholarship has addressed some of these
                        concerns. For example, Whitson and Whittacker see the proliferation of the
                        Blakean meme as a continuation of Blake’s own creative process, a process
                        that encourages collaboration and participation. Furthermore, the reception
                        of Blake from Gilchrist onward echoes the indeterminacy that Blake created
                        in his own illuminated books.<note place="foot">See, for example, Eaves

                            >William Blake Archive</ref> has done much to ease scholarly anxiety
                        about Blakean indeterminacy, providing as many digital copies of the
                        illuminated books as are available, yet the abundance of critical editions
                        of Blake’s poetry and prose and the wealth of secondary criticism
                        problematizes notions of scholarly authority and textual stability.<note
                            place="foot">There are various editions of Blake’s verbal and visual

                        For undergraduate students engaging with Blake and his illuminated books for
                        the first time, such a disparate and growing corpus of work can pose a
                        significant challenge to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>In an attempt to cultivate student engagement with Blake’s illuminated books
                        via the digital environment, we developed an assignment that leveraged one
                        specific and popular component of the Blakean ecosystem: Wikipedia. Drawing
                        on the assignment model developed by the <ref
                            target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_program"
                            >Wikipedia Education Program</ref>, our students investigated the
                        complexities of scholarly discourse for one unique collection of Blake’s
                        poems, synthesizing arguments from a variety of methodological approaches.
                        Additionally, as contributors to the larger digital humanities efforts
                        around Blake, our Wikipedia assignment allowed students an intervention in
                        how the public received Blake scholarship. </p>
                    <p>In two undergraduate courses focusing on British poetry, during the Fall 2013
                        and Spring 2015 semesters, we asked students to create Wikipedia articles
                        about poems in Blake’s most accessible illuminated book: <title level="m"
                            >Songs of Innocence and of Experience</title>. As digital humanists, we
                        also wanted students to contribute to a public resource that wouldn’t
                        require significant curatorial investment that they weren’t trained for or
                        the development of a strict process of editorial oversight, yet would
                        require them to navigate the large, disparate corpus of secondary print and
                        digital scholarship on Blake. Wikipedia provided that opportunity. There are
                        significant lacunae in Wikipedia’s coverage of Blake’s work; for instance,
                        before our assignments about half of the poems from <title level="m">Songs
                            of Innocence and of Experience</title> had no <ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Innocence_and_of_Experience"
                            >Wikipedia articles</ref>, and those that were covered rarely explored
                        secondary criticism. For our student Wikipedia assignments, we asked our
                        students to fill those gaps. The remainder of this essay details our
                        implementation of Wikipedia article writing assignments and sets out some of
                        our missteps regarding implementing digital assignments. We discuss how the
                        exercise not only provided our students with different types of learning
                        opportunities, but also how such an assignment can become a tool for shaping
                        the public reception of Blake, Romanticism, and humanities knowledge more
                        generally.</p>

                        for our students that in turn facilitates public access to humanistic

                        articles that best meet community expectations become thorough literature
                        reviews, where nearly every sentence is yoked to an authoritative citation.
                        When meeting these standards, Wikipedia’s content effectively weighs
                        different interpretive strategies, producing thorough, historiographically
                        rich literature reviews (though in reality only a fraction of Wikipedia

                    </p>
                    <p>The utility of Wikipedia as a citable source in research is a keen topic of
                        discussion among academics. As recently as five years ago, treatment of
                        Wikipedia ranged from confusion and distrust to outright contempt, with one
                        observer describing Wikipedia as “scrappy, chaotic, dilettantish,
                        amateurish” (Glieck 380-81). For many critics, “the ability of users to add
                        and edit Wikipedia pages at will” is the resource’s most distinguishing
                        characteristic (Leitch 59). The democratization of knowledge production
                        inherent in the development of Web 2.0, and best embodied by Wikipedia,
                        allows any and all users to create and publish content electronically
                        without the supervisory presence of traditional loci of authority. This
                        decentering of authority not only destabilizes traditional conceptions of
                        knowledge production and dissemination but also raises issues regarding what
                        types of knowledge are suitable for scholarly consumption. For some of the
                        more forceful critics of Wikipedia, the outsourcing of knowledge production
                        results in a “truth by consensus” ethic and is akin to “the blind leading
                        the blind—infinite monkeys providing infinite information for infinite
                        readers, perpetuating the cycle of misinformation and ignorance” (Keen 4). </p>
                    <p>Despite the weaknesses created by this approach to knowledge production, the
                        scale and good faith of most contributions to Wikipedia has created an
                        indispensable digital resource. Wikipedia’s ubiquity and comprehensiveness
                        in many public topics has led to it becoming a common starting point (and
                        occasionally a source for citation). Effective use of Wikipedia as a
                        research tool and critical awareness of its process are, however, skills
                        sorely needed amongst undergraduates.<note place="foot">As a recent
                            undergraduate study found at Rutgers University, most students didn’t
                            use the references at the bottom of the article to start their research
                            into quality, but had a tendency to stop after reading the article and
                            search Google again (Todorinova 201-12).</note> To spread Wikipedia
                        literacy and create public-oriented scholars, a number of communities have
                        opted to have their students write Wikipedia articles. Major academic
                        associations, like the Association for Psychological Science, have been
                        encouraging students to improve their digital literacy by using Wikipedia to
                        create more authoritative public entry points for topics important to their
                            field.<note place="foot">See Farzan and Kraus. For information about

                    <p>Most assignments where students create Wikipedia articles capitalize on how
                        Wikipedia’s core content policies closely mirror the kinds of expectations
                        placed on student work for annotated bibliographies or literature reviews.
                        Wikipedia’s framework for creating and editing content actually trains
                        students in skillsets that humanities undergraduates often need to learn.
                        Humanities classrooms, particularly literature courses, tend to emphasize
                        original interpretation and students are often not taught scholarly
                        assessment skills until graduate school. As Thomas Leitch notes when talking
                        about the relationship between the kinds of knowledge mastery and that
                        emphasized by traditional canon-based learning in the field of English, the
                        ability to assess and compare original research, a literacy of secondary
                        sources, is missing from both academia and Web 2.0. Leitch goes on to claim
                        that “the more critical relationship between literature and literacy [is]
                        that a close consideration of Web 2.0 could foster seems essential to the
                        revitalizing, perhaps to the survival, of English studies and liberal
                        education generally” (Leitch 80). </p>
                    <p>We see our Wikipedia assignments providing, in part, a much-needed critical
                        space for our students to become better recognizers, assessors, and
                        communicators of the knowledge and skills they acquire in digitally
                        inflected humanities classes. Having students practice writing and research
                        on Wikipedia gives them the opportunity to investigate the complex layers of
                        secondary criticism that creates the academy’s authoritative knowledge base.
                        There is also an additional benefit: in developing and honing their digital
                        literacy, our students were concomitantly transforming Wikipedia’s
                        representation of Blake’s poems for casual readers, students, and
                        researchers, highlighting multiple contrasting readings of <ref

                        staff maintain these resources with the help of faculty and volunteers
                        experienced in running such assignments. The design wizard and standard
                        documentation of assignments have activities and staged assignment deadlines
                        that can be used in an eight to twelve week writing assignment akin to a
                        literature review or essay rubric used in upper division undergraduate or
                        graduate classes. These resources guide instructors and students through
                        selecting topics, developing familiarity with Wikipedia’s community of
                        practice, student research, engagement with library support, student peer
                        review, and final assessment projects. These materials are, however,
                        limiting because they require the Wikipedia assignment to be the core
                        written assignment of the semester. For our use of the Wikipedia assignment
                        model, we opted to modify the sample syllabus because we needed to include
                        other forms of written assessment, including poetry analysis. We created a
                        four to six week assignment that included using four evenly spaced “gates”
                        corresponding to the specific tasks we wanted to the students to undertake
                        and to focus the students on the Student Learning Objectives (SLOs) for the
                        course. The core SLOs for both courses are as follows: <list type="ordered">
                            <item n="1">Demonstrate a detailed knowledge of poetry from the British
                                Romantic Period, including identifying the various formal properties
                                of these poems.</item>

                        The class consisted entirely of non-English majors, and we offered the
                        Wikipedia assignment as an alternative to a standard literature review. Ten
                        students out of twenty opted for the Wikipedia assignment and were grouped
                        in pairs and self-selected one of the following poems from Blake’s <title

                    <p>The teamwork approach to writing the articles created a range in quality

                            >Quality assessment is based on Wikipedia’s Quality scale, which goes
                            “Stub” (short, no or few sources), “Start” (few sources, basic coverage
                            of several main points), C (Significant Coverage, not exhaustive, some
                            problems), “B” (Significant Coverage, near exhaustive, not peer
                            reviewed) and GA and FA (Peer reviewed, top quality articles). For the
                            scheme, see the assessment criteria at <ref

                            Also, see Fig 3 above.</note> Three of the student articles, “<ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Boy_Lost">The Little
                            Boy Lost</ref>,” “<ref

                        achieved Wikipedia’s C class of article assessment containing decent prose,
                        covering the main topical areas, and citing reliable sources. The other two
                        articles didn’t reach this standard. Instead, the students provided adequate
                        summaries of the poem, its structure, and a good textual foundation for
                        future article expansion, yet experienced some difficulty in finding
                        secondary research on the poems and so failed to meet <ref

                            show up with just title searches; both “Night” and “Spring” need Blake's
                            name to be in the search string.</note> In many teaching environments,
                        high visibility of student work can be a key motivator for encouraging
                        students to create high quality content: student work no longer dies at the
                        end of the semester, but rather has a lasting public impact. In one month,
                        the student articles had 1538 views (or an average 256 views per page),
                        reaching more readers in thirty days than many scholarly articles ever will,
                        even though their contributions don’t all meet Wikipedia’s own high quality
                        standards. After a year and a half, when the articles were able to increase
                        their position on Google, that average increased to 418 views, or a 60%
                        increase. Clearly there was a latent public demand for information about
                        these poems, when almost every month has that level of traffic. Moreover,
                        the student work fills omissions on Blake not previously addressed by
                        Wikipedia editors; in subsequent student work on the articles, only two of
                        the articles have been revised: “<ref

                    <p>After the first assignment, we realized that the quality of our students’
                        articles could be improved. When modifying the <ref
                            target="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education">Wikipedia’s
                            Education Program’s model</ref> for the assignment, we chose to omit the
                        following elements: ensuring that peer review and meeting the “gates” were
                        graded; building in early research support for non-English-major students;
                        and placing more emphasis on quality rather than completion in the grading
                        rubric. While meeting the core SLOs for the poetry course, the articles
                        produced for the first iteration of the assignment may not impact public
                        Blake knowledge as strongly as they could and students didn’t get as
                        thorough an immersion in scholarship as we had intended.</p>

                    <p>Learning from our earlier experiences, we chose to run the next iteration of
                        the assignment in an upper-division British Literature class during Spring
                        2015. We made several revisions to the first iteration of the assignment.
                        Rather than have students write articles collaboratively, we assigned one
                        article per student and provided <ref
                            target="https://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/bibliography.xq?b=specific&amp;targ_div=d1"
                            >a bibliography of secondary sources</ref>. We also shortened the
                        deadline to four weeks. We found that these changes, plus running the
                        assignment with a group of English majors, created a much better outcome for
                        the students and their contributions. Our students wrote most of the
                        remaining missing articles on <ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Innocence_and_of_Experience"

                        Experience</title></ref>, creating, on average, higher quality articles. The
                        best indicators for this improvement are the number and types of secondary
                        sources the students referenced in the articles and Wikipedia article
                        quality. But, in some respects, these are superficial indicators. “<ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_Boy">The School
                            Boy</ref>,” for instance, didn’t summarize all eleven of its sources,
                        instead relying on three while providing the others for future researchers
                        as a “Further reading,” whereas other articles like “<ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Girl_Lost">The Little
                            Girl Lost</ref>” do exemplary jobs focusing on the nuance of the three
                        scholarly interpretations. </p>
                    <p>With this iteration of the assignment, the students consistently added
                        greater publicly valuable content, with nuanced summaries of critical
                        readings of the poems. Thus far, except for some formatting and consistency
                        changes made by Alex Stinson and other Wikipedia editors, there have been no
                        significant revisions or changes to the articles. Table 2 (below) offers a
                        statistical overview for the Wikipedia articles on Blake’s poems that the
                        students created for the second version of our Wikipedia assignment.</p>

                    <p>For the second version of the assignment we also asked students to complete a
                        survey that contributed to their grade upon completion. In general, student
                        responses to the survey suggest that the assignment led to a new literacy
                        about how Wikipedia works: six of the students used Wikipedia weekly before
                        the assignment, yet only two of the students knew that they could edit prior
                        to the assignment. In an open-ended question about what they learned, almost
                        every student mentioned having a new understanding of what's “going on
                        behind the scenes in Wikipedia” with most of the students making reference
                        to Wikipedia’s <ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability"
                            >Verifiability</ref> policy. Only two of the respondents had technical
                        concerns with editing Wikipedia.</p>
                    <p>When asked about difficulties of the assignment, students felt most
                        challenged by the research process required in creating Wikipedia articles.
                        Several of the responses mention a degree of nervousness about putting their
                        “best work” forward for Wikipedia and a public audience. In turn, the
                        challenge of doing research and having quality material available to the
                        public prompted students to consider who uses this information. Every
                        respondent answered questions about the impact of public spaces like
                        Wikipedia on poetry readers optimistically, hoping that they could make it
                        easier for new readers of poetry (including students like themselves) to
                        understand poems.<note place="foot">We asked, “What do you think is the role
                            of poetry in public digital spaces like Wikipedia? How important is it
                            to share academic knowledge about poetry with the public?”</note> For
                        six of the students, this was the first humanities course where they had
                        been asked to communicate to an audience beyond the instructor or their
                        classmates. As a skills-focused assignment, the research portion appears to
                        have developed their understanding and engagement with scholarly criticism
                        as well as prompted them to think critically about their own readers. In
                        terms of a public audience, we asked our students to consider the near
                        impossible: all potential global users of Wikipedia. Yet, with the
                        parameters set out by the Wikipedia editorial policy, specifically the
                        neutrality and citation requirements, students had clear editorial
                        guidelines to shape their respective public interventions in the Blakean
                        ecosystem. Furthermore, as users of Wikipedia prior to our classes, the
                        students were alert to the significance and relevancy of their assignments
                        as high-traffic gateways to other sources of knowledge about Blake. </p>

                    <head>Imagining Wikipedia Assignments Creating a Public entry to Romanticism </head>
                    <p>Overall, we found both iterations of the assignment to be successful, but we
                        also found ourselves questioning whether our two Wikipedia assignments
                        provided a suitable environment for students to engage with Blake’s creative
                        output. Part of Wikipedia’s radical vision of “anyone can edit” is
                        acknowledging that when you aren’t commissioning work from authorities (as
                        with traditional academic collections) much of the work is going to
                        incomplete or imperfect, especially in the first version. Thus, Wikipedia
                        is, and always will be, a “<ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_work_in_progress"
                            >work in progress</ref>.” For a Wikipedia article, no scholarly
                        imperative demands the student work meet the <emph>best</emph> accuracy,
                        precision, and comprehensiveness of content; rather these concerns are ceded
                        to the community of practice supporting Wikipedia, and to the many voices
                        and eyes that edit it. Therefore, as assessors of student work, we didn’t
                        have an obligation to spend additional time increasing precision and
                        comprehensiveness of student work, rather we could focus on assessment and
                        teaching competencies. As long as our students created <emph>better
                        </emph>content than was previously on Wikipedia, and they provided citations
                        to authoritative secondary sources where the public can learn more about
                        Blake, the students created a <emph>better</emph> public portal to the poems
                        than the SparkNotes or GradeSaver type websites that tend to dominate Google
                        searches when Wikipedia articles aren’t present. Additionally, while the
                        articles created by our students were all outside the top echelon of
                        Wikipedia’s taxonomy of quality (fig. 3), the assignment nevertheless
                        satisfied the SLOs for our courses. From the first iteration of the
                        assignment it was apparent that Wikipedia’s highest standards of quality
                            <emph>exceeded</emph> expectations typically placed on undergraduates
                        for literature review assignments. </p>
                    <p>As we continue to develop our Wikipedia assignment and other scholars
                        implement similar assignments, we’ll witness the creation of more content
                        and its continuous improvement with articles becoming even better (if not
                        the <emph>best</emph>) representation of the authoritative knowledge
                        available on the internet about these poems. Wikipedia’s dominance on search
                        engines and in the public’s research practices allows us to leverage student
                        work to create a public representation of our field and guarantees the
                        students’ work reaches a large public audience. Digital student projects on
                        blogs and other digital humanities sites could never guarantee this kind of
                        public impact.</p>
                    <p>Both iterations of our Wikipedia assignment enabled students to create
                        critical gateways for public understanding of the humanities. The missing
                        articles and cursory coverage that we filled with our assignments exist in a
                        number of important literary subjects ranging from gaps in obscure or
                        eclectic areas with limited public interest, to some of the most
                        well-researched authors and topics in Romanticism. For example, there are
                        crucial gaps in many Romantic-period writers, including <ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Hemans">Felicia
                            Hemans</ref> and <ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Turner_Smith">Charlotte
                            Smith</ref>. While Hemans has a Start Class rating and Smith a C Class
                        quality rating according to Wikipedia’s taxonomy of quality, as of October
                        30, 2015 there are <emph>no</emph> articles on their literary works. In
                        addition to these significant topical gaps, humanities on Wikipedia
                        frequently suffers from a form of knowledge popularism: the more popular the
                        subject, the more contributors write into the Wikipedia articles, while key
                        critical concerns are missed. </p>
                    <p>The seeming lack of scholarly rigor often evident in Wikipedia humanities
                        topics should not prevent scholars and students from using the platform to
                        communicate humanities topics to a public beyond the academy. There are
                        thousands of students in literature classrooms around the globe that can
                        fill the knowledge gaps in Wikipedia while providing a degree of scholarly
                        rigor. Wikipedia offers a collaborative space where scholars and their
                        students can actualize the Romantic ideal of bettering society through
                        enriching minds, providing a ready-made framework for exposing the public to
                        the complexities of scholarly discourse and encouraging them to participate
                        in knowledge production. With these two Wikipedia assignments, our students
                        became part of a broader Wikipedia community that shares an interest in
                        researching and disseminating the best knowledge to the public.</p>
