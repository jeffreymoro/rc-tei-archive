                              Whittier College (full citations above):Barkats, Nikolai. Clifford, Erica. Koffi,
                              Sara. Sanchéz, Elizabeth. Shephard, Terrileigh.</span></div>
                     </div> Upon entering the room, I will overhear discussions about how many, and which, Austen
                     novels students have already read. Another group, frequently the most spirited, will
                     be debating the relative merits of various film adaptations of the novels. Such rapport
                     among students derives from their shared enthusiasm for the topic, which in turn creates
                     an instant sense of community among many class members. Even those who are not fans
                     often find themselves invigorated by the happy anticipation of their peers. Because
                     of this, my central pedagogical question when teaching an Austen seminar becomes how
                     to enrich and support this peer-to-peer energy and make legible to students the ways
                     that Austen’s popularity reflects continuities, as well as differences, between the
                     sociality of the English country gentry and our own increasingly networked online
                     communities and identities.</p>
               </div>
               <p>By reading Austen as a member of a seminar that is also a peer-to-peer learning community,
                  students get to experience a twenty-first-century version of the social bonds that
                  structure relationships among Austen’s characters. This style of teaching, in which
                  digital and embodied experiential learning methods cross-fertilize each other as part
                  of a single, integrated approach, is my version of what Jesse Stommel and others term
                  “critical digital pedagogy:”</p>

               <p>This essay will describe a multi-modal, collaborative, project-based approach to teaching
                  Jane Austen’s novels through a focus on remixing and material history. Assignments
                  that engage students in collectively remixing Austen’s novels meld individual students
                  into a community, strengthening the classroom’s “little social commonwealth” by connecting
                  classroom and digital learning spaces in a single learning ecosystem (<em>Persuasion </em>31). Key elements of such project-based community-building include an ongoing, weekly
                  participant-creation assignment posted to Tumblr, a short exploration of textual materiality
                  connected to a close reading assignment focusing on historical word shifts, a physical
                  making assignment, and a student-led collaborative project that brings all class members
                  together into a participatory final experience. The choice of the social networking
                  site Tumblr as a central course platform has special resonance in an Austen classroom,
                  as a lively Austen fan community already exists on Tumblr. Through networking, reposting,
                  and remixing, students’ classwork thus organically becomes part of wider conversations
                  about Romantic-era culture among some of the many virtual communities of Austen’s
                  readers today. Transgressing distinctions between popular and scholarly reading communities
                  by sharing their classwork openly online in turn empowers undergraduate students to
                  realize that their own scholarship participates in, benefits from, and may eventually
                  even reshape the networks that characterize our current digital social commonwealths.</p>

               </div>
               <p>The backbone of my remixing approach to teaching Austen is a digital commonplace book
                  assignment that scaffolds student interaction throughout the course. A quick search
                  will turn up a number of useful models for commonplacing assignments in the literature
                  classroom. In <a class="link_ref" href="http://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2014/10/ThecommonplacebookSP14.pdf">a recent article</a> in the <em>Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em>, for example, Vimala Pasupath details an assignment using Pinterest to make visible
                  the labor and insights of close reading. Another <a class="link_ref" href="http://andrewgoldstone.com/teaching/lf2/common.html">assignment</a> by Andrew Goldstone sets up a single shared, password-protected Tumblr blog for the
                  whole class. My assignment asks students not only to build their own Tumblr blogs,
                  but also to follow and interact with class members’ blogs, extending educational discourse
                  beyond the campus. <a class="link_ref" href="http://olc.onlinelearningconsortium.org/conference/2015/et4online/perforating-classroom-how-hacking-online-game-tvsz-60-brings-together-facu">Elsewhere</a>, I’ve talked about this teaching approach as “perforating the classroom,” a term
                  to describe the value of teaching openly on the web rather than in the “walled” spaces
                  of learning management systems (LMS) like Moodle or Blackboard. Such LMSs have their
                  uses—to keep grades confidential, for example—but the fact that they are deliberately
                  isolated from the web reduces their utility both as tools for student lifelong learning
                  and as analogies to Romantic-era literary culture. My pedagogical approach highlights
                  connection—between students, between ideas, between historical periods, between Austen
                  and her readers, between elite and popular cultures, between technologies of reading.
                  As Juliette Wells argues in a recent <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/praxis/austen/pedagogies.commons.2015.wells.html">article</a>, I want to encourage my students to connect with Austen fandom and popular culture
                  as well as the many resources available online for scholarly study.</p>
               <p>On that note, I cannot fail to point out the wonderful resources and teaching ideas
                  in the recent <em>Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</em> special issue “<a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/commons/austen">Teaching Jane Austen</a>,” edited by Devoney Looser and Emily Friedman. One of the signal contributions of
                  this openly available journal issue is the “<a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/commons/austen/pedagogies.commons.2015.looserzarka.html">Annotated Bibliography on the Scholarship of Teaching Jane Austen</a>,” compiled by Emily Zarka and Devoney Looser. Annotated bibliographies like theirs
                  are scholarly versions of the kind of curation that my students undertook in their
                  commonplace books, and offer a useful touchstone for understanding the value of curation
                  as a social-intellectual practice that can yield networked scholarly communities in
                  this era of digital connectivity. This essay benefits from the resources, articles,
                  and ideas compiled by Looser and Friedman, and adds to them a critical digital pedagogy
                  approach to scaffolding a Jane Austen seminar which integrates both digital and embodied
                  learning.</p>
               <p>To foster such communal scholarship, I ask students to create digital commonplace
                  books in which they engage with other readers of Romantic-era literature via remixing
                  not only their own collection of quotations but also the bits of Austen culture online
                  that attract their interest. Tumblr, a free and open blogging platform, has the advantages
                  of being familiar to most students, very simple to use, and popular with a huge community
                  of users who regularly reblog media objects in a twenty-first century version of commonplacing.
                  Tumblr also has an active Austen fan population who share memes, movie references,
                  news about new games, products, travel opportunities, and so much more. Encouraging
                  students to interact with Austen fandom and popular culture for a class assignment
                  brings enormous energy into classroom discussions and challenges the unspoken barrier
                  between reading for pleasure and reading for class that so often frames academic discussions
                  of even the most beloved literary works. </p>
               <p>My commonplacing assignment was initially inspired by a blog post on a wonderful academic
                  blog titled <a class="link_ref" href="https://thisgaudygildedstage.wordpress.com/2007/09/24/teaching-with-commonplace-books/"><em>This Gaudy Gilded Stage</em></a>, and adapts categories and language from Patricia Taylor’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.academia.edu/9458734/Assignment_Guide_for_Finding_Paradise_Lost_">Electronic Commonplace Book</a> assignment as posted on the University of Connecticut freshman English blog in 2014.
                  The key requirements are that each student add three elements to their Tumblr blog
                  each week, that they tag their posts according to an organizational method that represents
                  their particular interests, that they follow each other’s blogs, that they design
                  their blogs according to their own taste, and that across the semester they include
                  a variety of different types of posts. Here is an excerpt from the assignment, which
                  enumerates various types of posts.</p>
               <p>Tumblr commonplace books must include at least one example of the following: </p>
               <ol>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e266">Important and/or interesting quotations from Austen’s novels,</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e267">Regular reposts of classmates’ posts, tagged according to the students’ own commonplacing
                     structure,</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e268">Summaries and/or quotations from scholarly or critical sources about Austen, 18th
                     and early 19th century material culture, domesticity, gender, class, empire, etc.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e269">Historical information on 18th and early 19th century issues relevant to Austen, including
                     period-appropriate maps, descriptions of southern England, and related information
                     about the places of Austen’s life and work.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e270">Popular culture appropriations of Austen (from any period). This can include artwork,
                     photos, YouTube videos, Web series, etc. Artwork or videos can be either created by
                     the student herself (bonus points!), or the work of others so long as it is properly
                     attributed. </li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e271">Music from the period.</li>
               </ol>
               <p> Other categories may include: </p>
               <ol>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e274">Silhouettes and other types of art from the period.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e275">Puzzles, charades, definitions of words whose meaning has changed, etc.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e276">Notes on how to throw a themed ball, set a table, make a recipe, play a period card
                     game, wear Regency-period clothing, etc.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e277">Quotations, ideas, or anything else relevant to the student’s interest in Austen and
                     her historical era.</li>
               </ol>
               <p>Students begin their commonplace books the first week of class after a brief introduction
                  to the Enlightenment intellectual practice of commonplacing, a tutorial on setting
                  up their Tumblr accounts, and, most importantly, a discussion about how they will
                  choose to craft their online identities for the course. Fortuitously, our class was
                  reading Austen’s early epistolary novella <em>Lady Susan </em>while we were also getting the Tumblr blogs launched, and so questions of rhetorical
                  stance, audience awareness, and reputation construction cross-pollinated our discussion
                  of both the novella and student choices about their own online identities for the
                  course. Students always enjoy reading the letters through which <span class="foreign">femme fatale</span> Lady Susan manipulates her daughter, her lover, her intended fiancé and others through
                  a carefully plotted rhetorical campaign. As a character, Lady Susan is unlike other
                  Austen protagonists in both class status and conduct, and may seem quite simplistically
                  wicked at first read. While discussing this novel, students consider how to craft
                  their own social media identities. The activity prompts students to think through
                  this plot crisis as an eighteenth-century version of what theorists of social media
                  today call “context collapse,” in which distinct audiences combine and create unexpected
                  (and often, unwanted) interpretations (boyd 31).</p>
               <p>Students’ increasing awareness of the wide implications, and often unforeseen consequences,
                  of their own social media self-expression sets the stage for a richly intercontextual
                  discussion of this first person epistolary fiction. Like Lady Susan, they realize
                  that their plans and hopes can be undermined if information intended for one audience
                  (photographs taken at college parties, for example) crosses over to other audiences
                  (future employers). While many students initially condemn Lady Susan, agreeing with
                  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg that “[h]aving two identities for yourself is an
                  example of a lack of integrity” (boyd 31), they quickly complicate this sentiment
                  when they consider their own online identity decisions. Social media “context collapse,”
                  which is especially prevalent on Facebook and other platforms that are part of the
                  “real name web,” is a useful analogy to help modern urban readers comprehend the social
                  dynamics of eighteenth-century English country gentry. Students immediately grasp
                  the identity complexities introduced by the possibility of such context collapse,
                  and tend to brim with stories about when their aunt or grandfather misunderstood something
                  they posted on social media for an intended audience of peers. Seeing Lady Susan’s
                  letter-writing practice in this light helps them interpret her character more sympathetically,
                  since many have grown up learning painful lessons about reputational identity in social
                  media. For this same reason, it is a key learning goal of my course to increase students’
                  expertise at shaping and managing their own online identities. My feminist pedagogy
                  seeks to encourage student agency online so that they can be, as one student pointed
                  out in a moment of delightfully ironic realization, <em>more like</em> Lady Susan—in rhetorical artistry, if not morality.</p>
               <p>Therefore, before students create their Tumblr blogs, we thoroughly discuss their
                  choices about how much identifying information they will choose to reveal in their
                  Tumblr accounts. Students then decide to create their Tumblr blogs with either their
                  real names, a durable pseudonym which they maintain across platforms, or an entirely
                  anonymous, disposable moniker chosen for one use only. In our course LMS, which is
                  password protected, we all share our Tumblr blog identities so that we can all follow
                  each other’s blogs. But on the Tumblr platform itself, I discourage students from
                  publishing identifying information (including photographs or nicknames) about other
                  students, even if they choose to use their own real names for their own blog. As students
                  gain more control over their own social media personas, they also gain richer appreciation
                  of the context of <em>Lady Susan</em> or <em>Emma</em>, novels which feature long-established, deeply interconnected communities of families.
                  For example, this student, <a class="link_ref" href="http://janereigns.tumblr.com/">Erica Clifford</a>, chose to identify herself by her full name in her course project, but students are
                  free to choose how much identifying information they wish to include.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Digital Pedagogy and Material Culture</span></h2>
               <p>Once student blogs are launched with a few initial quotations from the early readings
                  on the syllabus, we start thinking about the commonplace books as not only a useful
                  analogy for self-aware identity construction, but also as a knowledge technology with
                  specific resonances to eighteenth century and Romantic-era culture. Although we read
                  most of Austen’s published novels as well as many excerpted critical studies in this
                  course, we do not have time for a deep exploration of eighteenth-century book history
                  and publishing practices. However, even a brief consideration of the material history
                  of the eighteenth-century book can help students begin to appreciate the economic
                  conditions that configure Austen’s characters’ opportunities and choices as well as
                  Austen’s own various publishing strategies. To this end, while reading Edward Copeland’s
                  “Money” from the <em>Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen,</em> the class visits special collections, where students get to handle a number of Regency-era
                  texts and learn how printing processes, materials, and costs influenced readership
                  and the rise of circulating libraries, and we also get to view an early edition Johnson’s
                  <em>Dictionary</em> as well as some manuscript commonplace books.</p>
               <p>The archival visit is always one of the highlights of the semester, and two assignments
                  build on it: a short reflection piece about reading and writing by candlelight, and
                  a close-reading of a passage from an Austen novel comparing Johnson’s definition of
                  a word to our modern usage. Many students put one or both of these assignments into
                  their Tumblr commonplace books, as in this <a class="link_ref" href="http://universaltruthsrevealed.tumblr.com/search/dictionary">example</a>. The other technology of the text assignment, reading/writing by candlelight, pairs
                  very well with <em>Sense and Sensibility, </em>and helps students appreciate Austen’s careful equation between Marianne’s cramped
                  postures and her desperate emotions while she writes letters to Willoughby in the
                  second volume. The assignment also offers context for thinking through the trope of
                  the flickering candle, that durable device of gothic fiction, which Austen exploits
                  and satirizes in <em>Northanger Abbey</em>. The assignment asks students to read at least one chapter of a novel and then handwrite
                  a reflection about the experience—both by candlelight. Students then take a digital
                  photograph of their study area and post it to their commonplace book alongside their
                  reflection, as in this <a class="link_ref" href="http://universaltruthsrevealed.tumblr.com/image/60908380109">example</a> by Terrileigh Shepherd. Notice the layers of textual technology represented in this
                  single image: the student is hand-writing after reading by candlelight from a Norton
                  Critical Edition of <em>Emma,</em> then using a cell phone camera to digitally photograph her text and post it to her
                  twenty-first-century version of an eighteenth-century commonplace book. In this particular
                  case, the assignment offered Terri an opportunity to tell the class about growing
                  up in Zimbabwe, where frequent power outages made candlelight a familiar homework
                  resource. Access to technology is not only temporally but also geographically differential,
                  a topic that the class explored again when we watched Patricia Rozema’s adaptation
                  of <em>Mansfield Park</em> and discussed Said’s argument about Austen’s implication in English imperialism.</p>
               <p>These simple assignments yield remarkable results, since they defamiliarize reading
                  itself by transforming it into a consciously embodied role-playing activity that can
                  bring the Regency period to life. As students orient themselves to the physical postures
                  and technological challenges of reading and writing by candlelight, they begin to
                  imagine how material culture pervades and situates our lived experience. Students
                  reflect on issues including the height of the candle, troublesome drafts, the smell
                  and heat of candlelight, the physical cramps or eyestrain they experience, and their
                  sense of embodying Marianne’s Romantic sensibility. The opportunity to imagine themselves
                  into the physicality of the Regency period can open a series of realizations about
                  gender, age, class position, social occasion, affect, and the body itself as a historically-constructed
                  aspect of character. After this initial assignment, and because students find this
                  kind of experiential learning so dynamic, the class engaged in a series of role playing
                  activities that focus on material culture, including a Jane Austen dancing session,
                  a sketching exercise where we copied a profile using shadow-tracing, a Commerce card-party,
                  and a Regency-style potluck. For many of these activities, students added entries
                  to their digital commonplace books not only collecting but also reflecting on the
                  experience itself; in other words, their commonplace books became, in many instances,
                  not only collections of remediated objects and phrases, but also of reflective writing
                  about their own learning processes.</p>
               <p>Role playing and other game-like activities involve students in active learning that
                  yields rich readings, close attention to nuances of the text, and melds students into
                  an engaged learning community. Such an atmosphere provides a useful context from which
                  to address Romantic individualism, gender, and class in the novels. My students, in
                  twenty-first-century Los Angeles, find it difficult to appreciate the power of unfamiliar
                  social conventions, from Anne Elliot’s frustrating inability to voice her desire in
                  <em>Persuasion</em>, to Fanny’s moral certainties in <em>Mansfield Park, </em>to Darcy’s misgivings about the Bennet family in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. In these cases, the shared commonplace books, which quickly fill with pop culture
                  Austen memes satirizing Regency gender norms, offer valuable springboards into more
                  historically nuanced discussions of manners and textuality. In other words, by sharing
                  these items on Tumblr, students make visible to themselves, and to each other, their
                  historical distance from the novels, and can therefore begin to teach each other about
                  contemporary material culture through posts on clothing, meals, etiquette, architecture,
                  money, and many more aspects of culture.</p>

                  <p>Student-designed digital commonplace books both enable shared research and discovery
                     and embody individual student’s various relationships to Regency culture. One example
                     of a commonplace book that led through pop culture references to an exploration of
                     material culture, in this case fabric and fashion, is the commonplace book “<a class="link_ref" href="http://bonnetenvy.tumblr.com/">Bonnet Envy</a>.” Elizabeth Sanchéz, who initially titled her commonplace book “My Dear Miss Elizabeth,”
                     became fascinated by masculine fashion, and at the final (which was a ball thrown
                     by the students for the campus community) she welcomed guests to the ball with a display
                     of her watercolor fashion plates (see Figure 1). She also explained how to tie a cravat
                     and offered guests a choice to wear either gloves or a cravat for the dancing, so
                     that all guests could freely choose and signal their gender role for the dancing

                              seeking funding from student government, assigning each other organizational responsibilities,

                     </div>. The posts and aesthetics of her blog together embody her interest in period history,
                     and her careful research, as in this image:</p>

               <p>In contrast, student Nikolai Barkats’s commonplace book displays a widely different
                  aesthetic and set of intellectual preoccupations. “<a class="link_ref" href="http://darcysintown.tumblr.com/">Darcy’s in Town</a>” focuses on pulp fiction, gaming, and modern Austen rewritings. This student became
                  the class expert on Austen mashups, with a playful focus on gender and masculinity
                  in the novels and their filmic and textual afterlives. Like Elizabeth Sanchéz, this
                  student was also interested in masculinity in the novels, but his approach was quite
                  distinct, as his choice of topics and format makes clear. Note the eye-popping background
                  color, the pulp-fiction title and cover art, and the fascination with video games
                  and other remix forms:</p>

                  <p>Another student’s site, Sara Koffi’s “<a class="link_ref" href="http://austen-not-texas.tumblr.com/">Austen-not-Texas</a>,” demonstrates a more traditional commonplace book structure, offering primarily
                     quotations from novels and criticism and short, informal reactions.

                     and comparing how community at a small liberal arts college might be similar to the

               <p>Finally, Erica Clifford’s blog <a class="link_ref" href="http://janereigns.tumblr.com/">“Jane Reigns”</a> integrates all these aspects of the digital commonplace book, and culminates in a
                  final digital essay exploring one aspect of material culture in Austen’s era. Erica’s
                  work integrates popular culture references, historical and archival sources, quotations
                  from novels and criticism, and, at the bottom of each blog page, a scrolling list
                  of the posts by other students and other bloggers that she favorited or commented
                  on. Her digital essay, posted near the top of her book, is a video published on YouTube
                  and titled <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkHsQo4vCL0">“Bread Pudding: A Socioeconomic Cultural Portrait.”</a> This video exemplifies a possibility for undergraduate work that traditional essays
                  often don’t achieve: undergraduate scholarship that is rigorous and wide-ranging while
                  being potentially useful to an audience that goes far beyond her classmates. It is,
                  therefore, a student research project that may have a life after being graded, as
                  it offers an entry point into its topic for future readers, bakers, and/or students.
                  Since Erica chose to make it publicly available on her Tumblr as well as YouTube,
                  it will be only a browser search away for anyone with an interest in Jane Austen’s
                  love of bread pudding.</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/rehn-5Thumb.jpg" alt="“Jane Reigns,” by Erica Clifford (Click here for video)" class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>The aspect of Erica’s book that most excites me, beyond her rather wonderful essay
                  on dessert, is the scrolling feed of other students’ posts with whom she interacted.
                  The Tumblr platform, a popular social media site favored by slightly more women than
                  men, actively encourages bloggers to share each other’s posts with the simple dashboard
                  button “Quote.” Using this platform affordance, many individual Tumblr users produce
                  very little original material but build extensive collections of reblogged materials
                  that represent their own individual interests and tastes. In this sense, Tumblr is
                  a modern, social commonplace book, adding the Web 2.0 culture of connection to John
                  Locke’s conception of commonplacing. The many Tumblr themes available include citational
                  links, so that when a blogger reshares another blogger’s post, the software automatically
                  includes that link in the post, and alerts the original author. This creates a network
                  of users who quickly form interest communities. Since I asked all my students to “follow”
                  each other’s blogs, they also received notifications of each other’s posts, which
                  further encouraged active sharing, and, at times, created real-time virtual communities
                  of readers. Such real-time sharing was especially useful when students were reading
                  critical articles. Finding a key passage, they would post it to their commonplace
                  books with a brief commentary or an image from a film or other source. Other students
                  also reading the article (usually the night before class discussion) would read and
                  reshare the posted quotations as a study aid, so that by the time we were all sitting
                  in the room together preparing to discuss the article, the class had already established
                  a foothold for themselves from which to begin our consideration. In general, I participate
                  in such discussions only by posting, or reblogging, or “liking”, content, as any other
                  members of the class would do. My role is therefore to <em>participate</em>, or lead by example, rather than to guide or direct.</p>
               <p>Such social reading can happen, of course, with other kinds of informal reflective
                  writing due before class. But what really excited me about this instance was that
                  I had not explicitly <em>assigned</em> students to discuss the article ahead of time, and they saw their interactions on
                  Tumblr as helpful for their own reading process rather than as an obligatory exercise.
                  Sometimes students would write about the passage, as Sara Koffi does <a class="link_ref" href="http://austen-not-texas.tumblr.com/post/62909623347/most-of-us-now-correctly-understand-a-question">here</a>. Sometimes they would share helpful study tools, as Elizabeth Sanchéz does <a class="link_ref" href="http://bonnetenvy.tumblr.com/post/64020209635/a-handy-little-guide-to-the-relationships-in-pride">here</a>. The sense of community endeavor this shared blogging inspired brought the class
                  together into a learning community connected by helpfulness and shared interests.
                  It is, I think, no accident that this was the same group that collectively decided
                  to throw a ball for the campus. I won’t describe the ball, as <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol34no2/wilson.html">Cheryl Wilson</a> and others have already written usefully about teaching dancing as a part of a course
                  on Jane Austen, but the fact that the class chose, as a group, to create this event
                  is probably my single favorite teaching experience ever, one that I do believe is
                  connected to students’ Tumblr community building throughout the semester.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Tumblr Design, Participatory Culture, and Commonplacing as Curation</span></h2>
               <p>This community building was facilitated by the time we spent in class referring to
                  and learning from other’s Tumblr blogs. As their blogs grew, students’ expertise with
                  different aspects of Tumblr became clear, and we often had short student-led technical
                  discussions during class. One student explained the citational practices of the Tumblr
                  community (it is bad form to reblog a modified meme without acknowledgement, for instance),
                  which led naturally and usefully to a discussion of both academic citational practices
                  and Austen’s own dense network of textual allusions, particularly in <em>Persuasion </em>and <em>Northanger Abbey. </em>Other students showed the class how they achieved certain design aspects of their
                  blogs, which increased the range of aesthetic possibilities among the blogs. Note
                  the differing design aesthetics of Nikolai Barkats’ pulp-fiction inspired “Darcy’s
                  In Town” versus the embowered “Jane Reigns” or the self-consciously antiqued “Universal
                  Truths.” The students’ design freedom elevated this assignment over other familiar
                  reading response assignments they might post to an LMS forum, and resulted in a sense
                  of ownership of the assignment that created energy, community, and moved discussions
                  into the realm of what network theorist Henry Jenkins calls “participatory culture,”
                  which includes the following characteristics:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e445">relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement,</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e446">strong support for creating and sharing creations with others, </li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e447">types of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is passed
                     along to novices,</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e448">members who believe that their contributions matter, and</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d2374e449">members who feel some degree of social connection with one another (at the least,
                     they care what other people think about what they have created). (Jenkins 5-6)</li>
               </ol>
               <p>Here, Jenkins is describing what he believes is a significant cultural shift associated
                  with Web 2.0 practice. Unlike broadcasting, print media authorship, or even early
                  hard-coded HTML websites, Web 2.0 applications such as Tumblr, Twitter, and WordPress
                  overlay one-to-many networks like books or traditional classrooms with the many-to-many
                  networks of social media. In this kind of distributed network, all participants have
                  not only the opportunity but the motivation to produce as well as consume, since their
                  contribution embodies their individuality to the class community.</p>
               <p>Like today’s socially networked readers, gentry women of Austen’s period were not
                  only consumers but also the producers of much artistic and domestic culture. Characters
                  such as Georgiana Darcy or Jane Fairfax exemplify the accomplished woman in Austen’s
                  work, in contrast to protagonists whose more modest accomplishments are much thematized
                  in the novels. However, while Elizabeth Bennet or Emma Woodhouse may not play and
                  sing as well as others, they, like other women of their class and period, were valued
                  for their “society,” the contribution that their presence would make to a gathering.
                  Of course, we still delight in witty or wise friends, but we rarely think of ourselves
                  now as valuable primarily for how our creative contribution adds to a collective whole.
                  The press of such gendered obligation on Austen’s characters is one of the most important,
                  and most subtle, aspects of the novels for modern students to grasp, precisely because
                  it is so pervasive and so internalized. And, like any other disciplinary technology,
                  this social obligation to contribute manifests itself by empowering characters to
                  act accordingly—some more than others, of course. Similarly, when students form their
                  own commonplacing digital community, they experience both the empowerment and the
                  constraints of the technology that facilitates their community. Tumblr becomes a material
                  manifestation of Foucault’s power/knowledge, with the affordances of the technology
                  channeling student contributions and empowering them to create and share digital objects
                  that amaze and delight them with their own accomplishments.</p>
               <p>Throughout the semester, the class would consult members’ commonplace books to find
                  references, research topics, and design inspiration. To enhance this sense of student
                  ownership of the assignment, I asked students to evaluate each other’s commonplace
                  books twice during the semester, working from a rubric that we collectively developed
                  early in the semester. We contrasted these activities to Emma’s tutelage of Harriet
                  Smith in <em>Emma, </em>to Henry Tilney’s relationship to Catherine Morland in <em>Northanger Abbey, </em>and to the themes of romance and moral education that intertwine in so many of Austen’s
                  novels. The students’ commonplace books tend to exhibit vitality, energy, and good
                  will that embodies many aspects of Jenkins’ participatory culture, a hallmark of our
                  networked, Web 2.0 era, and a distinct contrast to the more hierarchical and elite
                  publishing practices of Austen’s era.</p>
               <p>Digital pedagogies succeed at community-creation because they are, in fact, embodied
                  learning practices, as I hope this article has shown. Hybrid assignments can illuminate
                  forms of technology and labor precisely because they foreground the material conditions
                  of reading and writing, including physical place, textuality, temporality, and economics.
                  When students remix and otherwise make canonical texts their own, they open spaces
                  to historicize technologies of textuality and in the process discover for themselves
                  some differences between late eighteenth and early twenty-first century modes of life.
                  Today, unlike Regency-era people, students rarely expect to produce the intellectual
                  and recreational artifacts that occupy their time. Many of us are today passive consumers
                  of cultural merchandise, but that is changing. Tumblr and other Web 2.0 platforms
                  that encourage remixing and sharing cultural artifacts are part of a transformation
                  that is taking place in parts of our society. While I distance myself from techno-utopians
                  who imagine that internet technology is an unmixed social good, I do find that students
                  bloom when their learning is connected to each other and to others on the web who
                  share their interests. They also discover commonalities between Regency-era culture
                  and their own lives that might otherwise remain unacknowledged. </p>
