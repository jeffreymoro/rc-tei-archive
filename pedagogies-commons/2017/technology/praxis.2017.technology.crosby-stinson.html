            <p class="noCount">When teaching British Romanticism, cultivating student interest in the material often
               requires the educator to explain the relevance of texts that for many seem historically
               and linguistically remote. One way to help facilitate student engagement is to ask
               them to investigate the public impacts of the assigned texts and communicate those
               impacts to a public audience. Digital humanists often turn to established digital
               humanities projects or blogs to provide students a platform for this kind of work;
               however, we trialed using a public resource that didn’t require a curatorial investment
               or the development of strict editorial oversight. Wikipedia provided that opportunity:
               despite nearly 4.9 million articles and one of the most visited sites on the web,
               there are a number of gaps in Wikipedia’s coverage of British Romantic literature,
               including coverage of William Blake’s most taught collection of poems: <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>. For a series of coursework assignments on Romantic poetry, we asked students to
               fill those gaps. This essay details our implementation of Wikipedia article writing
               assignments over two semesters of a British Romantic poetry class, including both
               the digital pedagogy and design concerns shaping the assignment. We explore some of
               the missteps regarding the implementation of digital assignments and discuss how the
               experience not only provided our students with different types of learning opportunities,
               but also how such an assignment can become a tool for shaping the public reception
               of Blake, Romanticism, and humanities knowledge more generally.</p>

                  <p>Teaching British Romanticism to undergraduate literature majors and non-majors often
                     necessitates an introductory discussion about the relevance of texts that may seem
                     historically and linguistically remote. One way to facilitate student engagement is
                     to ask them to investigate the public impacts of the assigned texts and to communicate
                     their importance to a public audience. Digital humanists often turn to out of the

                     </div> For faculty who don’t have the time or resources to create their own digital projects
                     or to supervise the creation of student-led digital projects, we suggest adapting
                     and incorporating student Wikipedia assignments.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Wikipedia provides the ideal platform to encourage students to develop editorial responsibility
                  over the creation and publication of knowledge. The website is a high-traffic and
                  globally conspicuous public repository of knowledge that expands in a user-generated,
                  public-facing model that many Romantic-period writers would perhaps have appreciated.
                  For every Wikipedia article created there is a step-by-step archiving process that
                  creates a self-reflective repository ripe for tracing the development and the production
                  of knowledge. Just as William Blake used printing technologies as a testing ground
                  for the expression of his creativity, experimenting with etching and engraving techniques
                  to develop his illuminated printing process, student Wikipedia assignments can be
                  used as a testing ground for collaborative editorial expression (McGann 57). </p>
               <p>Despite housing nearly 4.9 million articles and being one of the most visited sites
                  on the web, there are many gaps in Wikipedia’s coverage of British Romantic literature,
                  including coverage of Blake’s most taught collection of poems: <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>. For a series of undergraduate Wikipedia assignments, we asked our students to fill
                  in those gaps and imagine the broader arguments around Romantic literature. We introduced
                  them to the sort of conversation communities that have become a hallmark of recent
                  literary pedagogy. By using Blake and his illuminated poetry as the focus of our Wikipedia
                  assignments, we also challenged students to navigate a complex, rapidly expanding
                  print and digital ecosystem that is, as recent critics have observed, “collaborative
                  and participatory” (Whitson and Whittacker 51).</p>

                  <p>During the last 150 years, Blake’s eclectic, experimental creative output has been
                     accessible to a much larger audience than during his own lifetime. Despite the prophetic
                     exhortations of his illuminated books, Blake was a poet/artist with a limited readership.
                     Alexander Gilchrist’s biography of Blake (1863) and W.B. Yeats and Edwin J. Ellis’
                     edition of Blake’s poetry (1893) did much to establish a broader audience, and by
                     the mid-twentieth century Blake was accorded canonical status. Transcending the academy,
                     Blake is a cultural mainstay for groups as diverse as the British Women’s Institute,
                     the Beat poets, and the far-right British National Party.

                     </div> On the internet, Blake’s presence has grown to the point that Roger Whitson and Jason
                     Whittacker consider that with his remediated presence on sites such as <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query+william+blake">YouTube</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://twitter.com/w_blakequotes">Twitter,</a> <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake">Wikipedia</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/williamblake">Flickr</a>, Blake “is a true mass media phenomenon” (Whitson and Whittacker 24, 138-61). If
                     we consider Blake’s presence on Wikipedia, for instance, we see that in 2013 users
                     made “about 5,477” editorial revisions to the <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake">William Blake Wikipedia page</a> (Whitson and Whittacker 142). By July 13, 2015, the Blake Wikipedia page had 6,402

               <p>Blake’s place in the cultural zeitgeist coupled with library shelves straining under
                  the ever-increasing weight of critical editions, facsimiles, and critical analysis,
                  as well as an array of digital resources (from archival sites such as the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org">William Blake Archive</a>, the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106190.html">British Library’s digital Notebook of William Blake,</a> the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.zoamorphosis.com">Blake 2.0 Cloud and Zoamorphosis Blog</a>, critical editions, and myriad homework help websites analyzing his poems) indicate
                  a diverse and expanding audience. New readers of Blake are often confronted by a bewildering
                  array of different versions of Blake’s works accompanied by a daunting mountain of
                  commentary, accessible in numerous formats and on multiple platforms.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While this material about Blake continues to increase, creating an ecology of print
                     and electronic resources about and influenced by Blake, we have to remember that the
                     many “Blakes” that constitute this ecology aren’t necessarily representative of the
                     same William Blake, poet, painter, and printmaker. Transferring Blake’s illuminated
                     books to other formats necessitates some form of loss for, as Wayne C. Ripley observes,
                     to translate a work “to a new medium . . . irrevocably changes its form, context,
                     circulation, and meaning” (Ripley para. 5). With the growth of this Blakean ecology,
                     there has also been concern about notions of authority and that the many Blakes existing
                     in print and digital media will confound what is already confusing. Recent scholarship
                     has addressed some of these concerns. For example, Whitson and Whittacker see the
                     proliferation of the Blakean meme as a continuation of Blake’s own creative process,
                     a process that encourages collaboration and participation. Furthermore, the reception
                     of Blake from Gilchrist onward echoes the indeterminacy that Blake created in his
                     own illuminated books.

                     critical editions of Blake’s poetry and prose and the wealth of secondary criticism
                     problematizes notions of scholarly authority and textual stability.

                              all with different editorial agendas. For example, in addition to David V. Erdman’s
                              standard reference work: The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake (2nd ed. 1988),

                     </div> For undergraduate students engaging with Blake and his illuminated books for the first
                     time, such a disparate and growing corpus of work can pose a significant challenge
                     to negotiate.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In an attempt to cultivate student engagement with Blake’s illuminated books via the
                  digital environment, we developed an assignment that leveraged one specific and popular
                  component of the Blakean ecosystem: Wikipedia. Drawing on the assignment model developed
                  by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_program">Wikipedia Education Program</a>, our students investigated the complexities of scholarly discourse for one unique
                  collection of Blake’s poems, synthesizing arguments from a variety of methodological
                  approaches. Additionally, as contributors to the larger digital humanities efforts
                  around Blake, our Wikipedia assignment allowed students an intervention in how the
                  public received Blake scholarship.</p>
               <p>In two undergraduate courses focusing on British poetry, during the Fall 2013 and
                  Spring 2015 semesters, we asked students to create Wikipedia articles about poems
                  in Blake’s most accessible illuminated book: <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>. As digital humanists, we also wanted students to contribute to a public resource
                  that wouldn’t require significant curatorial investment that they weren’t trained
                  for or the development of a strict process of editorial oversight, yet would require
                  them to navigate the large, disparate corpus of secondary print and digital scholarship
                  on Blake. Wikipedia provided that opportunity. There are significant lacunae in Wikipedia’s
                  coverage of Blake’s work; for instance, before our assignments about half of the poems
                  from <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> had no <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Innocence_and_of_Experience">Wikipedia articles</a>, and those that were covered rarely explored secondary criticism. For our student
                  Wikipedia assignments, we asked our students to fill those gaps. The remainder of
                  this essay details our implementation of Wikipedia article writing assignments and
                  sets out some of our missteps regarding implementing digital assignments. We discuss
                  how the exercise not only provided our students with different types of learning opportunities,
                  but also how such an assignment can become a tool for shaping the public reception
                  of Blake, Romanticism, and humanities knowledge more generally.</p>

                     </div> Educators often misunderstand the multiple layers of editorial work that happens on
                     the site. Once editors add content to Wikipedia, the core volunteer community wrangles
                     this massive contributory activity by following the community's founding <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">five pillars</a> that include <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines">policies and community best practices</a> and the ability to track every editorial intervention through the software’s revision
                     history tracking. Three mutually dependent core content policies regulate all the
                     content in Wikipedia:</p>

                  <p>These policies encourage all content to be tied to a citation from secondary or tertiary
                     sources and for contributors to remain neutral by equally representing all of the
                     major reputable opinions about the topic. In effect, articles that best meet community
                     expectations become thorough literature reviews, where nearly every sentence is yoked
                     to an authoritative citation. When meeting these standards, Wikipedia’s content effectively
                     weighs different interpretive strategies, producing thorough, historiographically
                     rich literature reviews (though in reality only a fraction of Wikipedia articles successfully
                     meets the community's expectations of quality content).

               <p>The utility of Wikipedia as a citable source in research is a keen topic of discussion
                  among academics. As recently as five years ago, treatment of Wikipedia ranged from
                  confusion and distrust to outright contempt, with one observer describing Wikipedia
                  as “scrappy, chaotic, dilettantish, amateurish” (Glieck 380-81). For many critics,
                  “the ability of users to add and edit Wikipedia pages at will” is the resource’s most
                  distinguishing characteristic (Leitch 59). The democratization of knowledge production
                  inherent in the development of Web 2.0, and best embodied by Wikipedia, allows any
                  and all users to create and publish content electronically without the supervisory
                  presence of traditional loci of authority. This decentering of authority not only
                  destabilizes traditional conceptions of knowledge production and dissemination but
                  also raises issues regarding what types of knowledge are suitable for scholarly consumption.
                  For some of the more forceful critics of Wikipedia, the outsourcing of knowledge production
                  results in a “truth by consensus” ethic and is akin to “the blind leading the blind—infinite
                  monkeys providing infinite information for infinite readers, perpetuating the cycle
                  of misinformation and ignorance” (Keen 4). </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Despite the weaknesses created by this approach to knowledge production, the scale
                     and good faith of most contributions to Wikipedia has created an indispensable digital
                     resource. Wikipedia’s ubiquity and comprehensiveness in many public topics has led
                     to it becoming a common starting point (and occasionally a source for citation). Effective
                     use of Wikipedia as a research tool and critical awareness of its process are, however,
                     skills sorely needed amongst undergraduates.

                              but had a tendency to stop after reading the article and search Google again (Todorinova

                     </div> To spread Wikipedia literacy and create public-oriented scholars, a number of communities
                     have opted to have their students write Wikipedia articles. Major academic associations,
                     like the Association for Psychological Science, have been encouraging students to
                     improve their digital literacy by using Wikipedia to create more authoritative public
                     entry points for topics important to their field.

                     of Wikipedia’s knowledge base so as to be better able to reflect critically on Wikipedia
                     as a platform for synthesizing <em>a priori</em> knowledge and the process by which authoritative sources of knowledge are created.
                     As a participant in a <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.k-state.edu/digitalhumanities/symposium/schedule.html">Teaching with Wikipedia</a> workshop we hosted at Kansas State University in Spring 2015 observed, ‘Wikipedia
                     assignments highlight the need for students to see how the knowledge sausage is made,

                  <p>Having students contribute to Wikipedia requires an initial process of acclimatization.
                     For instance, we introduced our students to Wikipedia’s community of practice expectations
                     and then monitored them as they explored this new and unfamiliar environment. Members
                     of the Wikipedia community have long recognized the challenges facing new contributors.
                     Since 2010 the <a class="link_ref" href="https://wikimediafoundation.org">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, the nonprofit that undergirds the community and technology that Wikipedia runs on,
                     has supported a global Wikipedia Education Program that provides best practices and
                     tools to ease the learning curve of creating such assignments.

                     </div> This framework has supported thousands of classes globally, and, since 2013 additional
                     resources, including mentoring and assignment design support, have been available
                     for educators in the United States and Canada through a sister non-profit the <a class="link_ref" href="https://wikiedu.org/about-us/">Wiki Education Foundation</a>. Among the resources produced are <a class="link_ref" href="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education/Resources">instructional booklets for classroom instruction, targeted disciplinary best practices
                        and sample assignment guides</a>.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Most assignments where students create Wikipedia articles capitalize on how Wikipedia’s
                  core content policies closely mirror the kinds of expectations placed on student work
                  for annotated bibliographies or literature reviews. Wikipedia’s framework for creating
                  and editing content actually trains students in skillsets that humanities undergraduates
                  often need to learn. Humanities classrooms, particularly literature courses, tend
                  to emphasize original interpretation and students are often not taught scholarly assessment
                  skills until graduate school. As Thomas Leitch notes when talking about the relationship
                  between the kinds of knowledge mastery and that emphasized by traditional canon-based
                  learning in the field of English, the ability to assess and compare original research,
                  a literacy of secondary sources, is missing from both academia and Web 2.0. Leitch
                  goes on to claim that “the more critical relationship between literature and literacy
                  [is] that a close consideration of Web 2.0 could foster seems essential to the revitalizing,
                  perhaps to the survival, of English studies and liberal education generally” (Leitch
                  80). </p>
               <p>We see our Wikipedia assignments providing, in part, a much-needed critical space
                  for our students to become better recognizers, assessors, and communicators of the
                  knowledge and skills they acquire in digitally inflected humanities classes. Having
                  students practice writing and research on Wikipedia gives them the opportunity to
                  investigate the complex layers of secondary criticism that creates the academy’s authoritative
                  knowledge base. There is also an additional benefit: in developing and honing their
                  digital literacy, our students were concomitantly transforming Wikipedia’s representation
                  of Blake’s poems for casual readers, students, and researchers, highlighting multiple
                  contrasting readings of <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=songsie&amp;java=no"><em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em></a> and pointing towards possible sources for further research.</p>

               <p>For those not familiar with assigning Wikipedia article writing in the classroom,
                  we would strongly recommend the use of materials provided by the <a class="link_ref" href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Educationprogram/Educators">Wikipedia Education Program</a> and the newly launched <a class="link_ref" href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org">Wikipedia Assignment Design Wizard</a>. The Wikimedia Foundation and the Wiki Education Foundation staff maintain these
                  resources with the help of faculty and volunteers experienced in running such assignments.
                  The design wizard and standard documentation of assignments have activities and staged
                  assignment deadlines that can be used in an eight to twelve week writing assignment
                  akin to a literature review or essay rubric used in upper division undergraduate or
                  graduate classes. These resources guide instructors and students through selecting
                  topics, developing familiarity with Wikipedia’s community of practice, student research,
                  engagement with library support, student peer review, and final assessment projects.
                  These materials are, however, limiting because they require the Wikipedia assignment
                  to be the core written assignment of the semester. For our use of the Wikipedia assignment
                  model, we opted to modify the sample syllabus because we needed to include other forms
                  of written assessment, including poetry analysis. We created a four to six week assignment
                  that included using four evenly spaced “gates” corresponding to the specific tasks
                  we wanted to the students to undertake and to focus the students on the Student Learning
                  Objectives (SLOs) for the course. The core SLOs for both courses are as follows: </p>
               <ol>
                  <li class="item" id="d3622e430">Demonstrate a detailed knowledge of poetry from the British Romantic Period, including

                     the articles were able to increase their position on Google, that average increased
                     to 418 views, or a 60% increase. Clearly there was a latent public demand for information
                     about these poems, when almost every month has that level of traffic. Moreover, the
                     student work fills omissions on Blake not previously addressed by Wikipedia editors;
                     in subsequent student work on the articles, only two of the articles have been revised:
                     “<a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Boy_Lost">The Little Boy Lost</a>” denuded superfluous background material related to Blake and gained a gallery of

               <p>After the first assignment, we realized that the quality of our students’ articles
                  could be improved. When modifying the <a class="link_ref" href="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education">Wikipedia’s Education Program’s model</a> for the assignment, we chose to omit the following elements: ensuring that peer review
                  and meeting the “gates” were graded; building in early research support for non-English-major
                  students; and placing more emphasis on quality rather than completion in the grading
                  rubric. While meeting the core SLOs for the poetry course, the articles produced for
                  the first iteration of the assignment may not impact public Blake knowledge as strongly
                  as they could and students didn’t get as thorough an immersion in scholarship as we
                  had intended.</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/crosby-stinson-4Thumb.png" alt="Wikipedia Article: William Blake’s ‘Night’" class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>Learning from our earlier experiences, we chose to run the next iteration of the assignment
                  in an upper-division British Literature class during Spring 2015. We made several
                  revisions to the first iteration of the assignment. Rather than have students write
                  articles collaboratively, we assigned one article per student and provided <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/bibliography.xq?b=specific&amp;targ_div=d1">a bibliography of secondary sources</a>. We also shortened the deadline to four weeks. We found that these changes, plus
                  running the assignment with a group of English majors, created a much better outcome
                  for the students and their contributions. Our students wrote most of the remaining
                  missing articles on <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Innocence_and_of_Experience"><em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em></a>, creating, on average, higher quality articles. The best indicators for this improvement
                  are the number and types of secondary sources the students referenced in the articles
                  and Wikipedia article quality. But, in some respects, these are superficial indicators.
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_Boy">The School Boy</a>,” for instance, didn’t summarize all eleven of its sources, instead relying on three
                  while providing the others for future researchers as a “Further reading,” whereas
                  other articles like “<a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Girl_Lost">The Little Girl Lost</a>” do exemplary jobs focusing on the nuance of the three scholarly interpretations.</p>
               <p>With this iteration of the assignment, the students consistently added greater publicly
                  valuable content, with nuanced summaries of critical readings of the poems. Thus far,
                  except for some formatting and consistency changes made by Alex Stinson and other
                  Wikipedia editors, there have been no significant revisions or changes to the articles.

                  poems that the students created for the second version of our Wikipedia assignment.</p>

               <p>For the second version of the assignment we also asked students to complete a survey
                  that contributed to their grade upon completion. In general, student responses to
                  the survey suggest that the assignment led to a new literacy about how Wikipedia works:
                  six of the students used Wikipedia weekly before the assignment, yet only two of the
                  students knew that they could edit prior to the assignment. In an open-ended question
                  about what they learned, almost every student mentioned having a new understanding
                  of what's “going on behind the scenes in Wikipedia” with most of the students making
                  reference to Wikipedia’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a> policy. Only two of the respondents had technical concerns with editing Wikipedia.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When asked about difficulties of the assignment, students felt most challenged by
                     the research process required in creating Wikipedia articles. Several of the responses
                     mention a degree of nervousness about putting their “best work” forward for Wikipedia
                     and a public audience. In turn, the challenge of doing research and having quality
                     material available to the public prompted students to consider who uses this information.
                     Every respondent answered questions about the impact of public spaces like Wikipedia
                     on poetry readers optimistically, hoping that they could make it easier for new readers
                     of poetry (including students like themselves) to understand poems.

                     </div> For six of the students, this was the first humanities course where they had been
                     asked to communicate to an audience beyond the instructor or their classmates. As
                     a skills-focused assignment, the research portion appears to have developed their
                     understanding and engagement with scholarly criticism as well as prompted them to
                     think critically about their own readers. In terms of a public audience, we asked
                     our students to consider the near impossible: all potential global users of Wikipedia.
                     Yet, with the parameters set out by the Wikipedia editorial policy, specifically the
                     neutrality and citation requirements, students had clear editorial guidelines to shape
                     their respective public interventions in the Blakean ecosystem. Furthermore, as users
                     of Wikipedia prior to our classes, the students were alert to the significance and
                     relevancy of their assignments as high-traffic gateways to other sources of knowledge
                     about Blake.</p>

               <p>Overall, we found both iterations of the assignment to be successful, but we also
                  found ourselves questioning whether our two Wikipedia assignments provided a suitable
                  environment for students to engage with Blake’s creative output. Part of Wikipedia’s
                  radical vision of “anyone can edit” is acknowledging that when you aren’t commissioning
                  work from authorities (as with traditional academic collections) much of the work
                  is going to incomplete or imperfect, especially in the first version. Thus, Wikipedia
                  is, and always will be, a “<a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_work_in_progress">work in progress</a>.” For a Wikipedia article, no scholarly imperative demands the student work meet
                  the <em>best</em> accuracy, precision, and comprehensiveness of content; rather these concerns are
                  ceded to the community of practice supporting Wikipedia, and to the many voices and
                  eyes that edit it. Therefore, as assessors of student work, we didn’t have an obligation
                  to spend additional time increasing precision and comprehensiveness of student work,
                  rather we could focus on assessment and teaching competencies. As long as our students
                  created <em>better </em>content than was previously on Wikipedia, and they provided citations to authoritative
                  secondary sources where the public can learn more about Blake, the students created
                  a <em>better</em> public portal to the poems than the SparkNotes or GradeSaver type websites that tend
                  to dominate Google searches when Wikipedia articles aren’t present. Additionally,
                  while the articles created by our students were all outside the top echelon of Wikipedia’s
                  taxonomy of quality (fig. 3), the assignment nevertheless satisfied the SLOs for our
                  courses. From the first iteration of the assignment it was apparent that Wikipedia’s
                  highest standards of quality <em>exceeded</em> expectations typically placed on undergraduates for literature review assignments.</p>
               <p>As we continue to develop our Wikipedia assignment and other scholars implement similar
                  assignments, we’ll witness the creation of more content and its continuous improvement
                  with articles becoming even better (if not the <em>best</em>) representation of the authoritative knowledge available on the internet about these
                  poems. Wikipedia’s dominance on search engines and in the public’s research practices
                  allows us to leverage student work to create a public representation of our field
                  and guarantees the students’ work reaches a large public audience. Digital student
                  projects on blogs and other digital humanities sites could never guarantee this kind
                  of public impact.</p>
               <p>Both iterations of our Wikipedia assignment enabled students to create critical gateways
                  for public understanding of the humanities. The missing articles and cursory coverage
                  that we filled with our assignments exist in a number of important literary subjects
                  ranging from gaps in obscure or eclectic areas with limited public interest, to some
                  of the most well-researched authors and topics in Romanticism. For example, there
                  are crucial gaps in many Romantic-period writers, including <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Hemans">Felicia Hemans</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Turner_Smith">Charlotte Smith</a>. While Hemans has a Start Class rating and Smith a C Class quality rating according
                  to Wikipedia’s taxonomy of quality, as of October 30, 2015 there are <em>no</em> articles on their literary works. In addition to these significant topical gaps,
                  humanities on Wikipedia frequently suffers from a form of knowledge popularism: the
                  more popular the subject, the more contributors write into the Wikipedia articles,
                  while key critical concerns are missed.</p>
               <p>The seeming lack of scholarly rigor often evident in Wikipedia humanities topics should
                  not prevent scholars and students from using the platform to communicate humanities
                  topics to a public beyond the academy. There are thousands of students in literature
                  classrooms around the globe that can fill the knowledge gaps in Wikipedia while providing
                  a degree of scholarly rigor. Wikipedia offers a collaborative space where scholars
                  and their students can actualize the Romantic ideal of bettering society through enriching
                  minds, providing a ready-made framework for exposing the public to the complexities
                  of scholarly discourse and encouraging them to participate in knowledge production.
                  With these two Wikipedia assignments, our students became part of a broader Wikipedia
                  community that shares an interest in researching and disseminating the best knowledge
                  to the public.</p>
