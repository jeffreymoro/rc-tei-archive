                    <p>In a recent cross-disciplinary project aimed at bridging courses in English
                        and Electrical Engineering at Union College, we conducted a dual exploration
                        of the role of sound in Romantic literature, culture, and technology by the
                        incorporation of Electrical Engineering practices and technologies into a
                        Romanticism course, on the one hand, and, on the other, the introduction of
                        Romantic poetry, theory, and technology into a course on digital signal
                        processing. The collaboration brought together two intermediate-level
                        courses: “The Romantic Revolution” and “Discrete Systems.” More
                        specifically, we devised an interdisciplinary team experience bringing
                        humanities and engineering approaches to the analysis of the phenomenon of
                        sound as represented in poetry and technology of the Romantic period. We
                        used contemporary technology from Phasor Lab (a state-of-the-art facility
                        located at Union College’s Peter Irving Wold Center for Science and
                        Engineering) to measure poetic sound with scientific instrumentation. This
                        trans-disciplinary lab required English students to work in conjunction with
                        their peers who specialize in signal processing for a dual investigation of
                        the conceptual, aesthetic, and technological contexts of Romantic sound—not
                        only of the poetry but also the age’s beloved Aeolian lyre. </p>
                    <p>Students first examined the spectral content of an Aeolian harp, an
                        instrument that fascinated Romantic-period poets and inspired many lyrical
                        poems, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Effusion 35” (1795) (later
                        titled “The Eolian Harp” [p. 1796]) as well as Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “Mont
                        Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamouni” (1817). In addition,
                        engineering students recorded, processed, and analyzed student recitations
                        of Romantic poetry related to the Aeolian harp; these students then
                        collaborated with their peers from the Romanticism course to label formal
                        aspects of the poetry (e.g., assonance, alliteration, rhyme, meter, poetic
                        feet, etc.), using forms specific to each discipline. Student teams from the
                        two courses offered simultaneously by the English and Electrical and
                        Computer Engineering (ECE) Departments ultimately produced co-authored term
                        papers in the style of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics
                        Engineers) conference papers (intended for an engineering audience). While
                        writing the reports, engineering students focused on composing the technical
                        aspects of the project, while literature students provided prose related to
                        literary and historical aspects of Romanticism. The literature students took
                        the lead in the peer-editing process and also became familiar with aspects
                        of technical writing.</p>
                    <p>In this essay, we detail the various technologies and techniques—including
                        binaural recording and the Short-time Fourier Transform—that we have
                        employed in this collaboration, as well as the vital functions that Romantic
                        poetic and sound technologies played in the classroom and lab environments
                        at our liberal arts institution during this multi-year project. We focus on
                        the role of Romanticism in the hybrid humanities-engineering classroom at a
                        small undergraduate college and foreground the value of contemporary
                        technologies in the study of historical understandings of sound.</p>

                    <head>Introduction: Interdisciplinary Collaborations</head>
                    <p>This collaboration began as a result of several boot camps that occurred at
                        the 2013 The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp), “Humanities +
                        Engineering” at Union College. We required students from our respective core
                        sophomore-level courses in British Romantic studies and ECE to attend a
                        session on “Music + Engineering,” where the engineering students delivered
                        an interactive demonstration on signal processing techniques to a diverse
                        group of non-experts from various disciplines and fields. As an example, the
                        students described the concepts of time and frequency domain analysis and
                        the use of the Fourier Transform to decompose sound into its composite
                        frequencies. The student populations enrolled in these two courses spanned
                        several majors and minors including English, Art History, Bioengineering,
                        and Music. The ECE course on digital signal processing, for example, is
                        required by three engineering programs at Union College (Electrical,
                        Computer, and Bioengineering), and all majors and minors at our academic
                        institution enroll in sophomore-level courses offered by the English
                        Department. </p>
                    <p>During the dynamic and engaging question-and-answer session that followed
                        this THATCamp event, we began discussing the possibilities of recording and
                        analyzing natural sounds occurring outside of human structures and
                        institutions. For instance, we pondered the differences between
                        environmental and musical sounds as well as the types of sounds created
                        during the recitation of poetry. This conversation led us to think about the
                        nature and function of the Aeolian harp, a wind harp placed outside in
                        fields but most often during the Romantic period in open window casements or
                        in other domestic settings in which natural breezes impact the tuned strings
                        of the harp, thus setting them harmonically into motion. While the Aeolian
                        harp was invented in an earlier period, it is well known that the device
                        became an absolute fascination during the Romantic era, and poets such as
                        Coleridge and Shelley often employed the trope of the harp in both poetry
                        and prose. In fact, Timothy Morton has noted that the Aeolian harp “became a
                        household item as popular and familiar in the long eighteenth century as
                        sound systems are today” (313). “The Aeolian harp is an environmental
                        instrument,” writes Morton, “[o]ne places the harp in a window, so that it
                        will catch the undulations of wind” (313). As “a form of recording or
                        monitoring” of the environment, the Aeolian harp is actually closer
                            <quote>to science than to art, nearer to modern sensors and seismographs
                            . . . than to the idea of an “art object,” something in a frame, in an
                            exhibition space or in an anthology, discrete, separated, isolated, and
                            focused. Such instruments modulate one wave (wind in the case of the
                            Aeolian harp) in terms of another wave (sound waves produced by the
                            strings). (Morton 313)</quote> Through an internal grant, we were able
                        to purchase not only a contemporary, commercially manufactured wind harp for
                        use outdoors but also the type of period-specific casement harp described by
                        Morton—a replica harp that was hand-crafted by a professional luthier and
                        modeled upon Romantic-period originals.<note place="foot">The authors would
                            like to thank Union College for its generous funding of this project
                            through both the Humanities Faculty Research Fund (HFRF) as well as the
                            Internal Education Foundation (IEF) grants. The measurement
                            instrumentation in Phasor Lab was supported through NSF-MRI grant
                            #0923384.</note> Our work with these devices prompted us to consider the
                        following question: given late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
                        interests in this instrument as well as its function in verse as a lyrical
                        trope, what about Romanticism might particularly lend itself to
                        technologically infused or enhanced pedagogical approaches and assignments
                        related to this device and some of the poetry it helped to inspire? </p>
                    <p>Despite the fact that the Romantics are often perceived as critiquing rampant
                        industrialization, technological questions and concerns can be found
                        throughout even the most celebrated and foundational texts of the period.
                        Shelley, for instance, compared the human body—and especially the human
                        sensorium—to something like a radically complex machine akin to the Aeolian
                        harp. He famously writes in the opening paragraphs of his “A Defence of
                        Poetry” (c. 1821) that <quote>[m]an is an instrument over which a series of
                            external and internal impressions are driven, like the alternations of
                            an ever-changing wind over an Æolian lyre, which move it by their motion
                            to ever-changing melody. But there is a principle within the human
                            being, and perhaps within all sentient beings, which acts otherwise than
                            in the lyre, and produces not melody alone, but harmony, by an internal
                            adjustment of the sounds or motions thus excited to the impressions
                            which excite them. (Shelley 511)</quote> Shelley here revises and
                        extends his earlier understanding and interpretation of the nature and
                        function of the Aeolian lyre as treated in poems such as “Mutability (‘We
                        are as clouds’)” (1816) and, perhaps more significantly, “Mont Blanc.” The
                        prompting of human cognitive functions through sensory stimuli might be
                        analogous to environmental winds shocking into life an Aeolian harp, Shelley
                        suggests in the “Defence,” but this analogy goes far beyond any simple,
                        one-to-one correspondence because “within the human being” there exists “an
                        internal adjustment” to external stimuli—an adjustment that is best
                        understood as not only self-reflexive but also as existing in dialectical
                        relation with the “impressions” from an external world. For Shelley, then,
                        analysis of the Aeolian harp ultimately leads to a conception of
                        subject-object relations as existing in complex feedback loops, or perhaps
                        better stated, human subject and external environment are always already
                        deeply interfused for Shelley. This is a sentiment that the poet expressed
                        just a few years earlier in “Mont Blanc”: <quote><lg>

                    <p>Reconsidering his earlier statement in this poem that the “everlasting
                        universe of things / Flows through the mind” (1-2), Shelley suggests in the
                        lines above that human cognitive functions might very well “passively . . .
                        receiv[e] fast influencings” from external environments, but cognitive
                        functions also very much <emph>render</emph> their environments as well.
                        According to Shelley, minds and worlds thus exist in reciprocal
                        relationships akin to what William Wordsworth famously describes as that
                        “mighty world / Of eye and ear, both what they half-create, / And what
                        perceive” (106-108). </p>
                    <p>Extending Shelley’s Romantic-era understanding of the human-environment
                        dialectic to the technological, John Tresch contrasts the “classical
                        machine,” “[e]xemplified by the clock, the lever, or the balance” and “seen
                        as a passive transmitter of external forces, as a symbol of balance and
                        eternal order” representative of “a stable, determinist nature and . . .
                        associated with an epistemology of rational, unfeeling detachment” (12),
                        with what he terms the “Romantic machine,” epitomized by, for example, the
                        Aeolian harp: <quote>The exemplary machines of the romantic era . . . could
                            be seen to have their own motive force within them; they were presented
                            as ambiguously alive. . . . In the early nineteenth century, machines
                            were not exclusively associated with detachment, rationality, and
                            fixity, but with the conversions, imaginative flights, and metamorphoses
                            of the fantastic. They drew forth invisible powers, converted them, and
                            put them to use. Unlike the classical machine, the romantic machine did
                            not stand alone; it involved the active participation of the observer
                            and articulated a spontaneous, living, and constantly developing nature;
                            it produced aesthetic effects and emotional states. (12)</quote>
                        Romantic-era intellectuals like Coleridge and Shelley were drawn to the
                        Aeolian harp and gave treatment to the device repeatedly in their writings
                        because this instrument represented at first an analogue but ultimately a
                        metaphor for the type of “active participation” that they each envisioned
                        human subjects experiencing while moving through dynamic and vital (if also
                        deeply unpredictable) external environments. For these reasons, “[t]he
                        Aeolian harp looks backwards to a poetics of place and of the genius of
                        place; and forwards to a poetics of automation, an uncanny foreknowledge in
                        the cultural imaginary of recording technologies,” as Morton has
                        persuasively explained (327). </p>

                    <head>Data Acquisition and Analysis: Binaural Recordings</head>
                    <p>Inspired by not only the Romantic preoccupation with this “recording” device
                        but also by contemporary investigations of the Aeolian harp as both
                        technological instrument and literary trope in recent Romantic criticism and
                        theory, students in the Romanticism course studied the basic elements of
                        poetic rhyme and meter as well as other related matters pertaining to the
                        study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century poetics (e.g.,
                        assonance, consonance, enjambment, varieties of poetic feet, etc.) in poems
                        such as “The Eolian Harp,” “Mutability,” and “Mont Blanc.” A unique setup
                        awaited the English students in the ECE Department’s laboratory, where
                        poetic readings were recorded binaurally so that the recordings would
                        reproduce an uncanny, three-dimensional sense of sound directionality as
                        perceived by a listener at a particular position. In order to prepare to
                        collaborate during our cross-disciplinary laboratory investigation, we
                        selected “Mont Blanc” as our focus text due to the poem’s emphasis on the
                        nature and function of sound as well as its various engagements with themes
                        and concepts related to the Aeolian lyre. During the first three weeks of
                        the course in Romanticism, students were introduced to a range of basic
                        poetic devices, techniques, and terms studied during close readings and
                        critical investigations of a range of other canonical Romantic-era texts
                        (e.g., Wordsworth’s 1799 edition of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>).
                        In addition to the formal aspects of poetry, students in the English course
                        simultaneously explored the conceptual and historical foundations of
                        Romanticism. </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile across campus, engineering students learned fundamentals of digital
                        signal processing, including sampling and quantization, the Nyquist Theorem,
                        the concepts of time and frequency domain, the Fourier Transform, as well as
                        spectrogram and digital filtering techniques. The Nyquist Theorem provides
                        guidance on how to acquire a signal (such as a recorded sound) without
                        artifacts, and the time and frequency domain, the Fourier Transform, and
                        spectrogram and digital filtering permit the study and processing of the
                        signal’s spectral content. Students also learned a technique for filtering
                        signals to remove selected frequency components, which can potentially
                        separate a signal with two or more simultaneously occurring contributions
                        into independent components. In order to emphasize to the students that the
                        signal processing techniques are general and can be applied to the
                        investigation of signals acquired from a range of sources—poetic, musical,
                        environmental, and otherwise—the students performed a blind analysis of data
                        from a “mystery source.” Only after completing the assignment was it
                        revealed that a neurobiologist had provided the data. </p>
                    <p>Having briefly introduced both groups of students to Coleridge’s
                        representation of the Aeolian harp as “that simplest lute” which “by the
                        desultory breeze caressed” produces “long sequacious notes / [that] [o]ver
                        delicious surges sink and rise” and which create, in effect, “a soft
                        floating witchery of sound” (13, 15, 19-20, 21), we chose to auralize (and
                        therefore literalize) for the group during laboratory time the sound that,
                        in part, evoked Romantic poets’ imaginative literary descriptions of this
                        device’s sounds. We first sampled a recording made from a contemporary,
                        commercially manufactured wind harp. This modern interpretation of the
                        Aeolian harp is shown below (Figure 1) against an ominous, late-October
                        Schenectady sky, and a recording of it being played by the wind (audible as
                        background noise underneath the sustained, eerie sounds of the harp) can be
                        heard through the following <ref

                        (Figure 2). Listening to the type of technology that excited the
                        imaginations of several Romantic poets added a new dimension to the
                        students’ exposure to this work. We then asked the engineering students to
                        use their repertoire of digital signal processing techniques to add yet
                        another dimension to the group’s collective understanding of the harp and

                        conceptual concerns related to the Aeolian harp and its functions.

                        and marking techniques greatly assisted these students in better
                        understanding the rhythm and meter of assigned lines and allowed them to
                        sound out the poetry when practicing recitations. During the lab day
                        recording, one individual from each pair of students volunteered to recite
                        aloud assigned selections of Shelley’s verse. </p>
                    <p>Following these activities, the engineering students returned to the ECE
                        Department with the recordings of both the Aeolian harp and poetry and
                        plotted their recordings in the time and frequency domain (using Short-time
                        Fourier Transform, or spectrogram) (Proakis and Menolakis). They compared
                        and contrasted the wind-excited harp data with the data collected from the
                        recited poetry. To analyze the harp data further, the students also
                        considered possible algorithms for separating the sound of the wind from
                        that of the harp. Moving on to the recited poetry, once students identified
                        the onset of words and/or specific syllables within the spectrogram, they
                        entered the next phase of the interdisciplinary collaboration, which
                        required the expertise of their peers from the Romantic poetry class. </p>
                    <p>We arranged a meeting between the two classes, with each group of students
                        arriving with their respective forms of individually prepared data analysis
                        (e.g., marked, prepared lines; spectrograms, etc.). In order to obtain
                        insight into the interpretation of spectrograms, the students listened to an
                        audio recording of an Aeolian harp (included at the end of this paragraph) and identified the signature of various aural features as
                        they appear within the spectrogram (shown in Figure 4). By listening to the
                        audio of the harp excited by the wind, one hears the harp’s overtones
                        sustained in time (which correspond to the long, horizontal lines in the
                        spectrogram in Figure 4) and abrupt flapping of the wind (which corresponds
                        to the vertical lines in the spectrogram, because the duration of the wind’s
                        noise is short in time). The harp is initially excited in the lower portion
                        of the frequency range, and a burst of higher frequency overtones begins
                        about halfway through the sample, rising briefly to frequencies above 1,500
                        Hz in the upper portion of the figure.<note place="foot">All spectrograms in

                    <p>While students in the English course guided engineering students in
                        understanding the range of poetic devices under consideration in Shelley’s
                        verse, students from the ECE course guided their peers studying literature
                        in interpreting the technical visualizations. In effect, each group’s
                        respective expertise fused to produce interdisciplinary interpretations of
                        the figures for the results sections of their collaboratively produced

                    <p> For reference, Figures 5 and 6 below present sample analyses of excerpts
                        from “Mont Blanc” showing the capacity for the spectrogram to reveal both
                        structural features of the poem and nuances of interpretation. A recording
                        of a selection from the first stanza of “Mont Blanc” can be found at the end of this paragraph, and the spectrogram of a short excerpt is provided in

                        visualization also permits personal interpretations to be compared side by
                        side (Figure 6), revealing differences in recitational tempo, caesura,
                        stress placement within poetic feet, and features of the natural timbre of
                        each reader’s voice.</p>

                            following phrase from “Mont Blanc”: “my human mind” (37). The first is
                            by a female voice (please click <ref

                                >here</ref> to listen to the audio file of this recording). The
                            temporal placement of each syllable, including the composite consonants
                            and vowels, are shown immediately above the plot. The tempo of the
                            second recitation is faster than the first and is therefore more
                            compressed in the plot. The caesuras appear as dark vertical areas.
                            Slight variations in pitch at the vowels can be discerned (these are the
                            curved structures) in both recitations, and while the recitations differ
                            in many ways, the spectrogram also reveals the presence of several
                            similar inflections. </figDesc>

                    <p>Pedagogically speaking, having students perform analyses such as those shown
                        in the figures above and build such evidence into technical papers provided
                        another opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration. The students in the
                        English course had writing-based techniques to share with the engineering
                        students, but these humanities students were generally unfamiliar with the
                        constraints of writing for a professional technical journal. Starting the
                        first week of the term, the engineering students prepared for this aspect of
                        the collaboration by performing a detailed analysis of several
                        representative technical papers in professional engineering
                        journals—stripping content until the papers were distilled into skeletal
                        forms. In one exercise, the students analyzed high-impact papers for
                        language usage and style, including variation in sentence length and
                        structure. In another, they focused on how the authors of transformative
                        papers incorporated engaging language into objective descriptions of
                        material not typically intended to evoke the kind of visceral response that
                        lends itself perhaps more naturally to imaginative prose. The resulting
                        templates included such information as the core elements of an abstract,
                        typical structure for an introduction, efficient presentation techniques for
                        the results of a literature search, and interesting ways to present a slew
                        of mathematical equations. Armed with these skeletal templates by the end of
                        the term’s first week, the engineering students prepared to flesh out their
                        templates with prose, section by section, as relevant materials were learned
                        during class time (e.g., mathematical theory, data, etc.). By the time that
                        the interdisciplinary group meeting on data analysis occurred, the
                        engineering students were able to prepare a draft of the theory,
                        experimental setup, and results sections of their papers, which they then
                        sent to their peers in the Romanticism course. </p>
                    <p>Having received their collaborators’ drafts, students in the English course
                        began the peer-editing process with the goal of helping their collaborators
                        to articulate and explain in greater detail the results of their
                        experiments. For example, students focused on inserting a range of
                        appositive phrases to qualify such things as definitions for consonance,
                        iambic pentameter, the different forms of poetic feet found in “Mont Blanc,”
                        caesura, alliteration, assonance, and so on. Using Microsoft Word’s “Track
                        Changes” function, these students were asked to focus their editorial
                        attention on matters related to the engineering student’s rhetoric and logic
                        as well as their articulation of ideas in sentence form (e.g., language,
                        diction, structure, etc.). The engineering students were not often familiar
                        with poetic terminology. In effect, students in the Romanticism course
                        helped their peers to qualify and expand upon definitions and explanations
                        of such things as depictions of Shelley’s biography, lyric poetry, and the
                        Aeolian harp. Each editing process was unique and depended on what each
                        engineering student found in his or her results, and so these student
                        collaborators could not fully predict what would become the focus of an
                        individual argument or set of evidence. In this way, students studying
                        English literature provided something like a real-world example of
                        collaborative, technical editing. Additionally, students in the Romanticism
                        course faced unfamiliar language, ideas, and results from a discipline far
                        removed from their own and to which they were assigned to add their own
                        knowledge about and expertise in Romantic-era poetry in order to help their
                        peers explain experimental results and articulate arguments in the form of
                        term papers. </p>
                    <p>Upon return of the peer-edited papers, the engineering students analyzed
                        their revised texts (using the template shown at the following <ref
                            target="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/burkett-catravas-DOCUMENT5.pdf"
                            >link</ref>) and checked editorial changes for technical accuracy,
                        accepting or rejecting edits and suggestions as needed. However, it was
                        found in a number of cases that suggested changes, although often
                        beautifully written, had to be set aside because they introduced technical
                        inaccuracies—from the engineering perspective—into the final report. As a
                        final class-time exercise, the engineering students participated in a
                        contest focused on the production of pithy writing. The winning entry
                        consisted of the sentence reduced by the largest percentage in word count
                        without changing its informational content or meaning. We read aloud to the
                        class both the initial and the revised versions of the five entries that had
                        claimed the largest percentage reductions in word count, and our students
                        voted on whether each improved sentence retained all of the original
                        information, disqualifying those that did not. </p>

                        that go beyond single author or disciplinary boundaries. “Nowadays, one
                        would be hard-pressed to find a term that is more frequently espoused and
                        valued in the humanities than ‘interdisciplinarity.’ These days, it seems
                        that everybody does interdisciplinary work,” writes Bewell, <quote>A strange
                            aspect of the manner in which English professors think about
                            interdisciplinarity . . . is that it does not usually involve
                            collaboration with people outside of our discipline. Whereas elsewhere
                            in the university, interdisciplinarity usually involves bringing people
                            from different disciplines together in order to address a common issue
                            that extends beyond disciplinary boundaries, English interdisciplinary
                            research is usually done by loners. Most academics in the humanities
                            engage with other disciplines through books. They rarely write
                            collaboratively, preferring instead to write single-authored articles
                            and monographs. (393-94) </quote> Our collaboration has been envisioned
                        from the start as uniting students and faculty from departments that are
                        very rarely thought of together for either contemporary research or
                        pedagogical projects. We did so in the space of the experimental laboratory
                        environment instead of a conventional literature classroom in order to
                        promote intimate intellectual interactions and experiments among students
                        studying vastly different topics, concepts, techniques, and procedures.<note
                            place="foot">We furthermore follow Alan Bewell’s following
                            clarification: “In saying that English interdisciplinarity is different
                            from other forms of this activity at the university, I am not making a
                            complaint, but instead stressing the limitations of what English
                            interdisciplinarity usually entails” (394). That is, our lab-based,
                            collective group investigation is not meant to be understood as
                            undermining the relevance or importance of interdiscursive work but,
                            rather, is enacted as a way of expanding research and teaching-based
                            activities beyond traditional horizons. </note> This study thus allows
                        us to promote interdisciplinary skills and approaches as opposed to what
                        Linda Hutcheon and Michael Hutcheon have referred to as “interdiscursive”
                        work, a “term to describe people who remain, inevitably, disciplinarily
                        trained but borrow from other disciplines” (1371). Further clarifying this
                        concept, Alan Richardson has recently observed that “interdiscursive”
                        research often involves “reading across disciplinary boundaries and
                        selectively incorporating elements of another discipline’s vocabulary,
                        without placing one’s home disciplinary perspective into sustained, mutually
                        vulnerable, and potentially transformative dialogue with the rival
                        perspectives of colleagues trained in significantly different areas, with
                        different methods and aims” (x). By prompting our students to understand
                        that their research is not only cooperative but also that no single disciple
                        may actually lay an exclusive claim to the types of questions, issues, and
                        ideas under investigation during these group activities, we have sought to
                        encourage a type of critical thinking that moves beyond the tired binaries
                        of, for example, “humanities” <emph>versus </emph>“sciences” in favor of
                        seeking rigor while pursuing interdisciplinarity. </p>
                    <p>This cross-disciplinary investigation showed all involved in the
                        collaboration the ways that contemporary technologies can assist in seeing
                        anew what were already Romantic forms and formulations of technology.
                        Ultimately, modern technology enabled historical recovery. Listening to the
                        Aeolian harp excited our imaginations to ask new questions about Shelley’s
                        poetry in particular and, more generally, about a previous historical epoch
                        often perceived as far removed from our own. The act of listening to the
                        sounds of this Romantic device served as a gateway into investigation of the
                        dramatic variety of sounds found in Shelley’s poetry in its historical
                            context.<note place="foot">In a related example, binaural recording has
                            rich potential for both the study and performance of Romantic lyric
                            falling under the category of closet drama. Dramatic works like <title
                                level="m">Prometheus Unbound </title>(1820), for instance,
                            intentionally make use of the inner ear of the human imagination, given
                            that Shelley’s lyrical drama was most likely intended for private
                            recitation. As Suzanne L. Barnett has recently noted in her review of
                            the 2013 “performance” of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound </title>as
                            a staged reading at New York City’s Lucille Lortel Theatre, this
                            generally “unstageable” work poses significant challenges when executed
                            via stage performances (Barnett). Binaural technology may be uniquely
                            suited for realizing and archiving such dramatic interpretations of
                            ostensibly “unstageable” poetic dramas, given that audiences can
                            actively experience the work largely devoid of physical forms. This
                            technology provides opportunities to integrate the insights of scholarly
                            work with creative impulses to produce dynamic performances touching
                            both general audiences and research communities.</note> Furthermore, the
                        recordings of “Mont Blanc” made in Phasor Lab allowed students to practice a
                        host of recitational techniques important for understanding further English
                        Romantic verse, and the three-dimensional nature of the binaural recordings
                        (as opposed to, say, recordings made via smartphones) prompted students to
                        recite Shelley’s poetry to the binaural head as if they were communicating
                        with a placeholder for a future audience to listen to these lines of verse.
                        In this way, the harp directed us to a set of Romantic poetic concerns (both
                        formal and conceptual) that assisted our students in their literary as well
                        as media archaeological reconstructions of an open range of potential ways
                        in which, on the one hand, “Mont Blanc” might have been intended by Shelley
                        to be sounded out while also exploring, on the other hand, how contemporary
                        recitations of the poem might be inherently delimited by Shelley’s original
                        poetic devices. </p>
