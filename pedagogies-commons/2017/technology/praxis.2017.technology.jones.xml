            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount"> The Romantic period saw an explosion of printed material, ushered
                    in by the end of perpetual copyright in 1774, new technologies that led the
                    charge toward mass production, and the nearly insatiable appetite of a newly
                    formed reading public. The concept of information overload far predates that
                    contemporary term; in the Romantic period, like today, expanded access made the
                    feeling more acute. Many Romantic readers felt the need, with the surfeit of
                    information, to make their engagement more lasting. One way Romantic readers—and
                    our students—could meet this need is through collection, and later indexing and
                    reflection, in commonplace books. This article explores adopting a sustained
                    practice of commonplacing in online classes as a way for students to position
                    themselves as best they can as Romantic readers, confronting in the internet age
                    a similar expansion of ideas and information. It details a semester-long project
                    that pushes students to move from collection and organization to synthesis and
                    reflection. Students keep individual commonplace books, contribute to a
                    class-wide commonplace book, and reorganize and reflect upon their shared
                    commonplace book in place of a traditional final exam. The purpose of these
                    assignments is to foster students’ understanding of the historical and personal
                    value of the commonplace book as a genre and to ensure students’ engagement with
                    thematic threads within the Romantic period. Assignment sheets and “quick start”
                    guides for students are made available with this article, along with a reference
                    aid for those interested in incorporating these assignments in their classrooms.

                    <p>In 1751, at the nascence of the print-saturated age that would continue to
                        see unprecedented heights, Samuel Johnson invented a figurative use for the
                        term ephemera in his <ref
                            target="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004772607.0001.005/1:5.3?rgn=div2;view=fulltext"
                                ><title level="m">Rambler</title> 145</ref>. The insect whose life
                        spans a mere day becomes equivalent in Johnson’s terms to newspapers, “the
                            <emph>Ephemerae </emph>of learning,” those “productions . . . seldom
                        intended to remain in the world longer than a week” (Johnson). Despite his
                        defense of these writers of ephemera, Johnson’s turn of phrase nonetheless
                        carries notions of death and decay. The printed page loses its value when it
                        loses its immortality, Johnson reports, and when its production outstrips
                        its longevity. </p>
                    <p>Johnson’s claim, though intended solely for periodical publications, presages
                        the publishing boom to come. The Romantic period saw an explosion of printed
                        material, ushered in by the end of perpetual copyright in 1774, new
                        technologies that led the charge toward mass production, and the nearly
                        insatiable appetite of a newly formed reading public.<note place="foot">See
                            H.J. Jackson’s Introduction to <hi rend="italic">Romantic Readers</hi>,
                            pages 7-9 in particular. Matthew Taunton’s article “Print Culture” for
                            the British Library provides accessible information on Romantic and
                            Victorian print technologies.</note></p>
                    <p>There is debate over the extent to which this “reading revolution” is
                        particularly Romantic, with H. J. Jackson making the case that literacy
                        rates were on the rise before the Romantic period and mass production would
                        not come until the Victorian age. Even if these technologies had not
                        practically realized the boom in production and distribution of knowledge,
                        their presence and promise changed the conversation about reading and
                        publishing. We can reconsider the term “revolution” without denying there
                        was considerably more print for Romantic readers and that readers’
                        engagement with any material could now be ephemeral. The concept of
                        information overload far predates that contemporary term; in the Romantic
                        period, like today, expanded access made the feeling more acute. Many
                        Romantic readers felt the need, with the surfeit of information, to make
                        their engagement more lasting. One way Romantic readers—and our
                        students—could meet this need is through collection, and later indexing and
                        reflection, in commonplace books. </p>
                    <p>Commonplace books allowed Romantic readers to confront the overload of
                        printed pages by editing their own volumes, pushing back against the new
                        technology through a deliberately antiquated and painstaking form of
                        collection and transcription revived, as William St. Clair notes, from “the
                        manuscript miscellanies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries” (226).
                        The desire to order information is not foreign to traditional student
                        populations, millennials who are digital natives, or even the population I
                        teach, nontraditional students in online and distance degree completion
                        programs. The world is one where Buzzfeed has perfected the art of the
                        listicle, programs like Pinterest and Tumblr allow users simple forums
                        through which to bookmark, follow, and find. As the most popular search
                        engine, Google’s <ref target="https://www.google.com/about/">stated
                            mission</ref> is “to organize the world’s information and make it
                        universally accessible and useful.” Through adopting a sustained practice of
                        commonplacing, my students and I position ourselves as best we can as
                        Romantic readers, confronting in the internet age a similar expansion of
                        ideas and information. </p>
                    <p>Asking students to inhabit the genre through an integrated and sustained set
                        of hands-on activities that reimagine the means of traditional recall,
                        synthesis, and analysis expands their grasp of the historical factors that
                        condition texts. Commonplacing literally and figuratively collapses the
                        distance between texts, drawing them into a conversation that resembles the
                        way Romantic readers met these same works. We encounter our readings, not as
                        discrete works of genius huddled under authors’ names in anthologies, but as
                        part of a larger cultural conversation integrally tied to those who produce
                        literature and to those who consumed and still consume these works. There is
                        something powerful in confronting the materiality of texts—even,
                        paradoxically, through digital means—that, at its best, empowers students as
                        readers, collapsing the distance between their experience and what can seem
                        so foreign. </p>
                    <p>I developed the “Commonplacing Our Semester” project for an online course,
                        English 411: British Romantic Literature, to be offered to students in an
                        interdisciplinary degree completion program. The semester-long project
                        pushes students to move from collection and organization to synthesis and
                        reflection. Students keep individual commonplace books, contribute to a
                        class-wide commonplace book, and reorganize and reflect upon their shared
                        commonplace book in place of a traditional final exam. The purpose of these
                        assignments is to foster students’ understanding of the historical and
                        personal value of the commonplace book as a genre and to ensure students’
                        engagement with thematic threads within the Romantic period. I prescribe
                        fixed parameters for the class-wide commonplace book, leaving the individual
                        assignment more fluid and open to creative, yet still historically relevant,
                        interpretations. As our commonplacing is a sustained project, I take pains
                        to create continuity in style and structure across teaching materials,
                        including assignment sheets and “quick start” guides for students (which are
                        made available with this article, along with a reference aid for those
                        interested in incorporating these assignments in their classrooms).<note
                            place="foot">PDFs of my teaching materials are available under figures
                            1, 3, 5, and 6.</note></p>
                    <p>Students initiate their understanding of the genre though archival research
                        of commonplace books housed in the <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu"
                            >Harvard University Library’s Open Collections Program</ref> and further
                        their understanding through adopting the practice themselves. Students’
                        research informs their choice of purpose and technology for their individual
                        commonplace books. The class-wide commonplace book takes John Locke as its
                        model. Commonplace books allowed readers to amass information, similar to
                        the way blogs and social media forums offer records or catalogs of
                        information. Some Romantic readers, influenced by Locke’s popular treatise
                            <ref target="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3209685"><title
                                level="m">A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books</title></ref>
                        (1706), used indexing to track commonalities. This added layer of
                        organization was not an end unto itself; it was meant to spur further
                        critical thought, with usefulness, according to Locke, the chief goal of
                        commonplacing. </p>

                        program that may in comparison look rudimentary but allows users to
                        manipulate the page beyond sequential readings or targeted searches for
                        single items. Students transcribe weekly quotations, devising what Locke
                        called “heads” for the index, motifs or tags for each quotation. Students
                        refine their thinking in the final exam, which requires a further
                        reorganization of the collected quotations and heads into thematic threads.
                        To successfully complete the exam, students must return to our semester’s
                        work to find <emph>common places</emph> among what they collectively and
                        cumulatively have contributed. Looking back, they recognize patterns that
                        have emerged in our thinking about Romanticism and how we might define
                        Romanticism given our class’s concerns. Their accompanying essays take up
                        issues of process—how and why students chose the themes they did—and
                        consider Romanticism as both an intellectual movement and historical period.
                        The two parts of the exam help students synthesize the wealth of material we
                        have gathered over the course of the semester into manageable pieces that
                        suggest larger questions of categorizing the Romantic period.</p>

                    <head>Curating an Online Experience</head>
                    <p>Effective use of technology is essential to my teaching, as most of my
                        courses are taught either asynchronously and wholly online or through other
                        distance means. The online course is its own genre, dependent upon the
                        written word as its means of communication. In contrast to live discussion,
                        participants, both students and instructors, craft and (ideally) have time
                        to polish what it is they want to say. But reading 250 words is a different
                        experience than hearing 250 words. My most successful online courses avoid
                        attempting to replicate the experience of a live classroom. I attempt,
                        instead, to embrace the genre, working within the limitations and the
                        possibilities of the virtual classroom. </p>
                    <p>As online educators, we are curators of the learning experience. Embracing
                        the medium through which we communicate with students involves not simply
                        amassing information but reimagining it. The majority of my students are
                        taking full course loads online, in addition to their 9-to-5 jobs, which
                        require many more hours in front of a computer screen. Not only do I
                        organize learning modules with information overload in mind, but I also draw
                        this concept into the virtual classroom. With its dependence upon the
                        written word, our digital medium reflects commonplacers’ active engagement
                        with written text. Even the social aspects of commonplacing—circulating the
                        book among friends, transcribing a favorite line or penning an original
                        verse for its owner—use written modes of communication. We, too, rely on the
                        written word.</p>
                    <p>In my experience, providing students with as much detail as possible about
                        major assignments upfront—despite the potential for information
                        overload—assuages student fears in an online learning environment. I
                        introduce the semester-long engagement with commonplace books in the
                        course’s first learning module with a lengthy assignment sheet I title
                        “Commonplacing Our Semester.” (Link to the full document through Figure 1
                        below.) </p>

                    <p>The introductory sections of this assignment sheet link Romantic reading
                        experiences with our own, specifically through the “Consider while
                        Commonplacing” box on page 2. This part asks students to consider modern
                        equivalents of commonplacing through tagging, sharing to save, and
                        bookmarking, while introducing terms common in modern conversations about
                        technology—information overload fatigue and information literacy. The last
                        page of the assignment sheet reassures students that feeling information
                        overload is an intentional part of our learning experience. </p>
                    <p>After a brief introduction to commonplacing as a Romantic practice, the
                        assignment sheet details the four component parts of the semester-long
                        project: archival research of primary source material; an individual
                        commonplace book that students propose and keep throughout the semester; a
                        class-wide commonplace book they share digitally with their colleagues; and
                        a final exam that requires reorganization and reflection upon the shared
                        piece. Despite my desire for transparency, I leave off details of the final
                        exam until late in the semester so that students’ commonplacing stems from
                        their experience of the weekly readings and our exploratory discussions, not
                        from a prescribed end goal. These four components total a little over 40% of
                        students’ final grades, as explained in Figure 2 below, with the remainder
                        of the semester’s final grade divided among a close reading essay (20%),
                        researched argument (25%), and participation on discussion boards (15%). </p>

                    <p>I am keenly aware that assignment sheets, especially in a wholly online
                        format, can add to information overload. But a digital classroom does not
                        allow for asides and clarifications that occur when reviewing a document in
                        person. Structure is key to producing materials that are thorough yet
                        manageable. Repeated visual elements within and across the two assignments
                        sheets underscore significant requirements and guide students to see the
                        project as a whole. </p>

                        institutions and for students whose resources may be limited. Harvard’s
                        open-access resource offers millions of digitized pages, curated into six
                        themed projects. The project we use, the Reading collection, houses
                        manuscript and printed material related to reading as a solitary and social
                        practice, including a subsection for <ref

                        information that can overwhelm the online learner accessing them on a home
                        PC. </p>
                    <p>To ease this potential information overload, I developed a <title level="m"
                            >Quick Start Guide to the Harvard Collections</title> (linked below in
                        Figure 3) with visual steps for accessing and navigating the archive, along
                        with explanations of Harvard’s terminology, tips for the site, and links to
                        pertinent Romantic materials. Harvard’s selections span the seventeenth to
                        the nineteenth centuries and five languages, in both printed and manuscript
                        forms. The database provides digital surrogates, often without
                        transcriptions or translations, which can be daunting for undergraduates.
                        Few of the books themselves are fully searchable, but the links on the
                        commonplace book <ref

                        shown in Figure 3 below, I direct students to read first the ten commonplace
                        books linked in the overview section on the homepage. I then ask that they

                        visual and organizational patterns. Even if students cannot always read the
                        language (or the handwriting), what comes into focus is that there is
                        variety within accepted formats. Students share their findings through
                        discussion board posts from which we craft a working definition of the

                    <head>Applying the Theory: Individual and Shared Commonplace Books</head>
                    <p>Once we have compiled a rough definition of the genre, we move to practices
                        of commonplacing. The freedom within boundaries that characterizes Romantic
                        commonplace books is why I assign two forms: the individual and shared
                        commonplace books, both requiring weekly entries that engage that module’s
                        readings. The individual commonplace book’s grade is based on a brief
                        proposal and electronic submission of the commonplace book in full at the
                        end of the semester. Even if students wait to compile all entries at the
                        close of the semester, they will still meet the goals for this component:
                        self-directed engagement with assigned readings and parsing connections
                        between the historical facets of the genre and modern resonances of
                        commonplace books.</p>
                    <p>The assignment sheet’s section “To Consider When Writing Your Proposal”
                        suggests possible purposes, entries, and technologies to guide students’
                        proposals, but they are not bound by these suggestions. Students, like their
                        Romantic predecessors, may choose to collect only particular types of
                        material (poetry, for example, like this nineteenth-century <ref

                        prescribed format taken up by many commonplacers in the eighteenth and
                        nineteenth centuries, one adapted from John Locke’s <ref

                        of commonplacing, along with the recipient, Jean Le Clerc’s, prefatory
                        advice for commonplacers, both of which I assign to students.<note

                        of commonplace books—that “it is of Service to have Collections of this
                        Kind, both that Students may learn the Art of putting Things in Order, as
                        also the better retain what they Read” (sequence 13). What Locke adds—and
                        what publishers later capitalize on—is a clear methodology for keeping an
                        index. </p>
                    <p>This organizational principle, in brief, involves an index with what Locke
                        calls “heads,” what literarily we would call motifs, or, on the internet,
                        tags. (I consciously use the term “heads” since a primary learning outcome
                        for this component is for students to apply practically Locke’s theory.)
                        Locke’s method, in its most simplified form, is as follows: at the beginning
                        or end of the book, the commonplacer designates blank pages with
                        alphabetical columns into which heads are accumulated, as seen below in
                        Figure 4. When adding content throughout the commonplace book, the
                        commonplacer keeps running heads in the margins of the pages that are then
                        cross-referenced in the index with the page number. Even in our simplified
                        form (explained in more detail in the next section), indexing requires
                        students to move beyond note taking to employing pattern recognition and
                        engagement with literary motifs. “Locke’s ‘New Method,’” Stephen Colclough
                        notes, “still encouraged readers to record extracts from their reading under
                        headings, but these were now to emerge from their reading rather than
                        dictate it” (33). My students, like the Romantics before them, engage in an
                        active process of reading and interacting with material collected that
                        results in an intentionally ordered book instead of a dizzying collection of
                        quotations with little use beyond their initial transcription. </p>

                    <p>After completing research into Locke’s method of indexing, specifically by
                        reading Locke’s guide and referencing commonplace books styled after his
                        method linked in the Commonplacing Our Semester assignment sheet, students
                        begin weekly entries on our Padlet wall. Each entry consists of two parts: a
                        single quotation from that week’s textbook reading and “heads” (Locke’s term
                        for motifs or tags) added to the index that the student generated for this
                        quotation. </p>
                    <p>To prepare for weekly entries to the class-wide commonplace book, I
                        prearrange and embed a Padlet wall with the index, consisting of separate
                        text boxes (what Padlet terms “posts”) for each letter of the alphabet,
                        followed by a subheading for weekly entries, as shown in Figures 7 and 8.
                        One shortcoming of Padlet is that the virtual surface stops immediately
                        after the last post, which impedes maneuverability. I add a “placeholder”
                        post, seen in Figure 8, dragging it down the page until there is ample space
                        for students to add entries. </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The basic form of an entry, seen in Figure 9, includes three parts: a
                        student’s name and module week number in the title line; the material from
                        that week’s reading the student wishes to contribute; and a list of running
                        heads, which are the motifs the student assigns to the passage quoted. I
                        limit the length of quotations (10 lines for poetry, 250 words for prose) to
                        keep the page manageable and to avoid another potential form of information
                        overload. I offer bonus points for students who add heads to their
                        classmates’ posts, denoted by their name in parentheses after the head, as
                        in the figure below where Student B has added “innocence” and “experience”
                        to another student’s entry. Padlet also offers an unobtrusive way to attach
                        documents to text box entries with explanations as to why students selected
                        the particular passage.<note place="foot">I only require explanations if
                            students wish to post a quotation that has already been chosen by a
                            fellow classmate. In this case, students would note “Duplicate Entry”
                            with their classmate’s name in the text box, along with a list of heads,
                            and attach a paragraph justifying their inclusion of this passage. The
                                <title level="m">Quick Start Guide for Padlet</title>, page 5,
                            includes an example of a duplicate entry. Although the first-come,
                            first-served nature might be a detraction, I do not disallow or
                            discourage duplicate entries since, as Adam Hooks <ref
                                target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html"
                                >notes</ref>, commonplaces tend to be <emph>common</emph>, both

                    <p>The second weekly requirement is to add the heads students have generated to
                        the alphabetical index at the top of the wall, along with entries for author
                        (in boldface) and title (styled according to MLA rules and followed by the
                        author’s name in parentheses), as in Figure 10. Students must be diligent
                        about checking the index so as to add heads created by classmates that they
                        might not have considered, but which are relevant to their contributions. </p>

                    <p>Whereas printed commonplace books allow for page numbers to be added to the
                        index, Padlet’s digital surface provides a continuous screen, unbroken by
                        discrete sections. To replicate the cross-referencing gained through
                        pagination, I ask students at the end of the semester to further organize
                        the class-wide commonplace book so that entries are grouped according to
                        larger thematic concerns germane to our ongoing discussions of Romanticism.
                        This final requirement of the semester-long commonplace book assignment
                        (which counts as the final exam) has two graded parts: the reorganization of
                        quotations and heads on Padlet and an accompanying essay explaining
                        students’ rationale for this new organization. The exam requires students to
                        choose thematic threads to act as umbrella concepts under which the
                        accumulated quotations and heads could be housed. I limit the exam to six to
                        eight thematic threads, with all heads distributed among the themes and only
                        five quotations assigned to each. The final exam assignment sheet, available
                        under Figure 1, explains this process in further detail. Steps for realizing
                        this assignment in Padlet are included in the <title level="m">Quick

                    <p>One benefit of this assignment is its cumulative nature, which happens by way
                        of students returning to our class-wide commonplace, not for revision but
                        for reimagining, informed by the whole of the semester and the work of
                        classmates. In this, the assignment may realize the best of what we would
                        hope from all of our social media: the collection and distribution of
                        knowledge that gains from its communal nature new perspectives on that which
                        is shared.</p>

                    <p>In a digital age, we confront, as Romantic readers did, the limits of media.
                        How does—or should—one preserve ephemera? What does it mean to collect
                        within a digital medium—a repository that is intentionally not tangible,
                        unable to be physically held or even held in the promise of perpetuity? One
                        way to address these questions is to adopt a means of collection that is
                        less passive than the now familiar modes of bookmarking, sharing to save,
                        and tagging. </p>
                    <p>Reflecting a practice Romantic readers perfected, our commonplacing combats
                        information overload. It also allows for a sense of ownership over material
                        students often feel distanced from, a feeling shared by Romantic compilers,
                        many of whom were excluded from purchasing printed books but who could
                        fashion their own via commonplacing. Romantic commonplace books reflected
                        their compiler’s individual tastes but, paradoxically, were also “frequently
                        the work of multiple hands and circulated among multiple readers within
                        particular circles of friends” (Lynch 137). We, too, compile our own texts,
                        sharing not only insights gleaned from the texts but also the act of
                        creation. Using the means available to us in the digital age, we embody, as
                        best we can, the place of Romantic readers. </p>
