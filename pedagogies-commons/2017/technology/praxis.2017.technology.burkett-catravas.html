               <h2><span class="head">Overview of the Project</span></h2>
               <p>In a recent cross-disciplinary project aimed at bridging courses in English and Electrical
                  Engineering at Union College, we conducted a dual exploration of the role of sound
                  in Romantic literature, culture, and technology by the incorporation of Electrical
                  Engineering practices and technologies into a Romanticism course, on the one hand,
                  and, on the other, the introduction of Romantic poetry, theory, and technology into
                  a course on digital signal processing. The collaboration brought together two intermediate-level
                  courses: “The Romantic Revolution” and “Discrete Systems.” More specifically, we devised
                  an interdisciplinary team experience bringing humanities and engineering approaches
                  to the analysis of the phenomenon of sound as represented in poetry and technology
                  of the Romantic period. We used contemporary technology from Phasor Lab (a state-of-the-art
                  facility located at Union College’s Peter Irving Wold Center for Science and Engineering)
                  to measure poetic sound with scientific instrumentation. This trans-disciplinary lab
                  required English students to work in conjunction with their peers who specialize in
                  signal processing for a dual investigation of the conceptual, aesthetic, and technological
                  contexts of Romantic sound—not only of the poetry but also the age’s beloved Aeolian
                  lyre. </p>
               <p>Students first examined the spectral content of an Aeolian harp, an instrument that
                  fascinated Romantic-period poets and inspired many lyrical poems, including Samuel
                  Taylor Coleridge’s “Effusion 35” (1795) (later titled “The Eolian Harp” [p. 1796])
                  as well as Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “Mont Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamouni”
                  (1817). In addition, engineering students recorded, processed, and analyzed student
                  recitations of Romantic poetry related to the Aeolian harp; these students then collaborated
                  with their peers from the Romanticism course to label formal aspects of the poetry
                  (e.g., assonance, alliteration, rhyme, meter, poetic feet, etc.), using forms specific
                  to each discipline. Student teams from the two courses offered simultaneously by the
                  English and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Departments ultimately produced
                  co-authored term papers in the style of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics
                  Engineers) conference papers (intended for an engineering audience). While writing
                  the reports, engineering students focused on composing the technical aspects of the
                  project, while literature students provided prose related to literary and historical
                  aspects of Romanticism. The literature students took the lead in the peer-editing
                  process and also became familiar with aspects of technical writing.</p>
               <p>In this essay, we detail the various technologies and techniques—including binaural
                  recording and the Short-time Fourier Transform—that we have employed in this collaboration,
                  as well as the vital functions that Romantic poetic and sound technologies played
                  in the classroom and lab environments at our liberal arts institution during this
                  multi-year project. We focus on the role of Romanticism in the hybrid humanities-engineering
                  classroom at a small undergraduate college and foreground the value of contemporary
                  technologies in the study of historical understandings of sound.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Introduction: Interdisciplinary Collaborations</span></h2>
               <p>This collaboration began as a result of several boot camps that occurred at the 2013
                  The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp), “Humanities + Engineering” at Union
                  College. We required students from our respective core sophomore-level courses in
                  British Romantic studies and ECE to attend a session on “Music + Engineering,” where
                  the engineering students delivered an interactive demonstration on signal processing
                  techniques to a diverse group of non-experts from various disciplines and fields.
                  As an example, the students described the concepts of time and frequency domain analysis
                  and the use of the Fourier Transform to decompose sound into its composite frequencies.
                  The student populations enrolled in these two courses spanned several majors and minors
                  including English, Art History, Bioengineering, and Music. The ECE course on digital
                  signal processing, for example, is required by three engineering programs at Union
                  College (Electrical, Computer, and Bioengineering), and all majors and minors at our
                  academic institution enroll in sophomore-level courses offered by the English Department.

                  <p>During the dynamic and engaging question-and-answer session that followed this THATCamp
                     event, we began discussing the possibilities of recording and analyzing natural sounds
                     occurring outside of human structures and institutions. For instance, we pondered
                     the differences between environmental and musical sounds as well as the types of sounds
                     created during the recitation of poetry. This conversation led us to think about the
                     nature and function of the Aeolian harp, a wind harp placed outside in fields but
                     most often during the Romantic period in open window casements or in other domestic
                     settings in which natural breezes impact the tuned strings of the harp, thus setting
                     them harmonically into motion. While the Aeolian harp was invented in an earlier period,
                     it is well known that the device became an absolute fascination during the Romantic
                     era, and poets such as Coleridge and Shelley often employed the trope of the harp
                     in both poetry and prose. In fact, Timothy Morton has noted that the Aeolian harp
                     “became a household item as popular and familiar in the long eighteenth century as
                     sound systems are today” (313). “The Aeolian harp is an environmental instrument,”
                     writes Morton, “[o]ne places the harp in a window, so that it will catch the undulations
                     of wind” (313). As “a form of recording or monitoring” of the environment, the Aeolian
                     harp is actually closer <span class="quote">‘to science than to art, nearer to modern sensors and seismographs . . . than to the
                        idea of an “art object,” something in a frame, in an exhibition space or in an anthology,
                        discrete, separated, isolated, and focused. Such instruments modulate one wave (wind
                        in the case of the Aeolian harp) in terms of another wave (sound waves produced by
                        the strings). (Morton 313)’</span> Through an internal grant, we were able to purchase not only a contemporary, commercially
                     manufactured wind harp for use outdoors but also the type of period-specific casement
                     harp described by Morton—a replica harp that was hand-crafted by a professional luthier
                     and modeled upon Romantic-period originals.

                     </div> Our work with these devices prompted us to consider the following question: given
                     late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century interests in this instrument as well
                     as its function in verse as a lyrical trope, what about Romanticism might particularly
                     lend itself to technologically infused or enhanced pedagogical approaches and assignments
                     related to this device and some of the poetry it helped to inspire?</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Despite the fact that the Romantics are often perceived as critiquing rampant industrialization,
                     technological questions and concerns can be found throughout even the most celebrated
                     and foundational texts of the period. Shelley, for instance, compared the human body—and
                     especially the human sensorium—to something like a radically complex machine akin
                     to the Aeolian harp. He famously writes in the opening paragraphs of his “A Defence
                     of Poetry” (c. 1821) that <span class="quote">‘[m]an is an instrument over which a series of external and internal impressions are
                        driven, like the alternations of an ever-changing wind over an Æolian lyre, which
                        move it by their motion to ever-changing melody. But there is a principle within the
                        human being, and perhaps within all sentient beings, which acts otherwise than in
                        the lyre, and produces not melody alone, but harmony, by an internal adjustment of
                        the sounds or motions thus excited to the impressions which excite them. (Shelley
                        511)’</span> Shelley here revises and extends his earlier understanding and interpretation of the
                     nature and function of the Aeolian lyre as treated in poems such as “Mutability (‘We
                     are as clouds’)” (1816) and, perhaps more significantly, “Mont Blanc.” The prompting
                     of human cognitive functions through sensory stimuli might be analogous to environmental
                     winds shocking into life an Aeolian harp, Shelley suggests in the “Defence,” but this
                     analogy goes far beyond any simple, one-to-one correspondence because “within the
                     human being” there exists “an internal adjustment” to external stimuli—an adjustment
                     that is best understood as not only self-reflexive but also as existing in dialectical
                     relation with the “impressions” from an external world. For Shelley, then, analysis
                     of the Aeolian harp ultimately leads to a conception of subject-object relations as
                     existing in complex feedback loops, or perhaps better stated, human subject and external
                     environment are always already deeply interfused for Shelley. This is a sentiment
                     that the poet expressed just a few years earlier in “Mont Blanc”:

               <p>Reconsidering his earlier statement in this poem that the “everlasting universe of
                  things / Flows through the mind” (1-2), Shelley suggests in the lines above that human
                  cognitive functions might very well “passively . . . receiv[e] fast influencings”
                  from external environments, but cognitive functions also very much <em>render</em> their environments as well. According to Shelley, minds and worlds thus exist in
                  reciprocal relationships akin to what William Wordsworth famously describes as that
                  “mighty world / Of eye and ear, both what they half-create, / And what perceive” (106-108).</p>
               <p>Extending Shelley’s Romantic-era understanding of the human-environment dialectic
                  to the technological, John Tresch contrasts the “classical machine,” “[e]xemplified
                  by the clock, the lever, or the balance” and “seen as a passive transmitter of external
                  forces, as a symbol of balance and eternal order” representative of “a stable, determinist
                  nature and . . . associated with an epistemology of rational, unfeeling detachment”
                  (12), with what he terms the “Romantic machine,” epitomized by, for example, the Aeolian
                  harp: <span class="quote">‘The exemplary machines of the romantic era . . . could be seen to have their own
                     motive force within them; they were presented as ambiguously alive. . . . In the early
                     nineteenth century, machines were not exclusively associated with detachment, rationality,
                     and fixity, but with the conversions, imaginative flights, and metamorphoses of the
                     fantastic. They drew forth invisible powers, converted them, and put them to use.
                     Unlike the classical machine, the romantic machine did not stand alone; it involved
                     the active participation of the observer and articulated a spontaneous, living, and
                     constantly developing nature; it produced aesthetic effects and emotional states.
                     (12)’</span> Romantic-era intellectuals like Coleridge and Shelley were drawn to the Aeolian harp
                  and gave treatment to the device repeatedly in their writings because this instrument
                  represented at first an analogue but ultimately a metaphor for the type of “active
                  participation” that they each envisioned human subjects experiencing while moving
                  through dynamic and vital (if also deeply unpredictable) external environments. For
                  these reasons, “[t]he Aeolian harp looks backwards to a poetics of place and of the
                  genius of place; and forwards to a poetics of automation, an uncanny foreknowledge
                  in the cultural imaginary of recording technologies,” as Morton has persuasively explained
                  (327).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Data Acquisition and Analysis: Binaural Recordings</span></h2>
               <p>Inspired by not only the Romantic preoccupation with this “recording” device but also
                  by contemporary investigations of the Aeolian harp as both technological instrument
                  and literary trope in recent Romantic criticism and theory, students in the Romanticism
                  course studied the basic elements of poetic rhyme and meter as well as other related
                  matters pertaining to the study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century poetics
                  (e.g., assonance, consonance, enjambment, varieties of poetic feet, etc.) in poems
                  such as “The Eolian Harp,” “Mutability,” and “Mont Blanc.” A unique setup awaited
                  the English students in the ECE Department’s laboratory, where poetic readings were
                  recorded binaurally so that the recordings would reproduce an uncanny, three-dimensional
                  sense of sound directionality as perceived by a listener at a particular position.
                  In order to prepare to collaborate during our cross-disciplinary laboratory investigation,
                  we selected “Mont Blanc” as our focus text due to the poem’s emphasis on the nature
                  and function of sound as well as its various engagements with themes and concepts
                  related to the Aeolian lyre. During the first three weeks of the course in Romanticism,
                  students were introduced to a range of basic poetic devices, techniques, and terms
                  studied during close readings and critical investigations of a range of other canonical
                  Romantic-era texts (e.g., Wordsworth’s 1799 edition of <em>The Prelude</em>). In addition to the formal aspects of poetry, students in the English course simultaneously
                  explored the conceptual and historical foundations of Romanticism.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile across campus, engineering students learned fundamentals of digital signal
                  processing, including sampling and quantization, the Nyquist Theorem, the concepts
                  of time and frequency domain, the Fourier Transform, as well as spectrogram and digital
                  filtering techniques. The Nyquist Theorem provides guidance on how to acquire a signal
                  (such as a recorded sound) without artifacts, and the time and frequency domain, the
                  Fourier Transform, and spectrogram and digital filtering permit the study and processing
                  of the signal’s spectral content. Students also learned a technique for filtering
                  signals to remove selected frequency components, which can potentially separate a
                  signal with two or more simultaneously occurring contributions into independent components.
                  In order to emphasize to the students that the signal processing techniques are general
                  and can be applied to the investigation of signals acquired from a range of sources—poetic,
                  musical, environmental, and otherwise—the students performed a blind analysis of data
                  from a “mystery source.” Only after completing the assignment was it revealed that
                  a neurobiologist had provided the data. </p>
               <p>Having briefly introduced both groups of students to Coleridge’s representation of
                  the Aeolian harp as “that simplest lute” which “by the desultory breeze caressed”
                  produces “long sequacious notes / [that] [o]ver delicious surges sink and rise” and
                  which create, in effect, “a soft floating witchery of sound” (13, 15, 19-20, 21),
                  we chose to auralize (and therefore literalize) for the group during laboratory time
                  the sound that, in part, evoked Romantic poets’ imaginative literary descriptions
                  of this device’s sounds. We first sampled a recording made from a contemporary, commercially
                  manufactured wind harp. This modern interpretation of the Aeolian harp is shown below
                  (Figure 1) against an ominous, late-October Schenectady sky, and a recording of it
                  being played by the wind (audible as background noise underneath the sustained, eerie
                  sounds of the harp) can be heard through the following <a class="link_ref" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/burkett-catravas-FILE1.MOV">link</a>.</p>

               <p>This recording was then contrasted with one made available from a period-specific
                  casement harp, which was crafted for us by a luthier specializing in the reproduction
                  of nineteenth-century wind instruments (Figure 2). Listening to the type of technology
                  that excited the imaginations of several Romantic poets added a new dimension to the
                  students’ exposure to this work. We then asked the engineering students to use their
                  repertoire of digital signal processing techniques to add yet another dimension to
                  the group’s collective understanding of the harp and its significance. </p>

                  <p>During the next phase of collaboration, students from the English course were asked
                     to recite for the engineering students previously assigned lines from Shelley’s “Mont
                     Blanc,” a poem that, as noted earlier, grapples in part with conceptual concerns related
                     to the Aeolian harp and its functions. Engineering students recorded the recited poetry
                     with binaural technology in Phasor Lab, a specialized, soundproof laboratory equipped
                     for experiments at the intersections of Electrical Engineering and Music.

                  <p>Before the binaural recording activity, we paired up students in the Romanticism course,
                     assigned roughly ten lines from “Mont Blanc,” and required them to practice together
                     to improve poetic recitation techniques taught in class and through assignments. To
                     improve recitation of their assigned sections of verse, we asked students to separate
                     out each line of poetry into its five feet by identifying a given line’s ten syllables
                     of iambic pentameter and to divide those syllables into pairs of two. Once students
                     divided the assigned lines into feet, they then marked up lines for patterns of stressed
                     and unstressed syllables (please click <a class="link_ref" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/burkett-catravas-DOCUMENT1.pdf">here</a> for an example of this type of marking assignment).

                     </div> These traditional forms of poetic scansion and marking techniques greatly assisted
                     these students in better understanding the rhythm and meter of assigned lines and
                     allowed them to sound out the poetry when practicing recitations. During the lab day
                     recording, one individual from each pair of students volunteered to recite aloud assigned
                     selections of Shelley’s verse.</p>

               <p>Following these activities, the engineering students returned to the ECE Department
                  with the recordings of both the Aeolian harp and poetry and plotted their recordings
                  in the time and frequency domain (using Short-time Fourier Transform, or spectrogram)
                  (Proakis and Menolakis). They compared and contrasted the wind-excited harp data with
                  the data collected from the recited poetry. To analyze the harp data further, the
                  students also considered possible algorithms for separating the sound of the wind
                  from that of the harp. Moving on to the recited poetry, once students identified the
                  onset of words and/or specific syllables within the spectrogram, they entered the
                  next phase of the interdisciplinary collaboration, which required the expertise of
                  their peers from the Romantic poetry class. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>We arranged a meeting between the two classes, with each group of students arriving
                     with their respective forms of individually prepared data analysis (e.g., marked,
                     prepared lines; spectrograms, etc.). In order to obtain insight into the interpretation
                     of spectrograms, the students listened to an audio recording of an Aeolian harp (included
                     at the end of this paragraph) and identified the signature of various aural features
                     as they appear within the spectrogram (shown in Figure 4). By listening to the audio
                     of the harp excited by the wind, one hears the harp’s overtones sustained in time
                     (which correspond to the long, horizontal lines in the spectrogram in Figure 4) and
                     abrupt flapping of the wind (which corresponds to the vertical lines in the spectrogram,
                     because the duration of the wind’s noise is short in time). The harp is initially
                     excited in the lower portion of the frequency range, and a burst of higher frequency
                     overtones begins about halfway through the sample, rising briefly to frequencies above
                     1,500 Hz in the upper portion of the figure.

                  the range of poetic devices under consideration in Shelley’s verse, students from
                  the ECE course guided their peers studying literature in interpreting the technical
                  visualizations. In effect, each group’s respective expertise fused to produce interdisciplinary

                  stanza of “Mont Blanc” can be found at the end of this paragraph, and the spectrogram
                  of a short excerpt is provided in Figure 5, along with a guide to its interpretation.
                  The technical visualization also permits personal interpretations to be compared side
                  by side (Figure 6), revealing differences in recitational tempo, caesura, stress placement
                  within poetic feet, and features of the natural timbre of each reader’s voice.</p>

               <p>Pedagogically speaking, having students perform analyses such as those shown in the
                  figures above and build such evidence into technical papers provided another opportunity
                  for interdisciplinary collaboration. The students in the English course had writing-based
                  techniques to share with the engineering students, but these humanities students were
                  generally unfamiliar with the constraints of writing for a professional technical
                  journal. Starting the first week of the term, the engineering students prepared for
                  this aspect of the collaboration by performing a detailed analysis of several representative
                  technical papers in professional engineering journals—stripping content until the
                  papers were distilled into skeletal forms. In one exercise, the students analyzed
                  high-impact papers for language usage and style, including variation in sentence length
                  and structure. In another, they focused on how the authors of transformative papers
                  incorporated engaging language into objective descriptions of material not typically
                  intended to evoke the kind of visceral response that lends itself perhaps more naturally
                  to imaginative prose. The resulting templates included such information as the core
                  elements of an abstract, typical structure for an introduction, efficient presentation
                  techniques for the results of a literature search, and interesting ways to present
                  a slew of mathematical equations. Armed with these skeletal templates by the end of
                  the term’s first week, the engineering students prepared to flesh out their templates
                  with prose, section by section, as relevant materials were learned during class time
                  (e.g., mathematical theory, data, etc.). By the time that the interdisciplinary group
                  meeting on data analysis occurred, the engineering students were able to prepare a
                  draft of the theory, experimental setup, and results sections of their papers, which
                  they then sent to their peers in the Romanticism course. </p>
               <p>Having received their collaborators’ drafts, students in the English course began
                  the peer-editing process with the goal of helping their collaborators to articulate
                  and explain in greater detail the results of their experiments. For example, students
                  focused on inserting a range of appositive phrases to qualify such things as definitions
                  for consonance, iambic pentameter, the different forms of poetic feet found in “Mont
                  Blanc,” caesura, alliteration, assonance, and so on. Using Microsoft Word’s “Track
                  Changes” function, these students were asked to focus their editorial attention on
                  matters related to the engineering student’s rhetoric and logic as well as their articulation
                  of ideas in sentence form (e.g., language, diction, structure, etc.). The engineering
                  students were not often familiar with poetic terminology. In effect, students in the
                  Romanticism course helped their peers to qualify and expand upon definitions and explanations
                  of such things as depictions of Shelley’s biography, lyric poetry, and the Aeolian
                  harp. Each editing process was unique and depended on what each engineering student
                  found in his or her results, and so these student collaborators could not fully predict
                  what would become the focus of an individual argument or set of evidence. In this
                  way, students studying English literature provided something like a real-world example
                  of collaborative, technical editing. Additionally, students in the Romanticism course
                  faced unfamiliar language, ideas, and results from a discipline far removed from their
                  own and to which they were assigned to add their own knowledge about and expertise
                  in Romantic-era poetry in order to help their peers explain experimental results and
                  articulate arguments in the form of term papers. </p>
               <p>Upon return of the peer-edited papers, the engineering students analyzed their revised
                  texts (using the template shown at the following <a class="link_ref" href="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/burkett-catravas-DOCUMENT5.pdf">link</a>) and checked editorial changes for technical accuracy, accepting or rejecting edits
                  and suggestions as needed. However, it was found in a number of cases that suggested
                  changes, although often beautifully written, had to be set aside because they introduced
                  technical inaccuracies—from the engineering perspective—into the final report. As
                  a final class-time exercise, the engineering students participated in a contest focused
                  on the production of pithy writing. The winning entry consisted of the sentence reduced
                  by the largest percentage in word count without changing its informational content
                  or meaning. We read aloud to the class both the initial and the revised versions of
                  the five entries that had claimed the largest percentage reductions in word count,
                  and our students voted on whether each improved sentence retained all of the original
                  information, disqualifying those that did not.</p>

                     at Union College. In doing so, we follow Alan Bewell’s recent call for collaborations
                     that go beyond single author or disciplinary boundaries. “Nowadays, one would be hard-pressed
                     to find a term that is more frequently espoused and valued in the humanities than
                     ‘interdisciplinarity.’ These days, it seems that everybody does interdisciplinary
                     work,” writes Bewell, <span class="quote">‘A strange aspect of the manner in which English professors think about interdisciplinarity
                        . . . is that it does not usually involve collaboration with people outside of our
                        discipline. Whereas elsewhere in the university, interdisciplinarity usually involves
                        bringing people from different disciplines together in order to address a common issue
                        that extends beyond disciplinary boundaries, English interdisciplinary research is
                        usually done by loners. Most academics in the humanities engage with other disciplines
                        through books. They rarely write collaboratively, preferring instead to write single-authored
                        articles and monographs. (393-94) ’</span> Our collaboration has been envisioned from the start as uniting students and faculty
                     from departments that are very rarely thought of together for either contemporary
                     research or pedagogical projects. We did so in the space of the experimental laboratory
                     environment instead of a conventional literature classroom in order to promote intimate
                     intellectual interactions and experiments among students studying vastly different
                     topics, concepts, techniques, and procedures.

                              interdisciplinarity is different from other forms of this activity at the university,
                              I am not making a complaint, but instead stressing the limitations of what English
                              interdisciplinarity usually entails” (394). That is, our lab-based, collective group
                              investigation is not meant to be understood as undermining the relevance or importance
                              of interdiscursive work but, rather, is enacted as a way of expanding research and
                              teaching-based activities beyond traditional horizons. </span></div>
                     </div> This study thus allows us to promote interdisciplinary skills and approaches as opposed
                     to what Linda Hutcheon and Michael Hutcheon have referred to as “interdiscursive”
                     work, a “term to describe people who remain, inevitably, disciplinarily trained but
                     borrow from other disciplines” (1371). Further clarifying this concept, Alan Richardson
                     has recently observed that “interdiscursive” research often involves “reading across
                     disciplinary boundaries and selectively incorporating elements of another discipline’s
                     vocabulary, without placing one’s home disciplinary perspective into sustained, mutually
                     vulnerable, and potentially transformative dialogue with the rival perspectives of
                     colleagues trained in significantly different areas, with different methods and aims”
                     (x). By prompting our students to understand that their research is not only cooperative
                     but also that no single disciple may actually lay an exclusive claim to the types
                     of questions, issues, and ideas under investigation during these group activities,
                     we have sought to encourage a type of critical thinking that moves beyond the tired
                     binaries of, for example, “humanities” <em>versus </em>“sciences” in favor of seeking rigor while pursuing interdisciplinarity.</p>

                  <p>This cross-disciplinary investigation showed all involved in the collaboration the
                     ways that contemporary technologies can assist in seeing anew what were already Romantic
                     forms and formulations of technology. Ultimately, modern technology enabled historical
                     recovery. Listening to the Aeolian harp excited our imaginations to ask new questions
                     about Shelley’s poetry in particular and, more generally, about a previous historical
                     epoch often perceived as far removed from our own. The act of listening to the sounds
                     of this Romantic device served as a gateway into investigation of the dramatic variety
                     of sounds found in Shelley’s poetry in its historical context.

                              performance of Romantic lyric falling under the category of closet drama. Dramatic
                              works like Prometheus Unbound (1820), for instance, intentionally make use of the
                              inner ear of the human imagination, given that Shelley’s lyrical drama was most likely
                              intended for private recitation. As Suzanne L. Barnett has recently noted in her review
                              of the 2013 “performance” of Prometheus Unbound as a staged reading at New York City’s

                     </div> Furthermore, the recordings of “Mont Blanc” made in Phasor Lab allowed students to
                     practice a host of recitational techniques important for understanding further English
                     Romantic verse, and the three-dimensional nature of the binaural recordings (as opposed
                     to, say, recordings made via smartphones) prompted students to recite Shelley’s poetry
                     to the binaural head as if they were communicating with a placeholder for a future
                     audience to listen to these lines of verse. In this way, the harp directed us to a
                     set of Romantic poetic concerns (both formal and conceptual) that assisted our students
                     in their literary as well as media archaeological reconstructions of an open range
                     of potential ways in which, on the one hand, “Mont Blanc” might have been intended
                     by Shelley to be sounded out while also exploring, on the other hand, how contemporary
                     recitations of the poem might be inherently delimited by Shelley’s original poetic
                     devices.</p>
