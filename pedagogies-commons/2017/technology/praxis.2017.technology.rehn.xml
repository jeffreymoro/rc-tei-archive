                <p rend="noCount">This essay will describe a multi-modal, collaborative,
                    project-based approach to teaching Jane Austen’s novels through a focus on
                    remixing and material history. Assignments that engage students in collectively
                    remixing Austen’s novels meld individual students into a community,
                    strengthening the classroom’s “little social commonwealth” by connecting
                    classroom and digital learning spaces in a single learning ecosystem (Persuasion
                    31). Key elements of such project-based community-building include an ongoing,
                    weekly participant-creation assignment posted to Tumblr, a short exploration of
                    textual materiality connected to a close reading assignment focusing on
                    historical word shifts, a physical making assignment, and a student-led
                    collaborative project that brings all class members together into a
                    participatory final experience. Transgressing distinctions between popular and
                    scholarly reading communities by sharing their classwork openly online in turn
                    empowers undergraduate students to realize that their own scholarship
                    participates in, benefits from, and may eventually even reshape the networks
                    that characterize our current digital social commonwealths.</p>

                            students for their creativity and willingness to share digital
                            commonplace books they created during “Jane Austen in Context,” Fall
                            2013, Whittier College (full citations above):Barkats, Nikolai.

                            Terrileigh.</note> Upon entering the room, I will overhear discussions
                        about how many, and which, Austen novels students have already read. Another
                        group, frequently the most spirited, will be debating the relative merits of
                        various film adaptations of the novels. Such rapport among students derives
                        from their shared enthusiasm for the topic, which in turn creates an instant
                        sense of community among many class members. Even those who are not fans
                        often find themselves invigorated by the happy anticipation of their peers.
                        Because of this, my central pedagogical question when teaching an Austen
                        seminar becomes how to enrich and support this peer-to-peer energy and make
                        legible to students the ways that Austen’s popularity reflects continuities,
                        as well as differences, between the sociality of the English country gentry
                        and our own increasingly networked online communities and identities.</p>
                    <p>By reading Austen as a member of a seminar that is also a peer-to-peer
                        learning community, students get to experience a twenty-first-century
                        version of the social bonds that structure relationships among Austen’s
                        characters. This style of teaching, in which digital and embodied
                        experiential learning methods cross-fertilize each other as part of a
                        single, integrated approach, is my version of what Jesse Stommel and others
                        term “critical digital pedagogy:”</p>

                    <p>This essay will describe a multi-modal, collaborative, project-based approach
                        to teaching Jane Austen’s novels through a focus on remixing and material
                        history. Assignments that engage students in collectively remixing Austen’s
                        novels meld individual students into a community, strengthening the
                        classroom’s “little social commonwealth” by connecting classroom and digital
                        learning spaces in a single learning ecosystem (<title level="m">Persuasion
                        </title>31). Key elements of such project-based community-building include
                        an ongoing, weekly participant-creation assignment posted to Tumblr, a short
                        exploration of textual materiality connected to a close reading assignment
                        focusing on historical word shifts, a physical making assignment, and a
                        student-led collaborative project that brings all class members together
                        into a participatory final experience. The choice of the social networking
                        site Tumblr as a central course platform has special resonance in an Austen
                        classroom, as a lively Austen fan community already exists on Tumblr.
                        Through networking, reposting, and remixing, students’ classwork thus
                        organically becomes part of wider conversations about Romantic-era culture
                        among some of the many virtual communities of Austen’s readers today.
                        Transgressing distinctions between popular and scholarly reading communities
                        by sharing their classwork openly online in turn empowers undergraduate
                        students to realize that their own scholarship participates in, benefits
                        from, and may eventually even reshape the networks that characterize our
                        current digital social commonwealths.</p>

                    <p>The backbone of my remixing approach to teaching Austen is a digital

                        students not only to build their own Tumblr blogs, but also to follow and
                        interact with class members’ blogs, extending educational discourse beyond
                        the campus. <ref

                            >Elsewhere</ref>, I’ve talked about this teaching approach as
                        “perforating the classroom,” a term to describe the value of teaching openly
                        on the web rather than in the “walled” spaces of learning management systems
                        (LMS) like Moodle or Blackboard. Such LMSs have their uses—to keep grades
                        confidential, for example—but the fact that they are deliberately isolated
                        from the web reduces their utility both as tools for student lifelong
                        learning and as analogies to Romantic-era literary culture. My pedagogical
                        approach highlights connection—between students, between ideas, between
                        historical periods, between Austen and her readers, between elite and
                        popular cultures, between technologies of reading. As Juliette Wells argues
                        in a recent <ref
                            target="https://romantic-circles.org/praxis/austen/pedagogies.commons.2015.wells.html"
                            >article</ref>, I want to encourage my students to connect with Austen
                        fandom and popular culture as well as the many resources available online
                        for scholarly study. </p>
                    <p>On that note, I cannot fail to point out the wonderful resources and teaching
                        ideas in the recent <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogy

                        bibliographies like theirs are scholarly versions of the kind of curation
                        that my students undertook in their commonplace books, and offer a useful
                        touchstone for understanding the value of curation as a social-intellectual
                        practice that can yield networked scholarly communities in this era of
                        digital connectivity. This essay benefits from the resources, articles, and
                        ideas compiled by Looser and Friedman, and adds to them a critical digital
                        pedagogy approach to scaffolding a Jane Austen seminar which integrates both
                        digital and embodied learning.</p>
                    <p>To foster such communal scholarship, I ask students to create digital
                        commonplace books in which they engage with other readers of Romantic-era
                        literature via remixing not only their own collection of quotations but also
                        the bits of Austen culture online that attract their interest. Tumblr, a
                        free and open blogging platform, has the advantages of being familiar to
                        most students, very simple to use, and popular with a huge community of
                        users who regularly reblog media objects in a twenty-first century version
                        of commonplacing. Tumblr also has an active Austen fan population who share
                        memes, movie references, news about new games, products, travel
                        opportunities, and so much more. Encouraging students to interact with
                        Austen fandom and popular culture for a class assignment brings enormous
                        energy into classroom discussions and challenges the unspoken barrier
                        between reading for pleasure and reading for class that so often frames
                        academic discussions of even the most beloved literary works. </p>
                    <p>My commonplacing assignment was initially inspired by a blog post on a
                        wonderful academic blog titled <ref

                        categories and language from Patricia Taylor’s <ref

                            >Electronic Commonplace Book</ref> assignment as posted on the
                        University of Connecticut freshman English blog in 2014. The key
                        requirements are that each student add three elements to their Tumblr blog
                        each week, that they tag their posts according to an organizational method
                        that represents their particular interests, that they follow each other’s
                        blogs, that they design their blogs according to their own taste, and that
                        across the semester they include a variety of different types of posts. Here
                        is an excerpt from the assignment, which enumerates various types of posts. </p>
                    <p>Tumblr commonplace books must include at least one example of the following:
                            <list type="ordered">

                    <p>Students begin their commonplace books the first week of class after a brief
                        introduction to the Enlightenment intellectual practice of commonplacing, a
                        tutorial on setting up their Tumblr accounts, and, most importantly, a
                        discussion about how they will choose to craft their online identities for
                        the course. Fortuitously, our class was reading Austen’s early epistolary
                        novella <title level="m">Lady Susan </title>while we were also getting the
                        Tumblr blogs launched, and so questions of rhetorical stance, audience
                        awareness, and reputation construction cross-pollinated our discussion of
                        both the novella and student choices about their own online identities for
                        the course. Students always enjoy reading the letters through which
                            <foreign>femme fatale</foreign> Lady Susan manipulates her daughter, her
                        lover, her intended fiancé and others through a carefully plotted rhetorical
                        campaign. As a character, Lady Susan is unlike other Austen protagonists in
                        both class status and conduct, and may seem quite simplistically wicked at
                        first read. While discussing this novel, students consider how to craft
                        their own social media identities. The activity prompts students to think
                        through this plot crisis as an eighteenth-century version of what theorists
                        of social media today call “context collapse,” in which distinct audiences
                        combine and create unexpected (and often, unwanted) interpretations (boyd
                        31). </p>
                    <p>Students’ increasing awareness of the wide implications, and often unforeseen
                        consequences, of their own social media self-expression sets the stage for a
                        richly intercontextual discussion of this first person epistolary fiction.
                        Like Lady Susan, they realize that their plans and hopes can be undermined
                        if information intended for one audience (photographs taken at college
                        parties, for example) crosses over to other audiences (future employers).
                        While many students initially condemn Lady Susan, agreeing with Facebook
                        founder Mark Zuckerberg that “[h]aving two identities for yourself is an
                        example of a lack of integrity” (boyd 31), they quickly complicate this
                        sentiment when they consider their own online identity decisions. Social
                        media “context collapse,” which is especially prevalent on Facebook and
                        other platforms that are part of the “real name web,” is a useful analogy to
                        help modern urban readers comprehend the social dynamics of
                        eighteenth-century English country gentry. Students immediately grasp the
                        identity complexities introduced by the possibility of such context
                        collapse, and tend to brim with stories about when their aunt or grandfather
                        misunderstood something they posted on social media for an intended audience
                        of peers. Seeing Lady Susan’s letter-writing practice in this light helps
                        them interpret her character more sympathetically, since many have grown up
                        learning painful lessons about reputational identity in social media. For
                        this same reason, it is a key learning goal of my course to increase
                        students’ expertise at shaping and managing their own online identities. My
                        feminist pedagogy seeks to encourage student agency online so that they can
                        be, as one student pointed out in a moment of delightfully ironic
                        realization, <emph>more like</emph> Lady Susan—in rhetorical artistry, if
                        not morality.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, before students create their Tumblr blogs, we thoroughly discuss
                        their choices about how much identifying information they will choose to
                        reveal in their Tumblr accounts. Students then decide to create their Tumblr
                        blogs with either their real names, a durable pseudonym which they maintain
                        across platforms, or an entirely anonymous, disposable moniker chosen for
                        one use only. In our course LMS, which is password protected, we all share
                        our Tumblr blog identities so that we can all follow each other’s blogs. But
                        on the Tumblr platform itself, I discourage students from publishing
                        identifying information (including photographs or nicknames) about other
                        students, even if they choose to use their own real names for their own
                        blog. As students gain more control over their own social media personas,
                        they also gain richer appreciation of the context of <title level="m">Lady
                            Susan</title> or <title level="m">Emma</title>, novels which feature
                        long-established, deeply interconnected communities of families. For
                        example, this student, <ref target="http://janereigns.tumblr.com/">Erica
                            Clifford</ref>, chose to identify herself by her full name in her course
                        project, but students are free to choose how much identifying information
                        they wish to include. </p>

                        highlight their awareness of their own agency in determining their online
                        identities before participating in open online learning activities in my

                    <p>Once student blogs are launched with a few initial quotations from the early
                        readings on the syllabus, we start thinking about the commonplace books as
                        not only a useful analogy for self-aware identity construction, but also as
                        a knowledge technology with specific resonances to eighteenth century and
                        Romantic-era culture. Although we read most of Austen’s published novels as
                        well as many excerpted critical studies in this course, we do not have time
                        for a deep exploration of eighteenth-century book history and publishing
                        practices. However, even a brief consideration of the material history of
                        the eighteenth-century book can help students begin to appreciate the
                        economic conditions that configure Austen’s characters’ opportunities and
                        choices as well as Austen’s own various publishing strategies. To this end,
                        while reading Edward Copeland’s “Money” from the <title level="m">Cambridge
                            Companion to Jane Austen,</title> the class visits special collections,
                        where students get to handle a number of Regency-era texts and learn how
                        printing processes, materials, and costs influenced readership and the rise
                        of circulating libraries, and we also get to view an early edition Johnson’s
                            <title level="m">Dictionary</title> as well as some manuscript
                        commonplace books. </p>
                    <p>The archival visit is always one of the highlights of the semester, and two
                        assignments build on it: a short reflection piece about reading and writing
                        by candlelight, and a close-reading of a passage from an Austen novel
                        comparing Johnson’s definition of a word to our modern usage. Many students
                        put one or both of these assignments into their Tumblr commonplace books, as
                        in this <ref

                        reading/writing by candlelight, pairs very well with <title level="m">Sense
                            and Sensibility, </title>and helps students appreciate Austen’s careful
                        equation between Marianne’s cramped postures and her desperate emotions
                        while she writes letters to Willoughby in the second volume. The assignment
                        also offers context for thinking through the trope of the flickering candle,
                        that durable device of gothic fiction, which Austen exploits and satirizes
                        in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>. The assignment asks students
                        to read at least one chapter of a novel and then handwrite a reflection
                        about the experience—both by candlelight. Students then take a digital
                        photograph of their study area and post it to their commonplace book
                        alongside their reflection, as in this <ref
                            target="http://universaltruthsrevealed.tumblr.com/image/60908380109"
                            >example</ref> by Terrileigh Shepherd. Notice the layers of textual
                        technology represented in this single image: the student is hand-writing
                        after reading by candlelight from a Norton Critical Edition of <title
                            level="m">Emma,</title> then using a cell phone camera to digitally
                        photograph her text and post it to her twenty-first-century version of an
                        eighteenth-century commonplace book. In this particular case, the assignment
                        offered Terri an opportunity to tell the class about growing up in Zimbabwe,
                        where frequent power outages made candlelight a familiar homework resource.
                        Access to technology is not only temporally but also geographically
                        differential, a topic that the class explored again when we watched Patricia
                        Rozema’s adaptation of <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> and discussed
                        Said’s argument about Austen’s implication in English imperialism. </p>
                    <p>These simple assignments yield remarkable results, since they defamiliarize
                        reading itself by transforming it into a consciously embodied role-playing
                        activity that can bring the Regency period to life. As students orient
                        themselves to the physical postures and technological challenges of reading
                        and writing by candlelight, they begin to imagine how material culture
                        pervades and situates our lived experience. Students reflect on issues
                        including the height of the candle, troublesome drafts, the smell and heat
                        of candlelight, the physical cramps or eyestrain they experience, and their
                        sense of embodying Marianne’s Romantic sensibility. The opportunity to
                        imagine themselves into the physicality of the Regency period can open a
                        series of realizations about gender, age, class position, social occasion,
                        affect, and the body itself as a historically-constructed aspect of
                        character. After this initial assignment, and because students find this
                        kind of experiential learning so dynamic, the class engaged in a series of
                        role playing activities that focus on material culture, including a Jane
                        Austen dancing session, a sketching exercise where we copied a profile using
                        shadow-tracing, a Commerce card-party, and a Regency-style potluck. For many
                        of these activities, students added entries to their digital commonplace
                        books not only collecting but also reflecting on the experience itself; in
                        other words, their commonplace books became, in many instances, not only
                        collections of remediated objects and phrases, but also of reflective
                        writing about their own learning processes.</p>
                    <p>Role playing and other game-like activities involve students in active
                        learning that yields rich readings, close attention to nuances of the text,
                        and melds students into an engaged learning community. Such an atmosphere
                        provides a useful context from which to address Romantic individualism,
                        gender, and class in the novels. My students, in twenty-first-century Los
                        Angeles, find it difficult to appreciate the power of unfamiliar social
                        conventions, from Anne Elliot’s frustrating inability to voice her desire in
                            <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, to Fanny’s moral certainties in
                            <title level="m">Mansfield Park, </title>to Darcy’s misgivings about the
                        Bennet family in <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>. In these
                        cases, the shared commonplace books, which quickly fill with pop culture
                        Austen memes satirizing Regency gender norms, offer valuable springboards
                        into more historically nuanced discussions of manners and textuality. In
                        other words, by sharing these items on Tumblr, students make visible to
                        themselves, and to each other, their historical distance from the novels,
                        and can therefore begin to teach each other about contemporary material
                        culture through posts on clothing, meals, etiquette, architecture, money,
                        and many more aspects of culture. </p>

                    <p>Student-designed digital commonplace books both enable shared research and
                        discovery and embody individual student’s various relationships to Regency
                        culture. One example of a commonplace book that led through pop culture
                        references to an exploration of material culture, in this case fabric and
                        fashion, is the commonplace book “<ref

                        Sanchéz, who initially titled her commonplace book “My Dear Miss Elizabeth,”
                        became fascinated by masculine fashion, and at the final (which was a ball
                        thrown by the students for the campus community) she welcomed guests to the
                        ball with a display of her watercolor fashion plates (see Figure 1). She
                        also explained how to tie a cravat and offered guests a choice to wear
                        either gloves or a cravat for the dancing, so that all guests could freely
                        choose and signal their gender role for the dancing<note place="foot">This
                            ball emerged as a student initiative, and they organized it themselves,
                            including seeking funding from student government, assigning each other
                            organizational responsibilities, learning dances to teach attendees, and
                            sending out invitations. </note>. The posts and aesthetics of her blog
                        together embody her interest in period history, and her careful research, as
                        in this image:</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>In contrast, student Nikolai Barkats’s commonplace book displays a widely
                        different aesthetic and set of intellectual preoccupations. “<ref
                            target="http://darcysintown.tumblr.com/">Darcy’s in Town</ref>” focuses
                        on pulp fiction, gaming, and modern Austen rewritings. This student became
                        the class expert on Austen mashups, with a playful focus on gender and
                        masculinity in the novels and their filmic and textual afterlives. Like
                        Elizabeth Sanchéz, this student was also interested in masculinity in the
                        novels, but his approach was quite distinct, as his choice of topics and
                        format makes clear. Note the eye-popping background color, the pulp-fiction
                        title and cover art, and the fascination with video games and other remix
                        forms:</p>

                    <p>Another student’s site, Sara Koffi’s “<ref

                        demonstrates a more traditional commonplace book structure, offering
                        primarily quotations from novels and criticism and short, informal
                        reactions. <note place="foot">This student chose to create an anonymous
                            commonplace book, but, like all other students cited in this article,
                            has since given me authorization to cite her by name for this
                            article.</note>Sara used her commonplace book as a location to store her
                        discoveries while reading, and her witty observations were lauded by the
                        class for their insight and helpfulness. For example, here is Sara
                        reflecting on Harding’s classic essay “Regulated Hatred,” and comparing how
                        community at a small liberal arts college might be similar to the Longbourn
                        neighborhood: </p>

                    <p>Finally, Erica Clifford’s blog <ref target="http://janereigns.tumblr.com/"
                            >“Jane Reigns”</ref> integrates all these aspects of the digital
                        commonplace book, and culminates in a final digital essay exploring one
                        aspect of material culture in Austen’s era. Erica’s work integrates popular
                        culture references, historical and archival sources, quotations from novels
                        and criticism, and, at the bottom of each blog page, a scrolling list of the
                        posts by other students and other bloggers that she favorited or commented
                        on. Her digital essay, posted near the top of her book, is a video published
                        on YouTube and titled <ref
                            target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkHsQo4vCL0">“Bread Pudding: A
                            Socioeconomic Cultural Portrait.”</ref> This video exemplifies a
                        possibility for undergraduate work that traditional essays often don’t
                        achieve: undergraduate scholarship that is rigorous and wide-ranging while
                        being potentially useful to an audience that goes far beyond her classmates.
                        It is, therefore, a student research project that may have a life after
                        being graded, as it offers an entry point into its topic for future readers,
                        bakers, and/or students. Since Erica chose to make it publicly available on
                        her Tumblr as well as YouTube, it will be only a browser search away for
                        anyone with an interest in Jane Austen’s love of bread pudding. </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The aspect of Erica’s book that most excites me, beyond her rather wonderful
                        essay on dessert, is the scrolling feed of other students’ posts with whom
                        she interacted. The Tumblr platform, a popular social media site favored by
                        slightly more women than men, actively encourages bloggers to share each
                        other’s posts with the simple dashboard button “Quote.” Using this platform
                        affordance, many individual Tumblr users produce very little original
                        material but build extensive collections of reblogged materials that
                        represent their own individual interests and tastes. In this sense, Tumblr
                        is a modern, social commonplace book, adding the Web 2.0 culture of
                        connection to John Locke’s conception of commonplacing. The many Tumblr
                        themes available include citational links, so that when a blogger reshares
                        another blogger’s post, the software automatically includes that link in the
                        post, and alerts the original author. This creates a network of users who
                        quickly form interest communities. Since I asked all my students to “follow”
                        each other’s blogs, they also received notifications of each other’s posts,
                        which further encouraged active sharing, and, at times, created real-time
                        virtual communities of readers. Such real-time sharing was especially useful
                        when students were reading critical articles. Finding a key passage, they
                        would post it to their commonplace books with a brief commentary or an image
                        from a film or other source. Other students also reading the article
                        (usually the night before class discussion) would read and reshare the
                        posted quotations as a study aid, so that by the time we were all sitting in
                        the room together preparing to discuss the article, the class had already
                        established a foothold for themselves from which to begin our consideration.
                        In general, I participate in such discussions only by posting, or
                        reblogging, or “liking”, content, as any other members of the class would
                        do. My role is therefore to <emph>participate</emph>, or lead by example,
                        rather than to guide or direct. </p>
                    <p>Such social reading can happen, of course, with other kinds of informal
                        reflective writing due before class. But what really excited me about this
                        instance was that I had not explicitly <emph>assigned</emph> students to
                        discuss the article ahead of time, and they saw their interactions on Tumblr
                        as helpful for their own reading process rather than as an obligatory
                        exercise. Sometimes students would write about the passage, as Sara Koffi
                        does <ref
                            target="http://austen-not-texas.tumblr.com/post/62909623347/most-of-us-now-correctly-understand-a-question"
                            >here</ref>. Sometimes they would share helpful study tools, as
                        Elizabeth Sanchéz does <ref
                            target="http://bonnetenvy.tumblr.com/post/64020209635/a-handy-little-guide-to-the-relationships-in-pride"
                            >here</ref>. The sense of community endeavor this shared blogging
                        inspired brought the class together into a learning community connected by
                        helpfulness and shared interests. It is, I think, no accident that this was
                        the same group that collectively decided to throw a ball for the campus. I
                        won’t describe the ball, as <ref

                        teaching dancing as a part of a course on Jane Austen, but the fact that the
                        class chose, as a group, to create this event is probably my single favorite
                        teaching experience ever, one that I do believe is connected to students’
                        Tumblr community building throughout the semester.</p>

                    <p>This community building was facilitated by the time we spent in class
                        referring to and learning from other’s Tumblr blogs. As their blogs grew,
                        students’ expertise with different aspects of Tumblr became clear, and we
                        often had short student-led technical discussions during class. One student
                        explained the citational practices of the Tumblr community (it is bad form
                        to reblog a modified meme without acknowledgement, for instance), which led
                        naturally and usefully to a discussion of both academic citational practices
                        and Austen’s own dense network of textual allusions, particularly in <title
                            level="m">Persuasion </title>and <title level="m">Northanger Abbey.
                        </title>Other students showed the class how they achieved certain design
                        aspects of their blogs, which increased the range of aesthetic possibilities
                        among the blogs. Note the differing design aesthetics of Nikolai Barkats’
                        pulp-fiction inspired “Darcy’s In Town” versus the embowered “Jane Reigns”
                        or the self-consciously antiqued “Universal Truths.” The students’ design
                        freedom elevated this assignment over other familiar reading response
                        assignments they might post to an LMS forum, and resulted in a sense of
                        ownership of the assignment that created energy, community, and moved
                        discussions into the realm of what network theorist Henry Jenkins calls
                        “participatory culture,” which includes the following characteristics:</p>
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item>relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic
                            engagement,</item>
                        <item>strong support for creating and sharing creations with others, </item>
                        <item>types of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most
                            experienced is passed along to novices,</item>
                        <item>members who believe that their contributions matter, and</item>
                        <item>members who feel some degree of social connection with one another (at
                            the least, they care what other people think about what they have
                            created). (Jenkins 5-6)</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Here, Jenkins is describing what he believes is a significant cultural shift
                        associated with Web 2.0 practice. Unlike broadcasting, print media
                        authorship, or even early hard-coded HTML websites, Web 2.0 applications
                        such as Tumblr, Twitter, and WordPress overlay one-to-many networks like
                        books or traditional classrooms with the many-to-many networks of social
                        media. In this kind of distributed network, all participants have not only
                        the opportunity but the motivation to produce as well as consume, since
                        their contribution embodies their individuality to the class community.</p>
                    <p>Like today’s socially networked readers, gentry women of Austen’s period were
                        not only consumers but also the producers of much artistic and domestic
                        culture. Characters such as Georgiana Darcy or Jane Fairfax exemplify the
                        accomplished woman in Austen’s work, in contrast to protagonists whose more
                        modest accomplishments are much thematized in the novels. However, while
                        Elizabeth Bennet or Emma Woodhouse may not play and sing as well as others,
                        they, like other women of their class and period, were valued for their
                        “society,” the contribution that their presence would make to a gathering.
                        Of course, we still delight in witty or wise friends, but we rarely think of
                        ourselves now as valuable primarily for how our creative contribution adds
                        to a collective whole. The press of such gendered obligation on Austen’s
                        characters is one of the most important, and most subtle, aspects of the
                        novels for modern students to grasp, precisely because it is so pervasive
                        and so internalized. And, like any other disciplinary technology, this
                        social obligation to contribute manifests itself by empowering characters to
                        act accordingly—some more than others, of course. Similarly, when students
                        form their own commonplacing digital community, they experience both the
                        empowerment and the constraints of the technology that facilitates their
                        community. Tumblr becomes a material manifestation of Foucault’s
                        power/knowledge, with the affordances of the technology channeling student
                        contributions and empowering them to create and share digital objects that
                        amaze and delight them with their own accomplishments.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the semester, the class would consult members’ commonplace books
                        to find references, research topics, and design inspiration. To enhance this
                        sense of student ownership of the assignment, I asked students to evaluate
                        each other’s commonplace books twice during the semester, working from a
                        rubric that we collectively developed early in the semester. We contrasted
                        these activities to Emma’s tutelage of Harriet Smith in <title level="m"
                            >Emma, </title>to Henry Tilney’s relationship to Catherine Morland in
                            <title level="m">Northanger Abbey, </title>and to the themes of romance
                        and moral education that intertwine in so many of Austen’s novels. The
                        students’ commonplace books tend to exhibit vitality, energy, and good will
                        that embodies many aspects of Jenkins’ participatory culture, a hallmark of
                        our networked, Web 2.0 era, and a distinct contrast to the more hierarchical
                        and elite publishing practices of Austen’s era. </p>
                    <p>Digital pedagogies succeed at community-creation because they are, in fact,
                        embodied learning practices, as I hope this article has shown. Hybrid
                        assignments can illuminate forms of technology and labor precisely because
                        they foreground the material conditions of reading and writing, including
                        physical place, textuality, temporality, and economics. When students remix
                        and otherwise make canonical texts their own, they open spaces to
                        historicize technologies of textuality and in the process discover for
                        themselves some differences between late eighteenth and early twenty-first
                        century modes of life. Today, unlike Regency-era people, students rarely
                        expect to produce the intellectual and recreational artifacts that occupy
                        their time. Many of us are today passive consumers of cultural merchandise,
                        but that is changing. Tumblr and other Web 2.0 platforms that encourage
                        remixing and sharing cultural artifacts are part of a transformation that is
                        taking place in parts of our society. While I distance myself from
                        techno-utopians who imagine that internet technology is an unmixed social
                        good, I do find that students bloom when their learning is connected to each
                        other and to others on the web who share their interests. They also discover
                        commonalities between Regency-era culture and their own lives that might
                        otherwise remain unacknowledged. </p>
