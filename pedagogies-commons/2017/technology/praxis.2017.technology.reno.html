               as well as reflections on the assignment’s constraints and affordances. In doing so,
               I urge teachers of Romanticism to adopt digital research projects as alternatives
               and complements to traditional research papers, especially in interdisciplinary programs
               and at schools where students’ career goals do not include academia. </p>

                  <p>Interdisciplinarity is a Romantic convention. When Erasmus Darwin writes in the Advertisement
                     to <em>The Loves of the Plants</em> (1791) that the “general design” of his multi-layered scientific poem “is to inlist
                     Imagination under the banner of Science” (ix), he announces his composition’s commitment
                     to a variety of genres and technologies. In addition to verse, <em>The Loves of the Plants</em> is full of extensive scientific footnotes, visual images, and philosophical prose
                     interludes on aesthetic theory. In order to fully understand and represent the natural
                     world, Darwin implies, we must draw from myriad disciplines and technologies. As recent
                     scholarship demonstrates, Darwin’s polymathic approach to research and writing anticipates
                     literary trends in the Romantic period.

                     </div> The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries witnessed the emergence not only
                     of what we now call ecology but also of a range of authors who studied and drew from
                     various disciplines and technologies in their work. William Blake’s famous illuminated
                     printing fused the technologies of printing, painting, and industrialism in his democratic
                     poetry. Percy Shelley used hot air balloons to distribute political pamphlets. Mary
                     Shelley frequently infused her novels with new scientific and technological ideas.
                     William Wordsworth and John Clare often wrote poems that opposed industrial technologies,
                     such as railroads and enclosure. Importantly, all of these poets were influenced by
                     Darwin, and for this reason he serves as a model for both Green Romanticism and Technological
                     Romanticism.

                              issue of Studies in Romanticism on “Green Romanticism.” While many scholars prefer
                              the label of “Romantic Ecology”—for example, in the Romantic Circles Praxis Series
                              volume on “Romanticism &amp; Ecology”—I used “Green Romanticism” for my course as a more
                              accessible term for students who are not familiar with Romanticism or Ecology. “Technological
                              Romanticism,” on the other hand, is not so much a formal movement as a reference to
                              the growing body of scholarship that links science, technology, and art in the study

                  <p>How can we engage the overlapping scientific, ecological, and technological elements
                     of Romanticism in the classroom? How can we incorporate these elements alongside the
                     canonical literature often required for introductory courses and advanced surveys?
                     How can we help students to understand the exchange between imagination and science,
                     during the Romantic period and in the twenty-first century? These questions lie at
                     the heart of recent discussions in Romantic ecocriticism and pedagogy, and they are
                     the focus of this essay.

                     </div> Scholars such as David Orr advocate place-based education in the teaching of ecocriticism,
                     in contrast to classroom reliance on digital media and technology, which, as he and
                     others suggest, facilitates what Richard Louv calls “nature-deficit disorder” in our
                     students. As David Sobel argues, instructors often use “electronic media” to connect
                     students “with endangered animals and ecosystems around the globe.” While motivated
                     by good intentions, these changes ultimately “disconnect” students “from the world
                     outside their doors” (3). However, other scholars and teachers have utilized digital
                     technology successfully in teaching Romantic-era literature: nearly every volume of
                     the <em>Romantic Circles Pedagogies Edititions</em>, including this one, features digital pedagogy, and the most recent winners and finalists
                     for the <em>Romantic Circles</em> Pedagogy Contest developed courses with a central digital component. In this essay,
                     I argue that we can do the same with ecocriticism: rather than exacerbating nature-deficit
                     disorder, digital technology can facilitate students’ engagement with Green Romanticism
                     by allowing them to think outside of the classroom and to develop the kinds of interdisciplinary
                     approaches demanded by ecocriticism.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In my upper-level seminar on “Green Romanticism,” which I designed and taught during
                  Spring 2015, I ask my students to adopt a Darwinian-interdisciplinary approach in
                  understanding Romantic-era texts, including <em>The Loves of the Plants</em>. The culminating project of the course is a hybrid website-digital edition of an
                  assigned poem, which students create using <a class="link_ref" href="http://weebly.com/">Weebly</a>, a free website design program. (<a class="link_ref" href="http://greenromanticism.weebly.com/">You can find the course “hub” here</a>, which includes the course description, syllabus, bibliography, and listening list.)This
                  website project, described in detail below, mirrors the kind of approach modeled by
                  Darwin and other Romantic authors, fusing “imagination” and “science” through modern
                  digital technology. The project lends itself especially well to the study of Green
                  Romanticism, as this subfield focuses on advances in science and technology related
                  to Romantic ecology. Indeed, one overarching principle of my course is to chart the
                  various ways Romantic writers and artists attempted to represent “nature”—through
                  literature, music, visual art, science, and industry. Similarly, in their website
                  projects, students engage the multiple genres and media that characterize Green Romanticism
                  through the multimodality of digital media.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The website project affords students an opportunity to shape the still-evolving field
                     of Green Romanticism. While there has been important work on the ecological elements
                     in Blake, Wordsworth, the Shelleys, and, to a lesser extent, Clare, recent advances
                     in ecocriticism, science and technology studies, affect studies, and the cognitive
                     humanities have renewed and revitalized discussions of Romantic ecology. These advances
                     allow us to rethink not only the role of “nature” in the works of canonical poets
                     but also the role of Darwin and other prominent scientists in Romanticism itself.
                     After the first wave of ecocriticism in the early 1990s, which emerged in part as
                     a response to the dominance of new historicism throughout the 1980s, Romantic ecocriticism
                     has increasingly focused on the complex interplay of science, literature, and philosophy
                     that informs Romantic-era ecology.

                     perspectives from which to read Romantic literature, and it offers students a new

                     of the Romantic Ideology—but rather as potential engagements with Darwinian neuroscience
                     and Romantic-era ecology, how do we reread poems like “Tintern Abbey” and <em>Queen Mab</em>? If we add Erasmus Darwin, Humphry Davy, and Luke Howard to the canon of Romanticism,
                     how do we re-envision <em>The Botanic Garden</em>, or the cloud studies of Constable and Turner, or the bird poems of Shelley, Keats,
                     and Clare? If “the English Romantics were the first full-fledged ecological writers
                     in the Western literary tradition” (19), as James McKusick famously observed, how
                     do we distinguish Green Romanticism from Romanticism? Such questions framed my course
                     on “Green Romanticism,” and they informed my students’ website projects. Throughout
                     the semester, we read poets and novelists alongside scientists, artists, and Romantic
                     scholars, and, by drawing from these various texts and discourses in the creation
                     of their websites, my students were able to contribute to the ongoing reassessments
                     of Romanticism and of scholarly research and output.

               <h2><span class="head">The Assignment</span></h2>
               <p>This digital project begins on the first day of class when I distribute the assignment
                  prompt [see Appendix A], and students work on the project throughout the semester.
                  Thus, from day one, students explore Green Romanticism through various media; they
                  envision their work for the class as part of the online public sphere rather than
                  the perceived private space of the classroom (where work is exchanged between students
                  and teachers only); and they conceive of their research as an ongoing process that
                  spans the entire term. Moreover, students are generally more excited about starting
                  this project than a traditional research paper. This excitement helps to establish
                  student engagement with Romanticism. </p>
               <p>As I point out in the assignment prompt, one fundamental practice of literary scholarship
                  is annotating a text: as literary readers and scholars, we take notes in the margins,
                  we underline, we make connections, we pose questions, we engage with the text in order
                  to understand it in a more sophisticated and enriching manner. In our increasingly
                  digital world, these kinds of annotations have naturally moved to the digital sphere.
                  In class, I show the <a class="link_ref" href="http://romantic-circles.org/editions">digital editions</a> on <em>Romantic Circles</em> as representative examples, as well as models for what students will do in their
                  own digital projects. Once I establish this rationale for the assignment, I outline
                  the major requirements. Students’ website projects must include: (1) a home page containing
                  a brief introduction to the poem and the site; (2) a separate page containing the
                  full text of the poem; and (3) at least ten hyperlinks in the poem that take readers
                  to separate pages on the site and to other websites, sources, videos, paintings, and
                  related texts. These hyperlinks, I explain, are the digital annotations. They could
                  include: biographical and historical details; definitions and explanations of Romantic-era
                  terminology; references to and summaries of scholarly articles on a specific aspect
                  the poem; links to scholarly sites on the poem; paintings or other visual media directly
                  related to the poem (along with students’ commentary); and whatever else is helpful
                  in understanding and explaining the poem.</p>
               <p>After explaining the project on the first day of class and giving students a brief
                  overview of the course Weebly site, I provide a step-by-step handout on how to set
                  up their own site [see Appendix B]. I also disperse a “milestone checklist” to assess
                  their progress throughout the semester. This checklist is meant to keep students on
                  track throughout the term: by week six, students must select a text for the project;
                  by week ten, they must schedule a thirty-minute workshop with me to discuss their
                  project, at which time they must have completed the home page and at least two hyperlinks;
                  by week fifteen they must complete the project and give a brief presentation in class;
                  and by week sixteen (finals week) they must finalize their website based on my written
                  feedback and suggestions.</p>
               <p>For assessment and grading, I use a general rubric with three mandatory requirements
                  and three broader categories [see Appendix C]. I assign students a holistic letter
                  grade for the project rather than assign points for each category, but the point system
                  could work as well. The first three requirements—a home/introductory page, a page
                  with the full text of the poem, and at least ten hyperlinks—cover the nuts-and-bolts
                  of the project, while the second three categories—visual appeal, readability, and
                  research—cover the website’s content. These broader categories allow me to provide
                  specific feedback and guidance for each student’s site: during week fifteen, I write
                  a paragraph assessment for each category and provide detailed suggestions for revision
                  for each student. I also assign a letter grade based on the current state of the project.
                  Students then have one week to revise and submit the final version of their project.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Project Rationale</span></h2>
               <p>The digital project has three major goals. First, it aims to engage a diverse group
                  of students in research on Romantic-era literature and culture. This goal works especially
                  well for students at Auburn University Montgomery: all upper-level courses at AUM
                  are “split-level,” meaning the students are a mix of upper-level undergraduates and
                  graduate students in our interdisciplinary <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.cas.aum.edu/academic-programs/graduate-programs/mla">Master of Liberal Arts program</a>. In this particular course, the class was composed of three graduate students, seven
                  undergraduate English majors (two of whom were in the Honors program), and one undergraduate
                  Psychology major. The website project allows students to engage in research without
                  the “high stakes” of a fifteen- to twenty-page research paper—though this digital
                  project does require substantial research, time, and attention. Similar to a traditional
                  research paper, the website assignment develops close reading skills, research skills,
                  organization and logic, and fundamental principles of proper citation and scholarly
                  attribution. For instance, in order to create the hyperlinks, students must have a
                  detailed and sophisticated understanding of the poem and its scholarly reception,
                  and they must decide what pages to include and in what order. Additionally, most students
                  are already comfortable with digital technology and online writing, so they are more
                  willing to jump into a website project than what may be perceived as a daunting research
                  paper.</p>
               <p>A second goal is that students envision their research and thinking as part of a broader
                  community; the open access of many digital editions makes for a poignant example.
                  By creating a public website, students can both speak to scholars and teach general
                  readers. Like many online scholarly editions of texts—and like Darwin’s poetry—students
                  must navigate a dual audience while constructing their projects: they must write for
                  specialists and the general public. Accordingly, the third goal is for students to
                  model the kind of “blended approach” taken up by Darwin in <em>The Loves of the Plants</em> and by many other Romantic authors that we study: Blake, Darwin, Wordsworth, and
                  the Shelleys all envisioned their works at the intersections of poetry, prose, visual
                  art, science, and/or music. The digital annotated poem project allows students to
                  bring together a range of technologies in understanding their selected poems and in
                  modeling the interdisciplinary nature of the poems themselves.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Most students were excited about the website project from the start. Many of them
                     had created personal blogs and websites in the past, and a few even had experience
                     with computer programming. Weebly is straightforward and has a low learning threshold
                     for use, making it accessible even for students with limited computer skills. Students
                     with more advanced skills were not challenged by the interface itself, and they were
                     able to concentrate more on creating exciting content. In this sense, Weebly is especially
                     helpful at leveling the playing field in a blended graduate/undergraduate course,
                     since each student can adapt the project to accommodate their own interests and different
                     levels of academic skills. Several students also enjoyed the creative nature of the
                     project, which was apparent from the continual changes to their home pages during
                     the first few weeks of the semester. For example, one student, Juanita Barrett, included <a class="link_ref" href="http://jbarret5.weebly.com">original photographs</a> documenting the different kinds of clouds in Percy Shelley’s “The Cloud.” This kind
                     of creative work, which many students produced, enhanced engagement with the material
                     and allowed students to become more invested in their projects.

                              not comfortable with computers at all, and she decided to drop the course because
                              of the digital project. This is a potential drawback: even with the instructor’s offer
                              to provide individual help and attention at each stage in the process, some students
                              are simply averse to digital assignments.</span></div>

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Developing quality content proved more difficult for students than initial construction
                  and visual design. After creating the introductory home page and the poem page, several
                  students hit a wall halfway through the semester. As one student asked in class, “I
                  have the homepage and poem, so what do I do now?” This question allowed me to connect
                  the website project to fundamental aspects of every literature course: close reading,
                  research, and writing. As a class, we modeled these moves on the day’s assigned readings:
                  Wordsworth’s “Composed upon Westminster Bridge,” Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals, and
                  a chapter from Ashton Nichols’s <em>Beyond Romantic Ecocriticism</em>. I began by asking students what they thought about Nichols’s claim that Wordsworth’s
                  sonnet was “[o]ne of the greatest nature poems in English, by one of the greatest
                  nature poets in the language” (11). A few students said they were skeptical at first—this
                  was a poem about London, after all—but that Nichols’s subsequent close reading, which
                  illustrates his concept of “urbanature,” persuaded them. We then worked through a
                  close reading of the sonnet alongside Nichols’s analysis, eventually bringing in the
                  textual links to Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals, Darwin’s writings, and other forms
                  of Romantic natural history (all discussed in Nichols’s chapter). I then asked students
                  how these connections and links might take the form of hyperlinks in a digital version
                  of the poem. (I also displayed Nichols’s site on <a class="link_ref" href="http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat/">Romantic Natural History</a> as another model for how students might construct their own sites.) To illustrate
                  these points, we collaboratively built a rough digital version of the sonnet on Weebly,
                  inserting hyperlinks on specific words and phrases that would link to these intertextual
                  connections. The classroom had a built-in projector for the instructor’s computer
                  (this was not a computer lab), so students suggested hyperlinks that I would then
                  insert for everyone to see. This process gave students a better understanding of how
                  to approach their projects, and it allowed them to connect in-class discussions and
                  activities with their websites.</p>
               <p>The following week, we viewed and discussed a student example of the website project.
                  Funmi Stephens, one of the graduate students, volunteered to share her site with the
                  class, which provided some of the undergraduates with a model to which they could
                  aspire. Funmi was constructing <a class="link_ref" href="http://ode2night.weebly.com">her site</a> on John Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale,” and she had created several perceptive hyperlinks/pages.
                  For example, a hyperlink on the nightingale’s “self-same song” takes reader to a page
                  entitled “<a class="link_ref" href="http://ode2night.weebly.com/ballad.html">Ballad</a>,” which contains a video recording of a nightingale singing, details on the bird’s
                  taxonomy, and a brief explanation of the nightingale’s poetic roots in Greek mythology.
                  This page connects the literary resonances of the nightingale with the bird itself,
                  which was common in nineteenth-century England. By doing so, Funmi reveals why Keats
                  writes about this specific bird and how the nightingale relates to the poem’s focus
                  on the juxtaposition of death and immortality. Another page on “<a class="link_ref" href="http://ode2night.weebly.com/immortal.html">Ruth</a>” further examines this juxtaposition. Funmi explains this Biblical reference in the
                  poem and provides an external link to a scholarly article on religion and psychoanalysis.
                  Although we wouldn’t read Keats’s poem as a class for several more weeks, these hyperlinks
                  revealed connections similar to those that Nichols had charted in the readings from
                  the previous week. Providing this example in class inspired many students and helped
                  them to envision their own sites.</p>
               <p>In general, though, there was not a vast difference in the quality of the sites between
                  the undergraduate and graduate students. As none of the students were specializing
                  in eighteenth- or nineteenth-century British literature, they all had more or less
                  the same investment in Romanticism. Also, most graduate students at AUM go into secondary
                  education or community college teaching programs, so research in British Romanticism
                  is not a central focus of their studies. I imagine things might be different in a
                  doctoral program, where students would be at much different stages in their programs
                  of study, but in my class, there was only a one- or two-year separation between the
                  first-year Master’s students and the junior and senior undergraduates. </p>
               <p>Indeed, an undergraduate created one of the best projects of the course. In <a class="link_ref" href="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com">her site</a> on Blake’s “All Religions Are One,” Leslie Rewis has insightful pages on Biblical
                  references, Freud, Ghandi, Yann Martel’s <em>Life of Pi</em>, and Romantic scholarship, among other things. This site had the most hits (something
                  you can track on Weebly), and Leslie was even contacted by a scholar whom she cites.
                  Her site exemplifies the broad range of scholarly engagement afforded by the digital
                  project. For instance, Leslie links the first line of Blake’s poem—“The Voice of one
                  crying in the Wilderness”—to a <a class="link_ref" href="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/isaiah-40-1-5.html">page</a> that explains the Biblical allusion to Isaiah 40:1-5. By teasing out this allusion,
                  Leslie performs what we may call “classical” literary scholarship. However, she also
                  draws from High Theory: in a <a class="link_ref" href="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/freud.html">page</a> on Freud’s theory of personality, she uses psychoanalytic theory to interpret Blake’s
                  concept of the Poetic Genius. Additionally, Leslie created pages on <a class="link_ref" href="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/life-of-pi.html"><em>Life of Pi</em></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="http://allreligionsareone.weebly.com/gandhi.html">Gandhi</a> to explore Blake’s unconventional religious thought. These pages contain quotations,
                  videos, and links to other sites on religion.</p>
               <p>Another undergraduate, Sonni Gunnels, created an <a class="link_ref" href="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com">excellent site</a> on Shelley’s <em>A Vindication of Natural Diet</em>, bringing together information, images, and statistics on anatomy, crime, disease,
                  medicine, and ethics in relation to animals and meat eating. Like Leslie, Sonni’s
                  site illustrates a broad range of scholarly engagement, from a <a class="link_ref" href="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/meatless-edens.html">page</a> on the religious and mythological bases of vegetarianism to a <a class="link_ref" href="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/fermented-liquors.html">page</a> on Shelley’s references to “fermented liquors” to a <a class="link_ref" href="http://alwayssonni.weebly.com/meat-and-crime.html">page</a> on contemporary statistical analyses linking meat consumption and crime. Sonni successfully
                  “modernizes” Shelley’s treatise by drawing from twentieth- and twenty-first-century
                  science to vindicate vegetarianism. Her multidisciplinary approach parallels those
                  of Shelley and Darwin, and her site connects Shelley’s text to the present day, which
                  was a major goal of the assignment.</p>
               <p>Despite these successes, there were two major difficulties related to the project:
                  time management and plagiarism. As is often the case with final essays, a few students
                  put off the majority of the work until the final week of the semester, which resulted
                  in less-than-polished websites. I gave students freedom to complete the project on
                  their own schedule, as long as they followed the milestone checklist outlined earlier.
                  The required week ten meeting proved especially crucial to students’ success. During
                  this face-to-face meeting, I was able to assess each student’s progress, and we had
                  positive discussions on possible hyperlinks and timelines for completion. However,
                  approximately half of the students had completed only the home page and poem page.
                  This required lots of brainstorming, which was also helpful for many students. One
                  possible solution to this problem would be to break the project into multiple stages
                  throughout the semester, with multiple deadlines and grades for each stage.</p>
               <p>The second difficulty involved plagiarism. When I reviewed students’ sites during
                  the week ten meeting, many hyperlink pages contained instances of direct plagiarism.
                  Several students had copied and pasted whole paragraphs from external sites on specific
                  places, author biographies, and scientific details. Some students had included a link
                  at the bottom of the page—but no indication that the writing was not their own—while
                  others did not. As far as I could tell, these were not instances of intentional plagiarism:
                  students simply thought they could do this kind of “reposting” in the online environment
                  (we see it all the time on news sites and blogs, right?). This problem generated fruitful
                  discussions about academic research and citation methods, both in an online environment
                  and in “traditional” modes of scholarship. I likened hyperlinks to footnotes in literature
                  anthologies and scholarly articles, stressing to my students that even on websites,
                  they should always make a clear distinction between their writing and that of others.
                  This may seem like a basic point to stress in an upper-level literature seminar, but
                  I think many students have a much different sense of the “rules” pertaining to online
                  writing and paper-based writing. I plan to add a lesson about online plagiarism and
                  citation rules when I assign this project in the future.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5">
               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>Overall, the website project was a success. Students enjoyed building and sharing
                  their sites, were able to perform significant research and to engage with Romantic
                  texts without the perceived pressure of a formal research paper, and have a permanent
                  testament to the work they did throughout the semester. What’s more, their fusion
                  of “imagination” and “science” enabled them to make creative <em>and</em> scholarly connections with Green Romanticism. This is a major reason why the website
                  worked so well for this class: students learned about and explored the multidisciplinarity
                  of Green Romanticism through a digital assignment that required them to adopt a similarly
                  multidisciplinary approach. My students were able to contribute genuinely to the ongoing
                  shaping of the field, providing new ideas and insights to me, to their classmates,
                  to scholars, and to the general public.</p>
               <p>Ultimately, I urge teachers of Romanticism to adopt digital research projects as alternatives
                  and complements to traditional research papers, especially in interdisciplinary programs
                  and at schools where students’ career goals do not include academia. In fact, <em>most</em> of our students will not pursue an academic career. A digital website project provides
                  students with skills applicable to a wide range of professions: digital composition,
                  visual design, careful research and writing, and creative thinking are core skills
                  in a number of fields. Moreover, website design—even the simple design process of
                  Weebly—is certainly something many students will encounter after they leave college,
                  and having even a brief experience with website design in a literature course could
                  prove a valuable asset. Assigning a website project has the added benefit of engaging
                  students who otherwise have no commitment to or special interest in Romanticism as
                  a field of study. For many students, an upper-level course in Romanticism will be
                  their only exposure to the literature and art of this period, so the website will
                  stand as a lasting testament to their work—and perhaps will inspire a lifelong love
                  of literature. And, while I have argued that the project works especially well for
                  Green Romanticism, I believe this project could be adapted successfully for other
                  thematic approaches or to Romanticism more broadly.</p>
               <p>I also think this project could be tailored for students pursuing a doctoral degree
                  in English: a more sophisticated version of the project utilizing advanced software
                  would be quite appropriate for students at a Research I institution, whose future
                  careers will most likely involve work in the digital humanities. The MLA Job Information
                  Lists from the last few years show that institutions are increasingly interested in
                  hiring recent PhDs with either a focus in digital humanities or a secondary specialization
                  in some form of digital studies. Additionally, digital projects such as the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.blakearchive.org"><em>Blake Archive</em></a>, the <a class="link_ref" href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org"><em>Shelley-Godwin Archive</em></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="https://romantic-circles.org"><em>Romantic Circles</em></a>—not to mention the explosion of online journals and open-access scholarly sites—indicate
                  one of the central directions our profession is headed. Such digital projects afford
                  our students not only opportunities to access important texts and research on canonical
                  figures like Blake and the Shelleys but also to explore lesser-known figures such
                  as Erasmus Darwin. Technology and Green Romanticism go hand in hand, and emphasizing
                  this connection in the classroom has the benefit not only of bringing scientist-poets
                  like Darwin into the fold of Romanticism but also of drawing in more students to an
                  intensive study of Romanticism itself.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Appendix A: Annotated Poem Project: Assignment Prompt</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p class="noCount">As literary scholars, we annotate texts as we read: we take notes in the margins,
               we underline, we make connections, we pose questions, we engage with the text in order
               to understand it in a more sophisticated and enriching manner. In our increasingly
               digital world, these kinds of annotations have naturally moved to the digital sphere.
               Every year, there are more and more digital editions of literary works, and more sites
               dedicated to sharing scholarship with a broader audience (see, for example, the <em>Romantic Circles</em> site, <a class="link_ref" href="http://romantic-circles.org">http://romantic-circles.org</a>, especially its digital editions: <a class="link_ref" href="http://romantic-circles.org/editions">http://romantic-circles.org/editions</a>). For this project, you will contribute to this developing digital world of scholarship
               by creating an online annotated edition of an assigned poem using Weebly (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.weebly.com">http://www.weebly.com</a>). Using Weebly is free and quite easy: the website is generated for you, so all you
               need to do is upload material and customize design elements.</p>
            <p class="noCount">Here’s the assignment: you will create your own Weebly website dedicated to one assigned
               poem, which you will sign up for during the first half of the semester. You will send
               me the url for your site, and I’ll post a link on our shared course site (<a class="link_ref" href="http://greenromanticism.weebly.com">http://greenromanticism.weebly.com</a>). On your site, which you can design in any way you see fit, you must include: (1)
               a home page containing a brief Introduction to the poem and overview of your digital
               edition; (2) a separate page containing the full text of the poem; and (3) at least
               10 hyperlinks in the poem that take readers to separate pages on your site and to
               other websites, sources, videos, paintings, and related texts. These hyperlinks are
               the digital annotations. They could include: biographical and historical details;
               definitions and explanations of Romantic-era terminology; references to and summaries
               of scholarly articles on a specific aspect the poem; links to scholarly sites on the
               poem; paintings or other visual media directly related to the poem (along with your
               commentary); and whatever else is helpful in understanding and explaining the poem.
               Your project is due by our last class session, and we’ll share those in class.</p>

            <p class="noCount"><em>Introductory Page</em></p>
            <p class="noCount">Your Introductory Page should clearly and concisely establish the content and purpose
               of your site, as well as provide appropriate background information and images. Links
               to the various pages on your site should be easily accessible.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em>Poem Page</em></p>
            <p class="noCount">The full text of the poem should appear exactly as it was published/reprinted in our
               anthology. Font style and size should be easy to read.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em>Hyperlinks</em></p>
            <p class="noCount">The poem should have a minimum of ten hyperlinks that take your reader to specific
               pages on your site and/or to appropriate external sites. The hyperlinks should provide
               readers with detailed information to help them understand the poem—that is, the information
               you provide should not be obvious, but rather should require some deal of research

            <p class="noCount"><em>Visual Appeal</em></p>
            <p class="noCount">Think carefully about the overall design of your site as well as the interplay of
               image and text on each individual page. We read both image and text on websites, so
               the two should complement each other. Avoid cluttered pages, fonts that are difficult
               to read, and blurry images.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em>Readability</em></p>
            <p class="noCount">Your writing should be clear and concise, and it should be easy to navigate through
               the site. As you are writing for a public audience, you should avoid academic jargon
               and highly-specialized terminology. If you do use an unfamiliar term or concept, explain
               it clearly for your readers.</p>
            <p class="noCount"><em>Research</em></p>
            <p class="noCount">Your site should contain appropriate outside research from scholarly, peer-reviewed
               publications and sites. There is no minimum research requirement, but your site should
               reflect months of research and work on your text. You must provide appropriate citations
               for all outside sources. </p>

               issue of <em>Studies in Romanticism </em>on “Green Romanticism.” While many scholars prefer the label of “Romantic Ecology”—for
               example, in the <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series </em>volume on “<a class="link_ref" href="http://romantic-circles.org/praxis/ecology/index.html">Romanticism &amp; Ecology</a>”—I used “Green Romanticism” for my course as a more accessible term for students
               who are not familiar with Romanticism or Ecology. “Technological Romanticism,” on
               the other hand, is not so much a formal movement as a reference to the growing body
               of scholarship that links science, technology, and art in the study of Romanticism.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Jerome McGann coined the term “Romantic Ideology” in his important 1983 study of the
               same name, to which ecocritics such as Jonathan Bate responded in the early 1990s.
               After a fruitful decade of scholarship on Green Romanticism, James McKusick established
               the Romantics as foundational ecological writers, and since 2000 scholars have developed
               and tested his claim. Many historicists have critiqued what they see as the Romantics’
               transcendent and idealized vision of Nature, while McKusick and others have emphasized
               the material interconnectedness of Romantic ecology. In recent years, studies on the
               relationship between Romantic-era literature and science have moved scholarly discussions
               beyond debates between ecocriticism and new historicism to questions concerning the
               nature of Romantic ecology. Students in my class pick up with this third wave of Romantic
               ecocriticism. For new historicist work, see McGann; Levinson; Garrard; Morton; and
               Hess. For ecocritical responses to new historicism, see Bate; McKusick; Nichols; Oerlemans;
               and Rigby. For recent work in literature and science, see Sha; Schwartz; Kelley; Faflak
               and Sha; Ottum and Reno; and Mitchell.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">I should note that not everyone was thrilled with the assignment. One student was
               not comfortable with computers at all, and she decided to drop the course because
               of the digital project. This is a potential drawback: even with the instructor’s offer
               to provide individual help and attention at each stage in the process, some students
               are simply averse to digital assignments.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
