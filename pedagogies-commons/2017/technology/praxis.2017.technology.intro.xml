                <p rend="noCount"> This collection came together as the result of the annual
                    Romantic Circles-NASSR (North American Society for the Study of Romanticism)
                    Pedagogy Prize. Lindsey Eckert and Lissette Lopez Szwydky, co-winners of the
                    2014 prize, separately submitted projects that included technology as central
                    components of their courses. Together, the six essays in this volume speak to
                    the value of collaboration, interdisciplinary teaching, and public humanities.
                    Underscoring all of the contributions is a belief that Romantic literature is
                    uniquely suited to innovate pedagogical approaches that embrace new technologies
                    because the historical period itself was characterized by questions about
                    technology, its consequences, and its possibilities. As scholars and educators
                    of Romanticism, we see strong parallels between the period that we teach and the
                    age in which we live. Using multimedia projects, the essays in this collection
                    approach themes central to Romanticism—nature, rights, collaboration, reading,
                    the public sphere—through the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the
                    nineteenth century and the digital revolution at the turn of the twenty-first
                    century. This volume provides practical overviews of technical and digital
                    alternative assignments that can be incorporated into Romantic-period courses,
                    including critical reflection about the value of digital projects in the
                    humanities. </p>

                <p>Technology preoccupies us as scholars and, in particular, as teachers. <title
                        level="m">The Chronicle of Higher Education</title>’s blog <ref
                        target="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/"><title level="m"
                            >ProfHacker</title></ref> often features material dedicated to digital
                    pedagogy. The open-access journal <ref target="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com"
                        >Hybrid Pedagogy</ref> provides important practical and theoretical articles
                    that help educators meet the new possibilities and challenges of digital and
                    online pedagogy. Most recently, the forthcoming collection <title level="m"
                        >Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and
                        Experiments</title> promises to be an important text that helps us think
                    practically and theoretically about how digital technologies are changing what
                    and how we teach in the humanities classroom. (The editors of <title level="m"
                        >Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</title> have made keyword entries
                    available for <ref target="https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org/keywords/"
                        >open review on MLA Commons</ref>.) These examples are just the tip of the
                    iceberg. </p>
                <p>A reader might rightly wonder what a special issue on “Romanticism and
                    Technology” might add to this growing body of material. Indeed, this special
                    issue of <title level="m">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> is not, like
                    other previous issues, organized by genre or author. Yet underscoring all of the
                    contributions here is a belief that Romantic literature is uniquely suited to
                    innovate pedagogical approaches that embrace new technologies because the
                    historical period itself was characterized by questions about technology and its
                    consequences. Herein lies the strength of the collection. Despite the broad
                    range of approaches and interpretations contained in these essays, there exists
                    an uncanny cohesion. As scholars and educators of Romanticism, we see strong
                    parallels between the period that we teach and the age in which we live. Through
                    new lines of interdisciplinary and multimedia inquiry, the essays in this
                    collection ask us to reimagine themes central to Romanticism—nature, rights,
                    collaboration, reading, the public sphere—through the industrial Revolution at
                    the turn of the nineteenth century and the digital revolution at the turn of the
                    twenty-first century. </p>
                <p>The link between the Romantic period and today spurs our own individual pedagogy,
                    and it was for that reason that after the 2014 <ref
                        target="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/contest">NASSR/Romantic Circles
                        Pedagogy Contest</ref> we were asked to co-edit a special issue on this
                    topic. Lissette Lopez Szwydky’s submission for the contest, “<ref
                        target="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/contest/2014.szwydky">Mary Shelley
                        in Context(s): Wikis and Blogs in Romanticism Courses</ref>,” uses
                    open-access digital platforms to reimagine the spirit of collaboration that
                    characterizes the texts and careers of many Romantic-period writers. Through a
                    publicly accessible wiki, her students participate in modes of conversation and
                    scholarship that are themselves more analogous to Romantic modes of thought than
                    pedagogical products like the traditional five-page essay. Moreover, by creating
                    an open-access resource that can be used by multiple courses over a series of
                    years, students’ work also points toward the Godwin-Shelley circle’s emphasis on
                    collaboration, revision, and public education. Lindsey Eckert’s entry, based on
                    the graduate course “<ref
                        target="https://romantic-circles.org/pedagogies/contest/2014.eckert">Romanticism
                        and Technologies of Information</ref>,” emphasizes how debates about access
                    to and the circulation of information represented in Romantic literature,
                    particularly by members of the Godwin-Shelley circle, anticipate current debates
                    about the circulation of (digital) information. In addition to reading Romantic
                    literature, students in the course explore new approaches to literary
                    studies—TEI encoding, data mining, and platforms for making digital
                    editions—that reflect the changing face of scholarship in our own information
                    age. While students can produce research essays, they are also invited to
                    produce collaborative projects.</p>
                <p>Beyond ideas of community so crucial to our own pedagogy, collaboration also
                    grounds the pairing of “Romanticism” and “technology” throughout the essays in
                    this collection. Although a major thread of Romanticism championed individualism
                    and ideas of the solitary genius, the lived experience of many of the period’s
                    authors and readers complicate these notions. Writers at the center of
                    Romanticism formed elaborate social networks whose reach and relationship to
                    technological innovations remain impressive today. They exchanged manuscripts
                    and edited each other’s work. They corresponded regularly, taking advantage of
                    Britain’s growing mail system. They loaned books from circulating libraries and
                    discussed the latest periodicals in coffee shops. They published collaboratively
                    and competed for visibility. They employed emerging technologies to print their
                    works: steam presses, increased use of stereotype plates, and mechanized paper
                    production. They reconsidered the importance of education not only for the
                    individual but also for the masses. </p>
                <p>Similarly, this collection of essays emphasizes the possibilities opened by
                    collaboration and technology despite how much our profession continues to value
                    individual research, authorship, and teaching that privileges the essay genre.
                    Several of the contributions in this issue are collaboratively written, often as
                    the result of co-taught courses. The individually authored essays, too, show the
                    importance of collaborative discourse (in the classroom and among different
                    areas of specialization) and cooperative assignments (through peer review or
                    public sharing). </p>
                <p>In many ways, the technological and collaborative dimensions of the assignments
                    discussed in this collection mirror the material practices of Romantic-era
                    writing and publishing. Literary production (both then and now) relies on
                    period-specific technology to reimagine the audiences and aims of literature.
                    Romantic literary culture anticipates the frenetic and disjointed spirit of
                    internet publishing, social media, and educational practices. Not only was
                    “authority” a questionable category politically, but it was also one complicated
                    by historical authorship and editorial practices. As William St Clair reminds
                    us, “anonymity seems to have been normal, particularly for first books,” and
                    anonymous and pseudonymous publication was also used to escape the authority of
                    libel laws, with Byron’s <title level="m">Don Juan </title>being the most famous
                    example (173).<note place="foot">For a more comprehensive view of anonymous
                        publication in the Romantic period see Peter Garside, James Raven, and
                        Rainer Schöwerling’s bibliography of English novels.</note> The slipperiness
                    of authorship—exemplified by the publication history of John William Polidori’s
                    “The Vampyre: A Tale,” originally attributed to Byron—complicated the authority
                    one had over one’s name, copyright, and literary style. Moreover, Romantic
                    writers revised frequently, and many of the period’s most famous works exist in
                    multiple versions or editions (i.e., William Blake’s illuminated books,
                    Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title>, Wordsworth’s <title
                        level="m">The Prelude</title>, and Byron’s <title level="m">The
                        Giaour</title>). Fragmentary and unstable texts unsettled conceptions of
                    literary coherence and authority. These issues, prevalent in the Romantic
                    literary marketplace, are further complicated today by modern “authoritative
                    editions” that attempt to untangle them. </p>
                <p>Such shifts in the literary marketplace concerned contemporaries. Scholarship
                    reevaluating the Romantic public sphere, such as Paul Keen’s <title level="m"

                        Sphere</title> and Andrew Franta’s <title level="m">Romanticism and the Rise
                        of the Mass Public</title>, has shown that the conditions of writing,
                    publishing, and reading in the period were overshadowed by uneasy feelings about
                    the unknowable, uncontrollable aspects of a rapidly expanding and largely
                    anonymous public. Indeed, much of what is deemed suspicious about online
                    publishing today (textual instability, anonymity, lack of authority) reflects
                    similar criticisms that coincided with the rise of the novel, the explosion of
                    radical periodicals, the anonymous mass of writers who produced them, and
                    readers who consumed them. </p>
                <p>In this light, the essays collected here maintain technology’s centrality to
                    Romanticism and its continued legacy in the present. The themes and projects
                    discussed in this volume were not developed with the aim of imposing
                    anachronistic models of technological engagement for the sake of engaging
                    students in the study of literary history on their own terms. We maintain that
                    the pedagogical and scholarly possibilities afforded by today’s technology are a
                    natural progression of Romanticism’s emergence in the age of revolutions:
                    technological and political, literary and social. The essays here present an
                    implicit argument that Romantic technology and mediation are key precursors to
                    our own contemporary multimedia-driven culture. Thus, they support previous
                    claims that “the modern technological age” actually “began with the industrial
                    revolution and romanticism” and that “Romantic poetry is both strikingly
                    illuminated by, and capable of illuminating, our multi-mediated situation” (Ong
                    1; Langan and McLane 239). We see parallels here of Clifford Siskin and William
                    Warner’s edited collection <title level="m">This is Enlightenment</title>, which
                    resituates what is sometimes understood as a singular moment in modern history
                    as “an event in the history of mediation” characterized by the rise of distinct
                    models for organizing information, tools and techniques for disseminating
                    knowledge, and practices for operating under new philosophical, economic, and
                    political systems (1). If, as Siskin and Warner’s volume suggests,
                    eighteenth-century writers were the Enlightenment’s architects, then the
                    Romantics (and their twenty-first-century successors) were its practitioners,
                    introducing new models of critique and technique as the proliferation of new
                    media turned to saturation. </p>
                <p>Like Sisken and Warner, we see clear parallels between the technological
                    revolutions of the turn of the nineteenth century and “the tale now being retold
                    by the early twenty-first-century advent of electronic and digital media. . . .
                    [E]veryone has the sense that there is nowhere to hide from [technology’s]
                    mediating powers; in fact, the desire to hide is itself an index to saturation
                    and confirmation of difference becoming a new norm” (19). As educators, we
                    recognize that the saturation of new media in our students’ lives both in and
                    outside of the classroom requires new modes of engagement as we teach students
                    to consume, critique, and produce knowledge. We also hear echoes of excitement
                    and mistrust among our colleagues and students that resonate with the critical
                    questions that Romantic literature poses. The period’s thinkers and artists
                    employed the newest technologies to communicate with growing audiences and
                    expanding publics while remaining skeptical of its increasing presence in daily
                    life. This, too, is a value that students today can take from the Romantics and
                    the scholars who serve as mediators between the past and the present; as
                    technology becomes ubiquitous, there is a need for understanding both its uses
                    and its limitations. Since many Romantic texts themselves thematize technology’s
                    limits and possibilities as well as the changing nature of the public sphere,
                    Romanticism is especially well-situated to help students become critical users
                    of technology. One way to do this is to teach practices that ask students to use
                    the technologies available to them as a way of rethinking how they too can
                    become historical mediators for a range of audiences with varying levels of
                    exposure to the content covered in the classroom.</p>
                <p>Questions of access also offer a common thread amongst in the present collection
                    much like they informed Mary Wollstonecraft’s call for a national system of
                    education, the democratic language of “the new poetry” spearheaded by William
                    Wordsworth and Coleridge’s <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, and Percy
                    Bysshe Shelley’s excitement for the public’s increasing access to print. All of
                    the digital projects described in this issue draw on open-access resources and
                    platforms. Romantic-era literature, history, and technology are imagined for a
                    broad cross-section of students at different points in their academic careers.
                    Our decision to highlight access in our original call for papers reflects the
                    material conditions and restrictions of teaching today as budget cuts dominate
                    higher education and the value of the humanities is increasingly questioned. The
                    innovative assignments with public-engagement components outlined in several of
                    these essays demonstrate how we might use pedagogy to convey the relevance of
                    humanistic inquiry beyond the academy. By adding to Wikipedia or creating
                    original open-access editions, students of Romanticism add to a body of
                    knowledge that crosses the boundaries between town and gown. A related goal of
                    this collection is to reflect the range of institutions where Romanticism is
                    taught, the different levels of access afforded to each, and the distinctive
                    needs of students. These essays represent teaching and research environments
                    from across North America, from online courses at state institutions to small
                    classes at liberal arts colleges. </p>
                <p>Despite diverse institutions, common questions arise. What might graduate
                    students in English gain from digital projects on the Romanticism? How do
                    undergraduate English majors who will move on to a range of careers after
                    graduation benefit from non-traditional assignments? How is the study of
                    Romanticism beneficial for biology and computer engineering majors as well as
                    those in English? One significant conclusion presented by these essays is that
                    employing innovative technologies and assignments build the same skills that we
                    have traditionally valued in our discipline: close reading, analytical thinking,
                    and rigorous (well-cited) research. Moreover, these essays suggest that as
                    Romanticists we are uniquely positioned to “encourage the transfer of print
                    reading abilities to digital and vice versa” that, according to Katherine
                    Hayles, is absent in many literary courses (63). Together these essays offer
                    practical plans and course materials that will help readers confidently adopt
                    them for their own classroom. Beyond modeling innovative classroom practices,
                    the authors of these essays also help us reflect theoretically about how
                    teaching Romantic literature alongside (historical) questions of technology,
                    ethics, and humanity can help prepare students for future academic work as well
                    as for being more reflective people generally. All of the digital assignments
                    covered here require students to consider the crossover from the classroom into
                    the public sphere not as a “secondary” learning outcome but instead as a primary
                    mode of engagement that highlights practical uses and ethical effects of
                    humanistic study in the twenty-first century.</p>
                <p>Interdisciplinary thinking and action drive Seth Reno’s “‘Imagination under the
                    banner of Science’: Teaching Green Romanticism with Weebly.” Reno fuses “Green
                    Romanticism” and “Technological Romanticism” through web-based assignments where
                    students create digital editions. These editions bring together text-based
                    readings, authoritative sources, and multimedia elements that illustrate each
                    poem’s text alongside its landscapes, ecological references, and visual frames
                    of reference. Thus, Reno asks his students to model “the interdisciplinary
                    nature of the [Romantic] poems” that they study, achieving a “place-based”
                    literacy of the poems’ texts and environmental contexts. Undergraduate and
                    graduate students in this split-level course use traditional skills (close
                    reading, logical organization, and scholarly support and attribution) to create
                    digital projects that connect the ecological concerns of Romantic texts to
                    current ethical debates in a medium aimed at a public audience. Reno ends with a
                    refreshingly honest reflection about the challenges that multimedia projects
                    present, yet he also argues that, despite their challenges, these projects are
                    particularly good at providing students with skills applicable to careers both
                    in and outside of the academy.</p>
                <p>In “‘A Sound but half its own’: A Collaborative, Cross-Disciplinary Exploration
                    of Poetic Sounds in Literature and Electrical Engineering Classrooms,” Andrew
                    Burkett and Palmyra Catravas detail their innovative collaboration between the
                    humanities and the applied sciences. They show us how modern technology can be
                    used to better understand Romantic poetics. Separate groups of students from
                    English and Engineering collaborate on semester-long projects that visualize
                    sound waves created by an Aeolian harp and recite poems to “measure poetic sound
                    with scientific instrumentation.” The engineering students write papers
                    according to standards of scientific writing, and the literature students add
                    historical and literary details while also gaining experience in technical
                    writing and editing. While the individual courses each focus primarily on the
                    terms and tools of their respective disciplines, the students simultaneously
                    experience how cross-disciplinary work enhances each area of study.</p>
                <p>New approaches to semester-long projects and scholarly editions unfold from the
                    perspectives of both instructor and students in “Digital Projects in the
                    Romanticism Classroom: A Practical Guide to Student Use of WordPress,”
                    collaboratively written by Michelle Levy and two graduate students, Ashley
                    Morford and Lindsey Seatter. Along with the detailed rationale and pedagogical
                    planning that Levy relates, the student perspective adds an important voice to
                    the educational experience, arguing for the “use-value” of digital projects in
                    literature classes. Their essay challenges us to reconsider the research essay’s
                    prominence in literary courses, and it celebrates the range of outcomes possible
                    when students are afforded flexibility to experiment with new formats. The piece
                    also provides a primer for instructors who are relatively new to digital
                    projects, and it discusses numerous examples of web resources, open-access
                    archives, and a <ref target="https://romanticdigitalprojects.wordpress.com/"
                        >companion website</ref> with clear tutorials and links to several
                    successful projects. Additionally, Morford and Seatter describe how they have
                    used their projects as foundations for ongoing graduate work, remaking the final
                    project for Levy’s course into the first step in a larger research agenda that
                    advances Romanticism’s relevance to digital humanities.</p>
                <p>Andrea Rehn’s “Digital Communities, Embodied Learning, and Material Culture in
                    Jane Austen” invites readers to consider the parallels between social identity
                    in the Regency period and the digital age. The social networks described in
                    Austen’s works come into relief through assignments that emphasize embodied
                    practices including reading, dancing, and socializing. Students use online tools
                    such as Tumblr and YouTube to capture, create, and distribute cultural artifacts
                    and customs from the Romantic period. For Rehn and her students, technology
                    enables a multisensory understanding of the relevant historical context. Whether
                    collecting recipes for bread pudding, creating video guides, or throwing a
                    Regency-themed ball, students demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the social
                    codes that guided Austen’s characters. At the same time they are asked to
                    consider questions of subjectivity and performance as they develop their own
                    online identities, and Rehn shows how contemporary social media theories of
                    “context collapse” and “participatory culture” provide students with a framework
                    for exploring the social mores of Regency country gentry.</p>
                <p>In a different take on the more ephemeral aspects of Romantic culture so distant
                    to many students, “Digital Experiments in Romantic-era Commonplace Books”
                    contrasts the ways that audiences in different historical periods manage
                    “information overload.” Working with <ref target="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu"
                        >Harvard University Library’s Open Collections Program</ref>’s open-access
                    digital manuscripts, Shelley AJ Jones stresses the connections between
                    eighteenth-century periodicals, nineteenth-century commonplace books, and
                    contemporary technology. Padlet provides a digital platform where students
                    create their own virtual commonplace books. Students use John Locke’s indexing
                    system to “synthesize the wealth of material . . . gathered over the course of
                    the semester into manageable pieces that suggest larger questions of
                    categorizing the Romantic period.” Students curate and preserve the most
                    relevant information according to a combination of personal interests as well as
                    historical models of knowledge organization in a digital environment. Students
                    work individually and collaboratively on projects that teach them as much about
                    information management in the Romantic period as in the digital age. Readers
                    interested in data management will find useful parallels with Ann Blair and
                    Peter Stallybrass’s “Mediating Information, 1450-1800,” a concise survey of
                    techniques and technologies of storing and retrieving information from the
                    medieval period through the Enlightenment.</p>
                <p>Concluding the volume, Mark Crosby and Alex Stinson ask how collaborative writing
                    models and existing public knowledge repositories can be harnessed in the
                    Romantic literature classroom. “William Blake, Wikipedia, and a Public Pedagogy”
                    tackles the challenges of creating credible information for one of the most
                    popular sites on the internet. For Crosby and Stinson, Blake and Wikipedia are a
                    natural pairing. Both are media phenomena built on democratic ethos. More
                    importantly, they identify an opportunity for student work to shape public
                    discourse. Especially helpful in this essay is the discussion of Wikipedia’s
                    established standards for quality assessment. While many scholars question the
                    credibility of the site (especially with regard to students’ overreliance on
                    Wikipedia as a source), Crosby and Stinson show us that Wikipedia’s standards
                    are actually quite stringent—perhaps even more so than the standards to which
                    undergraduate literary students are often held. Their discussion reveals how we
                    might better align pedagogical expectations for evaluation, scholarly standards
                    for publication, and the public need for quality information. Students are thus
                    situated in a unique and empowered position to supply this need and increase the
                    visibility of the humanities in the public sphere. </p>
                <p>At their core, all of the essays here gesture toward the need to extend the
                    discourses of the humanities in general, and Romanticism in particular, beyond
                    classroom and disciplinary boundaries. Technology offers an effective toolkit to
                    accomplish these goals. One of our biggest challenges as Romanticists lies in
                    demonstrating to our students the parallels between past and present as well as
                    the value of humanities versus straightforward professional training. Technology
                    provides a bridge between concepts that may seem distinctive or perhaps even
                    incompatible to our students through practices that reflect their material and
                    virtual realities.</p>
                <p>Beyond pedagogy, the work presented in this collection has larger implications
                    for research, scholarship, and disciplinary innovation. Explicit connections
                    between technology and literature are critical to contemporary literary studies.
                    Much in the same way that Romanticists were central to the development of
                    literary theories shaping the pedagogical frameworks that underscore our own
                    training, digital humanities and pedagogy fosters not only interdisciplinary
                    work, but also <emph>intra</emph>-disciplinary discussion. What do we share in
                    common with colleagues who specialize in historical periods or theoretical
                    approaches different from our own? How can asking our own students to reimagine
                    their scholarly research and practice encourage us to do the same? How can we
                    find opportunities to connect the work in our individual courses to the broader
                    implications of literary study in the twenty-first century? The essays collected
                    here provide models for technology’s ability to reimagine Romanticism as the
                    springboard for critical pedagogy and public humanities. </p>
