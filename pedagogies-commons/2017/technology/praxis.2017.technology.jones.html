            <p class="noCount">The Romantic period saw an explosion of printed material, ushered in by the end of
               perpetual copyright in 1774, new technologies that led the charge toward mass production,
               and the nearly insatiable appetite of a newly formed reading public. The concept of
               information overload far predates that contemporary term; in the Romantic period,
               like today, expanded access made the feeling more acute. Many Romantic readers felt
               the need, with the surfeit of information, to make their engagement more lasting.
               One way Romantic readers—and our students—could meet this need is through collection,
               and later indexing and reflection, in commonplace books. This article explores adopting
               a sustained practice of commonplacing in online classes as a way for students to position
               themselves as best they can as Romantic readers, confronting in the internet age a
               similar expansion of ideas and information. It details a semester-long project that
               pushes students to move from collection and organization to synthesis and reflection.
               Students keep individual commonplace books, contribute to a class-wide commonplace
               book, and reorganize and reflect upon their shared commonplace book in place of a
               traditional final exam. The purpose of these assignments is to foster students’ understanding
               of the historical and personal value of the commonplace book as a genre and to ensure
               students’ engagement with thematic threads within the Romantic period. Assignment
               sheets and “quick start” guides for students are made available with this article,
               along with a reference aid for those interested in incorporating these assignments
               in their classrooms. </p>

               <p>In 1751, at the nascence of the print-saturated age that would continue to see unprecedented
                  heights, Samuel Johnson invented a figurative use for the term ephemera in his <a class="link_ref" href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004772607.0001.005/1:5.3?rgn=div2;view=fulltext"><em>Rambler</em> 145</a>. The insect whose life spans a mere day becomes equivalent in Johnson’s terms to
                  newspapers, “the <em>Ephemerae </em>of learning,” those “productions . . . seldom intended to remain in the world longer
                  than a week” (Johnson). Despite his defense of these writers of ephemera, Johnson’s
                  turn of phrase nonetheless carries notions of death and decay. The printed page loses
                  its value when it loses its immortality, Johnson reports, and when its production
                  outstrips its longevity.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Johnson’s claim, though intended solely for periodical publications, presages the
                     publishing boom to come. The Romantic period saw an explosion of printed material,
                     ushered in by the end of perpetual copyright in 1774, new technologies that led the
                     charge toward mass production, and the nearly insatiable appetite of a newly formed
                     reading public.

                              Taunton’s article “Print Culture” for the British Library provides accessible information
                              on Romantic and Victorian print technologies.</span></div>

               <p>There is debate over the extent to which this “reading revolution” is particularly
                  Romantic, with H. J. Jackson making the case that literacy rates were on the rise
                  before the Romantic period and mass production would not come until the Victorian
                  age. Even if these technologies had not practically realized the boom in production
                  and distribution of knowledge, their presence and promise changed the conversation
                  about reading and publishing. We can reconsider the term “revolution” without denying
                  there was considerably more print for Romantic readers and that readers’ engagement
                  with any material could now be ephemeral. The concept of information overload far
                  predates that contemporary term; in the Romantic period, like today, expanded access
                  made the feeling more acute. Many Romantic readers felt the need, with the surfeit
                  of information, to make their engagement more lasting. One way Romantic readers—and
                  our students—could meet this need is through collection, and later indexing and reflection,
                  in commonplace books. </p>
               <p>Commonplace books allowed Romantic readers to confront the overload of printed pages
                  by editing their own volumes, pushing back against the new technology through a deliberately
                  antiquated and painstaking form of collection and transcription revived, as William
                  St. Clair notes, from “the manuscript miscellanies of the sixteenth and seventeenth
                  centuries” (226). The desire to order information is not foreign to traditional student
                  populations, millennials who are digital natives, or even the population I teach,
                  nontraditional students in online and distance degree completion programs. The world
                  is one where Buzzfeed has perfected the art of the listicle, programs like Pinterest
                  and Tumblr allow users simple forums through which to bookmark, follow, and find.
                  As the most popular search engine, Google’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.google.com/about/">stated mission</a> is “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”
                  Through adopting a sustained practice of commonplacing, my students and I position
                  ourselves as best we can as Romantic readers, confronting in the internet age a similar
                  expansion of ideas and information.</p>
               <p>Asking students to inhabit the genre through an integrated and sustained set of hands-on
                  activities that reimagine the means of traditional recall, synthesis, and analysis
                  expands their grasp of the historical factors that condition texts. Commonplacing
                  literally and figuratively collapses the distance between texts, drawing them into
                  a conversation that resembles the way Romantic readers met these same works. We encounter
                  our readings, not as discrete works of genius huddled under authors’ names in anthologies,
                  but as part of a larger cultural conversation integrally tied to those who produce
                  literature and to those who consumed and still consume these works. There is something
                  powerful in confronting the materiality of texts—even, paradoxically, through digital
                  means—that, at its best, empowers students as readers, collapsing the distance between
                  their experience and what can seem so foreign. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I developed the “Commonplacing Our Semester” project for an online course, English
                     411: British Romantic Literature, to be offered to students in an interdisciplinary
                     degree completion program. The semester-long project pushes students to move from
                     collection and organization to synthesis and reflection. Students keep individual
                     commonplace books, contribute to a class-wide commonplace book, and reorganize and
                     reflect upon their shared commonplace book in place of a traditional final exam. The
                     purpose of these assignments is to foster students’ understanding of the historical
                     and personal value of the commonplace book as a genre and to ensure students’ engagement
                     with thematic threads within the Romantic period. I prescribe fixed parameters for
                     the class-wide commonplace book, leaving the individual assignment more fluid and
                     open to creative, yet still historically relevant, interpretations. As our commonplacing
                     is a sustained project, I take pains to create continuity in style and structure across
                     teaching materials, including assignment sheets and “quick start” guides for students
                     (which are made available with this article, along with a reference aid for those
                     interested in incorporating these assignments in their classrooms).

               <p>Students initiate their understanding of the genre though archival research of commonplace
                  books housed in the <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu">Harvard University Library’s Open Collections Program</a> and further their understanding through adopting the practice themselves. Students’
                  research informs their choice of purpose and technology for their individual commonplace
                  books. The class-wide commonplace book takes John Locke as its model. Commonplace
                  books allowed readers to amass information, similar to the way blogs and social media
                  forums offer records or catalogs of information. Some Romantic readers, influenced
                  by Locke’s popular treatise <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3209685"><em>A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books</em></a> (1706), used indexing to track commonalities. This added layer of organization was
                  not an end unto itself; it was meant to spur further critical thought, with usefulness,
                  according to Locke, the chief goal of commonplacing.</p>

                     </div> For the shared commonplace book, I use <a class="link_ref" href="https://padlet.com">Padlet</a>, a free note-taking program that may in comparison look rudimentary but allows users
                     to manipulate the page beyond sequential readings or targeted searches for single
                     items. Students transcribe weekly quotations, devising what Locke called “heads” for
                     the index, motifs or tags for each quotation. Students refine their thinking in the
                     final exam, which requires a further reorganization of the collected quotations and
                     heads into thematic threads. To successfully complete the exam, students must return
                     to our semester’s work to find <em>common places</em> among what they collectively and cumulatively have contributed. Looking back, they
                     recognize patterns that have emerged in our thinking about Romanticism and how we
                     might define Romanticism given our class’s concerns. Their accompanying essays take
                     up issues of process—how and why students chose the themes they did—and consider Romanticism
                     as both an intellectual movement and historical period. The two parts of the exam
                     help students synthesize the wealth of material we have gathered over the course of
                     the semester into manageable pieces that suggest larger questions of categorizing
                     the Romantic period.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Curating an Online Experience</span></h2>
               <p>Effective use of technology is essential to my teaching, as most of my courses are
                  taught either asynchronously and wholly online or through other distance means. The
                  online course is its own genre, dependent upon the written word as its means of communication.
                  In contrast to live discussion, participants, both students and instructors, craft
                  and (ideally) have time to polish what it is they want to say. But reading 250 words
                  is a different experience than hearing 250 words. My most successful online courses
                  avoid attempting to replicate the experience of a live classroom. I attempt, instead,
                  to embrace the genre, working within the limitations and the possibilities of the
                  virtual classroom. </p>
               <p>As online educators, we are curators of the learning experience. Embracing the medium
                  through which we communicate with students involves not simply amassing information
                  but reimagining it. The majority of my students are taking full course loads online,
                  in addition to their 9-to-5 jobs, which require many more hours in front of a computer
                  screen. Not only do I organize learning modules with information overload in mind,
                  but I also draw this concept into the virtual classroom. With its dependence upon
                  the written word, our digital medium reflects commonplacers’ active engagement with
                  written text. Even the social aspects of commonplacing—circulating the book among
                  friends, transcribing a favorite line or penning an original verse for its owner—use
                  written modes of communication. We, too, rely on the written word.</p>
               <p>In my experience, providing students with as much detail as possible about major assignments
                  upfront—despite the potential for information overload—assuages student fears in an
                  online learning environment. I introduce the semester-long engagement with commonplace
                  books in the course’s first learning module with a lengthy assignment sheet I title
                  “Commonplacing Our Semester.” (Link to the full document through Figure 1 below.)
                  </p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/jones-1Thumb.jpg" alt="Repeated visual design on the project’s assignment sheets. (View PDFs of the “Commonplacing Our Semester” and “Final Exam” assignment sheets here.)" class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>The introductory sections of this assignment sheet link Romantic reading experiences
                  with our own, specifically through the “Consider while Commonplacing” box on page
                  2. This part asks students to consider modern equivalents of commonplacing through
                  tagging, sharing to save, and bookmarking, while introducing terms common in modern
                  conversations about technology—information overload fatigue and information literacy.
                  The last page of the assignment sheet reassures students that feeling information
                  overload is an intentional part of our learning experience. </p>
               <p>After a brief introduction to commonplacing as a Romantic practice, the assignment
                  sheet details the four component parts of the semester-long project: archival research
                  of primary source material; an individual commonplace book that students propose and
                  keep throughout the semester; a class-wide commonplace book they share digitally with
                  their colleagues; and a final exam that requires reorganization and reflection upon
                  the shared piece. Despite my desire for transparency, I leave off details of the final
                  exam until late in the semester so that students’ commonplacing stems from their experience
                  of the weekly readings and our exploratory discussions, not from a prescribed end
                  goal. These four components total a little over 40% of students’ final grades, as
                  explained in Figure 2 below, with the remainder of the semester’s final grade divided
                  among a close reading essay (20%), researched argument (25%), and participation on
                  discussion boards (15%). </p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/jones-2Thumb.jpg" alt="The four components in brief, captured from page 3 of the “Commonplacing Our Semester” assignment sheet." class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>I am keenly aware that assignment sheets, especially in a wholly online format, can
                  add to information overload. But a digital classroom does not allow for asides and
                  clarifications that occur when reviewing a document in person. Structure is key to
                  producing materials that are thorough yet manageable. Repeated visual elements within
                  and across the two assignments sheets underscore significant requirements and guide
                  students to see the project as a whole. </p>

                  <p>Commonplacing allows students a way to arrange information and empowers students to
                     feel a sense of ownership over this knowledge. To ground students in the practice
                     of commonplacing, I assign two short and digestible readings: William St. Clair’s
                     brief historical overview of Romantic era commonplace books from <em>The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</em> (224-29) coupled with the <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html">homepage</a> of Harvard’s commonplace book digital archive. I require little secondary reading
                     so that students’ understanding of the genre comes from their archival research into
                     the nearly 100 commonplace books digitized by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu">Harvard University Library’s Open Collections Program</a> as part of its <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/">Reading</a> collection.

                              posts that explore early modern commonplace books: “How To Read Like a Renaissance
                              Reader,” “Necessary Quotation Marks,” “Re-membering Shakespeare,” and “Mangling Shakespeare.”
                              Stephen Colclough’s Consuming Texts: Readers and Reading Communities, 1695-1870 includes
                              ample detail on commonplace books’ origins in the early modern period, reimagining
                              through Locke, and permutations as albums through the nineteenth century.</span></div>
                     </div> Large digitization projects like Harvard’s make the kind of work I propose here possible
                     for larger institutions and for students whose resources may be limited. Harvard’s
                     open-access resource offers millions of digitized pages, curated into six themed projects.
                     The project we use, the Reading collection, houses manuscript and printed material
                     related to reading as a solitary and social practice, including a subsection for <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html">commonplace books</a>. But these projects themselves represent a glut of information that can overwhelm
                     the online learner accessing them on a home PC.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To ease this potential information overload, I developed a <em>Quick Start Guide to the Harvard Collections</em> (linked below in Figure 3) with visual steps for accessing and navigating the archive,
                     along with explanations of Harvard’s terminology, tips for the site, and links to
                     pertinent Romantic materials. Harvard’s selections span the seventeenth to the nineteenth
                     centuries and five languages, in both printed and manuscript forms. The database provides
                     digital surrogates, often without transcriptions or translations, which can be daunting
                     for undergraduates. Few of the books themselves are fully searchable, but the links
                     on the commonplace book <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html">homepage</a> can focus students’ individual efforts. For example, as shown in Figure 3 below, I
                     direct students to read first the ten commonplace books linked in the overview section
                     on the homepage. I then ask that they explore the <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/highlights/highlight1.html">Reading “Collection Highlights”</a> (specifically pages <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/highlights/highlight9.html">nine</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/highlights/highlight10.html">ten</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/highlights/highlight11.html">eleven</a> which deal explicitly with commonplace books) before searching by century, language,
                     or type of publication and navigating one by one the full list of items.

               <h2><span class="head">Applying the Theory: Individual and Shared Commonplace Books</span></h2>
               <p>Once we have compiled a rough definition of the genre, we move to practices of commonplacing.
                  The freedom within boundaries that characterizes Romantic commonplace books is why
                  I assign two forms: the individual and shared commonplace books, both requiring weekly
                  entries that engage that module’s readings. The individual commonplace book’s grade
                  is based on a brief proposal and electronic submission of the commonplace book in
                  full at the end of the semester. Even if students wait to compile all entries at the
                  close of the semester, they will still meet the goals for this component: self-directed
                  engagement with assigned readings and parsing connections between the historical facets
                  of the genre and modern resonances of commonplace books.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The assignment sheet’s section “To Consider When Writing Your Proposal” suggests possible
                     purposes, entries, and technologies to guide students’ proposals, but they are not
                     bound by these suggestions. Students, like their Romantic predecessors, may choose
                     to collect only particular types of material (poetry, for example, like this nineteenth-century <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3163259">collection of ballads</a>) or group their collections thematically, as did eighteenth-century commonplacer
                     Thomas Austen in separate manuscripts on <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3685841">poetry and plays</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3686383">religious poetry</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3294845">theology and philosophy</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3707797">devotional literature and sermons</a>.

                              The Harvard archive includes Ellis Gray Loring’s commonplace book printed in 1821
                              with an “Illustration of the Common-Place Book” in modern typeface based on Locke’s

                              the Harvard Collections, which explains how to access transcriptions.</span></div>
                     </div> This method became so popular that publishers printed commonplace books “upon the
                     plan recommended and practised by John Locke,” such as the ones <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3196824">Ellis Gray Loring</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:3446603">George Ripley</a> kept, and, in 1831, Charles Sumner published <a class="link_ref" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.ARCH:3990555"><em>The Lawyer's Common-place Book</em></a> based on Locke’s formula, all of which I ask students to reference.

                     </div> Locke and Le Clerc assert the usefulness of commonplace books—that “it is of Service
                     to have Collections of this Kind, both that Students may learn the Art of putting
                     Things in Order, as also the better retain what they Read” (sequence 13). What Locke
                     adds—and what publishers later capitalize on—is a clear methodology for keeping an
                     index.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This organizational principle, in brief, involves an index with what Locke calls “heads,”
                  what literarily we would call motifs, or, on the internet, tags. (I consciously use
                  the term “heads” since a primary learning outcome for this component is for students
                  to apply practically Locke’s theory.) Locke’s method, in its most simplified form,
                  is as follows: at the beginning or end of the book, the commonplacer designates blank
                  pages with alphabetical columns into which heads are accumulated, as seen below in
                  Figure 4. When adding content throughout the commonplace book, the commonplacer keeps
                  running heads in the margins of the pages that are then cross-referenced in the index
                  with the page number. Even in our simplified form (explained in more detail in the
                  next section), indexing requires students to move beyond note taking to employing
                  pattern recognition and engagement with literary motifs. “Locke’s ‘New Method,’” Stephen
                  Colclough notes, “still encouraged readers to record extracts from their reading under
                  headings, but these were now to emerge from their reading rather than dictate it”
                  (33). My students, like the Romantics before them, engage in an active process of
                  reading and interacting with material collected that results in an intentionally ordered
                  book instead of a dizzying collection of quotations with little use beyond their initial
                  transcription. </p>

                  or website, there are multiple levels of <a class="link_ref" href="http://blog.padlet.com/2013/01/even-better-privacy-settings.html">privacy</a>, from password protected to public, with an unlimited number of users whose level
                  of access can be tailored through permissions. There are options to send <a class="link_ref" href="http://blog.padlet.com/2013/03/email-notifications.html">emailed notifications</a> when users modify a wall, and, if not embedded, URLs are customizable (with student
                  names for their individual commonplace books, for example).</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/jones-6Thumb.jpg" alt="Example of a Padlet wall embedded as a content item in Blackboard.

               <p>After completing research into Locke’s method of indexing, specifically by reading
                  Locke’s guide and referencing commonplace books styled after his method linked in
                  the Commonplacing Our Semester assignment sheet, students begin weekly entries on
                  our Padlet wall. Each entry consists of two parts: a single quotation from that week’s
                  textbook reading and “heads” (Locke’s term for motifs or tags) added to the index
                  that the student generated for this quotation. </p>
               <p>To prepare for weekly entries to the class-wide commonplace book, I prearrange and
                  embed a Padlet wall with the index, consisting of separate text boxes (what Padlet
                  terms “posts”) for each letter of the alphabet, followed by a subheading for weekly
                  entries, as shown in Figures 7 and 8. One shortcoming of Padlet is that the virtual
                  surface stops immediately after the last post, which impedes maneuverability. I add
                  a “placeholder” post, seen in Figure 8, dragging it down the page until there is ample
                  space for students to add entries. </p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/jones-7Thumb.jpg" alt="Sample pre-arranged index for the class-wide commonplace book." class="graphic"/></figure>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The basic form of an entry, seen in Figure 9, includes three parts: a student’s name
                     and module week number in the title line; the material from that week’s reading the
                     student wishes to contribute; and a list of running heads, which are the motifs the
                     student assigns to the passage quoted. I limit the length of quotations (10 lines
                     for poetry, 250 words for prose) to keep the page manageable and to avoid another
                     potential form of information overload. I offer bonus points for students who add
                     heads to their classmates’ posts, denoted by their name in parentheses after the head,
                     as in the figure below where Student B has added “innocence” and “experience” to another
                     student’s entry. Padlet also offers an unobtrusive way to attach documents to text
                     box entries with explanations as to why students selected the particular passage.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                              (12)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I only require explanations if students wish to post a quotation that has already
                              been chosen by a fellow classmate. In this case, students would note “Duplicate Entry”
                              with their classmate’s name in the text box, along with a list of heads, and attach
                              a paragraph justifying their inclusion of this passage. The Quick Start Guide for
                              Padlet, page 5, includes an example of a duplicate entry. Although the first-come,
                              first-served nature might be a detraction, I do not disallow or discourage duplicate
                              entries since, as Adam Hooks notes, commonplaces tend to be common, both familiar
                              and quotable.</span></div>

               <p>The second weekly requirement is to add the heads students have generated to the alphabetical
                  index at the top of the wall, along with entries for author (in boldface) and title
                  (styled according to MLA rules and followed by the author’s name in parentheses),
                  as in Figure 10. Students must be diligent about checking the index so as to add heads
                  created by classmates that they might not have considered, but which are relevant
                  to their contributions. </p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/jones-10Thumb.jpg" alt="Sample index with student entries in the class-wide commonplace book. " class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>Whereas printed commonplace books allow for page numbers to be added to the index,
                  Padlet’s digital surface provides a continuous screen, unbroken by discrete sections.
                  To replicate the cross-referencing gained through pagination, I ask students at the
                  end of the semester to further organize the class-wide commonplace book so that entries
                  are grouped according to larger thematic concerns germane to our ongoing discussions
                  of Romanticism. This final requirement of the semester-long commonplace book assignment
                  (which counts as the final exam) has two graded parts: the reorganization of quotations
                  and heads on Padlet and an accompanying essay explaining students’ rationale for this
                  new organization. The exam requires students to choose thematic threads to act as
                  umbrella concepts under which the accumulated quotations and heads could be housed.
                  I limit the exam to six to eight thematic threads, with all heads distributed among
                  the themes and only five quotations assigned to each. The final exam assignment sheet,
                  available under Figure 1, explains this process in further detail. Steps for realizing
                  this assignment in Padlet are included in the <em>Quick Reference Guide for Instructors Using Padlet</em>.</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/technology/images/jones-11Thumb.jpg" alt="Sample final exam thematic thread post on Padlet." class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>One benefit of this assignment is its cumulative nature, which happens by way of students
                  returning to our class-wide commonplace, not for revision but for reimagining, informed
                  by the whole of the semester and the work of classmates. In this, the assignment may
                  realize the best of what we would hope from all of our social media: the collection
                  and distribution of knowledge that gains from its communal nature new perspectives
                  on that which is shared.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">A Common Reading Experience</span></h2>
               <p>In a digital age, we confront, as Romantic readers did, the limits of media. How does—or
                  should—one preserve ephemera? What does it mean to collect within a digital medium—a
                  repository that is intentionally not tangible, unable to be physically held or even
                  held in the promise of perpetuity? One way to address these questions is to adopt
                  a means of collection that is less passive than the now familiar modes of bookmarking,
                  sharing to save, and tagging. </p>
               <p>Reflecting a practice Romantic readers perfected, our commonplacing combats information
                  overload. It also allows for a sense of ownership over material students often feel
                  distanced from, a feeling shared by Romantic compilers, many of whom were excluded
                  from purchasing printed books but who could fashion their own via commonplacing. Romantic
                  commonplace books reflected their compiler’s individual tastes but, paradoxically,
                  were also “frequently the work of multiple hands and circulated among multiple readers
                  within particular circles of friends” (Lynch 137). We, too, compile our own texts,
                  sharing not only insights gleaned from the texts but also the act of creation. Using
                  the means available to us in the digital age, we embody, as best we can, the place
                  of Romantic readers. </p>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">One could give more context by assigning H.J. Jackson’s Introduction to <em>Romantic Readers</em>. For a historical account of commonplacing, Adam G. Hooks’ blog <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.adamghooks.net/"><em>ANCHORA</em></a> offers four posts that explore early modern commonplace books: “<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.adamghooks.net/2012/08/how-to-read-like-renaissance-reader.html">How To Read Like a Renaissance Reader</a>,” “<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.adamghooks.net/2011/06/necessary-quotation-marks.html">Necessary Quotation Marks</a>,” “<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.adamghooks.net/2012/04/re-membering-shakespeare.html">Re-membering Shakespeare</a>,” and “<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.adamghooks.net/2012/01/mangling-shakespeare.html">Mangling Shakespeare</a>.” Stephen Colclough’s <em>Consuming Texts: Readers and Reading Communities, 1695-1870 </em>includes ample detail on commonplace books’ origins in the early modern period, reimagining
               through Locke, and permutations as albums through the nineteenth century.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Another option might be to limit to texts with direct ties to Romanticism, a list

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Adam Hooks provides a rousing defense of <em>sententiae</em>, with modern parallels to Kindle’s “Popular Highlights” and Amazon’s “Public Notes,”

               printing practices. This is one of the few texts for which Harvard includes a transcription,
               but clicking through sequence by sequence in their Page Delivery System can be cumbersome.
               The Harvard archive includes Ellis Gray Loring’s <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.google.com/about/">commonplace book</a> printed in 1821 with an “Illustration of the Common-Place Book” in modern typeface
               based on Locke’s method that can act as a supplemental text. See Page 2 of the <em>Quick Start Guide to the Harvard Collections</em>, which explains how to access transcriptions.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               been chosen by a fellow classmate. In this case, students would note “Duplicate Entry”
               with their classmate’s name in the text box, along with a list of heads, and attach
               a paragraph justifying their inclusion of this passage. The <em>Quick Start Guide for Padlet</em>, page 5, includes an example of a duplicate entry. Although the first-come, first-served
               nature might be a detraction, I do not disallow or discourage duplicate entries since,
               as Adam Hooks <a class="link_ref" href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html">notes</a>, commonplaces tend to be <em>common</em>, both familiar and quotable.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
