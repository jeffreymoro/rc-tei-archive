                    dinner to help everyone to “bond” at the beginning of a group trip -- and most
                    of us are equally aware of the advantages to having a final meal together before
                    everyone returns home. But instructors do not tend to think about eating and

                <p>It is rare, indeed, for the poet George Gordon, Lord Byron, to be held up as any
                    kind of an exemplar for healthy eating. His advice on food and diet was
                    notoriously bad, and, as Jane Stabler (among many other critics) has pointed
                    out, he was simultaneously “greedy and fastidious,” given to absurd “diets” of
                    potatoes and vinegar in order to control what T. S. Eliot would less than
                    generously refer to as the poet’s “tendency to corpulence” and “pudgy face”
                    (142). Certainly, references to hock and soda are scattered throughout the
                    poet’s journals and letters, used as a necessary antidote to the previous
                    night’s excesses. And yet, whatever else Byron may have been—fastidious, vain,
                    gormandizing—he was also an experienced and curious traveler. He understood the
                    importance of trying the foods and delicacies of a strange land, and notably,
                    young as he was when washed up on the shore of Haidée’s island, there is never a
                    suggestion that Don Juan would turn up his nose at the “viands” and dainties
                    proffered to him by the beautiful foreigner’s hand. He might have longed for
                    good British comfort food, “chiefly a beef-steak / but beef is rare within these
                    oxless isles” (II.153). But Don Juan was well aware that to refuse the local
                    fare would have been to reject not only Haidée, but also the customs and tastes
                    of his new home. Don Juan knows even this early in his journey that much
                        <emph>does</emph> depend on dinner—dining and diet are integral parts of any
                    abroad experience, and Byron knew that a single meal can make or break a journey
                    for the average tourist seeking sustenance and local color. </p>
                <p>Perhaps it is this unconscious knowledge of the power of food to shape our
                    experience that causes so many American students abroad never to hazard
                    disappointment in their temporary home by risking a “bad” experience with the
                    local cuisine. Instead, they munch stolidly through endless “American” fast food
                    dinners, pizzas, heavily-battered chicken nuggets, and tinned ravioli. Such
                    meals are the <foreign>heimlich </foreign>of the tourist menu, offering homely
                    and familiar fare that comforts as it fills. And to be fair, it is also very
                    inexpensive to eat such (if you will) “canny” food. But there is something very
                    sad about an entire coach load of American students stampeding past the
                    neighborhood pub, the curry house, or the open fresh market in Bath in order to
                    buy their bad pizzas or burgers before they hit the road again. History,
                    culture, not to mention good taste and health, are brushed aside in favor of the
                    familiar and the homely. Under the recognizable neon signs of the “big chain”
                    burger joints, students know what to expect. They know what the food will taste
                    like, how to get through the logistics of purchasing it without negotiating any
                    strange foreign practices, and they know (or they think they know) that the food
                    will be quality controlled. For similar reasons, students are far more likely to
                    gravitate towards the vaguely sterile supermarket than the open-air market.
                    Margaret Visser offers a brilliant summary of the appeal of the supermarket to
                    Americans in her classic study of food. Here, she explains: <quote>A North
                        American supermarket is a market place, temple, palace, and parade all
                        rolled into one. It is both expression and the symbol of the goals and means
                        of North American civilization, physically embodying the culture’s yearnings
                        for size, availability, freedom of choice, uniformity, variety, abundance,
                        convenience, cleanliness, speed, and the reduction of hierarchy to quantity:
                        money and amount. (22)</quote> What she does not observe, however, is that
                    the supermarket requires very little of us <emph>as</emph> consumers. Food is
                    removed from its context of production; we are not asked to ponder the origin of
                    our purchases, nor are we asked to interact with anyone in the process of
                    paying for it. There are no “kilos” to calculate, no odd cuts of meat to
                    pronounce—the economic exchange is one of mute, mutual indifference. </p>
                <p>It is precisely this thoughtless indifference that I work so hard to avoid
                    when traveling abroad with my students, whether studying across Greece and
                    Turkey over the space of three weeks, teaching “on the hoof,” or running a
                    six-week course in Bath through a UK-based private provider. I try hard to find
                    ways to encourage if not actually <emph>require</emph> them to engage in the
                    food culture of the country in which they are residing. Most faculty organizing
                    abroad programs know to have an opening dinner to help everyone to “bond” at the
                    beginning of a group trip—and most of us are equally aware of the advantages to
                    having a final meal together before everyone returns home. But instructors do
                    not tend to think about eating and student diet for the intervening weeks. We
                    diligently march our students off to see the big sites, to lecture to them about
                    historical events, and to file them through art galleries, but in between these
                    “cultural events,” the students slip back into the US of A via a quick pepperoni
                    slice from a fast food joint. Food and food culture, as we all know, are crucial
                    parts of any ethnography. The food and dining habits of a nation tell us a great
                    deal about its priorities, its lifestyle, and its history. To ignore the food of
                    a nation is to leave that place untried, unknown, untasted. And yet, it may be
                    argued, we can’t force students to eat something they don’t like. We cannot and
                    should not police their mealtimes. But we can encourage an engagement with the
                    culture in which the students reside by working certain food-oriented events
                    into our field school syllabi and assignments. We can make them aware of exactly
                    on <emph>what</emph> dinner depends.</p>
                <p>What follows are a few ideas for such field work, should we choose to emphasize
                    the importance of meals and food as they appear in Romantic poetry. Thankfully,
                    the Romantics were unusually vocal on the importance of food and drink, and it
                    is thus easy for all readers of the period to summon up a favorite “foodie
                    moment.” One of my top hits has to be John Keats’s “Eve of St Agnes.” Keats’s
                    long list of seductive dainties gathered by Porphyro in his efforts to win over
                    the sleeping Madeline is a fabulous place to begin a student examination of food
                    in nineteenth-century England: <quote><lg>

                        </lg>
                    </quote> Granted, this is not the usual diet of the average Brit even in the
                    Regency period, but as the critic John Thieme has convincingly argued, the
                    exotic and unattainable nature of this food is precisely the point (157).
                    Quince, lemon curd, and cinnamon syrops [sic] would have been immediately
                    recognizable to Keats’s readers as part of the burgeoning spice trade emerging
                    in England by the turn of the nineteenth century. As Thieme notes, following the
                    work of Timothy Morton, “the passage involves more than just a fetishistic
                    agglomeration of Oriental foodstuffs: in lines such as ‘Manna and dates,
                    inargosy transferr’d,’ it also emphasizes the extent to which spice is the
                    end-product of a complex trading network” (157). In short, just by focusing on
                    this passage, we can show our students how this narrative poem is not just about
                    two star-crossed lovers, but also about imperialism and orientalism. </p>
                <p>Of course, this passage in Keats is highly contested. Some critics, such as
                    Walter Jackson Bate and Jack Stillinger, insist that the sensuality of the spicy
                    banquet can only be understood in juxtaposition to the poem’s preoccupation with
                    a dangerous realm of metaphysical fantasy. While Madeline’s fasting might
                    produce devotion and chastity, Stillinger observes that: “Porphyro’s feast seems
                    intended to produce the opposite results, and there is more than a suggestion of
                    pagan sensuality in the strange affair of eastern luxuries that he heaps as if
                    by magic—‘with glowing hand’—on the table by the bed” (59). Marjorie Levinson,
                    on the other hand, comments on the onanistic nature of the luxurious spread. For
                    her, what Keats’s sensual, middle-class style reveals is the “dream of
                    masturbation”; unlike the wholesome dinner of Milton’s Adam, well-tasted and
                    satisfying, Keats’s food seems to be more about foreplay than about consumption
                    (26). It certainly remains untasted by the characters. But even more fascinating
                    a reading is offered by Timothy Morton, who alerts us to the “ready made” nature
                    of this banquet somehow “acquired” by Porphyro as if obtained fully prepared
                    from a pantry nearby. For Morton, this is “a symptom of the heightened role of
                    the consumer in the Romantic culture. As well as never being consumed (at least
                    not with the mouth), the food is never produced (at least not in the poem)”
                    (Spice 155). </p>
                <p>This reading strikes me as being not only absolutely correct, but of vital
                    significance. By the Regency period, England was no longer the gastronomic realm
                    of Fielding’s Tom Jones gnawing voraciously (and lasciviously) on a chicken leg
                    at the local tavern. This has become a country of consumers and gourmands who
                    seek to ogle luxury products as much as to devour them. We might remember, for
                    example, that lovely passage in Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Mansfield
                        Park</title> when Mary Crawford, that personification of urban
                    sophistication, is appalled by her sister’s vulgar references to having the
                    turkey dressed for the upcoming dinner party: “‘The sweets of housekeeping in a
                    country village!’ said Miss Crawford archly. ‘Commend me to the nurseryman and
                    poulterer’” (197). Her sister responds with more than a little acidity: “‘My
                    dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St Paul’s, and I
                    should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be. But we have
                    no such people in Mansfield’” (197). Unlike the country, London has now become a
                    city in which food <emph>specialists</emph> abound and where delicacies are
                    prepared for consumers, spread out in shop windows for their visual as well as
                    their gastronomic delectation. Part of being an elite Londoner in 1814 was about
                    being a “foodie” who consumes and savors international fare without ever having
                    to sully his or her hands with its preparation. In short, London had become the
                    breeding ground for those now famous food halls of Fortnum and Mason’s and
                    Harrods, which invite in their customers a very different consumer relationship
                    to food. Indeed, what better place to <emph>see</emph> food and this new
                    nineteenth-century consumerism in action than in these beautiful and opulent
                    halls? </p>
                <p>While it is true that the present food hall of Harrods was not built until 1894,
                    Charles Henry Harrod started his first business as a draper/green grocer in 1824
                    only four years after Keats’s poem was published. Fortnum and Mason’s, however,
                    opened in St. James's Market in 1707. By the mid-eighteenth century, the
                    founders had acquired a Royal Court affiliation and the store began to stock
                    ready-to-eat luxury meals such as those found in Madeline’s bedroom: fresh
                    poultry served in aspic, tea, candied capers, fruits, and chocolate found their
                    way onto the grocery shelves, readily available for any Porphyro to help himself
                    to a take-out spread of delicacies and viands. A fascinating exercise while
                    teaching “St Agnes” would be to send the students off to Fortnum’s and/or
                    Harrods, shopping list in hand, on a mission to track down the candied fruit,
                    cinnamon spices, sugared plums, and dates. The packaging alone for these
                    products will yield some fascinating cultural data and could open a wonderful
                    discussion about Edward Said’s theories of Orientalism and their applicability
                    to the Regency period, right up to the present day. </p>
                <p>Another activity would involve students comparing this exotic vision of England
                    to an older, more nationalistic understanding of a British diet in such texts as
                    the remarkably popular song “The Roast Beef of (Old) England” which appeared in
                    Henry Fielding’s <title level="m">Grub Street Opera </title>in 1731:<quote><lg>
                            <l>When mighty roast Beef was the Englishman’s food,</l>
                            <l>It ennobled our hearts, and enriched our blood;</l>
                            <l>Our Soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good.</l>
                            <l>Oh, the roast beef of England. (II.50)</l>
                        </lg></quote> Here is John Bull at his most jingoistic and stodgy, and such
                    celebrations of Britain’s native appetite could also set the stage for a group
                    assignment in which the students gathered at a local pub for a roast beef and
                    Yorkshire pudding dinner, while having a chat about the ways in which this
                    quintessentially English meal continued to be identified with true masculine
                    nobility as late as Squire Hamley’s chauvinistic preference for beef and other
                    “heavy viands” at Hamley Hall in Elizabeth Gaskell’s 1865 <title level="m">Wives
                        and Daughters</title> (309). This has always been a popular event when I
                    have taught Victorian literature.</p>
                <p>But as we move through the Romantic period, such discourse is not simply about
                    praising the hearty constitution of the British gentry. It begins to evolve into
                    a fascinating and highly contentious discourse on food as a
                        <emph>political</emph> signifier. Food-oriented political cartoons such as
                    James Gillray’s piece entitled “French Liberty and British Slavery” showing John
                    Bull feasting on roast beef while the scrawny Jacobin soldier chews on a chicken
                    foot would be an excellent introduction to this political discourse, and would
                    lend itself beautifully to a class discussion about the ways in which food and
                    eating came to signify political assignments and class valence by the 1790s (see
                    Fig. 3.1). Here, Gillray shows us a tattered French revolutionary figure who
                    gnaws hungrily upon wilted turnips and greens, the animal fodder of the time,
                    revealing for his anxious British viewers the absurdity of the many epithets in
                    the balloon above the figure’s head which celebrate the supposed success of the
                    young Republic. “No more taxes, no more slavery,” announces the French image.
                    But Gillray’s depiction of French “liberty” offers a stark contrast to the
                    opulence and plenty of Britain. While a rather robust John Bull curses the
                    punishing taxes levied on British citizens, this cartoon makes it clear that
                    such British “tyranny” is nothing compared to the brutality, hardship, and
                    barbarism created by the republican fanaticism in France. John Bull is wise to
                    stay away from such fancy French “progress,” and should instead eat his fill of
                    good solid British traditions. Anything other than the hardy fare of “mighty
                    roast Beef” should be viewed with suspicion by a true Englishman.</p>

                <p>By the nineteenth century, even those male characters in novels who seem too
                    invested in discussions on the composition of a particularly delicious sauce
                    were viewed as problematically Frenchified, (and by association feminized). An
                    anonymous review of William Hazlitt's <title level="m">Political Essays</title>
                    (1819) in the <title level="m">Monthly Review</title> (1820) for example,
                    reminds us that while Hazlitt might be a seductive and stimulating writer, his
                    political “tastes” are far from orthodox: <quote>The taste of the public has, of
                        late years, been accustomed to very high stimulants: no plain wholesome food
                        will go down; and every thing must be hashed and stewed with some
                            “<foreign>sauce piquante</foreign>,” which however delicious to one
                        palate, may be very offensive and disgusting to another. Mr. Hazlitt should
                        not cater for such pampered appetites. (256)</quote> In a similar vein, just
                    about any novel written during this period would include an admirable
                    description of a symbolically-charged British tea and, depending on the
                    instructor’s stamina (and the students’ skill level), they could be asked to
                    produce the food for this meal for a class “break” depending on the kitchen
                    facilities available. If all else and energy fails, the refreshment hall of the
                    Victoria and Albert Museum provides an excellent cream tea, complete with high
                    Victorian ambiance. In fact, the Morris, Gamble, and Poynter Rooms (opened in
                    1863) offered the first museum “restaurant” in the country. A visit here also
                    allows for a leisurely stroll through the design galleries with their exquisite
                    tea sets and paraphernalia dating from the eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth
                    century. In fact, my class plan for teaching Samuel Richardson’s <title
                        level="m">Clarissa </title>while in London includes treating the students to
                    a cream tea as we discuss the cultural discourse of tea, coffee, and other
                    stimulants that were being introduced into the British diet at this time. Most
                    famously, figures like Thomas Trotter had begun to describe what would come to
                    be referred to as “the English Malady”—a nervous complaint of modernity,
                    fostered by excessive stimulation by foreign substances. Notes one such
                    “expert,” John Coakley Lettsom, circa 1772: <quote>It stands charged by many
                        able writers, by public opinion, partly derived from experience, with being
                        the cause of many disorders; all that train of distempers included under the
                        name of NERVOUS, are said to be if not the offspring, at least highly
                        aggravated by the use of Tea. To enumerate all these, would be to transcribe
                        volumes. (49)</quote> But while the Regency gentry might have become
                    increasingly enamored of ready-made food, restaurants, and foreign stimulants,
                    there were still plenty of housekeepers, <foreign>pace</foreign> Mary Crawford
                    and her class, who were forced to hazard the smells and noise of the British
                    open market to purchase the ingredients for the standard evening meal. It is
                    crucial that the students be taken to an open market to see these, the oldest
                    forms of food commerce and trade existing in England. As I have already noted,
                    markets can be intimidating for those students who are only familiar with
                    sterile supermarkets. It is a wonderful idea to introduce the students to the
                    system of the market by organizing an outing in order to purchase the
                    wherewithal for a picnic “ploughman’s lunch” including fresh bread, pickles,
                    cheese, fruit, and seed or honey cakes. This way, the students will not only be
                    introduced to the local rhythms of their community but will be encouraged to eat
                    the local, organic produce—perhaps on a regular basis. (Be forewarned: American
                    students are generally freaked out by the metric system, so give them a cheat
                    sheet of measurements before you go.) It will also provide a wonderful excuse to
                    go for a hike through the Lake District or Wales to find a beautiful spot upon
                    which to read and study, say, “Tintern Abbey” while munching on a large wedge of
                    Stilton with pickled onions. On one memorable occasion, I had the students take
                    turns reciting the poem as we enjoyed our picnic, much to the amusement of the
                    passing tourists. For dessert, why not purchase some of the summer fruit of
                    Christina Rossetti’s “Goblin Market”? <quote><lg>

                    after all, changed that much over the past century, even if the effects of such
                    self-indulgence may no longer be viewed with such trepidation. </p>
                <p>The possibilities for educating our students about “tasting” the town are
                    endless, and I would encourage anyone running a study-abroad program to take
                    this issue seriously as so much of the abroad experience is lost when our
                    students refuse to participate in one of the most important social and cultural
                    events of any country—its dining and food customs. If much depends on dinner, it
                    is arguable that just as much depends on the local rituals and preparations that
                    make that dinner possible. Let me, then, return to Byron once more for some
                    words of advice. He writes in his journal entry for December 7, 1813: “When one
                    subtracts from life infancy (which is vegetation), sleep, eating and swilling,
                    buttoning and unbuttoning—how much remains of downright existence” (3.235).
                    Eating and, as Byron so elegantly puts it, “swilling” take up a significant
                    number of hours in our daily rituals. Why not make sure that this time is also a
                    learning experience since no one wants their summer program to become known as
                    “the summer of a dormouse.”</p>
