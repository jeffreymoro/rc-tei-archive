                <p rend="noCount"> This collection grows out of a 2014 conference panel at the North
                    American Society for the Study of Romanticism (NASSR), in which 5 of our 6
                    authors shared their varied experiences leading study-abroad courses and field
                    schools to various parts of England and France. These experiences ranged from
                    do-it-yourself plans to full partnerships with third-party organizers, with a
                    similar range of flexibility and cost. Taken together, 5 areas shape the
                    concerns of the 5 chapters: models of study and the logistics of running them;
                    models of leadership; types of assignments and excursions; forms of
                    collaborative teaching and learning; and the value of international education
                    for humanities-based learning. This volume will provide practical and
                    experience-based information about study-abroad programs as well as critical
                    reflection about methods and motives. </p>

                <p>This special issue of <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogies</title> began
                    as a panel at the NASSR conference of 2014, held in Washington, DC. It was
                    organized by R. Paul Yoder, who was inspired by the problems he had gathering
                    information about study-abroad trips while planning for his first such trip in
                    2012. His department chair had encouraged him to lead a group of students to
                    England, but the study-abroad office at the University of Arkansas – Little Rock was not very
                    helpful, though they gave him <foreign>carte blanche</foreign> to plan the trip.
                    The one requirement was to keep the price within an acceptable range of his
                    university’s middle and lower-middle class students. Beyond that, he was told to
                    do what he wanted.</p>
                <p>He ruled out relying on a guided tour, partly because of the expense and partly
                    because he wanted to retain “creative control” over the trip. Still, even with
                    the Internet, information was difficult to find. Nonetheless, he persevered and
                    the trip went very well. He discussed his experiences on the NASSR email
                    listserv and the Facebook Romanticism Scholars page, after which Tom Schmid
                    contacted him. Tom was planning his first study-abroad trip and wanted to
                    hear more about Paul’s experience. At that point, there was a realization that
                    if the two of them were having trouble finding information on study-abroad
                    trips, then others must be having similar trouble as well. The NASSR panel on
                    Romantic-period study-abroad programs came together not long thereafter. </p>
                <p>This initial NASSR panel offered a range and diversity of study-abroad
                    experiences. There was Paul’s do-it-yourself experience. Then, in sharp
                    contrast to the shoe-string budget tour Paul had organized, there was Tom’s
                    experience of hiring an outside agency to plan and execute the trip, as required
                    by his university. Also on the panel was Paul’s old friend, Ghislaine McDayter
                    at Bucknell University, who had considerable experience leading similar,
                    third-party provider organized trips to Bath and to London. Finally, the call
                    for papers yielded the submission from Colette Colligan and Michelle Levy from
                    Simon Fraser University who were planning their first full-semester “field
                    study” trips to Paris/Tours and London/the Lake District, respectively. The
                    diversity of the panel was thus in experience, format, and destination: from
                    Ghislaine, who regularly led study-abroad trips to Europe; to Paul and Tom,
                    who had led one trip to the Lake District each (albeit very different ones); to
                    Michelle and Colette, who were still in the planning stages of their first trips
                    (in the summer of 2016, Colette led her first study-abroad trip to France;
                    Michelle’s trip to England is scheduled for the summer of 2017).</p>
                <p>This formal group was augmented at NASSR by the presence of Jeff Cowton, the
                    curator of the Wordsworth Trust, which includes Dove Cottage (the poet’s
                    residence from 1799 to 1808), the museum, and the library/archive held in the
                    Jerwood Centre. His aim was to share his experience with the educational
                    programs that have been offered by the Trust over the years and to publicize and
                    expand their outreach to students from North America. Jeff attended the NASSR
                    conference largely for this panel, and his contributions to the discussion were
                    crucial. During the session, we shared practical logistical information and
                    discussed various models for study abroad, as well as questions of student
                    expectations, assignments, activities, and the experience of culture shock. We
                    also thought critically as a group about the value of study abroad generally and
                    how travel to the Lake District and Europe offered unique pedagogical
                    opportunities for students of Romanticism in particular.</p>
                <p>After the conference, Paul began to think of ways to share what we had all
                    learned, and he was not alone. Colette and Michelle contacted him about co-editing
                    a special number of the Romantic Circles Pedagogy Series, and they suggested
                    adding Nick Mason, who regularly led groups from Brigham Young University to the
                    UK, to the group. That was a good suggestion, as Nick is experienced leading
                    general education trips and can contribute to understandings of the current
                    state of study-abroad programming. We—Colette, Michelle, and Paul—thus became the
                    editors of this special issue, and authors of this introduction. The three of us
                    are delighted that our conversation about the distinctive educational experience
                    of study-abroad trips and field schools to the Lake District has continued in
                    this essay forum. </p>
                <p>Our aim for this issue is to provide pedagogical support for instructors through
                    sharing our planning, practical experience, and expertise running study-abroad
                    trips and field schools, particularly in the Lake District. In these essays, we
                    share stories and anecdotes from the field, syllabi, and itineraries that have
                    been tested, teaching methods that have been gleaned from immersion in the
                    environment, best practices for fieldwork that have been put to use, student
                    surveys that speak to the study-abroad experience, and research as it applies to
                    experience on the ground. These essays also begin to lay the groundwork for a
                    more critically informed understanding of the pedagogical strategies and
                    ambitions for study abroad. Indeed, as we moved from transforming conference
                    papers into publishable essays, we grappled with terminology. Most of us prefer
                    and use the phrase “study abroad,” the more capacious term that refers to any
                    educational opportunities being pursued outside of the student’s home country.
                    This term encompasses general education courses (such as those led by Nick) as
                    well as more specialized, literature-based courses (such as those focused on
                    Wordsworth and run by Tom and Paul). A few of us use the term field school
                    (Colette and Michelle; Ghislaine), which seems appropriate to the longer lengths of
                    the programs we lead. At the same time, the use of the term field school, and
                    the related discussions of fieldwork, seek to situate humanities-based inquiry
                    within scholarly traditions and practices usually associated with other
                    disciplines such as archeology, geography, history, as well as the natural
                    sciences. In their essays, Colette and Michelle, and Ghislaine, suggest modes of
                    cultural engagement and critical inquiry for our students that might define and
                    shape literature-based fieldwork, that may be appropriate to certain
                    study-abroad programs.</p>
                <p>Taken together, the essays in this issue explore five interrelated themes: (a)
                    models of study-abroad trips and field schools and the logistics of running
                    them; (b) models of leadership; (c) types of assignments and excursions; (d)
                    forms of collaborative teaching and learning; and (e) the critical value of
                    study abroad and international education for humanities-based learning,
                    particularly the literature of the Romantic period.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">(a) Models of study-abroad trips and field schools, and the
                        logistics of running them: </hi>We present a diverse array of approaches to
                    study abroad and field schools, involving a broad range of students, from
                    different disciplines, at different levels, from colleges and universities
                    across North America, as well as a wide range of programs. All of the
                    study-abroad trips and field schools discussed in this issue of <title level="m">Romantic Circles
                    Pedagogies</title> involved extensive planning, yet clear differences emerge in regard
                    to the budget, the degree of external support (such as from university
                    administrators and third-party providers), the academic requirements of the
                    program, and the length of the time spent abroad. Clearly, there is no one size
                    fits all when it comes to study abroad, customized as it must be to suit
                    institutional, academic, and instructional needs. </p>
                <p>In the following essays, we find models of very short trips (ten days, Tom;
                    eleven days, Paul, with optional add-on days in London) to more extensive ones,
                    ranging from six weeks (Michelle; Ghislaine) to eight weeks (Colette). Most of these
                    trips have one or two home bases (Colette, Michelle, Nick, Ghislaine), but Paul’s
                    trip had students staying in three to four different locations over a period of
                    eleven to thirteen days. The kinds of educational programs vary as well: from
                    one to three credit courses to general education courses offered to
                    non-literature students. Two of the study-abroad programs involve third-party
                    providers (Ghislaine; Tom), and the nature of their involvement is discussed
                    at length by Tom; several of the programs involve considerable engagement
                    with university administrators (Colette and Michelle; Nick), whereas Paul was
                    very much on his own in the development and implementation of the trip. Costs
                    range considerably as well: Paul’s eleven-day trip cost $1,345, compared to
                    Tom’s, of similar duration, which cost $2,700 (neither figure includes
                    airfare or tuition). Trips of longer duration can cost many thousands of
                    dollars, excluding airfare and tuition. The table presented in Appendix A
                    summarizes the major differences between the programs discussed in these essays
                    and the range of options study-abroad trips present to instructors considering
                    leading them.</p>
                <p>Some of the essays also provide information about practical matters calibrated to
                    the study-abroad model. Accommodations, excursions, and food are the essential
                    elements of trip planning, though travelling with a group of students requires
                    travel arrangements on a scale few of us are used to managing. Of course, with a
                    range of student budgets comes an extensive range of possibilities, from
                    communal meal cooking (a feature of both Colette and Paul’s trips, where
                    students were keen to save money and to cook and eat together) to high tea at a
                    London hotel or a meal at the upscale Pheasant Inn at Bassenthwaite (frequented
                    by Coleridge and Southey). As Ghislaine’s essay demonstrates, the question of how
                    much autonomy to give to students arises directly in relation to questions of
                    eating. Should students be allowed to eat every meal at cheap, American outposts
                    like McDonalds or encouraged to try more authentic, local fare? </p>
                <p>Different models of study abroad present different logistical challenges and
                    pedagogical opportunities, as our essays discuss. Trains, possibly even planes,
                    will be missed; guest speakers will not show up; guides will be difficult to
                    hear; personal possessions will be lost; someone might become injured or ill.
                    Sleep patterns are usually interrupted as a result of transatlantic travel, and
                    students will need varying periods of time to adjust, which can be hard to
                    accommodate on a short ten-day trip. Many students are also dependent on their
                    electronic devices and may find it hard to adapt to a world without 24/7
                    connectivity. They may be homesick; interpersonal issues can arise. These essays
                    speak to the importance of organization in the planning and running of
                    study-abroad trips in all their variety, but also to the need to prepare
                    directors and students for the inevitable discomforts and mishaps, with the
                    recognition that these very setbacks can forge the strongest bonds between
                    members of a group and create the most enduring memories.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold"> (b) Different models of leadership:</hi> Study-abroad leaders
                    will invariably find themselves considering the leadership role they will
                    assume. Study abroad can challenge how instructors usually relate with students,
                    but can also provide new opportunities for reconsidering their leadership
                    styles, both in the field and back home. A different skill set is called upon
                    than that usually required for the university classroom. Good organization is
                    important for any teaching environment, but flexibility, adaptability,
                    compassion, navigational skills, and even first-aid training become essential
                    skills for study abroad. The essays in this special issue approach this
                    leadership call in different ways, providing useful models for how instructors
                    can present themselves while in the field. Often in discussions of study-abroad
                    leadership, the parent model comes up because of the nurturing role taken on
                    outside of the institutional environment, but this parent model of leadership is
                    only one of several styles that have actually emerged among us. </p>
                <p>For Paul, one of the crucial elements of leading a field school is flexibility,
                    of accepting that, from time to time, plans will change and expectations will be
                    disappointed. Study-abroad leaders must be flexible in acknowledging that not
                    all (and indeed probably not many) students are world travelers—that they will
                    not all take our advice about what to pack, and that their disappointments and
                    frustrations will not be our own. He builds this flexibility into his program,
                    customizing the itinerary to student needs and inviting student input in
                    planning meetings. In contrast to this more spontaneous, student-centered
                    leadership style, there is the more structured leadership of Colette, Michelle, and
                    Tom, who rely on highly structured itineraries and assignments as leadership
                    supports in a highly unstable learning environment. At the end of Colette’s
                    field school in France, one student joked that she no longer knew how to plan
                    her life without her twenty-five page syllabus. Speaking of his experience
                    working with a third-party organizer, Tom notes that one of the great
                    advantages of working with them is “superior organization and peace of mind.”
                    Peace of mind is worth its weight in gold when on call 24/7 to deal with the
                    unexpected problems that will arise—from lost passports, to poorly chosen
                    footwear, to heat waves, to poor group dynamics, to last-minute lesson plans.
                    But with that peace of mind also comes a loss of autonomy and what Yoder
                    identifies as distributed leadership, whereby students take ownership of
                    planning for the trip. Also, for first-time instructors of field schools,
                    Colette and Michelle, who are embarking on trips and designing assignments for the
                    very first time, the experience is one of pedagogical experiment. Modeling that
                    curiosity and that willingness to experiment and try new things is integrated
                    into their leadership style. </p>
                <p> Just as there are many different types of travelers, so too are there many
                    different kinds of leaders. Some leaders promote group activities and projects;
                    others provide more space for privacy and autonomous work. Study abroad, as we
                    have seen, come in different shapes and sizes. So too are they developed and run
                    by individual faculty members whose personal approach to travel and teaching
                    will inevitably shape the nature of the programs they organize. Leaders are of
                    different ages and physical abilities, and our differences, like those of our
                    students, must be accommodated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">(c) Types of assignments and excursions: </hi>Alongside the wide
                    range of study-abroad experiences represented in these essays and leadership
                    styles, we find an equally diverse range of excursions and assignments described
                    within the essays that follow. These discussions express excitement about the
                    new pedagogical opportunities presented by study outside of the classroom and
                    abroad. For many of us, the traditional forms of teaching and evaluating
                    students do not provide the best means of emplacing students within their new
                    environments and might even reinforce what is already known and how one goes
                    about learning. Many of the lessons, excursions, and assignments require
                    students to take a different approach to learning, where the object of study
                    might be participation in ritual (such as high tea), or deliberate movement
                    through space (such as on a fell walk), or guiding a class on a tour through a
                    museum. Most study-abroad programs ask students to take on leadership roles,
                    sharing with, guiding, and instructing others, thus breaking down some of the
                    hierarchies present in most institutional educational contexts. More informal,
                    spontaneous, and collaborative methods of teaching and evaluation are
                    emphasized, though again there is no one size fits all—Paul’s Lake District
                    trip has no formal assignments, whereas the field schools discussed by Colette
                    and Michelle move toward the opposite end of the spectrum, discussed in detail in
                    their essay. It is important to recognize that, as these essays describe, one of
                    the most exciting elements of study abroad is that learning takes place outside
                    of the classroom, beside a waterfall, climbing a mountain, reading an original
                    manuscript, or sharing a meal together. </p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">(d) Forms of collaborative teaching and learning:</hi> Leading a
                    student trip abroad or directing an international field school is not a
                    one-person show, and never should it be approached as such. Our responsibility
                    to our students is intensified while in the field, and our leadership is total
                    while also at its most vulnerable. We are not just there for students’ academic
                    and cultural education, but must also manage group dynamics and individual
                    needs. A group agreement with students or Paul’s Rules of Tour can be an
                    important pedagogical instrument for study abroad, as important as a reading
                    list (see Appendices B and C). The essays in <title level="m">Study Abroad in
                        the Lake District</title> highlight the importance of working together and
                    sharing knowledge in the design and delivery of study-abroad programs. From the
                    early planning stages, it is necessarily a multi-party endeavor. It involves
                    working with various units at one’s home university, particularly the division
                    in charge of international education. This work may evolve into the development
                    of partnerships with international institutions—whether universities, research
                    centers, or residential colleges—–which typically require formal agreements and
                    legal counsel. Not to be overlooked is the careful program planning that goes
                    into course content, fieldwork, and student assignments, which benefit from
                    collaboration with and input from colleagues as well as teaching and learning
                    professionals, particularly given the money, mobility, and mayhem that are part
                    of the study-abroad endeavor.</p>
                <p>Then there is the collaboration that happens in the field. As Tom writes,
                    “having another set of experienced boots on the ground eases things
                    tremendously.” We work with third-party providers to schedule and lead
                    excursions; we liaise with guides and live with local hosts; we deliver course
                    content alongside other experts and foreign scholars; and we co-learn and
                    co-present with students. Family can also be integral for emotional and
                    logistical support when distant from home and familiar university
                    infrastructure. Furthermore, we find evidence of collaboration between students,
                    and between students and instructors, to a great degree. In most study-abroad
                    scenarios, we are bound together with our students and our students with each
                    other, far more intensely than on campus, reflecting the immersive nature of the
                    experience. The relationships formed during field schools provide new scope for
                    collaborative teaching and learning, and they also compel us to work more fully
                    with others within and outside of our institutions, both pre- and
                    post-departure. Many of the essays thus promote a team-based model for
                    study-abroad pedagogy and implore international education units working with
                    faculty instructors to provide the institutional, legal, financial, and
                    logistical support necessary to facilitate team building and thus the long-term
                    sustainability of study-abroad trips and field schools.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">(e) The value of study abroad and international education:</hi>
                    Many universities have international study-abroad programs across a range of
                    academic fields—such as business, design, environmental science, and archaeology.
                    Several of the essays in this special issue speak specifically to study-abroad
                    trips and field schools centered in Britain and the Lake District, but they also
                    initiate broader critical reflection about study-abroad programs and
                    international education. Given the costs of such programs for students and their
                    heavy administration requirements, it is important to think critically about
                    what they add to university education. Often billed as “transformative”
                    educational experiences that offer international “experience” through
                    “immersion” and “engagement” out “in the field,” we believe that these claims
                    must be carefully evaluated. Experience does not necessarily legitimize
                    knowledge. The notion of international education and cultural experience carries
                    the vestiges of elite travel and the European Grand Tour. The essays engage with
                    these issues while also offering some concrete examples of the educational value
                    of international study—whether that be the unmediated exposure to material and
                    physical objects, the opportunity to connect literature and ideas to
                    environment, new awareness and appreciation of cultural and interdisciplinary
                    knowledge in the age of STEM, or the development of international perspective
                    and intercultural competencies. The many student responses and educational
                    outcomes described, we believe, supports the claims made in support of
                    experiential learning beyond the campus. Many of Nick’s general education
                    students report becoming devoted readers of poetry, and one student even reports
                    that, as a result of a one-day visit to Grasmere, “I think Wordsworth has become
                    a part of me—and that is an outcome I was not expecting.” Study abroad can be a
                    stepping stone for our university’s larger international initiatives and goals,
                    but we need to ask how and why these programs appeal to students, as Mason does,
                    and report their feedback about how study abroad enriched their experience of
                    higher education if we want these programs to receive the attention, support,
                    and financial backing they deserve. </p>
                <p>We are delighted to share these essays with <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title> and look
                    forward to continuing the conversation about how study abroad can enrich the
                    pedagogical possibilities within our field. </p>
