                <p rend="noCount"> Over the past half-century, study abroad programs at North
                    American universities have shifted from semester- or year-long immersions in
                    another nation’s language and culture to short-term, professionally focused
                    offering sponsored by students’ majors. Acknowledging these trends, this essay
                    shows how immersive literary experiences like the Wordsworth Trust’s rare book
                    and manuscript workshops can continue to play central and formative roles in
                    study abroad programs designed not only for English majors but students with a
                    range of disciplinary and professional interests. </p>

                    <p>Unlike the Romanticism-themed and English-major-oriented study-abroad trips
                        featured elsewhere in this collection, this essay focuses on teaching
                        British Romanticism during programs designed for a disciplinarily diverse
                        cross-section of students from my relatively selective, 30,000-student,
                        private university in Provo, Utah. Marketed specifically as “general
                        education” programs, Brigham Young University’s most popular UK-based
                        study-abroad programs are housed at its London Centre, which is located on
                        the border of the Bayswater and Notting Hill neighborhoods, or roughly
                        midway between Kensington Palace and Portobello Road. Home to four
                        40-student programs per year, the London Centre spans two converted
                        Victorian row-houses which the university acquired when the neighborhood’s
                        property values bottomed out in the 1970s. </p>
                    <p>Given the imperative to fill a large facility and the location’s natural
                        appeal for students, the university has thus far largely resisted the trend
                        toward smaller, department- or major-based study-abroad trips in London. For
                        almost 40 years now, the operative model at BYU’s London Centre has featured
                        two or three professors from diverse disciplines using cultural heritage
                        sites in London and across the UK to teach introductory surveys of British
                        literature, history, politics, and fine arts. </p>
                    <p>Over time, the prevailing stereotype that has emerged of the BYU London
                        Centre student is of a wealthy, 20-year-old woman whose priorities are (in
                        descending order) 1) shopping, 2) taking photos in famous places, 3)
                        attending all the West End musicals, and 4) learning about British history
                        and culture. While both demonstrably inaccurate and understandably offensive
                        to the many students who save for years to pay their own way and relish
                        every experiential and academic opportunity the program affords, this
                        caricature exists for a reason. However noble it may be to run
                        horizon-expanding, liberal arts-based programs for students from all corners
                        of campus, even the best teachers struggle to get dietetics majors to care
                        about the Stuart Restoration, pre-dental students to feel invested in
                        Constable’s technique, or aspiring elementary school teachers to feel
                        passionate about <title level="m">Mrs. Dalloway</title>, <title level="m"
                            >Saturday</title>, and other books they’ll never possibly teach.</p>
                    <p>Yet, as I’ll argue in what follows, offering non-majors an immersive
                        education in British literature and culture is one of the most valuable and
                        fulfilling academic services literature professors can offer. Before
                        devoting most of this essay to recapping the memorable experiences BYU
                        professors, including myself, have had taking students of diverse aptitudes
                        and interests to the Wordsworth Trust, I’d like to frame what follows in
                        terms of the current realities of study abroad at most North American
                        colleges and universities. After detailing the general trend away from
                        humanities-based study-abroad programs, I will recap experiences my students
                        have had at the Wordsworth Trust which exemplify how professors of British
                        literature in general and Romanticism in specific might still offer crucial
                        cultural, philosophical, aesthetic, and life lessons for today’s North
                        American study-abroad students, 90% of whom currently hail from majors
                        outside the humanities. </p>

                    <head>The New Realities of Study Abroad</head>
                    <p>Throughout much of the latter half of the twentieth century, study abroad for
                        North American university students generally followed one model: traveling
                        to one of Europe’s grand cities for a semester or year of language immersion
                        accompanied by a steady diet of museums, cafes, palaces, cathedrals, and
                        pilgrimages to authors’ homes. A last vestige of the British Grand Tour and
                        the German <foreign>wanderjahr</foreign>, the once-common “year out” or
                        “junior year abroad” offered an ideal finishing experience for students
                        intent on becoming global citizens.<note place="foot">See also Twombly et al.
                            15-17.</note> With the gradual professionalization of the college
                        experience and the rising costs of a university education, however, spending
                        an entire year studying European languages and cultures <emph>in situ
                        </emph>increasingly appears a thing of the past. According to the Institute
                        of International Education’s <title level="m">Open Doors</title> report for
                        2014, only 3.2% of US study-abroad experiences now fill an entire academic
                        or calendar year, with 36.5% lasting a single semester and 60.3% fewer than
                        nine weeks.</p>
                    <p>Even more dramatic than the turn from long- to short-term programs is the
                        shift away from liberal-arts-based study-abroad programs. Although most
                        English, history, or French professors might still imagine study abroad as a
                        modern analog to the Grand Tour, the reality for some time now has been that
                        humanities-based programs constitute a small and steadily shrinking slice of
                        the study-abroad pie. In 2012–13, 22.5% of US study-abroad students came
                        from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, 22.1%
                        from the social sciences, and 20.4% from business. Humanities students, by
                        contrast, constituted only 10.4% of Americans studying abroad, down from
                        14.2% in 2005–06.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, though, the shift away from language- and culture-based study
                        abroad has not made Europe any less desirable a setting for these programs.
                        Quite the opposite, in fact, as in 2012–13 the top four study abroad
                        destinations for US college students—including those participating in
                        programs catering to the likes of engineers, nurses, and accountants—were 1)
                        the United Kingdom, 2) Italy, 3) Spain, and 4) France. As counterintuitive
                        as it might seem in a moment when the developing economies of the BRICs and
                        MINTs are “in” and Europe’s outmoded PIGS are “out,”<note place="foot">For
                            much of the new century, conventional wisdom in the financial world has
                            been to invest in high-growth BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China)
                            and up-and-coming MINTs (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey), while
                            unloading all holdings in the debt-ridden PI(I)GS (Portugal, Italy,
                            Ireland, Greece, and Spain) of Old Europe.</note> Europe’s market share
                        in the US study-abroad industry has actually increased of late. Case in
                        point, in the year between 2011–12 and 2012–13, the number of American
                        university students completing study abroad in the dowdy old UK rose by
                        4.5%, while the number traveling to economically booming, tech-friendly
                        China declined by 3.2%.</p>
                    <p>What these figures seem to suggest is that, although American university
                        students might no longer consider art, history, and culture as the be-all
                        and end-all of studying abroad, they still overwhelmingly prefer their
                        “real-world” adventures in globalization to occur in the sorts of safe,
                        efficient, and culturally-rich destinations Europe can readily supply. While
                        by day they might want to tour hospitals and factories, study high-speed
                        rail networks, and meet with captains of global industry, by night they
                        would much prefer cruising the Seine, taking in a flamenco show, or
                        exploring the British Museum than going back to a dingy apartment powered by
                        a fickle power grid.</p>
                    <p>Given the enduring appeal, then, of educational experiences in Europe with at
                        least some high-cultural trappings, study abroad would seem an ideal site
                        for humanities professors to reassert themselves as key contributors to the
                        education of students in all fields. Moreover, study abroad also offers
                        scholars in the humanities opportunities to collaborate meaningfully with
                        colleagues from the other side of campus, many of whom would relish the
                        opportunity to add a historical or cultural component to their European
                            programs.<note place="foot">Contrary to the stereotype, many professors
                            and students in the sciences and professions not only enjoy studying the
                            humanities but recognize how essential it is to understand other people
                            and cultures—including their languages, art, and history—to succeed in a
                            globalized economy. As the American Chemical Society reported to the US
                            House Committee on Science and Technology in 2007, “while globalization
                            does not affect the chemical principles or scientific process that
                            undergraduate chemistry students must master, it does impact the world
                            that students must be prepared to work and live in when they finish
                            their degree.” Alluding specifically to study abroad programs for
                            chemistry students, the Society went on to argue, “When students
                            interact with people from other cultures and build their STEM knowledge
                            in a foreign environment, they stretch their abilities and gain new
                            perspective—perspective that only comes from leaving the place where
                            they grew up” (qtd. in DeWinter and Rumbley 71).</note>

                    <head>Pilgrimages to Grasmere</head>
                    <p>It is in this spirit that four times per year BYU sends forty students drawn
                        from virtually every major on campus to London to study British literature,
                        history, and culture with professors from the liberal arts. While the core
                        BYU London Centre curriculum has remained largely unchanged since the late
                        1970s, the university has increasingly urged faculty to facilitate more
                        meaningful interactions between our students and British scholars and
                        institutions. </p>
                    <p>With this administrative and pedagogical priority in mind, my colleague and
                        fellow Romanticist Paul Westover and I began laying the foundations for our
                        current partnership with the Wordsworth Trust during a 2011 trip we made to
                        Grasmere with three BYU undergraduates to research our since-published
                            <title level="m">Romantic Circles </title>edition of William
                        Wordsworth’s <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/guide_lakes/"
                                ><title level="m">Guide to the Lakes</title></ref>. During an
                        afternoon tea break with Jeff Cowton, the Wordsworth Trust’s head curator,
                        we began brainstorming ways to offer future BYU students the sort of
                        transformative archival experiences our current students were having that
                        day. Fortunately, I was scheduled to return to the UK the following year to
                        direct two general-education study-abroad programs at BYU’s London Centre.
                        And, thus, over the next nine months, Jeff and I sketched out a one-day
                        course that would draw upon the Trust’s collections and appeal to students
                        majoring in a range of disciplines. Since then, some five hundred BYU
                        students have participated in these workshops, and through trial and error,
                        Jeff has developed a series of demonstrations and hands-on exercises that
                        leave students of all backgrounds with a heightened appreciation for the
                        craft of poetry, a deeper reverence for rare books and manuscripts, and a
                        newfound understanding of how labor-intensive writing can be even for the
                        likes of William and Dorothy Wordsworth.</p>
                    <p>Given the scarcity of classroom time on study abroad and the survey-like
                        curriculum of a general education program, our faculty can rarely devote
                        more than a single class period to the Wordsworths in advance of traveling
                        to Grasmere. At a minimum, though, Jeff asks BYU professors to provide a
                        basic overview of the lives of William and Dorothy, their most famous
                        writings, and their contributions to British poetry, nature writing, and
                        environmentalism. Suggested advance readings include excerpts from Dorothy’s
                            <title level="m">Grasmere Journals</title> and a sampling of those poems
                        students will likely encounter in manuscript at the Trust (“Michael,” “Old
                        Man Traveling,” “Home at Grasmere, ” “Ode: Intimations of Immortality,” and
                        “Elegiac Stanzas”).</p>
                    <p>Of course, as almost anyone who has directed a study abroad program in London
                        or another world capital can attest, it’s unrealistic to expect students
                        experiencing what Wordsworth himself once called “the shock / Of the huge
                        town’s first presence” (<title level="m">Prelude</title> [1850] VII:66–67)
                        to glean much from formal classroom lectures on Romantic poetry. More often
                        than not, then, having students perform a hard reboot of their systems is
                        the first pedagogical challenge of taking them to the Wordsworth Trust.
                        Fortunately, the landscape itself does much of the preparatory work, as
                        evidenced by the dozens of class journal entries my students have submitted
                        over the years that adopt the language of conversion or transformation when
                        describing their first impressions of the Lake District. And, once in the
                        heart of Wordsworth country, undergraduates who a week earlier daydreamed
                        through my lectures on “spots of time” and “loss and recompense” frequently
                        find themselves reaching for their poetry anthologies. On one memorable
                        trip, a dozen students, most novitiates in poetry, spent their first night
                        in the Lake District reading poems aloud by moonlight. The following morning
                        at breakfast, several made a point of informing me that their most powerful
                        experience with literature while in Britain had come while their professor
                        was fast asleep.</p>

                    <head>Aura in the Twenty-First Century</head>
                    <p>On the heels of this initial exposure to what William Wordsworth called the
                        “spirit in these woods” (“Nutting,” l.54), the aspiring accountants,
                        physical therapists, and web designers in my groups have tended to be
                        slightly less wary of spending four hours poring over the manuscripts of
                        long-dead Lake District poets. Still, the opening moments of these workshops
                        have proven crucial for getting student buy-in. Consequently, Jeff Cowton
                        and his fellow curators tend to frontload sessions for an audience of
                        non-specialists, opening with an hour of hands-on show-and-tell featuring
                        some of the treasures of their collection.</p>
                    <p>Even—or, perhaps, especially—in an age when high-resolution images of many of
                        these books and manuscripts can be pulled up with a few keystrokes, holding
                        the actual thing almost unfailingly proves a transcendent experience for
                        students. After taking a group of BYU students to Grasmere in early 2015, a
                        colleague of mine reported how, <quote>[Jeff Cowton] began to win the group
                            over when he pushed a 1798 <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads </title>in
                            front of one student and coaxed her to open the case and unfold the
                            wrappings. She felt as if she were handling a fragment of the True
                            Cross; and since in class I had made enough of a fetish of the <title
                                level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (“the book that is the very
                            turning-point of all English poetry”), everybody else was drawn into the
                            sense of awe.</quote> This colleague went on to recount, <quote>Of all
                            the poems we had read in class, it was “Michael” that had made the
                            deepest impression. So there was a sharp intake of breath when, as Jeff
                            was leading us through a manuscript passage from her journals, they
                            found Dorothy writing of coming upon a certain sheepfold in Greenhead
                            Ghyll. When Jeff produced one of Dorothy’s actual notebooks, they were
                            mesmerized.</quote> Other literary relics that reliably produce gasps
                        from students are Wordsworth’s marginal notes in an edition of <title
                            level="m">Paradise Lost</title>; Coleridge’s annotations ranking
                        Shakespeare ’s sonnets; and the 1818 edition of <title level="m"
                            >Frankenstein</title>, the mere presence of which has brought several
                        BYU students to tears. When surveyed about their memories of the Wordsworth
                        Trust workshops three years after the fact, my 2012 students invariably
                        noted their sense of awe in viewing or holding these artifacts.<note
                            place="foot"> In May 2015 I e-mailed the eighty former students from the
                            two study abroad groups I took to Grasmere in 2012, asking them to offer
                            candid, on-the-record reflections on the Wordsworth Trust workshops.
                            Besides soliciting general memories, I asked: “Has there been any
                            long-term impact of the educational experiences we had at the Wordsworth
                            Trust? In other words, was it just a fun set of activities, or has it
                            had carry-over effects in your academic or professional life in perhaps
                            unexpected ways?” This was admittedly a less than scientific survey, and
                            I recognize that the most academically-engaged, literature-loving
                            students from my groups are likely overrepresented in the twenty-one
                            responses I ultimately received. The purpose of the survey, however, was
                            less to produce a rigorous assessment of the workshops than to
                            understand better the types of things students remembered three years
                            after the experience. All quotations below come from private responses
                            to my e-mail and are reproduced with the permission of the
                            respondents.</note> “It might sound crazy,” one student reported, “but I
                        almost felt closer to Wordsworth as I held early editions of his works and
                        flipped through the pages. It was like he was still there in those pages.”
                        Another wrote, “My connection to Wordsworth seemed so much deeper when I was
                        able to see things he actually penned. I struggled to interpret his
                        handwriting and was thrilled that his poetry existed in forms other than a
                        neatly printed literature book.” Even more vividly, a third student
                        recalled, <quote>Sitting in the Jerwood Centre, surrounded by the incredible
                            manuscripts, books, and letters, made me almost giddy. To an outside
                            observer, giddiness over old, yellowed pieces of paper probably seems
                            silly. However, I truly believe that reading an original manuscript of
                                <title level="m">The Prelude</title>—with the author’s notes and
                            scribbles—brought Wordsworth and his words to life in a way I could have
                            never experienced merely reading the poem in a sterile classroom in
                            Utah. For students of literature, I do not think there is anything more
                            satisfying or transcendent than reading the author’s work in its
                            original setting.</quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Stepping back from such comments, it is relatively easy to question the
                        “assessable outcomes” of auratic experiences or interrogate those ideologies
                        that engender reverential feelings for decaying books. Before heading too
                        far down those critical paths, however, we might pause and remember that the
                        responses cited above are those of twenty-first century, general-education
                        students from a college in Middle America—the same demographic cultural
                        commentators routinely denigrate for supposedly preferring the crass,
                        sensational, and banal to the transcendent and timeless. By not only
                        devoting four solid hours to textual studies of long-dead writers but also
                        continuing to rhapsodize over the experience three years later, these
                        students hardly conform to narratives about the demise of refined
                        sensibilities in an anesthetized age.</p>
                    <p>And, if these surveys are to be trusted, we are not just talking about a
                        fleeting contemplative moment devoid of long-term impact. A wide range of my
                        2012 students report carryover effects of the emotions they felt for poetry,
                        rare books, and the Wordsworths at the Jerwood Centre. A political science
                        major who has since completed law school says that the Jerwood Centre’s
                        book-lined walls inspired him to begin building his own library of old
                        books. A special education major tells how, prior to visiting Grasmere, she
                        “completely refused to look at poetry outside of class, minus the occasional
                        glance at <title level="m">Where the Sidewalk Ends</title>”; three years
                        later, she routinely includes poetry in her recreational reading, a change
                        she attributes to her single day at the Wordsworth Trust. And a film student
                        now working in the social media industry reports, “I find myself turning to
                        poetry and classic literary works in my free time when I need peace or when
                        I want to feel connected to that place. I think Wordsworth has become a part
                        of me —and that is an outcome I was not expecting.” Again, such testaments
                        of passion and aura can seem trite or fuzzy; but given how quickly the
                        contents of entire courses are forgotten by many students, it is difficult
                        to quibble with reports of lives changed as a result of a single afternoon
                        in rural northwestern England.</p>

                    <head>Transferable Knowledge and Skills</head>
                    <p>Of course, one would be hard-pressed to find a learning-objectives document
                        from an engineering, marketing, or public health study-abroad program that
                        aspires to provide students with transcendent, awe-inspiring, or
                        tear-inducing experiences. It is consequently important to step back and ask
                        what transferable knowledge and skills archival sessions like these can
                        provide the typical North American student and how faculty directors of
                        short-term programs not focused primarily on literature can justify the time
                        and expense of such a workshop. In concluding this essay, then, I want to
                        consider a few key lessons students from across the disciplines might glean
                        from participating in archival workshops in general and those at the
                        Wordsworth Trust in particular.</p>
                    <p>The first and most basic takeaway is perhaps the one we might least expect
                        students to learn at the home of a poet commonly associated with
                        spontaneous, free-flowing, and emotive verse—namely, just how much work goes
                        into good writing. One of the most effective exercises I have observed
                        during these workshops is one where Jeff Cowton assigns two or three
                        students to pore over the messy, fragmentary, and generally bewildering
                        manuscript of “The Ruined Cottage,” trying to trace how this roughest of
                        drafts evolved into the highly polished, mellifluous poem now found in major
                        poetry anthologies (see Figure 5.1). </p>

                    <p>At times this half-hour exercise has seemingly made a stronger impact than a
                        semester’s worth of on-campus lectures about the necessity of revision in
                        serious writing. As one of my students from 2012 reported, “In classes we
                        always study the ‘perfect’ typeset versions; but seeing Wordsworth ’s
                        handwriting, mistakes, and thoughts makes you realize that even the most
                        gifted of writers struggle.” Thinking of this same exercise, one program
                        director recalled, <quote>I happened to be sitting next to a student who, in
                            our ordinary classes, had been a bit obnoxious and indifferent. Yet she
                            was fascinated with the facsimiles, and the two of us sat together for
                            twenty minutes or so, trying to work out in what order the poet might
                            have written the various bits and what grounds we could give for
                            thinking so. In other words, an uninspired and uninspiring student
                            momentarily transformed into an eager textual critic. In fact, I daresay
                            Jeff made the biggest impression on our less-studious students, who were
                            particularly struck by the emphasis on the physicality and labor of
                            literary production: the paper, the ink, the bookmaking, and
                            bookbinding.</quote> While it would be difficult, and perhaps
                        impossible, to measure this single exercise’s lasting impact on these
                        students’ reading and writing, one can reasonable presume that they left
                        Grasmere with a newfound appreciation for how even the most naturally gifted
                        writers need draft upon draft before feeling a work is close to
                        finished.</p>
                    <p>An entirely different exercise —and one with particular appeal for
                        business-minded students —is one where Jeff asks the group to step into his
                        role as curator of a major archive and make difficult decisions regarding
                        the acquisition of newly available books and manuscripts on a fixed budget.
                        With one of my groups, for instance, he showed them an 1817 first-edition
                            <title level="m">Biographia Literaria </title>he had recently been
                        loaned by a dealer who was hoping the Trust might purchase it. After
                        explaining the rarity of this edition, its importance for Coleridgeans and
                        other scholars of British literature and philosophy, and that the Trust
                        already owned several copies of this edition, Jeff asked the students to
                        brainstorm reasons why he might possibly spend several thousand pounds to
                        acquire yet another copy. This forced them to think on the spot about issues
                        of distinctiveness and scarcity (i.e., potential discrepancies in the
                        condition, provenance, and marginalia of copies from the same print run);
                        opportunity cost (i.e., the wisdom of spending limited acquisition funds on
                        this book versus others that might come to market); and brand management
                        (i.e., the expense and competitive necessity of maintaining the world’s
                        premier collection of Wordsworth and Coleridge editions). Perhaps most
                        importantly, seeing a bookish Wordsworth expert in a remote corner of
                        England having to make difficult budgetary decisions reinforced the
                        necessity of gaining a basic education in economics and financial
                        management. Far from an abstract “case study” or “story problem,” this was a
                        real-world, real-time business decision Jeff was asking our students to help
                        him make.</p>
                    <p>Besides these decidedly pragmatic lessons, sessions at the Wordsworth Trust
                        also provide students with more generalized philosophies, insights, and
                        tools for life. After studying Dorothy’s diary at the Jerwood Centre, an
                        elementary education major in my 2012 group was inspired to begin keeping a
                        daily journal. “I have no expectations of becoming a great poet (or great
                        anything!),” she reported, “but I do want to keep an accurate and engaging
                        history about my own life. This has been the greatest enduring impact from
                        my experience at the Wordsworth Trust.” Another student from this group, a
                        geography major now working as a flight attendant, traces much of her
                        philosophy of travel to this trip: <quote>I constantly look back on my study
                            abroad and specifically the trip to the Lake District when I am planning
                            my visit to a new place. This study abroad taught me that wandering
                            through a new place, whether it be through the streets or through the
                            landscape, can only be supported when reading books, poems, or other
                            documents pertaining to the location.</quote> Perhaps most crucially for
                        denizens of the twenty-first century, a trip to the Lakes organized around
                        archival workshops almost inevitably instills an ethic of conservation
                        —preserving books, manuscripts, and historical sites to be sure, but also
                        continuing to protect an entire region which, by embracing the Wordsworths’
                        conservationist ideals, remains much the same as when William and Dorothy
                        rambled its hills. Especially for North American students all-too-habituated
                        to once-picturesque regions now despoiled by condominiums, power watercraft,
                        and parking lots, simply observing the painstaking preservation of both rare
                        books and landscapes can subtly shape their attitudes toward
                        conservation.</p>
                    <p>Given the time and expense it takes to travel from London to the Lake
                        District, such workshops will not be an option for all UK-based study
                        abroad. While the Wordsworth Trust offers the unparalleled experience of
                        studying centuries-old literary artifacts in a region that remains largely
                        unchanged, several of the core lessons taught by Jeff Cowton and his
                        colleagues at the Jerwood Centre might be replicated through similar
                        exercises at the British Library, the British Museum, and archives and
                        galleries across Europe. Although the experience of peering through thick
                        museum glass at a draft of a Keats ode or a Beethoven sonata might fall
                        short of holding a first-edition <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> or a
                        love letter from William to Mary Wordsworth, both can provoke stimulating
                        discussions about the power and aura of great art and the labor that goes
                        into great writing. And lest we professors of literature think such
                        activities are of little interest or value to general education and
                        pre-professional study-abroad students, we need only look at the data about
                        where programs catering to these students tend to be based (i.e., Europe)
                        and what types of cultural experiences they aim to provide. In sum, whether
                        as a featured part of a general-education study abroad or a supplemental
                        excursion built into a STEM or business-oriented program, participating in
                        an archival or textual studies workshop like those offered by the Wordsworth
                        Trust continues to rank among the most intellectually and culturally
                        formative experiences a North American student can have while studying
                        overseas. </p>
