                    <head>Introduction</head>
                    <p>We are directors of two Field Schools offered through the Department of
                        English and International Services at SFU. One is to London and the Lake
                        District, and the other is to Paris and the Loire Valley. For the past few
                        years, we have worked together throughout the lengthy process of seeking
                        Senate and Department-level approval for the Field Schools, and we thought
                        it only natural to continue to co-develop our field schools’ pedagogical
                        approaches and assignments. The importance of sharing ideas and
                        collaboration is in fact a common theme in the essays collected for this
                        issue on Lake District Field School Pedagogy. Our full-credit ten-week Field
                        Schools include two upper-division English literature courses taught by us
                        as well as a third course in another discipline which is taught by another
                        instructor to enhance the interdisciplinary nature of our programs. We
                        encourage our students to attend both of our Field Schools, which run in
                        alternating years, as part of their international post-secondary education
                        and engagement. </p>
                    <p>Fieldwork is not typical of humanities pedagogy or scholarship. It is a
                        practice associated with other academic disciplines, chiefly the social
                        sciences (especially linguistics, geography, anthropology, and archaeology).
                        In this paper, we develop a critical approach to fieldwork that is
                        specifically designed for the humanities and the kinds of historical and
                        literary cultural study that we do with our students. Our aim is to bring
                        fieldwork to the humanities and reinvigorate humanities pedagogy through
                        fieldwork. To that end, we have developed a series of assignments that
                        provide training in humanities-specific fieldwork methods. We advocate for
                        the use of digital-based assignments because they more readily allow for
                        cultural fieldwork to be multi-modal, shared, and archived. This digital
                        approach allows for greater integration between the students’ home and field
                        environments, breaking down artificial distinctions between the two and
                        enabling ongoing virtual fieldwork.</p>
                    <p>Published along with this essay is an appendix, London and Lake District
                        Assignments, that describes in some detail the assignments for our Field
                        Schools (Appendix D). We hope that by sharing these assignments, others can
                        adapt them for use in their own Field Schools.</p>

                    <head>What Is the Field and What Is Humanities Fieldwork?</head>
                    <p>Part of the process of developing our Field Schools has been to inquire more
                        deeply into our objectives for the program, as well as our very concepts of
                        the field and fieldwork. After all, “going out” into the field and
                        undertaking empirical-based fieldwork is not fundamental to literary
                        research or pedagogy as it is for the social sciences. We might bring our
                        students to a library, a special collection, a museum, or a cultural site,
                        but these are all brief excursions rather than sustained emplacements with
                        established practices and assignments. What do we mean by “the field” and
                        what kinds of “fieldwork” should we ask our students to undertake in it?</p>
                    <p>If we start with the dictionary meaning of “field,” we encounter complication
                        rather than clarity. One definition is an expanse of ground that has been
                        opened or cleared for human use, thus a physical place, clearly demarcated
                        from other places. Another definition is of an outlying area different from
                        a home base, as in sending representatives out into the field. A third
                        definition is a sphere of human activity or interest, as in a field of
                        knowledge or engagement. The meaning of the word “field” thus shifts from
                        the locational, and thus more clearly demarcated, to the social and
                        cultural, whose boundaries are more difficult to locate or define. This
                        third definition has become crucial to our concept of the field. We will not
                        be bringing our students to outlying locations cut off from the distractions
                        of their “real” lives, but rather bringing them to locations overgrown with
                        social, political, historical, and literary engagements that have transected
                        time and place. Our Field Schools to London and the Lake District, and to
                        Paris and the Loire Valley, are cultural sites that offer students rich
                        opportunities for <emph>multi-situated</emph> historical study.</p>
                    <p>The prevailing definition of student “fieldwork” is the empirical one. For
                        Elia Shabani Mligo, fieldwork is “the act of inquiring into the nature of
                        phenomena by studying them at first hand in the environments in which they
                        naturally exist or occur” (38). In this understanding, fieldwork uses the
                        environment and the people within it as its laboratory to make discoveries
                        and construct theories about existing phenomena (39). The model of fieldwork
                        presented is one of going, observing, leaving, and remembering (39). In
                        addition to the empirical model of the student researcher authorizing and
                        isolating knowledge through observation and experience is a more touristic
                        notion of student fieldwork, which draws from the language of exploration.
                        Richard Phillips, a geographer who advocates for incorporating fieldwork
                        into geography courses, speaks of fieldwork as a form of exploration driven
                        by curiosity and discovery (84). Both these empirical and touristic models
                        of fieldwork, we argue, are based on a reductive understanding of the field
                        and do not adequately describe the kind of multitudinous work and learning
                        that can be done by students in humanities-oriented study-abroad
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>The first problem is with the definition of the field as a differentiated
                        space, sharply distinguished from the student’s home environment. James
                        Clifford’s critical work on concepts of the field in anthropology proves
                        helpful, for he recognizes the field as a discursively constructed space. In
                            <title level="m">Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth
                            Century</title>, Clifford outlines how the field has been traditionally
                        constructed by means of localizing spatial practices and argues that such
                        spatial practices restrict our understanding of the field to a space over
                        there, of the past, or linked to exotic difference or indigeneity (97, 100,
                        107). Instead of being attuned to the ways culture travels across space and
                        time, researchers sustain a view of the “world as exhibition” (Heidegger
                        125). This limited sense of the field as a distinct outlying place, cut off
                        from dense regional, national, and global networks of migration and
                        communication, is perhaps less of an issue for study-abroad programs in
                        major international capitals like London and Paris, but not if such models
                        of the field predetermine the kinds of fieldwork that will be undertaken in
                        these programs.   </p>
                    <p>The second problem arises from the understanding of fieldwork as an empirical
                        method of observing, recording, and analyzing phenomenon. This
                        understanding—taken in its pure form—presumes a non-porous and
                        unidirectional relationship between the student researcher and the subject
                        of study: she travels to the field to gain specialized knowledge, returning
                        with data and research and experience to be analyzed and incorporated into
                        coursework, which is legitimized by the first-hand experience and the notion
                        of differentiated space. Traditionally, fieldwork has been encouraged to
                        overcome what Phillips, writing about geographical research, has called the
                        regrettable tendency to “cite not sight” (4). As Clifford points out,
                        however, this sense of the field as “other” also means that interactions
                        between students and the field are premised on separation and distance (66;
                        89–90).</p>
                    <p>Another consequence of this understanding of the field as geographically and
                        temporally bound and cut-off from the rest of the world is what Fiona Smith
                        (a geographer at the University of Dundee who has led a field course in
                        Costa Blanca in Spain) calls the “fieldwork bubble” (78). This is the
                        flipside of the student researcher who travels to the field to extract
                        specialized knowledge to bring home for analysis. In this scenario, the
                        student researcher who travels to the field superimposes her home culture
                        onto the field. As with the “tourist bubble,” the “fieldwork bubble” evokes
                        what Jens K. S. Jacobsen has called “travelling parochialism,” whereby
                        students and tourists alike “adopt some kind of furtherance of a home-like
                        culture.” The problem is that this bubble “confines and isolates” students
                        through the “protective walls” of their familiar institutional and regional
                        cultures (Jacobsen 71-72). Neither the researcher who mines cultural
                        resources to bring back home nor one who sets up home in the field are
                        adequate fieldwork models, as both are based on the dualism of home and
                        field, and the residual colonial ideologies of fieldwork.</p>
                    <p>In our view, a different model is needed for student fieldwork in the
                        humanities, one that is neither strictly empirical nor touristic and one
                        that does not view the field as an extension of home or a necessary other.
                        We want to destabilize the binaries between campus/field, home/abroad,
                        here/there, and now/then that help sustain “the fieldwork bubble” and the
                        notion of the field as an outlying place of the world where one goes off to
                        accrue knowledge through experience. In line with geographer Jennifer
                        Hyndeman, we want to emphasize the way the field comes home and home goes to
                        the field. </p>
                    <p>We advocate for an interactive, multi-situated, and expressive mode of
                        fieldwork, one that promotes humanistic values and methods, by which we mean
                        the critical study of human cultures across time and place alongside their
                        expressive modes of representation. Our model of fieldwork is distinctly
                        humanistic insofar as it is premised on a capacious understanding of
                        culture—ranging from food to theatre, art to architecture, literature to
                        film, graffiti to photography. It is also based on an understanding that
                        cultural histories and encounters occur both in sites of high culture, such
                        as museums, art galleries, and libraries, and on the streets and in the
                        underground. These sites offer numerous opportunities for students to relate
                        their learning to the places, objects, and people they are studying in
                        environments that are richly layered by time. We want our students to engage
                        in fieldwork as a shared and ongoing inquiry into a living past whose
                        location is neither here nor there and is never fixed or finished. Finally,
                        our vision of student fieldwork is centered on creative expression and
                        critical thinking as we encourage students to communicate their experiential
                        learning in a variety of modes and venues. We have embraced new forms of
                        digital media in fieldwork precisely because they enable simultaneous and
                        networked forms of inquiry, experience, and communication—so that fieldwork
                        can be shared, continued beyond the field, and both real and virtual at the
                        same time. All of our assignments are, therefore, what we call
                            <emph>transfield</emph> in approach, designed to have students move
                        across disciplinary, historical, geographical, cultural, and communicative
                        boundaries that can restrict engagements with the field and the fieldwork
                        they undertake. Our goal is for our students to be transformed by their
                        experiences in the field and to understand their own impact on the field as
                        participants, observers, and creators. </p>

                    <head>Fieldwork Assignments</head>
                    <p>Our Field School courses have been designed around five core assignments,
                        each with the purpose of enabling students to integrate their learning with
                        interactive experiences in the field. A notable feature of our assignments
                        is their significant incorporation of digital technologies, a recent trend
                        in fieldwork (cf. Welsh and France 48; Bedall-Hill 19). The practical reason
                        for this decision is that students will not have easy access to printers,
                        ink, and paper, though they will have their own laptops, mobile devices, and
                        internet connections in the dormitories. We also believe that digital tools
                        can help our students explore multiple modes of acquiring and communicating
                        knowledge, which will not only expand their notion of the field, but also
                        give them important training in digital technologies. An argument could be
                        made that we are simply creating a different kind of fieldwork bubble, one
                        that allows students to retreat into the digital environments and virtual
                        social networks they already know. We have tried, however, to balance
                        kinesthetic, visual, auditory, literary, and digital modes of investigation
                        into our assignments, which will push students of literature beyond the
                        usual, academically sanctioned modes of writing and research in our
                        discipline, while encouraging them to learn, perceive, and communicate in
                        multi-modal and multi-situated ways, both individually and collaboratively.
                        The assignments that we describe below pertain, in particular, to the London
                        and Lake District Field School. </p>
                    <p>The first assignment is field school participation. It is based on attendance
                        as well as regular and thoughtful contribution to the class meetings,
                        presentations, and excursions.</p>
                    <p>The second and most significant assignment is the fieldwork blog. Over the
                        course of the ten-week program, students will create a minimum of twelve
                        blog entries in a variety of different genres and media formats. The goal is
                        for students to develop an online portfolio of all of their fieldwork, which
                        can be shared both virtually (with friends and family at home) and also with
                        fellow students, and students will rotate presenting on their blogs during
                        our in-class meetings. The genres of field blog entries are fully described
                        in the handout, but briefly are as follows:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item><hi rend="bold">Journal entries</hi>, which describe an aspect of the

                            accompanied by a brief written caption;</item>

                            with brief epistolary accompaniment;</item>

                            to re-enact an experience or activity described in the course

                        <item><hi rend="bold">Pinterest boards</hi>, which have the students
                            thinking creatively about bringing the works in question into current
                            social media trends; and </item>
                        <item><hi rend="bold">Digital maps</hi>, which uses online software such as
                            Google Maps to chart the distinctive geography of the cities and
                            landscapes we are visiting and studying via art and literature.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Our third assignment asks students to prepare two on-site field
                        presentations, one that is individually led and the other collaboratively
                        prepared, in which they present on a specific historical site or artifact in
                        a manner that is interactive and site-specific. The collaborative on-site
                        field presentations require considerable planning and involvement on our
                        part, as we must familiarize ourselves with the site, its features, and the
                        route, and anticipate issues related to weather, scheduling, and group
                        needs. This assignment thus highlights the dynamic and improvisational
                        nature of the field and positions the students as co-instructors and the
                        instructors as co-presenters. </p>
                    <p>The fourth assignment focuses on archival work and specifically develops the
                        important scholarly skill of textual editing. For the London and Lake
                        District Field School, students will begin by transcribing from digital
                        surrogates and rare printed books from our own library’s Special
                        Collections, and this work will be the foundation for a specially-designed
                        short course we have arranged via an institutional partnership with <ref
                            target="https://www.wordsworth.org.uk/home.html">the Wordsworth
                            Trust</ref>. Over the course of three mornings, students will be
                        directly involved in archival study as they receive training in material
                        culture, the handling of rare books and manuscripts, manuscript
                        transcription, and textual editing. This work will enable them to contribute
                        to an ongoing research project, a digital edition of one of Dorothy
                        Wordsworth’s poetry notebooks. </p>
                    <p>Our fifth and final assignment asks students to present two lightning-style
                        talks at the end of their time in each destination, reviewing and
                        synthesizing their learning and providing the capstone event for the Field
                        Schools to London and the Lake District or to Paris and the Loire Valley. </p>
                    <p>In designing these field school assignments, a primary goal is to move both
                        instructor and student beyond traditional forms of academic literary work by
                        combining critical and creative as well as private, social, and public forms
                        of communication. With the on-site field presentation, we co-develop and
                        co-present along with our students, transforming the field into a more
                        democratic pedagogical space. Similarly, the transcription and textual
                        editing assignment enables students to participate in our research by having
                        them contribute to a publicly available digital edition. Our field blog
                        assignment also moves beyond traditional forms of academic, print-based
                        essay writing, as it requires students to write regularly, in multiple
                        genres, imagining different kinds of audiences, and using a repertoire of
                        voices. These blog entries will be read by fellow students as well as
                        friends and family back home, thereby allowing students’ fieldwork to travel
                        and reach some audiences not incorporated in traditional coursework. For a
                        student perspective on the value of writing fieldwork blogs, see this <ref

                        participant (at 1:30).</p>
                    <p>Another aim of ours is to prompt students to express themselves through
                        multimodal forms, such as the soundagram and the digital postcards that they
                        will produce for their field blogs. We are asking students to use a range of
                        digital media (visual, audio, video), allowing them to develop a skill set
                        in and familiarity with using these digital technologies and thus “burst”
                        the fieldwork bubble through ongoing communication, dialogue, and
                        remediation activities that link field to home and fieldwork to homework
                        through material and virtual experiences. Another argument in favor of
                        allowing students to do course work in these multimodal forms is that they
                        are engaging in vernacular forms of communication, ones that help them
                        connect to work outside of the academy (Takayoshi and Selfe 3).</p>
                    <p>A further goal is to have students move through space and time, performing,
                        retracing, and reviving encounters with the dynamic space we are calling the
                        field. In so doing, we are encouraging them to reflect on their own
                        geographical and temporal movements, and on how the locations we move
                        through are and have been tourist sites and global hubs, and a part of the
                        larger history of transatlantic migration, globalization, and colonization.
                        Our “digital mapping” and “in the footsteps of” assignments, for instance,
                        allow students to think critically and historically about different
                        encounters and journeys in a field overgrown through space and time.</p>
                    <p>Finally, and most importantly, we want students to be more conscious of the
                        ways they learn and acquire knowledge. We are prompting students to move
                        from being passive consumers of information and culture to becoming active
                        and critical producers of cultural knowledge in a social context, and to do
                        so by teaching forms of responsible and public-facing digital literacy that
                        are dominant in the culture at large (Williams xii). There are several
                        distinct kinds of inquiry and knowledge production in which our students
                        will engage as they learn by doing and observing with their field school
                        peers. Our emphasis on expression—written, oral, and performative—will be
                        familiar to our students, but we will challenge them, by asking them to
                        think, work, and present improvisationally, multimodally, and
                        collaboratively in person and in media forms that enable networked and
                        virtual communication. We will also encourage students to reflect critically
                        on how concepts of periodization, national cultures, and cultural heritage
                        have shaped their approach to Romanticism and Modernism, travel, and
                        expatriation. Lastly, borrowing from recent popular approaches to material
                        history, such as the BBC’s <title level="m">History of the World in a
                            Hundred Objects</title> based on the British Museum’s Collection, we
                        want our students to be attentive to the opportunities presented by the
                        traces of the past that survive into the present and by the way a single
                        object can animate an historical moment.    </p>
                    <p>Our assignments will develop our students’ international experience and
                        knowledge and have them think about their roles as students, researchers,
                        tourists, and travellers as part of a multi-scaled history of transatlantic
                        culture and migration, mass tourism, globalization, colonization, and
                        disciplinary research practices. Our assignments will also have students
                        undertake intercultural work, embedding their study of literature, history,
                        art, geography, book history, and digital humanities within their own
                        personal experiences in the field. We will certainly capitalize on our
                        immersion in the landscape, history, and material culture of London and the
                        Lake District, as well as of Paris and the Loire Valley, but we will also
                        have students regularly communicate and remediate their studies in the field
                        in written, performative, collaborative, and digital multi-media formats,
                        thus offsetting the romance of foreign immersion and appeal to experience
                        with regular reflection and dialogue in a supported but intense fashion that
                        will help make our field schools a transformative pedagogical experience for
                        us and for our students. </p>
                    <p>It is our hope that the fieldwork we have assigned for the Field Schools will
                        not end with the study-abroad semester. Not only have we linked fieldwork to
                        ongoing research projects to which students may be invited to continue as
                        contributors, but we are also developing undergraduate courses in humanities
                        fieldwork methods and applications. These courses will offer opportunities
                        for past or future field school students to reflect on fieldwork practices
                        and develop digital tools for fieldwork activities and assignments,
                        including virtual fieldwork. It will also be a platform for liaising with
                        our colleagues who specialize in fieldwork and digital media. These courses
                        will thus function as recruitment, support, and extension of our Field
                        Schools that will bring fieldwork to the humanities and reimagine humanities
                        pedagogy through fieldwork. </p>
