                <head>Appendix D: London/Lake District Field School Assignments</head>
                <div type="section">
                    <p rend="noCount">The following assignments are designed for two third-year
                        English courses to be offered as part of the London/Lake District Field
                        School, a full-time, credit-bearing program. The first course, “Romantic-Era
                        London,” will survey the Romantic period’s best-known authors (including
                        Austen, Baillie, Barbauld, Blake, Byron, Coleridge, De Quincey, Hemans,
                        Keats, Shelley, and Wordsworth) and focus on their representations of the
                        nation’s capital during one of its greatest moments of cultural production.
                        The second course, “The Wordsworth Circle and the English Lake District,”
                        will focus on the Wordsworths (primarily William and Dorothy) and S. T.
                        Coleridge, writers who immortalized the region and played an important role
                        in ensuring that its natural and cultural heritage was preserved. The Field
                        School will run for ten weeks: the first four weeks will be spent on campus,
                        the subsequent four weeks will be spent in London, and the remaining two
                        weeks in the Lake District. Total grades for the two courses, totalling 104
                        credit hours, equals 200% (100% per course).</p>

                        and excursions. You are expected to read the material in advance and bring
                        questions and comments from your blogs and about your fellow students’ blogs
                        to class. Respect and consideration for your classmates is also vital for
                        good class dynamics.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p rend="noCount">Every student will develop, maintain and add content to a
                        blog. Each week (for the six weeks of travel) you will be responsible for
                        creating and publishing two blog entries, for a total of twelve entries; in
                        addition, you will be responsible for one pre-departure entry. The purpose
                        of this blog is to serve as a platform and archive for a lot of the work you
                        will do in the Field School, and to enable you to share it with others. The
                        blog format encourages you to becoming active and critical producers of
                        cultural knowledge in a social context, through the use of an open-access,
                        public-facing, and responsible form of digital literacy. At the end of the
                        Field School, you will have an online portfolio or exhibit of all the
                        fieldwork you have done during the six weeks that we are in London and the
                        Lake District.</p>

                        <hi rend="bold">How will the fieldwork blog be executed?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p rend="noCount">You will create two entries every week, which will take a
                        variety of forms (see the table below). These entries will address different
                        topics, develop a repertoire of voices and critical skills, and speak to
                        audiences in the field and at home. Your blog entries will typically range
                        from three to five hundred words in length (certain genres of entry will
                        require different word lengths, however). Each entry will respond to what
                        you have seen, heard, or done on the date of the entry, as it relates to the
                        course material. Your entries should be varied and creative, but at the same
                        time engage critically with the fieldwork. To encourage experimentation,
                        creativity, and transfield approaches that can bridge time and place, you
                        should integrate multimedia elements into a number of your entries and
                        explore a variety of genres.</p>
                    <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Multimedia</hi>: The beauty of the blog format
                        (and the WordPress interface in particular) is that it is extremely easy to
                        integrate a range of media forms: photographs, video, audio, maps, and links
                        to other websites. You should be thinking about how to bring these media
                        formats into your entries in thoughtful and meaningful ways. One entry may
                        work best with a slideshow, another, with a series of short videos [using a
                        mobile phone or a camera with a video function], or another with audio
                        clips.  </p>
                    <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Genre</hi>: Although some of your entries may
                        take the form of a journal (that is, exploring some aspect of the day’s
                        activities), you will also want to diversify your blog entries by producing
                        one or more entries in the following genres. At least six of the entries
                        should be selected from the following list, with no more than two per
                        genre.</p>

                                about everything you have done; focus and write about a particular
                                aspect of the day’s fieldwork that was meaningful to you, and
                                explain why. </cell>

                                circle. Whether writing for a modern-day or a Romantic-era audience,
                                provide a detailed account of a tour with precise directions and a
                                discussion of important landmarks on the tour. Your aim should be to
                                guide your reader through the tour and convince him/her it is worth
                                doing. Feel free to experiment with pastiche and/or ekphrasis.

                        of the presentations will be done as teams of two to four students.  Each
                        presentation will be roughly twenty to twenty-five minutes in length on a
                        specific object or group of objects in a gallery, on a specific historical
                        or cultural site, or on a specific route or meeting place relevant to the
                        Romantic authors and contexts being studied. One presentation will take

                        made before we depart for London. Unlike typical presentations given in
                        classrooms, this presentation in the field should be interactive,
                        performative, and site-specific. You may have to negotiate with crowds,
                        noise, or rough terrain, so a formal presentation with script and visual
                        aids will likely be ill-suited to the environment. Your goal will be to
                        adapt your presentation to a dynamic public site while engaging in critical
                        commentary and reflecting on its relationship to the course material.</p>

                        from your field presentation. Perhaps, at a gallery visit, you will involve
                        students in sketching as a means of connecting them to the art they are
                        viewing; or you might organize a scavenger hunt that allows students to
                        learn about the objects and environment they are exploring; or you might
                        design a walking tour that illuminates some of the poetry we are reading; or
                        you might prepare an audio recording for students to listen to as they move
                        through a museum, or perhaps a questionnaire; or you might try to recreate
                        through performance a specific historical encounter or series of historical
                        encounters with an object or site; or you might organise a debate about a
                        contested issue related to the object, site, or route being investigated.

                    <p rend="noCount">One of the most exciting aspects of working in the field is
                        that we get to move through historically and culturally fascinating places,
                        the very places that inspired the cultural flourishings that we are
                        studying. These field presentations prompt you to connect the literature and
                        culture you are studying to these places, while developing your oral
                        communication skills and adaptability to new environments and public spaces
                        at the same time. These interactive presentations will also encourage you to
                        think critically about the ways in which your fieldwork is taking place in
                        locations whose geographies, histories, and publics continually change and
                        evolve.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p rend="noCount">For this assignment, students will be helping Dr. Levy build
                        her digital edition of Dorothy Wordsworth’s poetry, which is being developed
                        in partnership with SFU’s Wordsworth Special Collections and the Wordsworth
                        Trust. The digital edition is based upon two sources: (1) printed editions
                        of Dorothy’s poems as they appeared during her lifetime in poetry
                        collections published by her brother, William Wordsworth (all of these rare
                        books are available in SFU’s Wordsworth Special Collections); and (2)
                        manuscript copies of her poems, as held by the Wordsworth Trust Library (and
                        as digitally reproduced in an online database to which the library
                        subscribes).  Students will be assigned specific poems, in both print and
                        manuscript, and will be responsible for transcribing, encoding (in TEI-XML),
                        annotating, and contextualizing these poems. Much of this work will be done
                        before we leave; however, students will have access to the original
                        manuscripts, to be viewed under Dr. Levy’s supervision, as part of our short
                        course we are taking at the Wordsworth Trust. Students’ work will be vetted
                        by Dr. Levy and added to the digital edition currently in development, and
                        their contributions will be credited on the Wordsworth Trust website.</p>

                    <p rend="noCount">One of the most important and rewarding aspects of advanced
                        literary study is archival work and textual editing. Through this
                        assignment, students will learn about field work as researchers, entering
                        the archives of both our home institution and the Wordsworth Trust, and
                        learning how to engage with archival material responsibly and meaningfully.
                        Students will also learn important skills in textual and digital editing,
                        including text-encoding in TEI-XML; and will acquire a theoretical
                        understanding of the possibilities and limitations of remediation, the
                        process by which more and more manuscript and print artifacts are being
                        digitally represented. Finally, students will have the opportunity to have
                        their research made accessible to a wider public via dissemination on the
                        web.</p>

                        this assignment, you will be learning basic text-encoding using TEI-XML, the
                        standard mark-up language that has been developed for texts in the
                        humanities. Students will receive extensive training, and will begin
                        encoding their documents while in Vancouver.</p>

                        a simple presentation format where you show twenty-four images, each for
                        twenty seconds. The images advance automatically as you talk along to the
                        images. You can draw from your previous fieldwork assignments, and also
                        build on and add to this work.</p>

                    <p rend="noCount">This assignment allows you to reflect critically on your
                        fieldwork and share some of your discoveries and insights with the group
                        that has shared this experience with you. It is meant to be a lively and
                        entertaining capstone to our work, while also giving evidence to your

                        platform for their presentations. Students can prepare their presentations
                        ahead of time to the specified twenty seconds per slide and eight minute
                        maximum by uploading their presentations to YouTube; students then can
                        simply press play during the presentation and not worry about the management
                        of the slides.  You might also want to use Photoshop to edit your images.
                        Avoid packing your slides with images and texts: one image and one word is
                        likely better for audience comprehension, and remember that the slides are
                        accompanied by your narration. There are a number of royalty-free digital
                        image banks that you can use for any images that are not your own, such
                            as<ref target="http://www.imageafter.com/"> Image*After</ref>,
