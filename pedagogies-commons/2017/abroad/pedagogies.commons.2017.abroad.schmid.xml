            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount"> In summer of 2014 I led nine students to the Lake District for a
                    ten-day program on British Romantic literature, with a particular focus on
                    long-time Grasmere residents William and Dorothy Wordsworth and Thomas De
                    Quincey. I called the course “Walking with Wordsworth,” and the goal was both to
                    introduce students to the places that inspired particular poetic and prose works
                    of the Romantic period and to encourage students to question whether and how the
                    geographical context matters to the reader’s interpretation of the texts
                    themselves. Planning for the course began a year prior to departure and, per
                    university regulations, required working closely with the coordinator of the
                    study-abroad office at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), who strongly
                    advised using a third-party provider based in Texas with whom UTEP has
                    successfully partnered in the past. This article describes the classroom work
                    prior to arriving in the UK, the lodging, travel, and instructional components
                    of the trip itself, and the benefits of using a commercial provider in planning
                    and managing the logistics of the program. The article concludes that while
                    using a commercial provider adds a necessary bureaucratic layer to the
                    instructor’s planning and comes at some additional cost to the students, its
                    professional resources can offer significant time savings and peace of mind to
                    faculty, especially those planning a study abroad for the first time. </p>

                        encouragement in my initial consideration and planning of a student trip to
                        the Lakes</emph>.</p>
                <p>In summer of 2014 I took nine students—six undergraduates, two MA students, and
                    one non-degree seeking—to the Lake District for a ten-day program on British
                    Romantic literature, with a particular focus on long-time Grasmere residents
                    William and Dorothy Wordsworth and Thomas De Quincey. I called the course
                    “Walking with Wordsworth,” and the goal was both to introduce students to the
                    places that inspired particular poetic and prose works of the Romantic period
                    and to encourage students to think anew about the relationship and relative
                    importance of place to these literary productions—to consider the poetic and
                    other works in their natural habitat, so to speak—and actively to question
                    whether and how the geographical context matters to the reader’s interpretation
                    of the texts themselves. Planning for the course began a year prior to departure
                    and, per university regulations, required working closely with the coordinator
                    of the study-abroad office at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), who
                    strongly advised using a third-party provider based in Texas with whom UTEP has
                    successfully partnered in the past. UTEP often contracts with several such
                    providers, including International Studies Abroad (ISA) and Academic Programs
                    International (API), all of which have extensive expertise in developing
                    academic programs around the globe and in coordinating travel logistics,
                    itineraries, and in-country services; international programs and study-abroad
                    offices on local campuses will almost certainly have recommendations for
                    appropriate providers, depending on individual faculty needs and the
                    institution’s contractual arrangements, if any. In my case, since I had never
                    run a program abroad before, I agreed to use the recommended company (name
                    withheld to protect its privacy) and their on-site UK co-director, the latter of
                    whom oversaw the logistics of all in-country travel and activities and who
                    participated with the group throughout the program, from greeting us at the
                    Manchester airport to dropping us off for departure back to the US. I believe
                    the course was a success and that my own curricular goals were met: the students
                    and I walked in the footsteps of the Romantic writers who were inspired by the
                    fells and lakes of Cumbria, and the students evinced in their journals and final
                    papers an enriched understanding of the history and aesthetics of
                    Romantic-period literary responses to these northern landscapes. However, before
                    walking the environs of Keswick, Grasmere, Rydal, Langdale, Buttermere, and
                    Ullswater with my students, I had to waltz with my own study-abroad office and
                    the third-party organization, not always a smooth or easy task. While the
                    benefits of using a third-party provider in planning and delivering this student
                    class trip to the Lake District were substantial, they came at some cost both in
                    time and money; and while I will certainly consider partnering with the same
                    organization in the future—and recommending the company itself to interested
                    colleagues—an assessment of the advantages and frustrations may be useful to
                    faculty contemplating similarly structured study abroad courses of their
                    own.</p>
                <p>I need to stress from the start that the third-party organization—hereafter
                    referred to as TPO—proved a responsive and helpful partner and that it in no way
                    took control of the content or scope of the course or its in-country activities.
                    I brought the initial plan for the course to them and together we worked to make
                    it feasible, with all components and suggestions subject to my final approval.
                    That said, the initiative and experience of the resident UK co-director proved
                    invaluable in matching my course goals to specific activities, transportation,
                    housing, and meal options in England, and I endorsed nearly all her suggestions.
                    Once we finalized the itinerary, my co-director also took care of all hotel and
                    special-event reservations, secured blocks of tickets for admission to museums
                    and other venues, and planned group meals at various notable eateries, including
                    the Pheasant Inn at Bassenthwaite which Coleridge and Southey frequented; she
                    also arranged chartered transportation for each day of the trip, a significant
                    convenience given the comparative lack of public transportation options to a few
                    of the Lake District’s more remote locations. Stateside, TPO produced an
                    extremely eye-catching and professional flyer for advertising and recruiting
                    (using some of my own photographs from a previous research trip) and provided
                    pre-departure faculty and student handbooks (in PDF) as well as an extensive
                    on-site booklet with airport maps, helpful information on all activities,
                    emergency and other contact numbers, and a detailed itinerary for each day that
                    included interesting historical information on each site; participants were
                    given a printed copy of the booklet (along with a free umbrella) when the
                    director met us at the Manchester airport—where it was, in fact, raining when we
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>The course itself included both on-campus classwork (including three
                    examinations) before departure and a full schedule of activities in the Lake
                    District. On campus I held two extensive orientations and planning meetings in
                    the spring semester, during which I described the course goals and requirements
                    and provided the students with pictorial and narrative information—including
                    mileages—for the variety of walks we would be undertaking in England. These
                    orientation sessions also provided an opportunity to talk about Cumbrian
                    weather, including rainfall averages for May/June, recommended clothing and
                    footwear, exchange rates, cash recommendations, and so forth. </p>
                <p>Once the summer session began, we held five campus classes of 130 minutes each as
                    a kind of crash course in late eighteenth-century and Regency landscape
                    aesthetics, including a fairly hefty reading list for a short “Maymester”
                    course. We read and discussed selections from William Gilpin’s <title level="m"
                        >Observations on the Mountains and Lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland in
                        1772</title>, Thomas West’s <title level="m">Guide to the Lakes
                    </title>(which includes his famous descriptions of optimal viewing “stations”),
                    Burke’s <title level="m">Philosophical Inquiry into the Origins of Our Ideas on
                        the Sublime and Beautiful</title>, Ann Radcliffe’s 1794 <title level="m"
                        >Observations during a Tour to the Lakes of Lancashire, Westmoreland, and
                        Cumberland</title>, William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Guide to the
                        Lakes</title> and the entirety of Dorothy Wordsworth’s <title level="m"
                        >Grasmere Journal</title>, along with a generous selection of William
                    Wordsworth’s poetry, including the appropriate books of the <title level="m"
                        >Prelude</title>, Book Two of the <title level="m">Excursion</title> (<title
                        level="m">Complete Poetical Works</title>), the “Poems on the Naming of
                    Places,” “Idle Shepherd Boys,” “Home at Grasmere,” “Michael,” and so forth
                        (<title level="m">Major Works</title>). Among the primary texts, we also
                    read Dorothy Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Narrative Concerning George and Sarah
                        Green</title> and De Quincey’s “Memorials of Grasmere,” which give two
                    contrasting representations of the 1808 accidental deaths of George and Sarah
                    Green in a snowstorm atop the high fells between Langdale and Easedale. The loss
                    left a number of impoverished and orphaned children to the dubious charity of
                    the Grasmere community (about which Michelle Levy has written so insightfully);
                    the Green cottage can still be viewed in Easedale, just a few minutes’ walk from
                    the center of Grasmere.</p>
                <p>During the week of classes in El Paso, we also read several standard critical
                    assessments of the role and representation of nature in British Romanticism as a
                    way to contextualize the primary readings and structure our consideration of
                    literature and landscape in Cumbria. Only two of the student participants had
                    already taken a full semester course in British Romantic Literature from me, so
                    most of the students needed a basic background to the period before making sense
                    of the literary representations of landscape we would be considering both on the
                    page and on the ground in England. The primary readings, especially Burke’s
                    chapters on the sublime and beautiful, were of course central to our
                    discussions, but the students also benefited from the smattering of secondary
                    critical literature. We read and discussed Aidan Day’s introduction to seminal
                    scholarly definitions of Romanticism, the “Perspectives” section on “The
                    Sublime, the Beautiful, and the Picturesque” from the Romanticism volume of
                        <title level="m">The Longman Anthology of British Literature</title> (edited
                    by Susan Wolfson and Peter Manning), Jonathan Bate’s chapter on “The Picturesque
                    Environment” from <title level="m">Song of the Earth</title>, Geoffrey Hartman’s
                    classic essay on “Nature and the Humanization of the Self in Wordsworth,” and
                    generous portions of David McCracken’s <title level="m">Wordsworth and the Lake
                        District: A Guide to the Poems and Their Places</title>. The primary essays,
                    guidebooks, and poetry introduced students to the aesthetic vocabulary of the
                    period, while the secondary critical readings—especially Bate’s
                    chapter—encouraged resistant readings of the ideological investments in the
                    various Romantic-period representations of nature and the self; Dorothy
                    Wordsworth’s writings brought particular focus to the question of gender in the
                    Romantic representation of nature and landscape; and McCracken’s latter-day
                    guide helped immeasurably in mapping the literary/geographical reference points
                    for Wordsworth’s poetry before and after we set foot in Cumbria. To facilitate
                    our discussions while in England, each student brought with him or her a laptop
                    or tablet with key primary and secondary texts uploaded in PDF form, including
                    the relevant pages from McCracken describing the daily walks on the itinerary;
                    each student was required to keep a daily journal and to write a final response
                    paper analyzing the role of place in a particular poem, journal, or guide from
                    the period, both of which were due by either electronic or paper submission on
                    the final morning before departure.</p>
                <p>In the Lake District, we were headquartered in Greta Hall in Keswick, Coleridge’s
                    home from 1800–1803 and Southey’s from 1803 to his death in 1843, now run as a
                    B&amp;B. The availability of the hall was an inspired discovery by the UK
                    co-director, who secured the main house and coach house for the exclusive use of
                    our group and arranged with the Greta Hall owners, Scott Ligertwood and Jeronime
                    Palmer, for packed lunches on most days and breakfast each morning. Both the
                    main house and coach house also included kitchen and common-room spaces where we
                    could eat and hold informal discussions on the day’s—or next day’s—activities
                    and readings. One afternoon, Scott and Jeronime served afternoon tea in Southey’s
                    study, during which Scott gave an animated reading in his broad Scottish accent
                    of Southey’s “Three Bears” (written in that very room)—a huge hit with the
                    students. Greta Hall is an award-winning Green Tourism-designated B&amp;B, and I
                    can highly recommend it for a group of 10 or 12. The owners are well versed in
                    the literary history of the property, and it makes a perfect base of operations. </p>
                <p> My co-director also arranged for transportation by chartered van for each day’s
                    drive to specific locales and, again, her choice proved perfect for us. We used
                    Furness of Keswick and were driven everywhere we needed to go by the same driver
                    (I only knew him by his first name, Dave), a canny Lakeland native who became a
                    great companion on many activities, including the steep climb to Dungeon Ghyll
                    Force, about which I’ll talk in a moment. Related to the issue of knowledgeable
                    climbing partners, my co-director also retained the services of a local Keswick
                    mountain guide and author, Keith Richardson, for several of our more extended
                    Wordsworthian rambles. Keith has published several books on the area, including
                    a beautifully photographed history of the River Greta (which flows through
                    Keswick), and his knowledge of the Wordsworth/Coleridge connections with
                    particular places is extensive. My co-director’s hiring of Keith proved
                    invaluable: while I had prior knowledge of the area from a research trip to the
                    Wordsworth Trust archives years earlier, Keith knew the history and geography
                    intimately, was an experienced fell walker, and was immediately popular with the
                    students for his humor and colorful anecdotes. Since study abroad should
                    encourage as much immersion in local histories and cultures as possible, having
                    a local guide on staff was an instructive addition.  </p>
                <p>On our first full day in Keswick, Keith led us on an engaging walk from Greta
                    Hall along the Greta River, through Lower and Upper Fitz Park, and a short climb
                    to Latrigg and Windy Brow cottage, William and Dorothy’s home (thanks to William
                    Calvert) in 1794. Though the prospects from Windy Brow are not quite as open as
                    in the Wordsworths’ day, the view is still impressive, providing the perfect
                    opportunity to talk about the importance of William and Dorothy’s “pilgrimage,”
                    as they themselves termed it, to this modest home together, and recalling
                    Dorothy’s own description of the view at the time: <quote>This vale is
                        terminated on one end by a huge pile of grand mountains in whose lap the
                        lovely lake of Derwent is placed, at the other end by the lake of
                        Bassenthwaite, on one side Skiddaw towers sublime and on the other a range
                        of mountains not of equal size but of much grandeur, and the middle part of
                        the vale is of beautiful cultivated grounds interspersed with cottages and
                        watered by a winding stream [the Derwent] which runs between the lakes of
                        Derwent and Bassenthwaite. (qtd. in Newlyn 27)</quote> Later, we were
                    treated to a different angle of the view of Derwent valley and the southern vale
                    toward Thirlmere and Grasmere from the Castlerigg Stone Circle above Keswick. At
                    this point the views back to Skiddaw become more extensive, and Keith regaled
                    the students with the story of the raucous Southey/Wordsworth party atop Skiddaw
                    in 1815 to celebrate the fall of Napoleon.</p>
                <p>Throughout the week, Keith led short hikes to other notable spots of time and
                    place: Blea Tarn, where we saw the “Solitary’s” cottage and where Keith and I
                    took turns reading aloud the sections from <title level="m">The
                        Excursion</title> describing the tarn and the Solitary’s life; Dungeon Ghyll
                    Force in Langdale, where Keith read “The Idle Shepherd Boys”; Easedale, where we
                    discussed the George and Sarah Green story and talked about the composition of
                        <title level="m">The Prelude</title>; the shores of Ullswater, where I led a
                    discussion of “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud”; Aira Force above Gowbarrow Park,
                    where I read Wordsworth’s short poem on the waterfall; and Buttermere, for a
                    leisurely stroll around the lake and a drink in the pub where the famous Maid of
                    Buttermere once served the gawking tourists in Wordsworth’s day. </p>
                <p>Keith’s mountain savvy proved particularly welcome on the short but steep climb
                    to Dungeon Ghyll. As R. Paul Yoder discusses in his essay for this issue, most of
                    my students, too, experienced surprising difficulty with the walking, something
                    I will keep in mind for future iterations of the program. In the case of Dungeon
                    Ghyll, not only is the initial climb steep and on a rugged trail, but the force
                    itself can only be viewed by a fairly precipitous climb <emph>down</emph> into
                    the ravine cut by the beck, which is overarched with trees: only by climbing
                    down can you then look straight up the gorge to the water plunging beneath the
                    bridge of rock the idle shepherds dare each other to cross. The view is worth
                    seeing, especially for students of Romanticism, but the terrain is challenging
                    enough to give any instructor disturbing visions of insurance claims and
                    parental lawsuits. Keith and our Furness driver, Dave, insisted that students
                    climb down one at a time, see the view, then climb back up, all with their
                    assistance. They personally guided each student down and back before taking the
                    next, insuring the safety of each. The students were thrilled. They still talk
                    about it as one of their favorite days on the trip and they keep joking about
                    creating “I Survived Dungeon Ghyll Force” t-shirts. I have included a photo of
                    Keith Richardson reading “The Idle Shepherd-Boys” to the group, the dark depths
                    of Dungeon Ghyll behind and below him, into which the students would soon
                    descend.</p>

                <p>It is not my charge in this essay to describe our entire itinerary in detail, but
                    I do want to dwell for a moment on the high point of the course for everyone,
                    our “immersion” day at the Wordsworth Trust in Grasmere. This was where the
                    rubber really met the road in terms of the students’ scholarly engagement with
                    the archival material of the Wordsworth circle and the sights—and even tastes—of
                    Wordsworthian life in Dove Cottage and Rydal Mount; it is also a day that proved
                    the great value of having booked with TPO and being provided with a co-director,
                    who had arranged everything for us in advance. </p>
                <p>As the Wordsworth Trust curator, Jeff Cowton, explained at the NASSR session that
                    gave rise to this pedagogy issue, the Trust can provide customized immersion
                    experiences of one or several days (even longer) for student groups, and I can
                    recommend the activity highly. Our group worked with a Trust staff scholar all
                    morning on several manuscripts and textual issues, a revelatory experience for
                    my students, none of whom had extensive prior archival training. We then ate our
                    packed lunch (from Greta Hall) in the gardens and toured the Wordsworth museum
                    on our own. After lunch, the same Trust scholar led us on a personalized tour of
                    Dove Cottage and a stunning walk over the old Coffin Trail to Rydal Mount for an
                    hour or so in the house and grounds, followed by a leisurely stroll along the
                    far bank of Rydal Water and back to Dove Cottage. While we were at Rydal, the
                    Trust staff had prepared a meal in Dove Cottage from the Wordsworths’ recipe
                    book for our return, which we ate in the downstairs parlor in the gorgeous early
                    evening light; as Ghislaine McDayter discusses in her essay for this issue, food
                    can and should be a part of experiencing cultural nuances and differences, and
                    eating a typical meal the Wordsworths themselves would have served—potted trout,
                    homemade bread, local cheese, potato-and-leek soup—enriched the students’
                    understanding and appreciation for Romantic-period life in the vale. While we
                    ate, Jeff Cowton talked about the Wordsworths’ life in the cottage and read a
                    few of William’s poems. He also talked about the death of John Wordsworth aboard
                    the Abergavenny, Sir George Beaumont’s famous painting of “Peele Castle in a
                    Storm,” and Wordsworth’s “Elegaic Stanzas” (as the painting, which depicts a
                    ship floundering in a storm, reminded Wordsworth of John’s death). He then led
                    us upstairs to where the painting hangs and had me read the poem while seated
                    beneath the painting in Wordsworth’s favorite chair, the one in which he often
                    read and composed. I have never seen my students so rapt. Jeff concluded this
                    amazing day with a walk in the steep terraced garden in back of the cottage,
                    where he had the students all ascend to the little hermitage Wordsworth built
                    and read a stanza each from Wordsworth’s “A Farewell,” in which he says goodbye
                    to the garden and prepares it for the arrival of Mary Hutchinson, who will soon
                    return with him as his wife. The eight stanzas of the poem worked out perfectly
                    for the eight students in the garden.</p>
                <p>The reason we had eight instead of nine is that one of the students had been
                    gravely ill with what was diagnosed as dehydration and lack of sleep, and this
                    is where I was again extremely grateful for my co-director. Early that morning
                    in Keswick we were able to split up, my co-director taking the students down to
                    Grasmere, Scott Ligertwood and I taking the sick student to the emergency room.
                    Fluids and bed rest were prescribed, and my wife looked after the student for
                    the rest of the afternoon, while I was able to take a cab to Grasmere to join up
                    with the rest of the group for lunch and the following activities. The
                    dehydrated student recovered nicely and was ready to go by the next morning.
                    While a thankfully minor event, the emergency room visit highlighted for me the
                    real benefit of working with TPO: superior organization and peace of mind.
                    Having another set of experienced boots on the ground eases things tremendously,
                    and one thing TPO is very good at—and I imagine this must hold true for most
                    commercial vendors of academic study-abroad programs—is ensuring the comfort,
                    health, and safety of all participants and being prepared for emergencies. It is
                    worth noting in this context that my co-director constantly checked weather
                    conditions each day and carried an impressive first-aid kit and other emergency
                    supplies on each day’s outing. I am not saying that safety cannot be maximized
                    on one’s own, of course, only that having a partner with local contacts and the
                    support of an entire organization with hefty international experience can be a
                    comfort. Having my co-director taking care of logistics in general freed me to
                    do what I wanted most, which was teach.</p>
                <p>All this support came with a price, of course, and while the benefits largely
                    outweighed the disadvantages, there were some frustrations working with TPO. For
                    one thing, mediating between TPO and my university proved time consuming and
                    added to the already thick layer of bureaucratic processes UTEP’s Study Abroad
                    office piles on both faculty and students. Using TPO meant negotiating a
                    contract with the university, which involved me in lengthy mediations between
                    TPO, my department chair, the dean, the Provost’s Office, the university legal
                    department, and the study-abroad coordinator, all of whom were supportive and
                    efficient, but the process was more involved than if I had been running the
                    program on my own. In addition, communication between the UTEP study-abroad
                    coordinator, TPO, and myself was not always clear, especially in the crucial
                    matter of airline reservations (unknown to me initially, the UTEP coordinator
                    insisted for some reason on handling airfare reservations, though TPO would have
                    provided that service, and through a series of miscommunications actually lost a
                    block of reserved tickets; we all ended up getting tickets on the same flights
                    regardless, but the initial loss of the reservations created a lot of stress for
                    some students). On the UK side, the very efficiency I so appreciated in my
                    co-director proved somewhat irksome to many of my students, who, a bit unfairly
                    in my opinion, chafed against her crisp adherence to schedule: she became the
                    unwitting bad cop to my good cop. </p>
                <p>Finally, the financial cost to the students of using TPO remains troubling.
                    Despite repeated requests, I have not been able yet to get a clear declaration
                    of what TPO actually charged for their services or of the itemized cost
                    breakdown for the program; they have only given me lump sums for lodging, meals,
                    and activity costs: one dollar amount for each of those broad categories. I do
                    not know, for example, how much of a group discount, if any, TPO was able to
                    secure for us with Greta Hall, The Wordsworth Trust, Furness of Keswick, or the
                    Pheasant Inn, and I am amazed that the UTEP legal office approved the contract
                    without such itemizations in advance (I have since learned that third-party
                    organizations do not typically itemize costs to the extent I desired). TPO
                    charged each student about $2700, excluding tuition and airfare, but including
                    most meals, all lodging, in-country transportation, activity costs, guides,
                    etc., for the ten-day trip. That is actually not horribly out of line with the
                    program costs of similar study-abroad trips other UTEP faculty have developed on
                    their own, as I understand them from anecdotal evidence and consultation with
                    the study-abroad office, but it is much higher than, say, the cost of Paul
                    Yoder’s trip, over a commensurate period of time, as described in his essay for
                    this issue. My feeling is that in many ways the experience and service TPO
                    provides are worth the costs, but knowing in greater detail how those costs are
                    actually distributed and what, precisely, the company charges for their services
                    would be helpful for future planning. </p>
                <p>When all was said and done, the students were given a first-rate experience
                    (several of my students have repeatedly described it to me as a “dream trip”)
                    with luxurious accommodations; worry-free, pre-paid transportation in country;
                    and an impressive range of superbly guided activities related to the theme of
                    the relationship of landscape and environment to Romantic literature. For my
                    part, using TPO meant I could concentrate most on the pedagogical aims of the
                    course rather than on the logistical details my co-director managed so ably, and
                    that I had someone who could provide expert help in the event of an emergency.
                    If the metaphor of “herding cats” is apt for leading a study abroad—and I think
                    it is—then using a third-party vendor gives one another helpful wrangler or two,
                    though at a cost, unfortunately, to the students. My students were eligible for
                    study abroad scholarships and modest stipends from the college to help offset
                    those costs, but I believe if universities are serious about encouraging the
                    outsourcing of study abroad planning to third-party providers, they should
                    consider underwriting some of that extra cost.</p>
