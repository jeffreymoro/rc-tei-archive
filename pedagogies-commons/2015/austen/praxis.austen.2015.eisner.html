            <p class="noCount">This essay describes an advanced undergraduate course on “Jane Austen and the Gothic.”
               Breaking with a literary-historical narrative of development in which Austen corrects
               the Gothic’s excess, the course interspersed a selection of Austen’s novels with Gothic
               fiction of the 1780s and 90s to explore what these works share, and what their differences
               could prompt students to see about Austen’s fiction, about the Gothic, and about novels
               and novel reading in general. Reading Austen with the Gothic helped highlight the
               uneasiness and “agitation” permeating Austen’s evocations of apparently ordered social
               worlds, and helped students understand disordering moments in both Austen and the
               Gothic through a shared network of formal and ideological concerns linking political
               and social debates to questions of narrative and the representation of character.
               As the course played out, the striking diversity of student responses to Austen and
               to the Gothic—responses shaped in part by the divergent afterlives of Austen and the
               Gothic in today’s popular culture—focused our discussion in surprising ways not only
               on the social and epistemological value accorded different genres and modes of writing,
               but also on the kinds of privilege accorded different modes of reading (for example,
               fast or slow, compulsive or disciplined, credulous or skeptical), both in the Romantic
               period and in our own classroom practice. </p>

            </header><br/><div class="epigraph"><span class="quote">‘“The storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even than the wind,
                  which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The very curtains of her bed seemed
                  at one moment in motion, and at another the lock of her door was agitated, as if by
                  the attempt of somebody to enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery,
                  and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans.” 
                  <div class="indent2">(Jane Austen, <em>Northanger Abbey, </em>117)</div>’</span></div>
            <p>So, in <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, Austen parodies the Gothic thrillers Catherine Morland has been reading, sends up
               the Gothic’s deluded and sleepless readers, and at the same time indulges in the fun.
               The conjunctions and disjunctions between Austen’s fiction and the machinations of
               the Gothic tale formed the basis of the advanced undergraduate course, “Jane Austen
               and the Gothic,” I designed and taught in 2008. Cross-listed in English and Women’s
               Studies, the course juxtaposed a selection of Austen’s novels with representative
               Gothic fiction of the 1780s and 90s to explore what these works might share, and what
               their differences could help students see about Austen’s fiction, about the Gothic,
               and about the various interests and pleasures of novel reading (and writing) in general.
               Breaking with the neat categories and sequences that often organize period surveys,
               the course was both challenging and exciting to teach—not least because, in ways I
               hadn’t anticipated at the start of the semester, I found myself making new connections
               along with my students, and thinking about the wider field of writing along new lines.
               In what follows, I outline the rationale behind the course, how I structured it, and
               what I learned as I taught.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The idea to offer a course on Austen and the Gothic arose in part from the historicist
                  impulse that Patricia Matthew and Miriam Wallace see motivating many courses on Romantic-era
                  fiction (par. 1). Linking Austen with the Gothic returns her novels to important aspects
                  of the discursive contexts in which they were produced and initially read. On one
                  level, the course aimed to take account of the Gothic’s prominence in the literary
                  landscape in which Austen’s habits of reading and writing took shape: if the heyday
                  of the Gothic predates the publication of her novels, it coincides with her first
                  forays into novel-writing in the 1790s. Helped by the work of such critics as Marilyn
                  Butler, Mary Poovey, and Claudia Johnson, I hoped students would see that both Austen’s
                  fiction and Gothic novels of the 1780s and 90s respond to a social world in transformation,
                  participating in the cultural debates swirling around key institutions—marriage, the
                  family, patriarchal authority, property transmission.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Recently Nancy Armstrong has written about the connection between the Gothic and property
                           transmission in Austen: in her account, Austen’s fiction goes Gothic when the link
                           between property and personhood is disrupted (237).</span></div>
                  </div> Austen’s fiction and the Gothic novel alike experiment with new forms for representing
                  subjectivity, and test the relationship of individual desire to social forms; both
                  foreground the role of feeling in organizing or disturbing individual and social bodies.
                  Teaching Austen with the Gothic additionally offers students a way into the era’s
                  debates over the social role and social effects of the novel and novel-reading, and
                  into the contest between “real life and manners” and “romance” central to the theorization
                  of the novel underway in the period.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To be sure, one might map out this shared terrain in courses configured under other
                  rubrics: “Romantic Fiction,” or “Austen and her Contemporaries,” “Literature of Sensibility,”
                  or even “Gothic Novels,” say. Plus or minus a novel or two, our reading list— works
                  by Charlotte Smith, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Helen Maria
                  Williams. along with <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, and <em>Persuasion</em>—might well have fit comfortably under any of these titles. To my mind, though, my
                  own rubric offered two key advantages. First, I hoped the apparent opposition between
                  Austen’s controlled realism and the Gothic’s extravagance could function as a useful
                  heuristic to get students thinking about questions of genre and mode comparatively.
                  Second, and more crucially, I wanted to capitalize on the recognition factor both
                  Austen and the Gothic hold for readers (and viewers) today.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I deliberately avoided using the terms “Romantic” or “Romantic-era” in my title. My
                           thinking was that these terms might either perform a leveling function (reducing everything
                           we read to iterations of “Romanticism”) or interfere with students’ response to what
                           they read (if they were importing notions of what “Romantic” could mean). By the same
                           token, I wanted to resist letting the Gothic stand as simply another name for the
                           Romantic. As the course progressed, I found we did not require the terminology of
                           Romanticism to accomplish the pedagogical goals I had in mind. </span></div>
                  </div> Austen’s status as cultural icon and her moment as hot Hollywood property coexist
                  with the Gothic’s continuing power as a cultural mode: the Gothic novelists of the
                  late eighteenth century may not themselves be widely read anymore, but the sensibility
                  and the forms they helped launch live on, and they do so as part of a self-conscious
                  tradition. If, in one sense, my course directed students to the reading world Austen
                  herself inhabited, then the course at the same time forced the question of how and
                  why both Austen and the Gothic have enjoyed such different, but equally spectacular,
                  cultural afterlives. Combining the canonical power of Austen with the <em>frisson </em>of the Gothic—or somewhat theatrically contrasting the two—not only turned out to
                  be a potent draw for students (a good thing if you are under pressure to meet enrollment
                  targets), it proved a pedagogically productive experiment as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In our opening discussions, I was surprised to find how many of the students arrived
                  already holding fairly firm views on what reading Austen and reading the Gothic would
                  be like, whether or not they had actually read much of either. We had a few self-professed
                  Janeites who’d been reading her devotedly since high school or before, and a number
                  of these expressed serious skepticism about the Gothic. We had some fans of Gothic
                  fiction—at least in its more recent manifestations—some of whom volunteered (eyes
                  rolling) that they were willing to wade through some Austen if it got them to some
                  juicy Gothic novels, but that didn’t mean they weren’t going to like it. Several students
                  announced themselves as participants in fan or fan fiction communities organized around
                  Austen or the Gothic or both.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)

                           Book Club.”</span></div>
                  </div> But even those more catholic or agnostic in their tastes—including the significant
                  number of students who had read neither a single Austen novel nor a single work of
                  Gothic fiction—seemed puzzled by the course title, which they took as downright oxymoronic:
                  what could the world of “ladylike” Jane Austen, which they pictured as all period
                  dresses and clever repartee, possibly have to do with the Gothic, by which they understood
                  (not incorrectly) sex, crime and madness? Though when I taught this course, in 2008, <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> (2009) was still a year away, that title describes essentially the way my students
                  understood my own course title: that spoof (like the whole franchise it has spawned)
                  plays on the same sense of mashing up incongruities, mixing the decorous with the
                  degraded, my students anticipated.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)

                  </div>

            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I do not mean to present my students’ expectations as naïve, nor simply as misjudgments
                  to be corrected. They gave voice to what Clara Tuite describes as Austen’s “canonicity
                  effects,” “modes of cultural affect which serve specific functions within and investments
                  of literary culture,” interlinking concepts of formal mastery, class privilege, English
                  cultural heritage, and the romantic marriage plot (2). This is the “safe” Austen,
                  as Deidre Lynch puts it, dominant in cinematic and television adaptations of the past
                  several decades (Lynch “Introduction” 5). Austen scholarship over those same decades—especially
                  historicist, feminist and queer readings of her fiction—suggests many avenues for
                  challenging the straightforward identification of Austen’s fiction with these values,
                  and this course was designed to open up such alternative ways of reading Austen.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See, for example, Johnson, Tuite, and Heydt-Stevenson. </span></div>
                  </div> Rather than immediately dismissing my students’ received take on Austen, however,
                  I asked them to see it as a cultural formation, and to think about what cultural needs
                  this construction of Austen answers, whose interests it serves (Lynch “Introduction”
                  5). This moved our discussion to processes of reception and canon formation, and gave
                  me an opportunity to explain (drawing on the terrific collection of essays in Lynch’s
                  volume <em>Janeites</em>) that the cultural meanings of Austen have not always looked as stable and self-evident
                  as they might now; rather, they emerged through a long, complex, and varied reception
                  history.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Still, the relationship between Austen and the Gothic articulated by my students parallels
                  a developmental narrative often embedded in standard literary histories as well as
                  in our syllabi, perhaps especially in survey courses. In this narrative, Austen’s
                  writing marks the point at which the English novel straightens out and grows up. We
                  pit Austen’s maturity against the Gothic’s adolescent acting-out, or else, somewhat
                  contradictorily, Austen’s modernity against the Gothic’s old-fashioned weirdness,
                  and we produce this relationship in part just by assigning Austen after the Gothic,
                  or reading excerpts from Radcliffe as we teach <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, so that it appears Austen comes along to correct what comes before.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                           (6)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Clifford Siskin argues that Austen’s formal choices, along with her methods of publication
                           and presentation, not only perform her difference from the novel as she received it,
                           but also collude with the language of her earliest critics to represent that difference
                           as an advance in the developmental terms I have outlined (193–209). Siskin sees this
                           as a watershed moment in the development of the modern idea of "literature" itself
                           (205).</span></div>
                  </div> This developmental narrative often describes an ethical as well technical advance,
                  paralleled in turn by the maturation plots of her novels. According to this story,
                  in other words, where the Gothic functions like the unconscious, Austen acts as the
                  ego ideal: in this version of things, if the Gothic shows us who we fear we were,
                  or are, Austen shows us who we want to become.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To help imagine alternatives to such a developmental narrative and the typecast roles
               it assigns, my course partially dispensed with chronological sequence, instead alternating
               between Gothic novels and Austen’s fiction. We opened, not unconventionally, with
               Radcliffe’s <em>The Italian</em> (1797), followed by <em>Northanger Abbey</em> (1818). But we then went back to Lewis’s <em>The Monk</em> (1796) and Wollstonecraft’s <em>Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman </em> (1798), before reading <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1811) and watching the Ang Lee film (1995). Late in the semester, we tackled Smith’s
               <em>Emmeline, or the Orphan of the Castle </em>(1788), concluding with <em>Persuasion </em>(1818) and a final viewing session for some episodes of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> (1997-2003), the TV series whose sensibility merges dark, suburban Gothic with Austenian
               wit, irony and romance. While the syllabus thus exploited anachronistic conjunctions,
               one could argue such anachronism is built into much of Austen’s fiction already—integral
               to all her novels that began life in earlier versions in the 1790s, though most obvious
               in the case of <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, which is introduced in Austen’s advertisement as a text from an earlier day.</p>
            <p>I confess I walked out of that first class feeling fairly nervous about what might
               lie in store: would half the class just trash whatever we were reading in a given
               week? As the course played out, however, my students’ divided initial responses proved
               an excellent starting point for our discussions. What surprised me over the course
               of the semester was not just the richness of the connections students were able to
               draw on their own across the texts we read (e.g., in linking and comparing heroines—<em>The Italian</em>’s Ellena, Catherine Morland, Wollstonecraft’s Maria, Marianne Dashwood, Emmeline,
               Anne Elliot—or male leads—Henry Tilney, <em>Maria</em>’s Darnford, Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, Emmeline’s suitors Delamere and Godolphin,
               William Elliot, Frederick Wentworth, and so on), but also how our sustained experience
               with the Gothic shifted what we looked for in Austen, and how we saw it. Juxtaposed
               as they were, Austen and the Gothic could, in a sense, read one another. Repeatedly
               turning to Austen from the Gothic brought into sharper relief the unease and instability
               troubling Austen’s evocations of ordered social worlds—especially in the form of alternative
               or marginalized plotlines (for example, the doubled Elizas in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>), or in occasions of suspense, where anxiety can be oppressively intense for characters
               and for the reader, and where deranging outcomes feel all too likely. This changed
               how my students understood Austen’s marriage plot: instead of taking for granted the
               inevitability of narrative closure, students were more willing to imagine the situations
               of dispossession, powerlessness, danger or simply open-ended waiting in which Austen’s
               female characters often find themselves as situations from which there may indeed
               be no magical rescue. We could see the novels emphasizing forms of disconnection as
               much as forms of community.</p>
            <p>Moreover, turning to Austen from the Gothic and back again had the effect of denaturalizing
               Austen’s realism. Categories of reader response associated with the Gothic—suspense,
               horror, anxiety, fascination, boredom, laughter, disgust—became central to our discussions
               of Austen, too. Gothic novels, we noticed, never let the reader forget she’s reading
               a book: they are full of obtrusive indices of materiality and textuality. By contrast,
               I’d had trouble in the past getting students to think of Austen’s fiction as anything
               other than a transparent representation of reality. Coming back to Austen from the
               Gothic, however, we were better positioned to ask what Austen does differently so
               that our immersion in the narrative world she creates goes uninterrupted, to see that
               it takes particular strategies (free indirect discourse, irony, appeals to common
               sense and common situations, and so forth) to make this happen. Not only in <em>Northanger Abbey,</em> but across her fiction, students were attuned to the way Austen repurposes literary
               conventions (for example, in landscape prospects, or in epistolary exchanges) and
               they could now read these elements of the novel in sophisticated ways. Mary Favret’s
               <em>Romantic Correspondence</em> proved especially helpful in tracking the function of reading and writing letters
               in Austen’s fiction against the backdrop of sentimental convention.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Moving between Austen and the Gothic also helped us think in productive ways about
                  Austen’s representations of consciousness and interiority. The Gothic’s representations
                  of emotional extremity and psychic fragmentation sensitized us to the language of
                  “agitation” and anxiety permeating Austen’s fiction. In the Gothic, the boundary between
                  the self and what lies outside it is characteristically dissolved: the self projects
                  itself into the world, or the other invades the self. Where Romantic-era Gothic typically
                  diagnoses the breakdown of social bonds by isolating subjectivities, shrinking the
                  possibilities for social interaction, Austen’s comedies of manners obviously work
                  in the opposite direction, examining the fraying of social bonds by looking at moments
                  of dissonance among a circle of interacting characters, and imagining the repair of
                  bonds in groups knit together by sympathetic understanding. Her narrative imperatives
                  require, however, the differentiation of her heroines from social worlds that can’t
                  keep pace with their strength of imagination or desire, producing a gap between the
                  self and social reality that can feel Gothic in force. Like the Gothic, too, Austen
                  often dramatizes inwardness by focusing on the permeability of the boundary between
                  inside and outside.

                  </div> The claustrophobia Austen’s heroines frequently experience—necessary to produce their
                  distinction from their social worlds—might evoke parallels for students with the claustrophobic

            </div>
            <p>As we read, the balance of value among these works shifted in surprising ways. The
               Gothic was no longer just “context” or background, and the fact that some students
               <em>preferred </em>the Gothic to Austen’s brand of realism allowed for productive discussions about how
               and why we value certain kinds of texts, and about the privilege we accord to certain
               modes of reading. Austen (we always say) schools us in reading reflectively, with
               an appreciation for subtleties and precision of language, where re-reading moves us
               toward a revised understanding and greater clarity. Austen models the skeptical, recursive
               close reading our discipline—and especially our classroom practice—makes central.
               By contrast, the Gothic solicits reading as voracious consumption, propelled by curiosity;
               when you get to the end of the novel, you’re not expected to re-read, you look for
               the next book. Coleridge pinpoints exactly this feature of the Gothic in his 1794
               review of <em>Mysteries of Udolpho</em>: <span class="quote">‘Curiosity is raised oftener than it is gratified; or rather, it is raised so high
                  that no adequate gratification can be given it; the interest is completely dissolved
                  when once the adventure is finished, and the reader, when he is got to the end of
                  the work, looks about in vain for the spell which had bound him so strongly to it.
                  (par. 1)’</span> Led by student responses to the novels we were reading, our class discussions ended
               up canvassing this dichotomous sorting of readerly attitude. This, in turn, raised
               a series of questions I tried to negotiate as I taught. How well do these opposed
               models of reading describe what happens in readers’ actual practice? What are our
               actual investments (pedagogic or scholarly) in these models of reading? How might
               such an opposition between “close reading” and enthralled, compulsive reading block
               access to a more nuanced, more useful phenomenology of reading?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Certainly, as I told my students, I think the Gothic texts we were studying reward
                  close and careful reading (and re-reading). Not all of my students were spell-bound
                  by these Gothic fictions, of course, and I don’t want to minimize the challenge in
                  teaching them. Students can use a lot of help getting through long, strange, convoluted
                  novels like <em>The Monk </em>or <em>Emmeline</em>, both in simply holding onto the thread of the narrative and in knowing when to slow
                  down and read more closely (I ended up distributing chapter-by-chapter notes for <em>The Italian</em>, <em>The Monk</em> and <em>Emmeline</em>, avoiding plot summary but guiding students to significant passages and making key
                  narrative developments explicit). Still, as I’ve been suggesting, many of them did
                  report really getting carried away, especially by <em>The Italian </em>and <em>The Monk</em>. I cherish an e-mail I got early in the semester from one student, a talented close
                  reader: she acknowledged that the reading assignments are long, “but generally,” she
                  continued, sounding a little like Catherine Morland, “my problem has been stopping
                  at the assigned reading. It's hard not to get into these books. […] I robbed myself
                  of several hours of sleep last night reading <em>The Monk</em> almost to the end” (Fix). One of the pleasures of teaching this course was hearing
                  this kind of response, and I mention it partly as encouragement to those teachers
                  thinking about assigning some of these Gothic works. At the same time, one of the
                  challenges of the course—one I can’t claim to have solved to my satisfaction—was figuring
                  out how to talk about this kind of response in the classroom, besides simply welcoming
                  it with relief. All our training tells us to try to get students to slow down, to
                  linger over words; what then do we do with texts that impel readers to speed up? As
                  Rita Felski observes, and as my experience teaching this course brought home to me,
                  our discipline has a surprisingly impoverished vocabulary for talking critically (in
                  the classroom, or in our scholarship) about modes of non-detached reading without
                  lapsing into either platitudes or castigation (2). While we didn’t arrive at a solution
                  to this problem, the course at least succeeded in moving these questions out into
                  the open for me as well as for my students.

            <p>As we talked about their responses to these texts and considered how they worked towards
               or against ideals of “close reading,” I tried to get students to think about the formal
               features that encourage rapid, absorbed reading, and to think about what makes terror
               or sensation a source of pleasure for readers. We approached these questions in part
               historically through eighteenth-century theories of terror writing, including Anna
               and John Aikin’s “On the Pleasure Derived From Objects of Terror,” and period reviews.
               Coleridge’s reviews of Radcliffe and Lewis take the form of elaborate reflections
               on, or theories of, affective readerly response and how it is generated. Comparing
               Gothic or sentimental writing with the new realism Austen’s fiction represents, Walter
               Scott’s review of <em>Emma</em> similarly distinguishes these genres in part on the basis of the different way each
               affects the reader. Scott’s review is especially interesting because, while it identifies
               Austen’s fiction as a singular break with the “old <em>régime</em>” (192) of the novel, it is far from a ringing endorsement of her realism. Instead,
               Scott holds open the space his own historical fiction will occupy, blending “romance”
               and “real life” and manners, and at the same time imagines a new nineteenth-century
               figure, the general reader, who turns with equal delight to realism or romance, but
               who goes to each for different kinds of pleasures (200).</p>
            <p>The Austen novels we were reading, of course, thematize forms of intense readerly
               attachment: Catherine Morland’s addictive reading of the Gothic; Marianne Dashwood’s
               overidentification with sentimental fiction; the many kinds of bookishness on display
               in <em>Persuasion</em>, such as Captain Benwick’s Byronism and Anne Elliot’s memory stored with poetry (Pinch).
               We discussed how and why the potentially dangerous effects of (too much) reading became
               such a charged topic in the period, and why the Gothic in particular focused cultural
               anxieties about reading: fears about the reader’s susceptibility to the contagion
               of feeling or ideas, about the reader’s loss of self-control or self-mastery, about
               who was reading (women, the lower classes), about the specter of a mass reading public,
               about the commodification of literature and the industrialization of literary production.
               As E. J. Clery suggests, the irrationalism of the Gothic seemed to many to mirror
               the irrationalism of the transfixed reading public, and in turn the irrationalism
               of commercial modernity more generally (148). I emphasized the emergence of the Gothic
               in the 1790s as a recognizable “system,” facilitated by the development of new techniques
               of publishing, marketing, and distribution, exemplified by the growth of circulating
               libraries and the innovations of William Lane’s Minerva Press. When Catherine Morland
               remarks that “something very shocking indeed, will soon come out in London” and Henry
               Tilney recognizes that she is expecting “nothing more dreadful than a new publication
               which is shortly to come out, in three duo-decimo volumes…with a frontispiece to the
               first, of two tombstones and a lantern,” the exchange draws attention to the regularity
               of this London-based system of production and its networks of distribution into the
               provinces (<em>NA </em>77-8). The Gothic system appeared to create a spiral of demand, where an ever-increasing
               flood of books only further intensified the desire of an insatiable reading public
               for more.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>That Eleanor mistakes Catherine’s meaning and instead understands her to be talking
                  about actual riots in London points to the ambivalent association between “terrorist
                  writing” and the decade’s fears about political unrest—between riots in the streets
                  and a “riot in the brain,” a persistent theme in our discussions.

                  </div> Are Gothic fictions destabilizing social forces like mobs in the street, or is the
                  Gothic an escape or distraction from the potential for real violence? Does the Gothic
                  channel anxieties about political unrest, or work to contain or defuse the tensions
                  that might give rise to insurrection? Excerpts from Edmund Burke along with contemporary
                  prints helped my students see how in the paranoid post-Revolutionary climate of the
                  1790s the language of Gothic terror infected political discourse; we also discussed
                  how Gothic fiction could be turned to explicitly political uses (as in <em>Maria </em>or Godwin’s <em>Caleb Williams</em>), and in any case inevitably took on political dimensions.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To get a sense for the Gothic as a contested category and to see how period discourse
               mapped different kinds of reading onto different kinds of readers, we looked at William
               Wordsworth’s denunciation (in his “Preface” to the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>) of the “degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation” generated by “frantic novels,
               sickly and stupid German Tragedies, and “deluges of idle and extravagant stories in
               verse,” a reading habit he connects with the simultaneously hyper-stimulating and
               deadening environment of urban mass culture (177). My students had no trouble locating
               the metaphors of disease and addiction Wordsworth uses to describe a sick social body,
               and easily followed the connection, articulated by Karen Swann among others, between
               Wordsworth’s attack and modern-day complaints about the addictive, stupefying effects
               of mass culture. We circled back then to think about how Wordsworth’s divisions between
               “high” and “low” culture and his alignment of these spheres with reflective and sensation-seeking
               modes of reading correlated with the kind of opposition the class had registered in
               our course title.</p>
            <p>Like Michael Gamer and Robert Miles, rather than stress the coherence of a Gothic
               “tradition” or “mode” represented by a catalogue of conventions, I presented the Gothic
               as a “shifting ‘aesthetic’” (Gamer 4) privileging certain processes or forces: destabilization,
               fragmentation, contagion and the breaking of boundaries, repetition and proliferation,
               totalization, abjection, exaggeration, concealment, the operation of uncanny or invisible
               agency. This more flexible understanding of the Gothic allowed us to track Gothic
               effects more widely and to think about how the Gothic produces those effects, rather
               than simply identifying static motifs. In background lectures, I sketched the rise
               of a taste for the Gothic in the eighteenth century, connecting it with the vogue
               for ruins; literate culture’s ambivalent fascination with the superstitious tales
               of oral, folk culture; and the romance of the wild, the primitive, and the outdated
               in a world of enlightened progress. We talked about how the Gothic’s fascination with
               the unknowable or the unspeakable contrasted with the drive in Austen’s novels towards
               clarity, visibility, and open communication. As one explanation for the Gothic’s popularity
               we could test out over the semester, I proposed Clery’s analysis of Gothic reading
               as granting a temporary illusion of control, as the anxieties produced by the apparent
               irrationalism of modernity “could be assuaged by binding them to a narrative repeated
               over and over with only minor variations” (153). I juxtaposed this historicist perspective
               on the Gothic as a function of consumer culture with a brief introduction to psychoanalytic
               perspectives on horror, drawing especially on Kristeva’s theory of abjection.</p>
            <p>I chose <em>The Italian </em>in preference to other Radcliffe novels as a (relatively) compact and classic example
               of “terrorist” writing at its 1790s peak. Students responded well to the novel (they
               were especially fascinated by the mysterious Schedoni). I found Gamer’s discussion
               of the Gothic as an interested, local deployment of broader cultural codes—sentimentality,
               the sublime—useful in thinking about how to help my students through the narrative.
               In their initial reading, I discovered, students often skipped over just those passages
               where Radcliffe most obviously engages such codes, such as in her lengthy landscape
               descriptions; to the students, such passages just felt tedious and unrelated to the
               plot. However, once students see that these passages look like departures from the
               plot precisely because Radcliffe really does go out of her way to call attention to
               specific non-narrative codes, they can recognize the work these passages are doing,
               and pick up on the deployment of the same codes in other novels. Anticipating Austen’s
               concerns with the management of information at the level of narrative technique and
               its circulation among characters through gossip or letters, I drew attention to the
               many instances of represented storytelling in <em>The Italian</em>, and the importance of the control of information both within the plot and as a device
               of suspense (for example, the servant Paulo’s narrative of the confessional of the
               Black Penitents [80-82], or Ellena’s attempt to read Vivaldi’s note in the convent,
               closely recalled in Catherine’s attempt to read what turns out to be the laundry list
               in <em>Northanger Abbey</em> [132]).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Turning to <em>Northanger Abbey</em> from <em>The Italian</em>, students quickly recognized Austen’s debt to the Gothic as well as her critique
                  of it. They were receptive to the argument that Austen does not simply reject Gothic
                  irrationality, but rather mobilizes its energies and resources to her own ends.

                  </div> As Claudia Johnson points out, <em>Northanger Abbey</em> “domesticates the Gothic,” showing how its dangers are not comfortably distant but
                  shockingly close to the English reader (47). The novel spotlights sources of real
                  terror in Catherine’s world: the aforementioned riots; tyrannical and mercenary authority
                  figures; invidious forms of social deception. And as George Levine argues, the Gothic
                  devices Austen parodies in fact move the plot towards an ending every bit as magical
                  as any romance. To set up discussion of these aspects of the novel, I assigned Johnson’s
                  chapter on the novel from <em>Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel</em> and Robert Hopkins’s “General Tilney and the Affairs of State: The Political Gothic
                  of <em>Northanger Abbey</em>,” both excerpted in the Norton Critical edition we used; Jillian Heydt-Stevenson’s
                  discussion of Catherine’s discovery of the linen inventory as an entry into the “Gothicized”
                  economies of the household worked very well also as a focus for discussion (Heydt-Stevenson
                  130-1). Levine’s accessible “Translating the Monstrous” would also make good secondary
                  reading for undergraduates.</p>

            <p>Given the interests of the course, I had anticipated that much of our discussion would
               focus on Catherine’s addictive reading and the curiosity it inspires. Instead, however,
               taking their cue in part from Johnson’s astute observation that Henry Tilney largely
               scripts Catherine’s “Radcliffean excesses” at the Abbey in advance (39), my students
               quickly brought our discussion around to Tilney himself and his self-appointed role
               as instructor, a topic that sparked pronounced (and productive) disagreement. My students
               took widely varying viewpoints both on how to locate Tilney’s voice in relation to
               Austen’s authorial perspective, and—a separate but related issue—on how to understand
               Tilney himself (charming, kind, and reasonable, or insufferable, bullying, and ineffectual).
               Since Tilney so prominently asserts his own authority as a reader, this debate proved
               an excellent way to try to calibrate Austen’s own take on novel reading, and it opened
               up avenues into the novel’s representation of masculinity more generally. Our discussion
               of Tilney’s pedantry led us naturally to the question of what, if anything, Catherine
               learns over the course of the novel, and how. Many of my students voiced skepticism
               about a straightforward narrative of Catherine’s maturation as a progress from delusion
               to accurate judgment of reality, wondering instead about alternative descriptions
               of the novel’s plot: is the Catherine so eager to marry Henry Tilney as deluded a
               reader as ever? Has Catherine’s “strange, unaccountable character” been properly redirected,
               or absorbed by an (exaggeratedly) conventional fiction (<em>NA </em>6)?</p>
            <p><em>The Monk</em>’s sheer strangeness as a novel, its length, and especially its digressions and inset
               narratives and poetry, can prove challenging in the classroom. Taking these digressions
               and fragmentations seriously by asking why they are included and what work they perform—especially
               the “Bleeding Nun” narrative—can in fact be a useful technique for getting at larger
               patterns or issues in the novel (I recommend Peter Brooks’s essay “Virtue and Terror”
               along these lines). Students were able to see the novel’s fragmentation and incoherence
               not as a failing but as an alternative, juxtaposed against the principles of coherence
               and closure governing Austen’s realism—and so understand those elements of Austen’s
               work both as artistically achieved (not simply given) and as interested (not simply
               neutral). The instructor also has an opportunity here to introduce engaging material
               from the many adaptations and repackagings the novel spawned, from hilariously condensed
               chapbook versions (<em>Almagro and Claude; or Monastic Murder; Exemplified by the Dreadful Doom of an Unfortunate
                  Nun </em>(1803)), to phantasmagoria set-pieces, to stage versions (<em>Aurelio and Miranda</em>, starring Kemble and Sarah Siddons, and a “Heroic Pantomime Ballet” of “Alonzo the
               Brave and the Fair Imogine” that ran more than a year at Sadler’s Wells) (Clery 144).
               That the novel’s pastiche form lends itself immediately to this kind of commercial
               reproduction, and in fact absorbs it, will be obvious.</p>
            <p>Since I’d already introduced students to the political climate of the 1790s through
               <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, they were able to place <em>The Monk</em> in this context easily as well. Excerpts from Helen Maria Williams’s <em>Letters Written in France</em> (1790) helped us connect the novel to representations of revolutionary spectacle
               and spectatorship. <em>The Monk</em> and <em>Maria </em>worked well read in succession, since both engage a post-Revolutionary discourse of
               sensibility (especially through the figure of the libertine), and both explore the
               potentially “anarchic” force of individual desire that, as Mary Poovey points out,
               Austen also contemplates through the figure of Marianne Dashwood (Poovey 101, 185-194).
               By the time we reached <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, students were well-prepared to recognize in “sensibility” a contested cultural system
               (Butler 192). <em>Maria</em>’s critique of marriage and Wollstonecraft’s analysis of the systematic, institutional
               logic of women’s dispossession prime students to understand the frustration and precariousness
               in Elinor and Marianne’s situation in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>: the real threat of an intolerably closed existence. With <em>Maria</em>’s exploration of mother-daughter relationships in mind, we focused on representations
               of the maternal in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>—its bustling cast of mothers a nice change of pace after all the villainous fathers
               we’d been discussing. Ang Lee’s film adaptation of the novel, together with Deborah
               Kaplan’s essay “Mass Marketing Jane Austen,” brought us back to the questions about
               contemporary constructions of Austenian romance with which we began.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Coming to <em>Emmeline</em> late in the semester, students had a good sense of what to look for in a novel that
                  might otherwise have been mystifying and confusing. They could recognize that while
                  many of the elements of later Gothic novels are already present—distressed orphan,
                  check; old castle, check; random acts of poetry-writing, check—this work of the 1780s
                  predates the more codified Gothic of novels like <em>The Italian</em> and <em>The Monk</em>, and characters and plot don’t fully conform to Gothic stereotype: the mode is still
                  in formation. Built around waiting for a considered attachment rather than rushing
                  into the marriage market, the novel, Smith’s first, offers many possible lines of
                  connection with <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> and <em>Persuasion </em>in particular. If Delamere (lauded by Austen as among the “first of men” in her <em>History of England </em>[<em>NA </em>201]) and Godolphin foreshadow many of Austen’s male leads, Adelina’s poetry-writing
                  and madness can be read against Marianne Dashwood’s story, whereas Emmeline’s emotional
                  responsiveness and autonomy look forward in some ways to Anne Elliot’s. There are
                  plot similarities too: as Loraine Fletcher notes in her excellent introduction to
                  the Broadview edition (a great teaching text), Emmeline and Anne both reject the suitor
                  with family connections and marry a naval officer instead (21). Reading the novel
                  together with some of Smith’s sonnets, we focused on the construction of Emmeline’s
                  interiority though her solitary reveries and her sympathetic imagination, and the
                  almost magical power her ability to feel deeply seems to grant her. My students were
                  intrigued by all the rivalries between men in the book, and the way they constantly
                  threaten to derail the heterosexual courtship plot. The obviousness with which Smith
                  doles out rewards and punishments at the novel’s end makes for a good lesson in how
                  novelistic closure performs ideological work: what values or social positions are
                  vindicated and what values or social positions are criticized by the novel at the
                  end? How does the ending of the novel rearrange or reinforce social or power relations?
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
                           (11)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I would like to thank my colleague Deborah Kaplan for suggesting I assign Emmeline
                           in this course.</span></div>
                  </div>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Despite the connections with <em>Emmeline</em> I’ve mentioned, <em>Persuasion </em>felt in some ways like a significant departure from the novels I’ve been discussing.
               There’s nothing remotely Gothic about Kellynch Hall, and in the end, the old manor
               neither witnesses a triumphant return of the rightful owner, nor falls down (the other
               Gothic outcome for old houses). Mr. Elliot may be as dissolute and calculating as
               any Gothic villain— “a designing, wary, cold-blooded being...black at heart, hollow
               and black!” (132)—but the threat he poses Anne isn’t ever as immediate. Where novels
               like <em>The Monk </em>warn against the dangers of individual will unmoored from social structures and traditional
               roles (Brooks), <em>Persuasion </em>seems to celebrate that possibility. In its close, shifting away from the inheritance
               plot to a world where people rent rather than own their houses, the novel signals
               a shift in terrain and mode for the anxiety conjured by Gothic fictions. The terror
               attached to specific spaces in the Gothic is diffused into the less locatable, but
               perhaps less containable, anxiousness of everyday life.</p>
            <p>Teaching this class has encouraged me to experiment with setting up similar collisions
               among heterogeneous groups of novels to energize other courses I teach. In a British
               Romanticism graduate seminar, for example, where in the past I’d usually taught one
               or two novels along with poetry of the period—and those novels the usual suspects,
               typically Austen and/or Mary Shelley—I interspersed our reading in poetry with Maria
               Edgeworth’s <em>Castle Rackrent</em> (1800), Charlotte Dacre’s <em>Zofloya, or the Moor </em>(1806), Scott’s <em>Guy Mannering</em> (1815), and <em>Persuasion</em>. This was a rewarding move, and not only because my students found these novels a
               lot of fun to read. Making such jumps among novels and such leaps between genres,
               students can gain an exciting sense of the heterogeneity of a Romantic-era literary
               field characterized by forceful but radically differing claims for what literature
               can or should be.</p>

               thinking was that these terms might either perform a leveling function (reducing everything
               we read to iterations of “Romanticism”) or interfere with students’ response to what
               they read (if they were importing notions of what “Romantic” could mean). By the same
               token, I wanted to resist letting the Gothic stand as simply another name for the
               Romantic. As the course progressed, I found we did not require the terminology of

               but also collude with the language of her earliest critics to represent that difference
               as an advance in the developmental terms I have outlined (193–209). Siskin sees this
