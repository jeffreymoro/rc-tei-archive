            <p rend="noCount">In this introduction to the collection of essays, Looser and
               Friedman discuss the history of and the state of the scholarship of teaching
               Jane Austen, a surprisingly underdeveloped area of study, given Austen's
               ubiquity in the English curriculum at the college level.

            <p>“Is Jane Austen out of date for the classroom?” asked a British Council weblog entry
               in August 2013. The blogger, Chris Lima, answers immediately “no,” but her response
               follows an eye-catching photo of a woman holding up an exquisitely made teapot-shaped
               cookie, decorated with Austen’s supposed silhouette. The photo is captioned, “You
               don't have to bribe your students with Jane Austen tea cookies to get them to read
               her books.” At first glance, this short essay could be mistaken for a tongue-in-cheek
               article from <title level="j">The Onion</title>. </p>
            <p>The questioning of Austen’s fashionability or relevance for the classroom, however,
               appears to be entirely in earnest. Lima argues that Austen’s language is not as
               inaccessible to students as we might think, that her themes are still relevant, and
               that using the film adaptations such as the 1995 BBC <title level="m">Pride and
                  Prejudice</title> to help with contextualization offers a useful classroom tool.
               Lima, who teaches Austen at the University of Leicester, concludes, “The novel
                  [<title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>] is so popular around the world that
               the vast majority [of students] are quite familiar with the story and the characters
               and by the end of the course I feel they have created a quite strong connection with
               the book.” One might be tempted to ask if this is true with or without the tea
               cookies.</p>
            <p>What is startling about this feature on the UK’s premier international cultural
               organization’s website goes far beyond the question of bribes and cookies. It seems
               strange that the teaching of Austen today would be framed in such a defensive way,
               particularly just after the announcement that her face would be featured on the £10
               note. If Austen isn’t out of date for currency, shouldn’t we start with the
               assumption that she is also perfectly current for the college curriculum? </p>
            <p>Perhaps the question posed means to interrogate whether Austen <emph>has
                  currency</emph> among younger people, those of traditional college age. If so, the
               answer is even clearer. The popular vlog, <title level="j">The Lizzie Bennet
                  Diaries</title>, demonstrates Austen’s strong positioning among so-called classic
               authors in emerging new media and youth culture, at least among girls (Green and Su).
               Students may no longer know that Colin Firth played Mr. Darcy in the BBC <title
                  level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> (1995), as Donna Parsons argues in her essay
               in this special issue, but many do know that Lizzie of the Emmy Award Winning series
               is a modern-day, updated version of Austen’s nineteenth-century heroine. </p>
            <p>What the British Council’s blog post may reveal is that our conversations about
               teaching Austen remain in a rather fledgling state, especially given how often she is
               included on college or postsecondary (and, to a lesser extent, high school or
               secondary) syllabi in the US, Canada, and the UK. Are we really still in the position
               of needing to educate fellow educators about whether Austen’s themes are relevant?
               That would seem to be “How to Teach Jane Austen” on training wheels. Scholarship on
               Austen has developed by leaps and bounds over the past forty years, but the
               scholarship of teaching Austen has merely inched forward during this period. We hope
               that our special issue will join an outpouring of new, more sophisticated scholarship
               of <emph>teaching</emph> Austen.</p>
            <p>The essays collected here describe curricular ideas, innovations, and practices that
               seek to move us beyond simple questions of Austen’s accessibility, relevance, and
               context. The contributors (whose essays began as presentations in two linked
               “Teaching Jane Austen” sessions at the Modern Language Association Convention in
               Boston in January 2013) ask how we might enrich the teaching of Austen’s fiction by
               seeing her in conversation with manuscript culture, children’s literature, Harry
               Potter, or Romantic poetry. Collectively, these essays look to what it means to teach
               Austen in many kinds of classes and classrooms, with differently-located learners,
               and with a variety of texts, tools, and assignments. Although all of us teach at the
               college level in North America, many of us also seek to explore what it means to
               teach Austen in a global context and in alternative educational contexts—both hers
               and our own—as her reach has become virtually worldwide (Dryden). </p>
            <p>Four substantial books and dozens of essays about teaching Austen have been published over the
               past fifty years. These are joined by copious web-based materials, many hosted by
               publishing companies. The four books remain valuable ones. Marcia McClintock Folsom’s
               three edited collections in the “MLA Approaches to Teaching” series, <title level="m"
                  >Approaches to Teaching Austen’s</title> Pride and Prejudice (1993), <title
                  level="m">Approaches to Teaching Austen’s</title> Emma (2004), and <title
                  level="m">Approaches to Teaching Austen’s</title> Mansfield Park (2014) include
               valuable information about editions, criticism, and strategies for discussion. They
               feature essays that illuminate various approaches to the novel. Even so, only the new
                  <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> volume benefits from the most up to date
               scholarship, film adaptations, and other popular phenomena: the <title level="m"
                  >Emma</title> volume is now a decade old and her <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> volume is now
               more than twenty years old. One additional limitation to books in the series is that
               their focus must necessarily be on strategies for teaching a single Austen text, not
               on teaching an Austen-centered course or on teaching her other writings.</p>
            <p>As strong as they are, none of Folsom’s edited volumes sets out to do more than dip
               into the filmic, print, or stage adaptations and sequels for their potential uses in
               the Austen classroom. For those interested in such an approach, Louise Flavin’s
                  <title level="m">Jane Austen in the Classroom: Viewing the Novel / Reading the
                  Film </title>(2004) offers an alternative place to begin. Flavin describes the
               possibilities for teaching Austen in an image-rich environment, in which issues of
               originality, adaptation, and interpretation are brought to the fore. Flavin’s book,
               too, is now a decade old. These three titles have been foundational to the
               scholarship of teaching Austen at the college level.</p>
            <p>Dozens of articles on the subject preceded these books. (NOTE TO THE READER: We have
               identified more than 60 print and online sources related to the teaching of Austen
               and have compiled an annotated bibliography that may be found in <ref
                  target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/pedagogies/commons/austen/pedagogies.commons.2015.looserzarka.html"
                  >a separate section of this special issue</ref>.) Adding to the challenge of
               describing the scholarship of teaching on Austen is that many of these essays were
               published hither and yon—not in high-profile books or journals, and not necessarily
               in places we would look for them. What we can see from the scholarship we have been
               able to locate is that ruminating on the problems and possibilities of teaching
               Austen is not a recent phenomenon. Although it remains a comparatively underdeveloped
               area in the vibrant arena of Austen studies, the scholarship on teaching her is by no
               means new. Devoney Looser is now at work on a project documenting the teaching of
               Austen that dates to more than a century ago. To offer but one example, a short essay
               titled, “A Novel Course for Teachers: Jane Austen” appears in the Atlanta-based
                  <title level="j">Southern Educational Journal</title> in 1898. Ideas and advice on
               how (and why) to teach Austen have a long and as yet untold history.</p>
            <p>Most of these “teaching Austen” materials were not considered important enough to
               record in bibliographies of Austen scholarship. David Gilson’s invaluable <title
                  level="m">A Bibliography of Jane Austen</title> (Rev. ed., 1997) includes just
               three sources categorized in the index as related to “teaching,” all from the early
               1970s. It is true that some essays about teaching Austen do not sport titles
               signaling that they are about teaching. In 1975, Lionel Trilling published “Why We
               Read Jane Austen,” an essay that deals extensively with his experiences teaching her
               fiction in the classroom. Trilling sets out to describe “the intensity of feeling
               which students at my university directed to Jane Austen when I gave a course in her
               novels two years ago” (517). </p>
            <p>Trilling reports that he ran the course in a discussion-centered format rather than a
               lecture, and that “the optimum number of students would seem to be twenty and a
               practicable maximum probably cannot be higher than thirty” (518). He was amazed and
               distressed, then, when “the number of students who attended the first meeting of the
               course was something like 150” (518). It being the mid-1970s and Trilling being Trilling, he
               told the students he wanted to stick to the original enrollment he’d envisioned for
               the course and that he would conduct interviews to determine which students would be
               allowed to take it. After conducting a day and a half of interviews, he grew
               uncomfortable with the process; he had no criteria to make the decisions and worried
               that the notes he was jotting were “in some sense discriminatory” (518), having more
               to do with his sense of a student’s “personal interestingness” (518).</p>
            <p>These experiences with Austen in the classroom lead Trilling to consider Austen’s
               reputation. He discusses her place among a population of readers without credentials,
               whom he imagines as having turned her into a “pet” and a “darling” (519). Trilling
               believes that scholars of the immediate past (the early 1970s) turned “Austen into a
               figure . . . probably in part by the contemporary demand for female figures, though
               certainly not for that reason alone” (519). Trilling describes his own discomfort
               with attempting to add to our knowledge of how and why Austen had become “a figure,”
               versus approaching her as “nothing more than a good read” (520). He did not want to
               be on either pole, seeing himself as recuperating the idea of “a good read” beyond “a
               descent into mere creature-comfort, into downright coziness,” wanting to be prepared
               to discuss “why and how it is that pleasure comes to us from stories’ (520). </p>
            <p>Trilling’s interviews with prospective students led him to despair. As he writes,
               “There was something [students] wanted, not from me, as was soon apparent, but from
               Jane Austen, something that was making for an intensity in their application for the
               course such as I had no preparation for in all my teaching career” (520). Teaching
               Austen, Trilling finds, is <foreign>sui generis</foreign>. In the end, he came up
               with his list of forty students, having revised his maximum number upward, but he
               writes that he wasn’t prepared for the appeals, the expressions of bitterness (521).
               Why, Trilling asks, did this course mean so much, did Austen mean so much? One of the
               reasons he considers is that students flocked to Austen to “in some way transcend our
               sad contemporary existence” (521). </p>
            <p>He recalls a different context, only a few years earlier, in 1968, when the figure
               who had stood in that place in the college curriculum was William Blake (521).
               Trilling considers what it means that college students might flock to Blake in 1968
               and then, a handful of years later, to Austen: <quote> The style phases of our
                  culture are notoriously short; it was not to be thought anomalous that at one
                  moment disgust with modern life should be expressed through devotion to a figure
                  proposing impulse, excess, and the annihilation of authority [Blake], and then a
                  scant five years later through devotion to the presiding genius of measure,
                  decorum, and irony [Austen] (522)</quote> He turns to the then recently published
               work by Clifford Geertz, to make sense of life, culture, and aesthetics, articulating
               aspects of the vision of the value of humanism for which his criticism is famed. From
               the perspective of teaching Austen, however, several things are important to note in
               his essay, particularly his sense of college students embracing “a figure” in waves
               of fashion. Reading Trilling on Austen might strike us today as both old hat and new
               business. What is new, thanks to Trilling, is the realization that Austen’s being “a
               figure” in the college classroom itself has a long, varied, and not yet well-mined
               history.</p>
            <p>If we fast-forward ten years from Trilling, we find Patricia Meyer Spacks considering
               similar questions. Spacks published “Emma’s Happiness” in the <title level="j">ADE
                  Bulletin</title>, commenting on her teaching of Austen and offering another
               anecdotal view of continuity and change. She writes that her students came to the
               classroom not only seeking in Austen a “figure” or a pet and a darling (in Trilling’s
               terms) but because they “interest themselves” in Austen’s female characters,
               suggesting a kind of identification with the heroines (17). Problems arise with
                  <title level="m">Emma</title>, then, as students are loathe to “interest
               themselves” in a character they see as “overprivileged” and a novel that “offends
               feminist sensibilities and disappoints romantic expectations” (17). Spacks writes
               that “Every time I teach <title level="m">Emma</title>, the novel, I run into the
               same problem: students don’t like Emma, the character” (17). Spacks talks about the
               difficulties of getting students beyond thinking of characters as people to thinking
               of characters as characters, giving specific tactics for prompting other kinds of
               readings. </p>
            <p>She concludes that “Perhaps the best thing we can do for students of <title level="m"
                  >Emma</title> is to confuse them: to make them realize how many questions Austen
               raises, how few she distinctly answers, how much they themselves may resemble Emma
               precisely in her mistakes, how difficult it is to acknowledge such resemblance” (18).
               By 1986, Spacks’s essay implies, students were coming to Austen’s novels with several
               kinds of desires and impulses, seeking an identification with the heroine, a
               ratification of feminist sensibilities, and the satisfaction of romantic
               expectations—all at once. How different is this—or is this different at all?—from
               Trilling’s students’ desires? How different is it from the desires of our respective
               students today?</p>
            <p>Both Spacks and Trilling were teaching Austen at tony institutions in classes
               presumably made up of majority-white, economically privileged young Americans. We
               need more accounts of what it means to teach Austen to other student populations and
               in many kinds of classrooms. Nora Nachumi’s "'I Am Elizabeth Bennet': Defining One's
               Self through Austen's Third Novel,” is a trailblazing essay in this vein, describing
               her experiences teaching <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> to Orthodox
               Jewish women students. As Nachumi writes, “As Orthodox Jews, my students live lives
               circumscribed by expectations of feminine conduct that resemble those that appear in
               the novel. Thus <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> is more obviously
               relevant to their own lives than it is to those of most students at secular
               institutions” (120). </p>
            <p>In this special issue of <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</title>, we
               have tried to make sense of what it means to teach Austen beyond the elite college
               classroom, acknowledging that all Austen classrooms have changed over the past fifty
               years. In his essay in this issue, Michael Verderame describes his experiences and
               practices teaching <title level="m">Persuasion </title>in a men’s prison. In hers,
               Donna S. Parsons describes what it means to teach Austen to Midwestern undergraduate
               students raised on the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> novels and films. Our
               collective experiences and anecdotes certainly add to the record, but there is little
               large-scale information about where Austen is being taught or to whom. Textbook
               publishers must have a good idea, as so many of them are now marketing competing
               editions, but one suspects that, for that very reason, they would be loathe to share
               the information. It would be fascinating to know how the gender, race, and class
               demographics of students enrolling in Jane Austen courses have changed over time. It
               would be interesting to know how many of the students who come to an Austen course
               (or to the reading of a particular Austen novel in a literature course) already
               consider themselves her fans. As Sarah Raff asks in her essay, what does it mean that
               her students imagine the stereotype of a student in a Jane Austen class to be a
               (straight) college girl who is desperate for a boyfriend?</p>
            <p>The nine essays that make up this special issue touch on what happens when students
               discuss issues of courtship and romance through Austen, but they also consider what
               happens when Austen is taught in less familiar contexts, whether of content or
               method. Those contexts and methods include digital media and manuscript facsimiles
               (Levy) and Austen in popular culture (Wells). They include considerations of teaching
               Austen in light of the nineteenth-century literature around her that is “not Austen,”
               allowing students to better to understand the literary marketplace that she joined
               (Friedman). They include Austen and Harry Potter (Parsons), Austen and
               nineteenth-century children’s literature, such as that by Maria Edgeworth (Rosings),
               and Austen and a wide range of Gothic novels (Eisner). They include Austen in
               conversation with the “bix six” male Romantic poets (Lau) and with serious and
               satirical advice literature on love (Raff). Collectively, these essays show that not
               only is the teaching of Austen alive and well, it is booming. If what is going on in these
               contributors’ classrooms is any indication, Austen is now at the forefront of
               vibrant, creative, and multivalent pedagogical practices in the undergraduate and
               graduate literature curriculum. </p>
