            <p rend="noCount"> In this course we will read Jane Austen’s six print novels alongside her manuscript
                writing — her juvenilia, unpublished fiction, and selected letters. Using the newly
                launched website, <ref target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/index.html">Jane Austen’s
                    Fictional Manuscripts</ref>, which provides access to high-quality images of
                original manuscripts whose material forms are scattered around the world in
                libraries and private collections, we are presented with a unique opportunity
                formerly available only to select, highly specialized scholars. Specific topics to
                be covered include: Austen’s participation, both early in her life and throughout
                her career, in domestic, manuscript culture; her role as a reader and critical
                commentator on literary trends, including the novel of sensibility and the gothic;
                her difficult and prolonged efforts to revise her writing for print; her position as
                a female author, including her efforts to promote (and distinguish herself from) the
                fiction of other women; her status as a professional author, including her
                relationships with publishers and patrons; the material form in which her novels
                were printed, and their dissemination in circulating libraries and book societies;
                her reception in the early nineteenth century, in periodical reviews and by major
                writers of the period (including Byron, Scott, Wordsworth, and Coleridge); and her
                canonization during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as <emph>the </emph>major female author of the period. In addition to
                immersing ourselves in the world of Austen’s fiction, students will engage with a
                selection of theoretical readings that address her participation in the material
                culture of her day.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">In this course, we are seeking a thorough knowledge of the Romantic literary culture
                through an in-depth analysis of one of the period’s most famous authors, the
                novelist Jane Austen. You will be responsible—through your readings, presentations,
                participation and essays for seriously engaging with the literature and culture of
                this period.</p>
            <list>
            <item><hi rendition="#underline">Attendance and Participation</hi>:
            <p rend="noCount">Active and engaged class participation is necessary to make this course a success. We
                meet only 13 times during the semester – you must attend all classes. You are
                allowed one absence “no questions asked.” Thereafter (that is for any absences
                beyond the first) you must provide documentation to explain your absence. Without
                this documentation, your final grade will be reduced one grade for each absence (ie.
                from B+ to B for one unexplained absence). This is not done to be punitive but
                because regular attendance and involvement in the class is necessary for the course
                to be a success.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">You must do all of the required reading. As we will be doing the novels often in
                quick succession, it is highly desirable that you be finished reading the novel by
                the beginning of the first class that we are to consider it. Ideally, you will have
                read one or two of the novels before the start of the class. We are also working at
                a higher level in this class with more secondary sources, so again, this is a course
                with a lot of reading—consider yourself warned!</p></item>
                <item><hi rendition="#underline">Presentations</hi>:
            <p rend="noCount">You will make two presentations for the course. The first one, to be conducted in
                pairs, will count for 10% of your final grade (maximum 30 minutes). This
                presentation will require considerable outside research, and will be focused on a
                selected topic related to that day’s secondary reading. </p>
            <p rend="noCount">For your second presentation, to be given on the last day of class, you will be
                presenting a paper that outlines the major questions and implications of your final
                paper. The presentation will be at most 10 minutes.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">Additional guidelines for your presentations are provided below.</p></item>
                <item><hi rendition="#underline">Essays</hi>:
            <p rend="noCount"> You will write two essays in this course. Detailed guidelines for these papers will
                be given to you. As this course is writing intensive, we will be spending a lot of
                time on your writing. You will write two versions of the first paper, receiving
                feedback on the first version before you revise it. Please note that both grades (on
                the first and the revised paper) are recorded. The revised essay must be responsive
                to the criticism and suggestions received on the first version. It is your
                responsibility to ensure that you understand the suggestions and recommendations I
                will provide for you. </p>
            <p rend="noCount"> The structure for the second paper is slightly different. Here you will submit a
                proposal, including an outline and an annotated bibliography. Feedback on your
                proposal will help you as you write your final paper. See below for more details on
                your essay assignments.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">All papers are due on the dates listed in the class schedule. Late papers will lose
                one half-grade (one plus or minus grade) for every day they remain outstanding.
                There are no exceptions.</p>
            <p rend="noCount"> All papers must be presented in proper form: they must be typed, double spaced, one
                inch margins, 12 point font size, with page numbers, and an interesting title. Your
                name, date and class information must appear clearly on the first page of your
                paper. I require a hard copy of all papers (i.e. emailed copies not accepted).
                Please DO NOT use a separate title page; double-sided papers are strongly
                encouraged.</p></item>
                <item><hi rendition="#underline">Plagiarism:</hi>
            <p rend="noCount"> The <title level="m">MLA Style Manual</title> defines plagiarism as “the use of
                another person’s ideas or expressions in your own writing without acknowledging the
                source.” Plagiarism is a serious academic offence that will be reported to the Dean
                of Students, and can result in expulsion. If you plagiarize, you will be given a
                zero on that paper and may also fail the course. Please ask me if you have any
                questions about how to document your sources.</p></item>

            <p rend="noCount">On the first day of class you will be asked to sign up, in pairs, for a presentation
                topic. All topics are listed on the syllabus. Generally speaking, presentations will
                be held in the second or third hour of class, though there may be some flexibility
                with this as we go along.</p>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>For some topics, I have given specific readings to consider. For others, you
                    can find the secondary sources after consulting with me. It is important that
                    you come to see me well in advance of the presentation date (preferably at least
                    2 weeks before) to discuss your sources and your approach. A visit during office
                    hours is best.</item>
            </list>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>Most presentations will be conducted in pairs, with both students receiving

            </list>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>You will be expected to conduct some research for the presentation. It is
                    expected that this research will help you with your papers, so you should be
                    thinking ahead towards your papers in deciding what you would like to work on
                    for the presentation. </item>
            </list>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>Your aim in the presentation is twofold – to introduce students to the
                    scholarly literature and issues surrounding your topic, and of course how it
                    applies to Austen—and to stimulate discussion. You should aim to begin with a
                    more formal presentation of no more than 20 minutes in length (Be warned: I will
                    cut you off if you go over!). You should prepare on an overhead or handout at
                    least three, well-crafted and focused questions or exercises for discussion,
                    which will continue for another 10-20 minutes. There will also be an opportunity
                    for students to ask you questions about your research. Your presentation grade
                    will be based on both the formal presentation and the extent to which you
                    stimulate discussion, and respond to questions.</item>
            </list>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>You are encouraged to be as creative as possible in your presentation. While
                    reading from notes is fine, it would be terrific if you can think of more
                    inventive ways to present your material. Visual and audio aids are great – you
                    are responsible for bringing any necessary equipment to class.</item>

            <list type="unordered">
                <item>The presentation will be worth 10% of your grade. The presentation grade
                    includes both of the in-class oral presentation and discussion, as well as a
                    brief summary of the presentation, with a bibliography, that you will post to

            <p rend="noCount">You are responsible for devising your own topic for this paper. The requirements are
                as follows:</p>
            <list type="ordered">
                <item>You should focus on one novel or a few shorter works if that is what you want
                    to work on. Remember it is a short paper; no more than 7 pages
                    double-spaced.</item>
                <item>Your essay must consider at least four scholarly articles or book chapters.
                    These articles can be taken from those assigned in class. All articles must, of
                    course, be relevant to your paper.</item>
                <item>Your paper must have an argument and this argument should in some way relate
                    your reading of the novel to the scholarship you have read. In other words, you
                    should take a position on this scholarship and situate your reading of the novel
                    within what others have said about it. To do so effectively, you will probably
                    want to address a fairly narrow topic. For example, “Austen and the novel
                    tradition” is far too big; “Austen and the gothic novel” is getting better;
                    “Austen’s reading of Radcliffe’s <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title>” is
                    even better. </item>
                <item>You may take any topic, from any part of the class, and apply it to any novel.
                    So, for example, don’t confine yourself to the topic of “reading” in <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>; reading is important in all of the
                    novels, though in different ways.</item>
                <item>Ideally, you will pick a topic that relates to the focus of the course. This
                    isn’t to say that all of the issues Austen’s work raises, such as gender and
                    class, are not important, but, as I would like to see you working with the
                    course readings, try to find a topic that fits with our general investigation

            <p rend="noCount">The revision of your paper is due in class on <hi rend="bold">February 21</hi>. The
                revised paper must be stapled to the first version of the paper, with my

            <head><hi rend="bold">Your responsibility</hi></head>
                <p rend="noCount">When you hand the revision back in, <hi rend="bold">be sure you also hand in
                        the first marked version with comments on it. Please staple the two versions
                        together.</hi></p>

                <div type="part">
            <head><hi rend="bold">Our promise</hi></head>
                <p rend="noCount">I will assess your revision in light of the first version of your paper and
                    your responsiveness to my comments; my comments on your second version will
                    necessarily be briefer than those on your first.</p>

                <div type="part">
            <head><hi rend="bold">Why revise?</hi></head>
                <p rend="noCount">Writing (and the thinking that goes into it) is a process, and is never really
                    complete. A piece of writing is never perfect, but with work it can improve,
                    becoming clearer, more persuasive, more interesting.</p>
                <p rend="noCount">By revising your paper, you are given the opportunity to revisit and improve
                    your paper by rewriting it after having received feedback.</p>
                                </div>
            <div type="part">
            <head><hi rend="bold">How will the revision be graded?</hi></head>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>While it is unlikely that your grade will drop, since you were being graded in
                    part on your responsiveness to feedback, if you make no or few changes, it may
                    well drop. If you only make the most basic changes and corrections, as included
                    in your feedback, it is unlikely that your grade will rise. </item>
                <item>To improve your grade, you will have to do a lot more than fixing a few
                    sentences here and there (including any corrections that have been made on your
                    paper). Unless you did exceptionally well on the first paper—and this represents
                    a very small number of students, you must <hi rend="bold">rewrite </hi>your
                    paper. <hi rend="bold">I cannot stress strongly enough that a revision is a
                        rewriting, which means that you must write it again. You may use some
                        aspects of the first paper that did work, but by and large you should start
                        again.</hi>
                </item>
                <item>More specifically, we are looking for the following:</item>
                <item>Has the student enhanced or at least maintained what were strengths of the
                    original paper? </item>
                <item>Has the student addressed the global concerns articulated in the feedback
                    about the paper successfully, especially those mentioned in end comments, and as
                    many of the localized concerns as possible? </item>
                <item>Has the student worked on strengthening and developing his/her argument and
                    textual analysis? How convincing is the argument and the analysis?</item>
                <item>Does the revised paper work as a new whole, having unity and coherence?</item>
                <item>Has the student edited and proofread the revision successfully? </item>
            </list>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
            <head><hi rend="bold">Where do I start?</hi></head>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>I know it sounds obvious, but, start by reading the comments carefully. It is
                    important that you understand <hi rend="bold">every single mark on the
                        paper</hi>—both the end comments and the comments/corrections made
                    throughout your paper. If you cannot decipher or do not understand any of these
                    comment, please ask for elucidation. </item>
                <item>Note that when we make corrections, particularly on sentence and paragraph
                    level issues (grammatical and other mechanical/stylistic problems), we do <hi
                        rend="bold">not</hi> correct (or even note) every instance where there is a
                    problem. We do point out the types of problems that your paper demonstrates, and
                    it is up to you to avoid those problems on the revision. This applies to
                    problems with citations and quotations as well.</item>
                <item>Again, if you have any questions at all, please speak to your TA. For those of
                    you with more serious writing problems, it is strongly recommended that you seek
                    out the help of a writing tutor.</item>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
            <head><hi rend="bold">I have digested your comments and understand them, now
                    what?</hi> </head>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>Most of you have made good choices as to your topic and texts, and many of you
                    had decent arguments. In other words, most of you will not need to start
                    entirely from scratch. However, <hi rend="bold">almost everyone </hi>could stand
                    to improve his or her thesis (those of you who did not have an argument, of
                    course, need to find one). </item>
                <item>Where does an argument come from, you ask? It comes from reading the texts
                    over and over again. An argument does not state the obvious; nor does it skirt
                    the text altogether; nor does it simply repeat what others have said (including
                    what we have said in class). You must be closely engaged with <emph>reading </emph>a literary work (or adaptation in another media) in order to
                    develop an interesting argument.</item>
                <item>Support for the argument will come from your textual analysis. All of you need
                    to work on developing your close reading skills. It is not sufficient to quote
                    from the text; you must also properly introduce it and explain how that
                    particular quote supports your argument.</item>

            <p rend="noCount">The outline and annotated bibliography is due on <hi rend="bold">March 13th</hi>. The
                outline itself should be 1-2 pages, and the annotated bibliography.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">Your proposal should set out the texts you will be examining and an outline of your
                argument. You should include a brief discussion of the secondary sources you will be
                engaging with. Of course, none of this is fixed in stone, and the point of the
                exercise is (1) to encourage you to begin working on your final project due at the
                end of the term; and (2) to provide you with feedback on your paper ideas.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">Your annotated bibliography should contain a brief summary (no more than a paragraph)
                for each text you have consulted in your research. It should include both primary
                and secondary material that is relevant to your final paper, and all material that
                you have read even if you will not be using it in your final paper. Ideally, you
                will make your annotations as you proceed through your reading, when it is freshest
                in your mind. You should aim to annotate between 6-8 secondary sources.</p>

            <head><hi rend="bold">Final Paper </hi></head>
            <p rend="noCount">This paper is due in class, on <hi rend="bold">April 10th</hi>. It should be between
                10-12 pages in length. To make sure that you are on the right track, I highly
                recommend that you come speak to me about your thoughts as soon as possible.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">This is a more substantial research paper. In this paper, I would like for you to
                assess Austen’s novels in relation to a focused topic. I am leaving this very open
                ended so that you can write a topic that interests you. The guidelines are as
                follows:</p>
            <list type="unordered">
                <item>You must consider at least two novels, possibly three, and probably no more
                    than four (unless you have a very narrow topic). </item>
                <item>You may reconsider the novel you dealt with in your first paper, though your
                    focus should be different.</item>
                <item>As in your first paper, you should engage with the secondary criticism on your
                    topic. You must situate your own argument in the context of what others have
                    said about Austen on the topic you are addressing. You will want to consider at
                    least five scholarly book chapters or articles. Remember that I do not want you
                    to use the criticism simply to support your own readings. Rather, try to engage
                    in a conversation, and ideally a debate, with what others have already said. In
                    the somewhat unlikely event that you are addressing a topic that no one has
                    dealt with, you should speak to me about how to deal with this.</item>
                <item>In this paper, I would like for you to attempt to address some of the more
                    challenging aspects of Austen’s novels. So, make sure you select a topic that
                    interests you and that you feel is sufficiently complicated to challenge you. A
                    very simple, or overbroad topic (i.e. “education” in Jane Austen) will probably
                    not yield the best paper. </item>
