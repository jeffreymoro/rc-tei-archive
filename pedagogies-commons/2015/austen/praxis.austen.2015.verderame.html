            <p class="noCount">This essay explores the challenges of teaching literature in the unique setting of
               higher education programs in correctional institutions. Based on the author's experience
               teaching a romantic-literature course in prison, it explores some of the cultural
               and logistical obstacles at play in prison education and possibilities for how these
               obstacles can be successfully negotiated. Finally, it suggests possible examples of
               how to adapt Austen for other nontraditional audiences. </p>

               <h1><span class="head">Austen Unbound: Teaching <em>Persuasion </em>in Prison</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>There might seem to be few less auspicious settings for a discussion of Jane Austen
               than a classroom in a men’s penitentiary. In fact, when I mentioned to a colleague
               that I had taught <em>Perusasion</em> behind bars, she related a telling anecdote: In describing a proposed prison higher
               education program to a university administrator, when asked to talk about course content,
               she used Austen as the paradigmatic example of what <em>not</em> to teach in prison. But in our age when her novels have found vast new audiences
               through films and even, unbelievably, popular mashup horror fiction, perhaps the notion
               of Austen in prison blues may be easier to entertain.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the spring of 2012 I had the opportunity to teach as a volunteer instructor at
                  the Education Justice Project, a program based at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
                  and serving Danville Correctional Center, a medium-high security men’s prison about
                  40 miles away from campus.

                  </div> The brainchild of Rebecca Ginsburg, a UIUC professor of landscape architecture, EJP
                  has one paid staffer and survives on donations of time, money, and labor, primarily
                  by professors, graduate students, and community members who serve as administrators,
                  teachers, tutors, and workshop leaders. Unlike the prison’s adult basic education,
                  high school equivalency, and community college programs, EJP does not receive any
                  funds from the state. Its exclusive focus is on upper-level college instruction. Only
                  students who have completed the equivalent of an Associate’s Degree are accepted into
                  the program, and although EJP itself grants no degrees, classes are fully transferable
                  to degree-granting programs at UIUC and other four-year schools upon a student’s release.
                  EJP students are often regarded both by prison staff and the general population as
                  role models—not only for their academic achievement, but also for their discipline,
                  fortitude, and work ethic.</p>
            </div>
            <p>With only a small library and a handful of computers, the use of which by students
               is severely restricted, many traditional classroom expectations need to be trimmed.
               Papers cannot be expected to be typed, for instance, since most of the students have
               limited computer access and many do not have keyboarding proficiency. The lack of
               internet access and small library make traditional research papers difficult, so like
               many instructors I chose to emphasize reflective, critical papers. Perhaps most significantly,
               having to go through X-rays and several security doors, walk past snipers, and teach
               class with correctional officers standing outside creates its own psychological challenges,
               not to mention the 90-minute commute, drug test, finger printing, tuberculosis test,
               and thorough background screening required just to be able to get into the prison.
               All this made me distinctly less sympathetic to colleagues complaining about long
               photocopier lines and poorly worded student emails in their classes back on campus.</p>
            <p>And yet, like every EJP teacher I’ve talked to, it remains the single greatest teaching
               experience I’ve had. The students all come from different levels in terms of background
               knowledge, but all share a hunger for learning more. The class size (about 16 students)
               promotes the feel of a large seminar, and I became used to students requesting extra
               reading and getting up during class to find more information from the library. There
               was technically a break in the midst of classes, but it never really felt like it,
               since most of the students would remain and continue the discussion with me until
               the correctional officer announced that class had “resumed.” A completely unique educational
               environment developed, with an optimal balance between the level of personal respect
               and decorum the students showed to me and each other, and the tenacity and passion
               of the intellectual arguments that arose.</p>
            <p>My class was specifically designed for EJP, and focused on methodological issues of
               literary history focusing on two discrete but connected eras—late Romantic England
               and the Harlem Renaissance. The overarching theme of the class was how writers engaged
               with their historical moment, how they articulated the role of literature in shaping
               historical change, and how they responded to and transformed the literary tradition
               they inherited. Teaching a class so heavily dependent upon historical context is difficult
               in a situation where external research beyond a very small library is impossible,
               and budget constraints forced me to use only major works in thrift editions. What
               we lacked in resources, however, was more than made up for through depth of engagement.
               Without much in the way of secondary materials, the class had fewer facts at their
               hands to provide contextualization for the novel, but they probed those facts more
               forcefully and thoroughly than a typical undergraduate class, often detecting lines
               of connection between the works that I had never thought of before.</p>
            <p>For the Romantic unit of the class, I chose two novels, <em>Persuasion</em> (1818) and <em>Frankenstein</em> (1816), and three major poets, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats.
               This fairly conventional syllabus was in part dictated by the necessity of using thrift
               editions, but also reflected my desire, in a class centered on questions of literary-historical
               influence, to choose especially influential writers and works. Despite having some
               initial reservations about the suitability of Austen for an all-male classroom, I
               soon felt she was indispensable to the course I was trying to create. In particular,
               her satiric voice, depth of characterization, and psychological realism formed an
               important counterpoint to the forms of Romantic subjectivity embodied in the male
               poets. <em>Persuasion </em>also seemed the logical choice of Austen’s books for a class designed around questions
               of historicity, because of its connections to the Napoleonic Wars and other contemporary
               events, as well as the recursive quality of the narrative. What better way to explore
               questions of memory and historical imagination than with a novel obsessed with these
               concerns, a novel that is in many ways a “second-chance” story, commencing at a point
               in the heroine’s life years after the breakdown of a youthful romance. In effect,
               <em>Persuasion</em> was an Austen novel taking place after the conventional Austen plot had already failed.</p>
            <p>It would be nice to report that the power of Austen’s prose won my students over immediately,
               and I suddenly had a room full of committed Janeites. It would be equally satisfying
               to report that the students approached the text with hostility and that I, through
               my own pedagogical skill and sensitivity, convinced them of the book’s merits. The
               reality, of course, was more complicated. <em>Persuasion</em> faced more resistance than almost any other work we read over the course of the semester,
               and while most of the students left with a grudging respect for the novel and a sense
               of Austen’s importance, I still detected no great love for her, except for one or
               two students. How I reached even that point, however, is an interesting story.</p>
            <p>In later conversations with Austen teachers, I learned that male students’ difficulty
               with Austen is a nearly universal phenomenon, and I had found that to be true in my
               own teaching of Austen on campus as well. Beyond the gender barrier, I found additional
               challenges in the prison context. The students viewed, understandably, all the works
               read through the prism of their own experiences. Austen’s satirical depictions of
               the social conventions of the landed classes in early 19<span class="sup">th</span>-century England, and the female-centered marriage plot, made <em>Persuasion</em> seem as far removed as imaginable from the student’s lived experience. Other writers
               engendered a similar skepticism (the aestheticism of Keats evoked some particularly
               withering comments, while Byron and Shelley fared somewhat better), but <em>Persuasion</em> had the additional difficulties of Austen’s narrative style. The very factors that
               make her so significant in the history of the English novel—the meticulously precise
               diction, verbose yet elegant prose, the psychological complexity of characterization,
               the use of free indirect discourse, and the levels of irony at work in her narrative
               voice—all create challenges for contemporary readers.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, I did find one advantage in teaching Austen in this environment: the
               lack of familiarity with filmed Austen enabled the students to meet the novel on its
               own terms. Filmed versions, in my experience, often favor a lush romanticism at the
               expense of Austen’s social satire, and even the most effective film cannot fully capture
               the sense of a novel in which so much of the action takes place inside characters’
               minds. In television and film adaptations, the narrator’s voice has often been “clumsily
               and inappropriately translated into dialogue” (Roger 194). Taking advantage of the
               students’ ability to read with open minds and asking them to think about Austen in
               historical relationship to other writers of the time helped yield some surprising
               insights. Even today, Austen is often taught at the undergraduate level as either
               the culmination of the eighteenth century novel or, as it was taught to me, as the
               progenitor of Victorian fiction. I wanted to make a case to my class for a Romantic
               Austen, as deeply enmeshed in the debates and events of her time as Byron, Shelley,
               Leigh Hunt, or William Hazlitt. Making available selections from secondary works by
               Jeffery Cox and James Chandler helped students make these historical connections.</p>
            <p>One choice I made early in structuring the course paid particular dividends when we
               got to Austen. I designated one student to be responsible for leading the class in
               discussing each of the works, something I had done often in my campus classes but
               never before to this extent. I appreciated the seminar feel that developed once I
               relinquished leadership of the class, and also liked enabling (or forcing) students
               to take more ownership. Giving each student a turn also helped to democratize the
               EJP class significantly. Because EJP students are largely self-taught, their knowledge
               base and skill sets differ widely, and some students were much more comfortable expressing
               their ideas either verbally or in writing. Giving each student an opportunity to lead
               discussion confirmed that everyone had something important to contribute to the class.
               Moreover, every student diligently and creatively discharged his responsibility, making
               the overall class much more dynamic and interesting than it would have been had I
               been leading discussion. The success of this system confirmed for me the truth of
               a key EJP axiom, that when you set extremely high expectations they are likely to
               be not just met but exceeded.</p>
            <p>When we reached <em>Persuasion</em>, I was fortunate to have discussion led by an extremely energetic, thoughtful, and
               charismatic student. Equally fortuitously, he also happened to be the only student
               who expressed uncritical admiration for the novel. He broke down the residence of
               some other students to Austen’s prose style and the seeming lack of relatibility of
               her characters by suggesting that all enduring works of literature had something important
               to teach contemporary audiences across temporal bounds, and it was the reader’s job
               to make the imaginative and critical effort to transcend his historical experience.
               By repeatedly asking what Austen is trying to teach us today, he steered discussion
               in a direction that turned potentially disruptive resistance into a productive source
               of engagement. He preempted much of my plan for teaching the class by suggesting that
               our reasons for finding Austen difficult suggest the close relationship between literary
               works and their historical contexts, and that not merely had political and economic
               arrangements and language changed, but the fundamental ways people narrated and experienced
               their subjectivity in the world was different in Austen’s time than today. Moreover,
               his sheer energy helped transform what otherwise seemed likely to be an uncharacteristically
               sleepy EJP class.</p>
            <p>My students voiced many of the same difficulties that other modern readers, particularly
               male readers, are likely to encounter. They were not especially sympathetic to the
               romance plot, the lack of conventional “action,” or the intense fascination with the
               mores and manners of the social class Austen describes. Foregrounding Austen’s satirical
               voice helped overcome this objection to some extent, by showing the novels had more
               “bite” than they initially thought. I also found that bringing some of the other poems
               and prose texts we had read into the discussion helped them put together a picture
               of the intense social and economic changes going on at the time. Although I did not
               implement it in this iteration of the class, I think future writing assignments that
               focus on unpacking Austen’s complex narrative voice and language, and in particular
               her use of free indirect discourse, could help improve student comprehension for the
               novel. For instance, requiring students to paraphrase a paragraph of the novel in
               their own words, or conversely, describe a situation in their own lives by mimicking
               Austen’s prose style, could help penetrate some of the linguistic and narrative challenges
               presented by the novel.</p>
            <p>A second key move was in framing our discussion around historical events—not only
               on the macro-level (such as changing gender relationships and expectations for marriage,
               the rise of an urban commercial class, and the corresponding decline in the prestige
               of the gentry), but also more precise historical contexts, such as the final phase
               of the Napoleonic Wars after Napoleon’s escape from Elba. Without historical contextualization,
               the students would have had no way of knowing that “Austen makes the events of the
               novel coincide precisely” with Napoleon’s post-exile campaign, with Waterloo very
               much “at the forefront of Austen’s mind” (Deresiewicz 146).</p>
            <p>Here I followed Chandler’s argument for a model of literary-historical scholarship
               that emphasizes very tight windows of periodization. I also drew on the sense of Romantic-era
               war as reshaping the consciousness of temporality, based on the pioneering work of
               Mary Favret. Favret has pointed out that, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, readership
               and discussion of Austen has spiked in periods of war. During the two world wars,
               Austen was foremost among the literary treasures cited as “fortification” against
               the “upheavals of wartime,” a possibility with striking resonance for the contemporary
               Austen boom in a period which, for Americans, is not exactly wartime, but not peacetime
               either (Favret).</p>
            <p>Reading through the lens of wartime helped the students understand the changing status
               of the navy. Austen, herself the sister of two naval officers, left the navy alone
               unscathed from her satiric pen among major British cultural institutions. This reverence
               for the navy, and the generally sympathetic treatment of Wentworth, became more readily
               apparent to the students once we examined how Britain’s continued independence—let
               alone its empire and commercial prospects—depended upon control of the seas. In turn,
               this also helped the class appreciate the larger social trends at work in the novel,
               as they saw how the professional status of a naval officer would be so important,
               and correspondingly, for a commercialized and industrial society, how the possession
               of a good family name meant less and less. The combination of the historical background
               and the energetic contributions of our discussion leader helped warm the class towards
               <em>Persuasion</em>, which was reflected in their written work as well. Historicizing the work, and exploring
               it in terms of political, economic, and social relationships rather than just the
               marriage plot, improved the novel’s legibility and accessibility.</p>
            <p>One final analytical tool helped dramatically bring <em>Persuasion</em> alive. Throughout the class we had explored the period’s foundational arguments about
               the acts of reading and writing, and what the ultimate goal of literary expression
               should be. Shelley’s <em>Defence of Poetry</em> and Keats’s letters had both generated intense and lively discussion about the promises
               and pitfalls of reading and writing. The morality and methods of reading are an enduring
               concern in Austen’s work, most notably in <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, but significantly in <em>Persuasion</em> as well, which probes questions such as how one should read, what material should
               be read, and what ultimate purpose reading serves. We spent significant class time
               probing two of the major instances of reading in the text. Sir Walter Elliott’s obsessive
               reading and notetaking on the baronetage registry at the beginning of the novel suggested
               one model of reading, conservative and self-oriented. Sir Walter read in order confirm
               his own beliefs, assuage doubts about his own rapidly shrinking social status, and
               shore up his faith in a disappearing order. In contrast, Captain Benwick’s preferred
               reading matter, flowery Romantic poetry, marks him as highly sensitive and refined,
               but also more delicate and less practical than Wentworth, whom the novel regards as
               a more suitable masculine role model. We eventually suggested a third model of reading
               that Austen seems to be promoting though the demands she makes on her own readers:
               reading as an active exercise of critical intelligence, as opposed the escapist (in
               different ways) methods of reading favored by Benwick and Sir Walter. In the course
               of our time on <em>Persuasion</em>, we problematized the act of reading itself in ways that resonated throughout the
               remainder of the semester. We learned that the meaning of “good” or “effective” reading
               is not universal, but has been contested at different historical moments.</p>
            <p>Bringing out the theme of different approaches to the purpose and value of reading
               eventually proved the most productive way to generate engagement with the novel. Having
               read Wordsworth’s 1800 "Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>," the students were already aware of the period’s anxieties about the effect of inappropriate
               or "low-quality" reading on the aesthetic taste and moral commitments of different
               segments of society. The students implicitly grasped this idea; as well-read autodidacts
               themselves, they already had a commitment to reading as a mode of intellectual and
               moral uplift that few of my undergraduates at my home institution shared. For them,
               the writers we studied were not an abstract intellectual exercise; rather, Keats,
               Shelley, Byron, etc. represented living ideas, with the power to teach lessons that
               could be applied to their daily experience. They also had the experience of expressing
               tastes in reading that might come across as effete to some of the other inmates. Furthermore,
               they had the experience of having their own reading, viewing, and listening habits
               relentlessly scrutinized by prison authorities. So, by emphasizing <em>Persuasion</em> as a work in part about the promise and perils of reading, we situated the novel
               as an intervention to debates that they were already actively involved in.</p>
            <p>As my experience shows, Austen has the potential to reach all types of audiences,
               although different classrooms will demand different pedagogical approaches. We have
               seen film and television adaptations and pulp novelizations help to spread Austen’s
               appeal and create new generations of Janeites. But it is important not to underestimate
               the ability of the novels themselves to speak directly to even those contemporary
               readers without much experience reading literary fiction. At a time of shrinking enrollments
               in English classes and renewed fears about the health of the discipline, Austen is
               one of the field’s most reliable attractions to undergraduate students, standing perhaps
               second only to Shakespeare in possessing an equally high degree of cultural capital
               and popular appeal. My students at Danville Correctional Center taught me that her
               success endures not in spite of her difficulty, but rather directly because of the
               demands she places upon reading as an active exercise of critical intelligence. </p>
