            <p class="noCount">Throughout the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, Jane Austen was not treated—in
               published criticism or in the classroom—in relation to the major male Romantic poets
               or thought to participate in the period’s defining events and concerns, either political
               or literary. Although these attitudes have begun to change, most scholarship on Austen
               still treats her either in isolation or in relation to other women writers, and many
               instructors report that they have trouble integrating Austen in Romantic period courses.
               My essay argues that Austen’s novels share many characteristics with Romantic-era
               poems and can be taught alongside these in a way that enhances our understanding of
               Romanticism. Similarities in the works of Austen and the male poets include an embrace
               of individualism; a shift from external events to the inner life as a focus of literature;
               a fascination with brother-sister incest; an emphasis on commonplace people and settings;
               conflicts between the attractions of romance and reality; a celebration of the sympathetic
               imagination and awareness of the dangers of solipsism and visionary flight; and a
               love of the natural world. </p>

                  or thought to participate in the period’s defining events and concerns, either political
                  or literary. As late as the 7<span class="sup">th</span> (2000) edition, the <em>Norton Anthology's</em> "Introduction to the Romantic Period" referred to Austen as “the only important author
                  who seems to be untouched by the political, intellectual, and artistic revolutions
                  of her age” (Abrams 20). In recent decades that situation has at last begun to change,
                  and an increasing body of criticism connects Austen in various ways to the Romantic
                  movement.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>One indication of this change is that, beginning with the 8th edition of the Norton
                           Anthology (2006), the statement about Austen’s detachment from the concerns of her
                           age is gone, and in several passages she is linked to the Romantic poets (Greenblatt
                           22; see also 14). For other studies allying Austen with Romanticism, besides works
                           cited above, see essays by Nina Auerbach, a special issue of The Wordsworth Circle
                           devoted to the topic (7.4 [Autumn 1976]), Ruoff, Thomas, Tuite, Harris, and Walker.</span></div>
                  </div> But old habits apparently die hard. Most scholarship on Austen still treats her either
                  in isolation, in relation to other novelists, or in conjunction with other women writers.
                  Anecdotal evidence also indicates that many instructors still have trouble integrating
                  Austen in Romantic period courses and either omit her altogether, or, if they include
                  one of her novels, emphasize its differences from the poetry of the major male poets.
                  My most recent experience of this response was at a NASSR 2013 roundtable discussion
                  of the various period courses in which Austen is taught (Eighteenth-Century, Romantic,
                  Victorian), when an audience member declared that Austen has nothing in common with
                  the male Romantic poets.

            <p>I am committed to teaching Austen in my Romantics classes alongside William Wordsworth,
               Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Blake, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John
               Keats. In the first place, I consider it essential to include the major novelist of
               the period in such courses—indeed, it is as inappropriate to leave her out as it would
               be to omit Wordsworth or any other central figure of the age. Moreover, one need not
               view Austen’s work as a departure from trends that characterize Romantic poetry. Many
               central connections can be explored between Austen’s novels and Romantic poems that
               have been, as it were, hiding in plain sight all along. I do wish to make clear that
               I’m not arguing for teaching only the “big six” poets plus Austen, or for viewing
               her solely in relation to these writers. In my courses I do include other women writers
               (and often, due to time constraints, leave out one or more of the major male poets)
               and address various similarities and differences among all of the works treated. In
               this essay, however, I focus on connections between Austen and the major male poets
               because her supposed differences from them are what kept her out of the Romantic canon
               in the past and, I believe, still prove a stumbling block for many instructors. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>One of the major distinctions commonly made between Austen and the male poets is that
                  her works advocate relationships and community whereas theirs celebrate the isolated
                  self, but Austen’s novels definitely participate in the philosophy of individualism
                  that evolved in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as a result of
                  various developments. These include an increasing emphasis on the subjective nature
                  of reality in response to the empirical, skeptical, and associationist philosophies
                  of mind prevalent in the eighteenth century, according to which each individual’s
                  perception of the external world is unique and no universal values or conceptions
                  may be assumed. In addition, the rise of capitalism and new modes of labor and production
                  broke down traditional feudal and familial ties and encouraged competition and self-reliance,
                  but also alienation from stable relationships and rhythms of life. Protestantism contributed
                  to individualism with its emphasis on self-analysis and a direct personal relationship
                  between each person and God. Finally, the growth of a more democratic and fluid society
                  encouraged personal ambition and the desire to aspire beyond the condition in which
                  one was born. The question of whether Austen was conservative or progressive in her
                  political outlook has been hotly debated, but as Mary Poovey states, even those with
                  conservative sympathies “were influenced during this period by the rhetoric and practices
                  of individualism” (181).

                           related but somewhat different terms, Deresiewicz argues that Austen’s last three
                           novels convey a new sense of time similar to Wordsworth’s (28 and passim). Although
                           he doesn’t compare her to the Romantic poets, Thompson notes that “Austen’s narrative
                           presents its major characters as growing or maturing or developing as separate or
                           distinct or different individuals,” and he comments on “The historicity of this life
                           story,” saying “Austen is the first English novelist to portray this myth in a fully
                           fashioned for…</span></div>
                  </div> All of her novels can be characterized as <span class="foreign">Bildungsroman</span>, a genre that developed in the late eighteenth century, which depicts the maturation
                  or coming of age of a unique individual (see Stelzig 1-15). Wordsworth is especially
                  relevant to compare with Austen on this point, as many of his best-known poems—"Tintern
                  Abbey," "Intimations of Immortality," <em>The Prelude</em>—are concerned with the passage from childhood or youth to adulthood, but all of the
                  male poets address this issue in some fashion. Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence and Experience</em> are concerned with stages of mental development, and Coleridge’s poems depicting a
                  fall from one state to another ("Ancient Mariner," <em>Christabel</em>) can also be read as explorations of psychological evolution. Keats frequently addresses
                  the need to progress through the stages of life from a youthful and sensuous to more
                  intellectual and compassionate, both in his poems and in letters such as those describing
                  life as a “Mansion of Many Apartments” and of life as a “vale of Soul-making” (<em>Letters</em> 1: 280-81, 2: 101-4).

                           analogy of life as a mansion of many apartments. As Clayton notes, Keats’s pattern
                           of growth is itself indebted to Wordsworth’s Tintern Abbey, and Fanny significantly
                           keeps a transparency of Tintern Abbey in her East room sanctuary (67-72). Deresiewicz

               <p>Marlon Ross argues that “rituals of maturation” in literature of the Romantic period
                  are “culturally and gender-determined,” so that models of development are starkly
                  different for male and female writers, the latter of whom do not depict a “struggle
                  toward self-discovery” (234). Womanhood during the early nineteenth century “is assumed
                  . . . to be something stable,” and female maturity involves “the agreement not to
                  desire independent individuality” (Ross 159, 161).

                  </div> Although variations can be noted in female and male life stories in Romantic literature,
                  Austen certainly is similar to her male contemporaries in depicting the passage of
                  an individual from immaturity to adulthood, and her heroines also clearly “struggle
                  toward self-discovery” and achieve “independent individuality” in their maturation
                  process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>On the other hand, some might say that Austen champions maturity whereas many of the
                  male poets celebrate childhood and lament the passage to adulthood (e.g., Mellor 275,
                  279), but in truth all of these writers reflect nuance and complexity as they explore
                  the advantages and disadvantages of innocence and experience. Two works that are particularly
                  relevant to compare on the topic of the pros and cons of maturation are <em>Sense and Sensibility </em>and “Tintern Abbey.” Both Marianne Dashwood and the speaker in Wordsworth’s poem go
                  through a similar process of evolving from a passionate state to a more sober one
                  as they relinquish their youthful love for what seemed an all-consuming sublime or
                  heroic presence (Willoughby for Marianne and Nature for Wordsworth), that they come
                  to realize was largely a self-created projection of their own desires. Wordsworth
                  in many ways seems to prefer and yearn for his earlier intense relationship with Nature,
                  just as many readers feel that Marianne’s relationship with Willoughby remains more
                  vital and authentic than that with the flannel-waistcoated Colonel Brandon, whom she
                  marries after acquiring a “more calm and sober judgment” (429) and diminished expectations.

            <p>Another way in which Austen’s novels reflect the Romantic period’s focus on individual
               subjectivity is in their depiction of the heroines’ inner lives. It is commonplace
               to observe that little significant action occurs in Austen’s fiction; the drama takes
               place in the internal struggles of her characters. Although the heroines certainly
               interact with others, their most significant moments—and often the climaxes of the
               novels—involve solitary meditation. One thinks of Marianne’s serious reconsideration
               of her conduct during her illness, which she only later confesses to her sister; of
               Elizabeth’s reflections and self-recriminations after reading Darcy’s letter as she
               strolls about the grounds of Hunsford; of Emma’s mortified private analyses of her
               behavior and feelings after Mr. Elton’s proposal, the expedition to Box Hill, and
               Harriet’s confession of her love for Mr. Knightley; of Catherine’s remorseful hours
               alone with her own thoughts after Henry learns of her dark suspicions about his father;
               and of Elinor’s, Fanny’s, and Anne’s many periods of private reflection on past events
               and probable future outcomes. The latter is the most introspective of all Austen’s
               heroines: Adela Pinch notes how “Anne is often so occupied with her own rumination
               and recollection that impressions from the outside seem to have a hard time finding
               their way in” (152). </p>
            <p>Wordsworth declares that one of the chief characteristics of his <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> is that “the feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation,
               and not the action and situation to the feeling” (448), and in poems such as 
               “Hart-Leap Well,”
               
               “Simon Lee,”
               and 
               “The Idiot Boy,”
               he confronts the reader’s expectation for some sensational “tale” and announces that
               instead of plot-driven narratives he tells “simple song[s] for thinking hearts” (
               “Heart-Leap Well”
               97, 100), where the interest lies in personal responses to experiences of everyday
               life. In the quintessential Romantic lyric (such as Coleridge’s conversation poems,
               Percy Shelley’s 
               “Ode to the West Wind,”
               and Keats’s odes), a drama unfolds in the speaker’s inner debate as he struggles with
               a personal conflict and eventually achieves a measure of resolution. In Austen and
               the Romantic poets, the focus of literature moves from external events to the inner
               life of the individual.</p>
            <p>Walter Scott noted the revolutionary quality of Austen’s novels when he contrasted
               the “Big Bow-Wow strain” of his own works, which feature major historical events and
               provide little psychological depth in their depiction of characters, to her “talent
               for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life” (Southam
               106). As the 8<span class="sup">th</span> edition of <em>The Norton Anthology</em>'s "Introduction to the Romantic Period" notes, Austen’s model proved to be more influential
               than Scott’s in the history of the novel, which has continued to emphasize “the mind
               in flux” over action-driven plots (Greenblatt 22). Clifford Siskin argues that both
               Austen’s novels and Romantic poems reflect a “lyric turn” in literary history, and
               claims that in Austen we see the beginning of the “lyricization of the novel” (132).
               Gabrielle Starr, like Siskin, insists that fiction and poetry of the Romantic period
               share in the same developments and ought to be studied together. According to Starr,
               Romantic poetry was influenced by the novel, which was the first genre to depict “private
               experience and the inner world” of middle-class people in domestic settings (7). Whether
               the Romantic novel was lyricized or Romantic poetry was novelized, both genres reflect
               the period’s new emphasis on depicting personal thoughts and emotions.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The fact that Austen’s novels revolve around courtship plots may appear to challenge
                  the claim that her works subscribe to an individualist ethos. However, the very notion
                  that marriage ought to involve love, compatibility between partners, and personal
                  fulfillment is associated with new beliefs in “affective individualism” and the validity
                  of personal happiness (Johnson 90-91; see also 77-84). Elizabeth Bennet clearly suggests
                  the association of romantic love with democratic notions of each individual’s right
                  to “the pursuit of happiness” (in the words of the Preamble to the American Declaration
                  of Independence), when she tells Lady Catherine, who wants Elizabeth to promise that
                  she will never marry Darcy, “I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will,
                  in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to <em>you</em>, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me” (396). By refusing to acknowledge
                  the superior claim to Darcy of Miss De Bourgh, who was intended as his wife by both
                  Lady Catherine and Darcy’s mother, Elizabeth is branded an “‘Obstinate, headstrong
                  girl’” and an “‘upstart . . . young woman without family, connections, or fortune’”
                  (394-95). Mrs. Bennet makes a similar charge after Elizabeth refuses to marry Mr.
                  Collins on the ground that her “feelings in every respect forbid it” (122). For Mrs.
                  Bennet, Elizabeth is a “headstrong foolish girl” who “car[es] no more for [her family]
                  than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way” (123, 126). By insisting
                  on marrying for love instead of for the benefit of her own or her husband’s family,
                  Elizabeth is regarded by those who adhere to a more traditional view of marriage as
                  guilty of the sin of selfish individualism, associated with progressive, “upstart”
                  elements of society. Fanny Price is likewise considered by Sir Thomas to exhibit “wilfulness
                  of temper, self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit, which
                  prevails so much in modern days” when she refuses to accept the socially eligible
                  Henry Crawford on the grounds that she “cannot like him . . . well enough to marry
                  him” (367, 364). The fact that the heroines of Austen’s novels are chosen for their
                  personalities rather than their wealth, beauty, or status also bespeaks the new ethos
                  of the uniqueness and worth of each individual. As Robert Polhemus notes, “the need
                  to be noticed and loved for your own distinctive self” expresses “the passion of modern
                  individualism” (45; see also 31, 54).

               <p>One type of romantic relationship common to both Austen’s novels and many Romantic
                  poems (and, in the cases of Wordsworth and Byron, their personal lives) is that involving
                  sibling incest. Both Elinor Dashwood and Emma Woodhouse marry their brothers-in-law.
                  Colonel Brandon finds in Marianne the image of his cousin Eliza, who grew up in his
                  own family like a sister. This pattern in most pronounced in <em>Mansfield Park</em>, where Fanny Price’s strongest feelings are divided between her brother William and
                  her cousin Edmund, the latter of whom has lived in the same house with her like a
                  brother since she was ten years old. One explanation for the Romantic fascination
                  with incest is that it participates in the age’s celebration of childhood; brother-and-sister
                  bonds are uniquely strong because they are based on shared childhood experiences.
                  According to the empirical philosophy of eighteenth-century thinkers such as John
                  Locke, David Hume, and David Hartley, each individual is born as a blank slate and
                  develops his or her opinions, values, fears, and desires through idiosyncratic personal
                  associations. Siblings are more likely to share personality traits than people who
                  meet later in life because they have the advantage of similar formative experiences
                  and associations (see Richardson 744). Colonel Brandon says of his beloved cousin
                  Eliza, “Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows
                  and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza” (Austen, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> 233). In <em>Mansfield Park</em>, after describing the happy reunion between Fanny and her brother William, the narrator
                  comments on the way “even the conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal. Children of the
                  same family, the same blood, with the same first associations and habits, have some
                  means of enjoyment in their power, which no subsequent connections can supply” (273).

               <p>Austen is keenly aware of the errors of selfishness, self-absorption, and detachment
                  from others; indeed, nearly all of her flawed characters suffer from some version
                  of these traits. Such characters include Marianne as well as John and Fanny Dashwood,
                  Sir Walter Eliot, Mary Musgrove, the “bad boys” Wickham, Willoughby, and Henry Crawford,
                  Isabella and John Thorpe, Lydia Bennet, Mrs. Elton and many others, including to some
                  extent Emma Woodhouse and Elizabeth Bennet, the latter of whom like her father initially
                  uses her wit as a defensive technique to distance herself from intimacy with others.
                  But many Romantic poems likewise explore the dark side of individualism, as they depict
                  the dangers and misery of solipsistic isolation. Coleridge’s <em>Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> is one of the most disturbing poems ever written on the horrors of solitude and the
                  disastrous consequences of self-assertion, and in <em>Dejection</em> the speaker laments his loveless state and attributes to it a loss of imaginative
                  power. Shelley’s <em>Alastor</em> is also a cautionary tale about “The Spirit of Solitude” and the danger of rejecting
                  a proffered human relationship (the Arab Maid) for an illusory ideal. Wordsworth’s <em>Excursion</em> features a misguided character called The Solitary, and in 
                  “Elegiac Stanzas, Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle, in a Storm”
                   the speaker renounces his deluded, youthful conception of nature, which disconnected
                  him from the human community (“Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone, / Housed
                  in a dream, at distance from the Kind!” [53-54]). This poem, written in response to
                  John Wordsworth‘s death in a storm at sea, is perhaps an extreme statement of this
                  position, but many of Wordsworth’s most famous poems, including <em>Tintern Abbey</em>, the <em>Intimations</em> Ode, and <em>The Prelude</em>, describe a process of growth in which “Love of Nature Lead[s] to Love of Mankind,”
                  as the title of Book 8 of <em>The Prelude</em> announces.

                  </div> Keats’s odes progressively expose the emptiness and sterility of a timeless, ideal
                  realm among the society of gods and goddesses, which the speaker in <em>Ode to a Nightingale</em> ultimately finds “forlorn” of human companionship (70) and the speaker in <em>Ode on a Grecian Urn</em> rejects as “cold” and “desolate” (45, 40). Austen shares her awareness of the dangers
                  of excessive individualism with the male poets. All of these writers explore the advantages
                  and disadvantages, the gains and losses, of their age’s new conception of the unique

               <p>As has already been suggested, another major similarity between Austen’s works and
                  those of the male poets is their treatment of commonplace people and settings as fit
                  subjects of literature, written in language close to that of ordinary speech. William
                  Hazlitt famously allied Wordsworth’s celebration of humble life to the French Revolution’s
                  deposition of kings and aristocrats, but as Anne Rowland notes, Hazlitt could just
                  as well have attributed Wordsworth’s embrace of ordinary subjects and language to
                  the influence of the novel (125).

                  </div> Or, one could say that both the novel and Romantic lyric poetry reflect the democratizing
                  movement of the time, the shift away from hierarchical to more egalitarian, meritocratic
                  models of society and literature. Both genres could be written and read by men and
                  women outside of the literary elite, without a knowledge of classical languages and
                  traditional conventions of subject matter, style, and diction: the novel in that it
                  depicts contemporary, usually middle class people and their affairs in standard prose,
                  and the lyric poem in that it conveys the personal thoughts and feelings of the individual
                  speaker in language at least close to that “really spoken by men,” in Wordsworth’s
                  phrase (446).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Wordsworth provides the most obvious parallel to Austen on the adoption of commonplace
                  characters and subjects, but many of the other Romantic poets share in this trait.
                  In <em>Don Juan</em>, for example, Byron contrasts his “pedestrian Muses” to those of poets who deal in
                  the mystical or sublime (
                  “Dedication”
                   57). In addition, Byron’s choice of Don Juan for his protagonist, in stark contrast
                  to the heroic figures of previous epics (Canto 1, stanzas 1-5), is similar to Austen’s
                  choice of Catherine Morland as the protagonist of <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, a girl who has none of the grandiose virtues, talents, or physical attributes typical
                  of previous novel heroines. Both Byron and Austen present their unconventional leading
                  characters as revolutionary departures from previous literary tradition, in a shift
                  from the heroic, ideal, and implausible to the ordinary, down-to-earth, and natural.

               <p>Although the depiction of common life is an important characteristic of Romantic literature,
                  the period got its name from its association with romance, involving the remote, exotic,
                  passionate, dark, and mysterious, or even supernatural. Austen’s satire of these Romantic
                  aspects in <em>Northanger Abbey</em> and other works might seem to set her apart from the other major writers who defined
                  the era. Austen's treatment of romance is complex, however, as is that of most of
                  the male poets. The happy endings of Austen’s novels involve elements of fantasy and
                  wish-fulfillment, and many critics have argued that <em>Northanger Abbey</em> actually follows Gothic conventions. The works of the male poets too reflect tensions
                  between romance and reality, the commonplace and the exotic. Byron’s <span class="foreign">oeuvre</span> can be divided into the verse romances and the realistic satires (as well as his witty,
                  sociable letters); Keats’s career can largely be defined as a struggle between the
                  attractions of romance and commitment to the mortal world of pain and suffering; Coleridge
                  wrote poems of the supernatural but also the colloquial conversation poems, with their
                  close observation of the natural world; and Wordsworth’s poetry too, despite his condemnation
                  of Gothic sensationalism in the Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (which itself may be compared to Austen’s ridicule of the Gothic in <em>Northanger Abbey</em>), actually includes Gothic figures such as characters who suffer from madness and
                  guilt, and a brooding, mysterious, chastising presence in nature.

               <p>Austen traditionally was regarded as an advocate of reason and common sense, in contrast

                  </div> <em>Emma</em>, <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, and <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> are among the novels that appear to condemn flights of imagination and urge rationality
                  and reliance on empirical evidence in its place. The male poets, however, also frequently
                  treat the dangers of a visionary imagination that can lead one astray and cut one
                  off from connection to flesh-and-blood human beings. Works such as Shelley’s <em>Alastor</em>, Wordsworth’s <em>Elegiac Stanzas</em>, many of Keats’s poems including <em>Ode to a Nightingale</em> and <em>Ode on a Grecian Urn</em>, and Coleridge’s <em>Eolian Harp </em>and <em>Constancy to an Ideal Object</em> convey this cautionary attitude toward the imagination. In his 1813 lecture on <em>Hamlet</em>, Coleridge analyzes the protagonist’s problems in terms that directly recall the
                  errors of Emma Woodhouse and Catherine Morland. Hamlet is said to suffer from an “overbalance
                  of imagination,” so that his mind “is for ever occupied with the world within him,
                  and abstracted from external things: his words give a substance to shadows: and he
                  is dissatisfied with commonplace realities” (<em>Lectures </em>1: 544).</p>
            </div>
            <p>On the other hand, claims that Austen’s novels unequivocally condemn flights of imagination
               are undermined by many readings that note ways in which imaginative heroines supposedly
               rebuked—Catherine, Emma, Marianne—actually engage our sympathies, and a strictly rational
               perspective is also revealed to be flawed or impossible to maintain. Catherine Morland’s
               mother is completely devoid of imagination (“Her own family were plain matter-of-fact
               people” Catherine reflects [Austen, <em>Northanger Abbey</em> 62]), but she is imperceptive about the nature of her daughter’s unhappiness when
               she returns from Northanger Abbey suffering from a wounded heart. Elinor Dashwood,
               supposedly the exemplar of rational common sense, invents fictions when she believes
               the hair in a ring Edward is wearing must be her own, even though she never gave him
               a lock, and when she assumes Edward’s mother must be the cause of his coolness toward
               herself. Rather than oppose the male poets as celebrants of imagination and Austen
               as an advocate of rationality and empiricism, as with other issues treated above it
               is more accurate and productive to explore the balance or conflicts between reason
               and imagination in the works of these writers. As Lucy Newlyn notes, many scholars
               see a “duality [in] Romanticism, [a] tendency towards ambivalence, irony, and self-critique”
               (9) rather than a single, confident perspective. William Deresiewicz argues that Austen’s
               depiction of ambivalent feelings and relationships allies her with the Romantic poets,
               “for whom ambivalent feelings are their favorite feelings of all” (46).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Austen’s novels unquestionably convey support for one type of imaginative activity
                  that the male poets also championed: the sympathetic imagination, or the faculty by
                  which individuals project themselves into the thoughts and feelings of others. Percy
                  Shelley claims that “The great instrument of moral good is the imagination” in that
                  it allows one to “put himself in the place of another and of many others” (517). Keats
                  also celebrates this quality, which he calls “disinterestedness” (<em>Letters</em> 2: 79), using a term and concept he adopted from Hazlitt. All of Austen’s vindicated
                  heroines possess this capacity, which often distinguishes them from other, less empathic
                  characters. Elinor Dashwood is sensitive to the needs of others while Marianne remains
                  wrapped up in her own concerns and rudely ignores those around her. In this sense,
                  Elinor is more imaginative than Marianne. Similarly, one can say that Emma does not
                  need to suppress her imagination but shift from one form to another, from a visionary
                  to a sympathetic imagination that is directed toward entering into others’ perspectives.

               <p>Another related form of imagination Austen can be said to endorse as the male poets
                  do is the ability to lose herself in her creations. Keats praised the identityless
                  poet of “Negative Capability,” in contrast to the “[W]ordsworthian or egotistical
                  sublime” (<em>Letters</em> 1: 193-94, 386-87). For Keats, Coleridge, and Hazlitt, Shakespeare was the supreme
                  creative genius because of his protean or chameleonic ability to efface his own personality
                  as he entered into his characters. Austen has often been compared to Shakespeare in
                  her ability to create a range of fully realized characters that betray little of the
                  author’s personal identity. Indeed, Austen can be said to exemplify more than any
                  other writer of the period the Romantic ideal of the protean, Shakespearean, Negatively
                  Capable writer.

               <p>One of the major traits usually associated with Romantic poetry is a celebration of
                  nature, and Austen’s novels of manners may not appear to participate in her contemporaries’
                  love of the nonhuman world. A growing body of criticism, however, notes various ways
                  in which nature figures significantly in Austen’s work and allies it in this respect
                  with Romantic poetry. Like Wordsworth she finds cities like London, Bath, and Portsmouth
                  uncongenial and prefers rural villages and country houses, often presenting these
                  as more conducive to moral health than urban spaces. Edmund Bertram in <em>Mansfield Park </em>declares that “We do not look in great cities for our best morality” (108), much as
                  Wordsworth in <em>The Prelude</em> insists that “Love . . . does [not] thrive at ease / Among the close and overcrowded
                  haunts / Of cities, where the human heart is sick” (1850; 13.202-4). As Jonathan Bate
                  states, many of Austen’s heroines such as Fanny Price “read Cowper rather than Wordsworth,
                  but they would be broadly in sympathy with the argument of the preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> that . . . the essential passions of the heart ‘find a better soil’” in the country,
                  where “the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms
                  of nature.” In her support for human communities that are closely integrated with
                  rural life and rhythms of nature, Bate argues, “Austen comes closer to the sensibility
                  of Romanticism than we usually allow her to be” (550).

                           Austen’s and Wordsworth’s shared aversion to cities and belief that the provinces
                           are “the center of life” (65). He compares Mansfield Park to Wordsworth’s Michael.</span></div>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In addition, many key scenes in Austen’s novels take place out of doors. This is typically
                  where the hero and heroine finally come to an understanding and reveal their love
                  for one another, when they are free from the constraints of social decorum. This pattern
                  applies in <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, <em>Mansfield Park</em>, <em>Emma</em>, and <em>Persuasion</em>, and it is especially pronounced in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, where Mr. Darcy’s first proposal made indoors is rejected, whereas his second proposal,
                  made while he and Elizabeth are engaged in a long walk in the country, is accepted.
                  Elizabeth first begins to reassess her opinion of Darcy when she reads his letter
                  while walking along a country lane in Hunsford, where she has gone to “indulge herself
                  in air and exercise,” and she gains even greater respect for him when she views his
                  well-managed estate, notable for its “natural beauty . . . so little counteracted
                  by an awkward taste” (<em>Pride and Prejudice</em> 217, 271). For his part, Darcy is also attracted by Elizabeth’s engagements with the
                  natural world. The Bingley sisters disapprove when Elizabeth walks across the muddy
                  countryside to visit her sister at Netherfield Park and when she shows up at Pemberley
                  “brown and coarse” or suntanned from her summer travels (299), but in each situation
                  her outdoor exercise enhances her appeal for Darcy. Alison Sulloway points out that
                  Darcy is uncomfortable among strangers in drawing rooms and more at ease at home in
                  the country, alone or with a few close friends, and this fact, along with his pride
                  and aloofness, allies him with Mr. Rochester in Charlotte Bronte’s <em>Jane Eyre</em>, a character who is usually considered a quintessential Romantic hero (206-7). In
                  addition, as Barbara Seeber notes, some critics have seen in Darcy’s management of
                  Pemberley a type of proto-environmentalism (5). Both Elizabeth and Darcy are allied
                  with nature and this can be seen as one of the major shared values that draws them
                  together.

                           Romantic poets. Seeber’s book is devoted to exploring Austen’s engagement with non-human
                           nature, a practice that for Seeber situates her novels within the Romantic movement
                           (6-7). Deresiewicz believes Austen’s last three novels “display a new receptivity
                           to nature” informed by her reading of Romantic poetry (19; see also 20-21, 134-45).</span></div>

               </p>
            </div>
            <p>One can of course note many differences between aspects of Austen’s works and those
               of the male poets. One can also note major differences among the male poets themselves,
               however, but these distinctions do not prevent them from being studied together as
               participants in the same historical moment and literary movement. I believe Austen
               shares as many key traits with the major male poets as each one shares with the others,
               and that she can be seamlessly integrated into a Romantic period class. Studying Austen
               in context with the major male poets not only reveals aspects of Austen’s works not
               traditionally emphasized, it also sheds new light on the male poets’ works and thus
               helps transform our understanding of the Romantic era.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">One indication of this change is that, beginning with the 8<span class="sup">th</span> edition of the <em>Norton Anthology</em> (2006), the statement about Austen’s detachment from the concerns of her age is gone,
               and in several passages she is linked to the Romantic poets (Greenblatt 22; see also
               14). For other studies allying Austen with Romanticism, besides works cited above,
               see essays by Nina Auerbach, a special issue of <em>The Wordsworth Circle</em> devoted to the topic (7.4 [Autumn 1976]), Ruoff, Thomas, Tuite, Harris, and Walker.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">See Morgan, “Jane Austen and Romanticism” 366-68; Siskin 3, 11-13, and chap. 6. In
               related but somewhat different terms, Deresiewicz argues that Austen’s last three
               novels convey a new sense of time similar to Wordsworth’s (28 and passim). Although
               he doesn’t compare her to the Romantic poets, Thompson notes that “Austen’s narrative
               presents its major characters as growing or maturing or developing as separate or
               distinct or different individuals,” and he comments on “The historicity of this life
               story,” saying “Austen is the first English novelist to portray this myth in a fully
               fashioned form” (159).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Jay Clayton compares Fanny Price’s development to the scheme Keats outlines in his
               analogy of life as a mansion of many apartments. As Clayton notes, Keats’s pattern
               of growth is itself indebted to Wordsworth’s <em>Tintern Abbey</em>, and Fanny significantly keeps a transparency of Tintern Abbey in her East room sanctuary
               (67-72). Deresiewicz offers an extended comparison of Fanny in her East room and <em>Tintern Abbey</em> (56-62). Morgan sees parallels between Emma’s pattern of growth and that outlined
               in Wordsworth’s <em>Intimations</em> Ode, as well as in Blake’s poems (<em>In the Meantime</em> 44-50). Karl Kroeber employs Blake’s terms to describe the development of central
               characters in <em>Northanger Abbey</em> when he says that “the heroine progresses from innocence to experience, the hero
               from experience to redeemed innocence” (292).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               solitude, and she finds many similarities between his and Austen’s treatment of the
               value of community (see especially chap. 2). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of common life and simple language (65-67). Hazlitt allies Wordsworth’s poetry and

               Seeber’s book is devoted to exploring Austen’s engagement with non-human nature, a
               practice that for Seeber situates her novels within the Romantic movement (6-7). Deresiewicz
               believes Austen’s last three novels “display a new receptivity to nature” informed
               by her reading of Romantic poetry (19; see also 20-21, 134-45).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
