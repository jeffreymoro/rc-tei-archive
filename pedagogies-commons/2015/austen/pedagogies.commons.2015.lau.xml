                <p rend="noCount">Throughout the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, Jane
                    Austen was not treated—in published criticism or in the classroom—in
                    relation to the major male Romantic poets or thought to participate in the
                    period’s defining events and concerns, either political or literary.
                    Although these attitudes have begun to change, most scholarship on Austen
                    still treats her either in isolation or in relation to other women writers,
                    and many instructors report that they have trouble integrating Austen in
                    Romantic period courses.  My essay argues that Austen’s novels share many
                    characteristics with Romantic-era poems and can be taught alongside these in
                    a way that enhances our understanding of Romanticism.  Similarities in the
                    works of Austen and the male poets include an embrace of individualism; a
                    shift from external events to the inner life as a focus of literature; a
                    fascination with brother-sister incest; an emphasis on commonplace people and
                    settings; conflicts between the attractions of romance and reality; a
                    celebration of the sympathetic imagination and awareness of the dangers of
                    solipsism and visionary flight; and a love of the natural world.

                <p> Throughout the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, Jane Austen was not
                    treated—in published criticism or in the classroom—in relation to the major male
                    Romantic poets or thought to participate in the period’s defining events and
                    concerns, either political or literary. As late as the 7<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>
                    (2000) edition, the <title level="m">Norton Anthology's</title> "Introduction to
                    the Romantic Period" referred to Austen as “the only important author who seems
                    to be untouched by the political, intellectual, and artistic revolutions of her
                    age” (Abrams 20). In recent decades that situation has at last begun to change,
                    and an increasing body of criticism connects Austen in various ways to the
                    Romantic movement.<note place="foot" resp="editors">One indication of this
                        change is that, beginning with the 8<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> edition of the
                            <title level="m">Norton Anthology</title> (2006), the statement about
                        Austen’s detachment from the concerns of her age is gone, and in several
                        passages she is linked to the Romantic poets (Greenblatt 22; see also 14).
                        For other studies allying Austen with Romanticism, besides works cited
                        above, see essays by Nina Auerbach, a special issue of <title level="j">The
                            Wordsworth Circle</title> devoted to the topic (7.4 [Autumn 1976]),
                        Ruoff, Thomas, Tuite, Harris, and Walker.</note> But old habits apparently
                    die hard. Most scholarship on Austen still treats her either in isolation, in
                    relation to other novelists, or in conjunction with other women writers.
                    Anecdotal evidence also indicates that many instructors still have trouble
                    integrating Austen in Romantic period courses and either omit her altogether,
                    or, if they include one of her novels, emphasize its differences from the poetry
                    of the major male poets. My most recent experience of this response was at a
                    NASSR 2013 roundtable discussion of the various period courses in which Austen
                    is taught (Eighteenth-Century, Romantic, Victorian), when an audience member
                    declared that Austen has nothing in common with the male Romantic poets.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> The session was entitled “Austen Over Time,”
                        organized and moderated by Debra Gettelman and Shawn Maurer. </note>
                </p>
                <p> I am committed to teaching Austen in my Romantics classes alongside William
                    Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Blake, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe
                    Shelley, and John Keats. In the first place, I consider it essential to include
                    the major novelist of the period in such courses—indeed, it is as inappropriate
                    to leave her out as it would be to omit Wordsworth or any other central figure
                    of the age. Moreover, one need not view Austen’s work as a departure from trends
                    that characterize Romantic poetry. Many central connections can be explored
                    between Austen’s novels and Romantic poems that have been, as it were, hiding in
                    plain sight all along. I do wish to make clear that I’m not arguing for teaching
                    only the “big six” poets plus Austen, or for viewing her solely in relation to
                    these writers. In my courses I do include other women writers (and often, due to
                    time constraints, leave out one or more of the major male poets) and address
                    various similarities and differences among all of the works treated. In this
                    essay, however, I focus on connections between Austen and the major male poets
                    because her supposed differences from them are what kept her out of the Romantic
                    canon in the past and, I believe, still prove a stumbling block for many
                    instructors. </p>
                <p>One of the major distinctions commonly made between Austen and the male poets is
                    that her works advocate relationships and community whereas theirs celebrate the
                    isolated self, but Austen’s novels definitely participate in the philosophy of
                    individualism that evolved in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                    centuries, as a result of various developments. These include an increasing
                    emphasis on the subjective nature of reality in response to the empirical,
                    skeptical, and associationist philosophies of mind prevalent in the eighteenth
                    century, according to which each individual’s perception of the external world
                    is unique and no universal values or conceptions may be assumed. In addition,
                    the rise of capitalism and new modes of labor and production broke down
                    traditional feudal and familial ties and encouraged competition and
                    self-reliance, but also alienation from stable relationships and rhythms of
                    life. Protestantism contributed to individualism with its emphasis on
                    self-analysis and a direct personal relationship between each person and God.
                    Finally, the growth of a more democratic and fluid society encouraged personal
                    ambition and the desire to aspire beyond the condition in which one was born.
                    The question of whether Austen was conservative or progressive in her political
                    outlook has been hotly debated, but as Mary Poovey states, even those with
                    conservative sympathies “were influenced during this period by the rhetoric and
                    practices of individualism” (181).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also
                        Thompson 7-8. Other critics who explore the rise of individualism,
                        subjectivity, and privacy in relation to Austen and other Romantic writers
                        include Hart and Swingle.</note></p>
                <p>As several critics have noted, Austen shares with the Romantic poets a new
                    understanding of the self as developmental, evolving over time.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> See Morgan, “Jane Austen and Romanticism”
                        366-68; Siskin 3, 11-13, and chap. 6. In related but somewhat different
                        terms, Deresiewicz argues that Austen’s last three novels convey a new sense
                        of time similar to Wordsworth’s (28 and passim). Although he doesn’t compare
                        her to the Romantic poets, Thompson notes that “Austen’s narrative presents
                        its major characters as growing or maturing or developing as separate or
                        distinct or different individuals,” and he comments on “The historicity of
                        this life story,” saying “Austen is the first English novelist to portray
                        this myth in a fully fashioned form” (159).</note> All of her novels can be
                    characterized as <foreign>Bildungsroman</foreign>, a genre that developed in
                    the late eighteenth century, which depicts the maturation or coming of age of a
                    unique individual (see Stelzig 1-15). Wordsworth is especially relevant to
                    compare with Austen on this point, as many of his best-known poems—"Tintern
                    Abbey," "Intimations of Immortality," <title level="m">The Prelude</title>—are
                    concerned with the passage from childhood or youth to adulthood, but all of the
                    male poets address this issue in some fashion. Blake’s <title level="m">Songs of
                        Innocence and Experience</title> are concerned with stages of mental
                    development, and Coleridge’s poems depicting a fall from one state to another
                    ("Ancient Mariner," <title level="m">Christabel</title>) can also be read as
                    explorations of psychological evolution. Keats frequently addresses the need to
                    progress through the stages of life from a youthful and sensuous to more
                    intellectual and compassionate, both in his poems and in letters such as those
                    describing life as a “Mansion of Many Apartments” and of life as a “vale of
                    Soul-making” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 1: 280-81, 2: 101-4).<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> Jay Clayton compares Fanny Price’s development
                        to the scheme Keats outlines in his analogy of life as a mansion of many
                        apartments. As Clayton notes, Keats’s pattern of growth is itself indebted
                        to Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Tintern Abbey</title>, and Fanny
                        significantly keeps a transparency of Tintern Abbey in her East room
                        sanctuary (67-72). Deresiewicz offers an extended comparison of Fanny in her
                        East room and <title level="m">Tintern Abbey</title> (56-62). Morgan sees
                        parallels between Emma’s pattern of growth and that outlined in Wordsworth’s
                            <title level="m">Intimations</title> Ode, as well as in Blake’s poems

                        Blake’s terms to describe the development of central characters in <title
                            level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> when he says that “the heroine
                        progresses from innocence to experience, the hero from experience to
                        redeemed innocence” (292). </note></p>
                <p>Marlon Ross argues that “rituals of maturation” in literature of the Romantic
                    period are “culturally and gender-determined,” so that models of development are
                    starkly different for male and female writers, the latter of whom do not depict
                    a “struggle toward self-discovery” (234). Womanhood during the early nineteenth
                    century “is assumed . . . to be something stable,” and female maturity involves
                    “the agreement not to desire independent individuality” (Ross 159, 161).<note

                    Although variations can be noted in female and male life stories in Romantic
                    literature, Austen certainly is similar to her male contemporaries in depicting
                    the passage of an individual from immaturity to adulthood, and her heroines also
                    clearly “struggle toward self-discovery” and achieve “independent individuality”
                    in their maturation process. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, some might say that Austen champions maturity whereas many of
                    the male poets celebrate childhood and lament the passage to adulthood (e.g.,
                    Mellor 275, 279), but in truth all of these writers reflect nuance and
                    complexity as they explore the advantages and disadvantages of innocence and
                    experience. Two works that are particularly relevant to compare on the topic of
                    the pros and cons of maturation are <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility
                    </title>and “Tintern Abbey.” Both Marianne Dashwood and
                    the speaker in Wordsworth’s poem go through a similar process of evolving from a
                    passionate state to a more sober one as they relinquish their youthful love for
                    what seemed an all-consuming sublime or heroic presence (Willoughby for Marianne
                    and Nature for Wordsworth), that they come to realize was largely a self-created
                    projection of their own desires. Wordsworth in many ways seems to prefer and
                    yearn for his earlier intense relationship with Nature, just as many readers
                    feel that Marianne’s relationship with Willoughby remains more vital and
                    authentic than that with the flannel-waistcoated Colonel Brandon, whom she
                    marries after acquiring a “more calm and sober judgment” (429) and diminished
                        expectations.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See my “<title level="m"

                <p>Another way in which Austen’s novels reflect the Romantic period’s focus on
                    individual subjectivity is in their depiction of the heroines’ inner lives. It
                    is commonplace to observe that little significant action occurs in Austen’s
                    fiction; the drama takes place in the internal struggles of her characters.
                    Although the heroines certainly interact with others, their most significant
                    moments—and often the climaxes of the novels—involve solitary meditation. One
                    thinks of Marianne’s serious reconsideration of her conduct during her illness,
                    which she only later confesses to her sister; of Elizabeth’s reflections and
                    self-recriminations after reading Darcy’s letter as she strolls about the
                    grounds of Hunsford; of Emma’s mortified private analyses of her behavior and
                    feelings after Mr. Elton’s proposal, the expedition to Box Hill, and Harriet’s
                    confession of her love for Mr. Knightley; of Catherine’s remorseful hours alone
                    with her own thoughts after Henry learns of her dark suspicions about his
                    father; and of Elinor’s, Fanny’s, and Anne’s many periods of private reflection
                    on past events and probable future outcomes. The latter is the most
                    introspective of all Austen’s heroines: Adela Pinch notes how “Anne is often so
                    occupied with her own rumination and recollection that impressions from the
                    outside seem to have a hard time finding their way in” (152). </p>
                <p>Wordsworth declares that one of the chief characteristics of his <title level="m"
                        >Lyrical Ballads</title> is that “the feeling therein developed gives
                    importance to the action and situation, and not the action and situation to the
                    feeling” (448), and in poems such as <title level="a">Hart-Leap Well,</title>
                    <title level="a">Simon Lee,</title> and <title level="a">The Idiot Boy,</title>
                    he confronts the reader’s expectation for some sensational “tale” and announces
                    that instead of plot-driven narratives he tells “simple song[s] for thinking
                    hearts” (<title level="a">Heart-Leap Well</title> 97, 100), where the interest
                    lies in personal responses to experiences of everyday life. In the
                    quintessential Romantic lyric (such as Coleridge’s conversation poems, Percy
                    Shelley’s <title level="a">Ode to the West Wind,</title> and Keats’s odes), a
                    drama unfolds in the speaker’s inner debate as he struggles with a personal
                    conflict and eventually achieves a measure of resolution. In Austen and the
                    Romantic poets, the focus of literature moves from external events to the inner
                    life of the individual.</p>
                <p>Walter Scott noted the revolutionary quality of Austen’s novels when he
                    contrasted the “Big Bow-Wow strain” of his own works, which feature major
                    historical events and provide little psychological depth in their depiction of
                    characters, to her “talent for describing the involvements and feelings and
                    characters of ordinary life” (Southam 106). As the 8<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>
                    edition of <title level="m">The Norton Anthology</title>'s "Introduction to the
                    Romantic Period" notes, Austen’s model proved to be more influential than
                    Scott’s in the history of the novel, which has continued to emphasize “the mind
                    in flux” over action-driven plots (Greenblatt 22). Clifford Siskin argues that
                    both Austen’s novels and Romantic poems reflect a “lyric turn” in literary
                    history, and claims that in Austen we see the beginning of the “lyricization of
                    the novel” (132). Gabrielle Starr, like Siskin, insists that fiction and poetry
                    of the Romantic period share in the same developments and ought to be studied
                    together. According to Starr, Romantic poetry was influenced by the novel, which
                    was the first genre to depict “private experience and the inner world” of
                    middle-class people in domestic settings (7). Whether the Romantic novel was
                    lyricized or Romantic poetry was novelized, both genres reflect the period’s new
                    emphasis on depicting personal thoughts and emotions.</p>
                <p>The fact that Austen’s novels revolve around courtship plots may appear to
                    challenge the claim that her works subscribe to an individualist ethos. However,
                    the very notion that marriage ought to involve love, compatibility between
                    partners, and personal fulfillment is associated with new beliefs in “affective
                    individualism” and the validity of personal happiness (Johnson 90-91; see also
                    77-84). Elizabeth Bennet clearly suggests the association of romantic love with
                    democratic notions of each individual’s right to “the pursuit of happiness” (in
                    the words of the Preamble to the American Declaration of Independence), when she
                    tells Lady Catherine, who wants Elizabeth to promise that she will never marry
                    Darcy, “I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion,
                    constitute my happiness, without reference to <emph>you</emph>, or to any person
                    so wholly unconnected with me” (396). By refusing to acknowledge the superior
                    claim to Darcy of Miss De Bourgh, who was intended as his wife by both Lady
                    Catherine and Darcy’s mother, Elizabeth is branded an “‘Obstinate, headstrong
                    girl’” and an “‘upstart . . . young woman without family, connections, or
                    fortune’” (394-95). Mrs. Bennet makes a similar charge after Elizabeth refuses
                    to marry Mr. Collins on the ground that her “feelings in every respect forbid
                    it” (122). For Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth is a “headstrong foolish girl” who
                    “car[es] no more for [her family] than if we were at York, provided she can have
                    her own way” (123, 126). By insisting on marrying for love instead of for the
                    benefit of her own or her husband’s family, Elizabeth is regarded by those who
                    adhere to a more traditional view of marriage as guilty of the sin of selfish
                    individualism, associated with progressive, “upstart” elements of society. Fanny
                    Price is likewise considered by Sir Thomas to exhibit “wilfulness of temper,
                    self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit, which prevails
                    so much in modern days” when she refuses to accept the socially eligible Henry
                    Crawford on the grounds that she “cannot like him . . . well enough to marry
                    him” (367, 364). The fact that the heroines of Austen’s novels are chosen for
                    their personalities rather than their wealth, beauty, or status also bespeaks
                    the new ethos of the uniqueness and worth of each individual. As Robert Polhemus
                    notes, “the need to be noticed and loved for your own distinctive self”
                    expresses “the passion of modern individualism” (45; see also 31, 54).<note

                </p>
                <p>One type of romantic relationship common to both Austen’s novels and many
                    Romantic poems (and, in the cases of Wordsworth and Byron, their personal lives)
                    is that involving sibling incest. Both Elinor Dashwood and Emma Woodhouse marry
                    their brothers-in-law. Colonel Brandon finds in Marianne the image of his cousin
                    Eliza, who grew up in his own family like a sister. This pattern in most
                    pronounced in <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, where Fanny Price’s
                    strongest feelings are divided between her brother William and her cousin
                    Edmund, the latter of whom has lived in the same house with her like a brother
                    since she was ten years old. One explanation for the Romantic fascination with
                    incest is that it participates in the age’s celebration of childhood;
                    brother-and-sister bonds are uniquely strong because they are based on shared
                    childhood experiences. According to the empirical philosophy of
                    eighteenth-century thinkers such as John Locke, David Hume, and David Hartley,
                    each individual is born as a blank slate and develops his or her opinions,
                    values, fears, and desires through idiosyncratic personal associations. Siblings
                    are more likely to share personality traits than people who meet later in life
                    because they have the advantage of similar formative experiences and
                    associations (see Richardson 744). Colonel Brandon says of his beloved cousin
                    Eliza, “Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were
                    playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza”
                    (Austen, <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 233). In <title
                        level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, after describing the happy reunion between
                    Fanny and her brother William, the narrator comments on the way “even the
                    conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal. Children of the same family, the same
                    blood, with the same first associations and habits, have some means of enjoyment
                    in their power, which no subsequent connections can supply” (273).<note

                </p>
                <p>Austen is keenly aware of the errors of selfishness, self-absorption, and
                    detachment from others; indeed, nearly all of her flawed characters suffer from
                    some version of these traits. Such characters include Marianne as well as John
                    and Fanny Dashwood, Sir Walter Eliot, Mary Musgrove, the “bad boys” Wickham,
                    Willoughby, and Henry Crawford, Isabella and John Thorpe, Lydia Bennet, Mrs.
                    Elton and many others, including to some extent Emma Woodhouse and Elizabeth
                    Bennet, the latter of whom like her father initially uses her wit as a defensive
                    technique to distance herself from intimacy with others. But many Romantic poems
                    likewise explore the dark side of individualism, as they depict the dangers and
                    misery of solipsistic isolation. Coleridge’s <title level="m">Rime of the
                        Ancient Mariner</title> is one of the most disturbing poems ever written on
                    the horrors of solitude and the disastrous consequences of self-assertion, and
                    in <title level="m">Dejection</title> the speaker laments his loveless state and
                    attributes to it a loss of imaginative power. Shelley’s <title level="m"
                        >Alastor</title> is also a cautionary tale about “The Spirit of Solitude”
                    and the danger of rejecting a proffered human relationship (the Arab Maid) for
                    an illusory ideal. Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Excursion</title> features a
                    misguided character called The Solitary, and in <title level="a">Elegiac
                        Stanzas, Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle, in a Storm</title> the
                    speaker renounces his deluded, youthful conception of nature, which disconnected
                    him from the human community (“Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone, /
                    Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind!” [53-54]). This poem, written in
                    response to John Wordsworth‘s death in a storm at sea, is perhaps an extreme
                    statement of this position, but many of Wordsworth’s most famous poems,
                    including <title level="m">Tintern Abbey</title>, the <title level="m"
                        >Intimations</title> Ode, and <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, describe
                    a process of growth in which “Love of Nature Lead[s] to Love of Mankind,” as the
                    title of Book 8 of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> announces.<note

                        mischaracterized as a poet of ego and solitude, and she finds many
                        similarities between his and Austen’s treatment of the value of community
                        (see especially chap. 2). </note> Keats’s odes progressively expose the
                    emptiness and sterility of a timeless, ideal realm among the society of gods and
                    goddesses, which the speaker in <title level="m">Ode to a Nightingale</title>
                    ultimately finds “forlorn” of human companionship (70) and the speaker in <title
                        level="m">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title> rejects as “cold” and “desolate” (45,
                    40). Austen shares her awareness of the dangers of excessive individualism with
                    the male poets. All of these writers explore the advantages and disadvantages,
                    the gains and losses, of their age’s new conception of the unique self.</p>
                <p>As has already been suggested, another major similarity between Austen’s works
                    and those of the male poets is their treatment of commonplace people and
                    settings as fit subjects of literature, written in language close to that of
                    ordinary speech. William Hazlitt famously allied Wordsworth’s celebration of
                    humble life to the French Revolution’s deposition of kings and aristocrats, but
                    as Anne Rowland notes, Hazlitt could just as well have attributed Wordsworth’s
                    embrace of ordinary subjects and language to the influence of the novel
                        (125).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stuart Tave was one of the first
                        critics to connect Wordsworth’s and Austen’s embrace of common life and
                        simple language (65-67). Hazlitt allies Wordsworth’s poetry and the French
                        Revolution in his lecture “On the Living Poets” (161-62).</note> Or, one
                    could say that both the novel and Romantic lyric poetry reflect the
                    democratizing movement of the time, the shift away from hierarchical to more
                    egalitarian, meritocratic models of society and literature. Both genres could be
                    written and read by men and women outside of the literary elite, without a
                    knowledge of classical languages and traditional conventions of subject matter,
                    style, and diction: the novel in that it depicts contemporary, usually middle
                    class people and their affairs in standard prose, and the lyric poem in that it
                    conveys the personal thoughts and feelings of the individual speaker in language
                    at least close to that “really spoken by men,” in Wordsworth’s phrase (446). </p>
                <p>Wordsworth provides the most obvious parallel to Austen on the adoption of
                    commonplace characters and subjects, but many of the other Romantic poets share
                    in this trait. In <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, for example, Byron
                    contrasts his “pedestrian Muses” to those of poets who deal in the mystical or
                    sublime (<title level="a">Dedication</title> 57). In addition, Byron’s choice of
                    Don Juan for his protagonist, in stark contrast to the heroic figures of
                    previous epics (Canto 1, stanzas 1-5), is similar to Austen’s choice of
                    Catherine Morland as the protagonist of <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title>, a girl who has none of the grandiose virtues, talents, or
                    physical attributes typical of previous novel heroines. Both Byron and Austen
                    present their unconventional leading characters as revolutionary departures from
                    previous literary tradition, in a shift from the heroic, ideal, and implausible
                    to the ordinary, down-to-earth, and natural.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                <p>Although the depiction of common life is an important characteristic of Romantic
                    literature, the period got its name from its association with romance, involving
                    the remote, exotic, passionate, dark, and mysterious, or even supernatural.
                    Austen’s satire of these Romantic aspects in <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title> and other works might seem to set her apart from the other
                    major writers who defined the era. Austen's treatment of romance is complex,
                    however, as is that of most of the male poets. The happy endings of Austen’s
                    novels involve elements of fantasy and wish-fulfillment, and many critics have
                    argued that <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> actually follows Gothic
                    conventions. The works of the male poets too reflect tensions between romance
                    and reality, the commonplace and the exotic. Byron’s <foreign>oeuvre</foreign> can be divided into the verse romances and the realistic
                    satires (as well as his witty, sociable letters); Keats’s career can largely be
                    defined as a struggle between the attractions of romance and commitment to the
                    mortal world of pain and suffering; Coleridge wrote poems of the supernatural
                    but also the colloquial conversation poems, with their close observation of the
                    natural world; and Wordsworth’s poetry too, despite his condemnation of Gothic
                    sensationalism in the Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (which
                    itself may be compared to Austen’s ridicule of the Gothic in <title level="m"
                        >Northanger Abbey</title>), actually includes Gothic figures such as
                    characters who suffer from madness and guilt, and a brooding, mysterious,
                    chastising presence in nature.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On Gothic

                    Exploring conflicts or tensions between romance and reality yields many
                    similarities between Austen’s works and those of the male poets. Two particular
                    works I have compared on this topic are <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title> and Keats’s <title level="m">The Eve of St. Agnes</title>.
                    Both express a criticism of young women who lose touch with reality from their
                    engagement with supernatural tales, but both also participate in the romance
                    they ostensibly satirize (“Jane Austen and John Keats” 99-107). </p>
                <p>Austen traditionally was regarded as an advocate of reason and common sense, in
                    contrast to the male poets who were considered celebrants of the creative
                        imagination.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This point is made by Mellor

                    <title level="m">Emma</title>, <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, and
                        <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> are among the novels that
                    appear to condemn flights of imagination and urge rationality and reliance on
                    empirical evidence in its place. The male poets, however, also frequently treat
                    the dangers of a visionary imagination that can lead one astray and cut one off
                    from connection to flesh-and-blood human beings. Works such as Shelley’s <title
                        level="m">Alastor</title>, Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Elegiac
                        Stanzas</title>, many of Keats’s poems including <title level="m">Ode to a
                        Nightingale</title> and <title level="m">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title>, and
                    Coleridge’s <title level="m">Eolian Harp </title>and <title level="m">Constancy
                        to an Ideal Object</title> convey this cautionary attitude toward the
                    imagination. In his 1813 lecture on <title level="m">Hamlet</title>, Coleridge
                    analyzes the protagonist’s problems in terms that directly recall the errors of
                    Emma Woodhouse and Catherine Morland. Hamlet is said to suffer from an
                    “overbalance of imagination,” so that his mind “is for ever occupied with the
                    world within him, and abstracted from external things: his words give a
                    substance to shadows: and he is dissatisfied with commonplace realities” (<title
                        level="m">Lectures </title>1: 544). </p>
                <p>On the other hand, claims that Austen’s novels unequivocally condemn flights of
                    imagination are undermined by many readings that note ways in which imaginative
                    heroines supposedly rebuked—Catherine, Emma, Marianne—actually engage our
                    sympathies, and a strictly rational perspective is also revealed to be flawed or
                    impossible to maintain. Catherine Morland’s mother is completely devoid of
                    imagination (“Her own family were plain matter-of-fact people” Catherine
                    reflects [Austen, <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> 62]), but she is
                    imperceptive about the nature of her daughter’s unhappiness when she returns
                    from Northanger Abbey suffering from a wounded heart. Elinor Dashwood,
                    supposedly the exemplar of rational common sense, invents fictions when she
                    believes the hair in a ring Edward is wearing must be her own, even though she
                    never gave him a lock, and when she assumes Edward’s mother must be the cause of
                    his coolness toward herself. Rather than oppose the male poets as celebrants of
                    imagination and Austen as an advocate of rationality and empiricism, as with
                    other issues treated above it is more accurate and productive to explore the
                    balance or conflicts between reason and imagination in the works of these
                    writers. As Lucy Newlyn notes, many scholars see a “duality [in] Romanticism,
                    [a] tendency towards ambivalence, irony, and self-critique” (9) rather than a
                    single, confident perspective. William Deresiewicz argues that Austen’s
                    depiction of ambivalent feelings and relationships allies her with the Romantic
                    poets, “for whom ambivalent feelings are their favorite feelings of all”
                    (46).</p>
                <p>Austen’s novels unquestionably convey support for one type of imaginative
                    activity that the male poets also championed: the sympathetic imagination, or
                    the faculty by which individuals project themselves into the thoughts and
                    feelings of others. Percy Shelley claims that “The great instrument of moral
                    good is the imagination” in that it allows one to “put himself in the place of
                    another and of many others” (517). Keats also celebrates this quality, which he
                    calls “disinterestedness” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 2: 79), using a term
                    and concept he adopted from Hazlitt. All of Austen’s vindicated heroines possess
                    this capacity, which often distinguishes them from other, less empathic
                    characters. Elinor Dashwood is sensitive to the needs of others while Marianne
                    remains wrapped up in her own concerns and rudely ignores those around her. In
                    this sense, Elinor is more imaginative than Marianne. Similarly, one can say
                    that Emma does not need to suppress her imagination but shift from one form to
                    another, from a visionary to a sympathetic imagination that is directed toward
                    entering into others’ perspectives.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On this

                    imagination, from an agency that transports us “away from all our troubles”
                    (“I stood tip-toe upon a little hill” 138) to an
                    ideal realm, one that engages us with mortal men and women and the natural world

                </p>
                <p>Another related form of imagination Austen can be said to endorse as the male
                    poets do is the ability to lose herself in her creations. Keats praised the
                    identityless poet of “Negative Capability,” in contrast to the “[W]ordsworthian
                    or egotistical sublime” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 1: 193-94, 386-87).
                    For Keats, Coleridge, and Hazlitt, Shakespeare was the supreme creative genius
                    because of his protean or chameleonic ability to efface his own personality as
                    he entered into his characters. Austen has often been compared to Shakespeare in
                    her ability to create a range of fully realized characters that betray little of
                    the author’s personal identity. Indeed, Austen can be said to exemplify more
                    than any other writer of the period the Romantic ideal of the protean,
                    Shakespearean, Negatively Capable writer.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For

                <p>One of the major traits usually associated with Romantic poetry is a celebration
                    of nature, and Austen’s novels of manners may not appear to participate in her
                    contemporaries’ love of the nonhuman world. A growing body of criticism,
                    however, notes various ways in which nature figures significantly in Austen’s
                    work and allies it in this respect with Romantic poetry. Like Wordsworth she
                    finds cities like London, Bath, and Portsmouth uncongenial and prefers rural
                    villages and country houses, often presenting these as more conducive to moral
                    health than urban spaces. Edmund Bertram in <title level="m">Mansfield Park
                    </title>declares that “We do not look in great cities for our best morality”
                    (108), much as Wordsworth in <title level="m">The Prelude</title> insists that
                    “Love . . . does [not] thrive at ease / Among the close and overcrowded haunts /
                    Of cities, where the human heart is sick” (1850; 13.202-4). As Jonathan Bate
                    states, many of Austen’s heroines such as Fanny Price “read Cowper rather than
                    Wordsworth, but they would be broadly in sympathy with the argument of the
                    preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> that . . . the essential
                    passions of the heart ‘find a better soil’” in the country, where “the passions
                    of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature.” In
                    her support for human communities that are closely integrated with rural life
                    and rhythms of nature, Bate argues, “Austen comes closer to the sensibility of
                    Romanticism than we usually allow her to be” (550).<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> Bate quotes from "Wordsworth’s Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>" 447. Stuart Tave also notes Austen’s and
                        Wordsworth’s shared aversion to cities and belief that the provinces are
                        “the center of life” (65). He compares <title level="m">Mansfield
                            Park</title> to Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Michael</title>. </note>
                </p>
                <p>In addition, many key scenes in Austen’s novels take place out of doors. This is
                    typically where the hero and heroine finally come to an understanding and reveal
                    their love for one another, when they are free from the constraints of social
                    decorum. This pattern applies in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>,
                        <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, <title level="m">Emma</title>, and
                        <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, and it is especially pronounced in
                        <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>, where Mr. Darcy’s first
                    proposal made indoors is rejected, whereas his second proposal, made while he
                    and Elizabeth are engaged in a long walk in the country, is accepted. Elizabeth
                    first begins to reassess her opinion of Darcy when she reads his letter while
                    walking along a country lane in Hunsford, where she has gone to “indulge herself
                    in air and exercise,” and she gains even greater respect for him when she views
                    his well-managed estate, notable for its “natural beauty . . . so little
                    counteracted by an awkward taste” (<title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>
                    217, 271). For his part, Darcy is also attracted by Elizabeth’s engagements with
                    the natural world. The Bingley sisters disapprove when Elizabeth walks across
                    the muddy countryside to visit her sister at Netherfield Park and when she shows
                    up at Pemberley “brown and coarse” or suntanned from her summer travels (299),
                    but in each situation her outdoor exercise enhances her appeal for Darcy. Alison
                    Sulloway points out that Darcy is uncomfortable among strangers in drawing rooms
                    and more at ease at home in the country, alone or with a few close friends, and
                    this fact, along with his pride and aloofness, allies him with Mr. Rochester in
                    Charlotte Bronte’s <title level="m">Jane Eyre</title>, a character who is
                    usually considered a quintessential Romantic hero (206-7). In addition, as
                    Barbara Seeber notes, some critics have seen in Darcy’s management of Pemberley
                    a type of proto-environmentalism (5). Both Elizabeth and Darcy are allied with
                    nature and this can be seen as one of the major shared values that draws them
                        together.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the importance of the

                        Altomari; all draw parallels to Wordsworth or other Romantic poets. Seeber’s
                        book is devoted to exploring Austen’s engagement with non-human nature, a
                        practice that for Seeber situates her novels within the Romantic movement
                        (6-7). Deresiewicz believes Austen’s last three novels “display a new
                        receptivity to nature” informed by her reading of Romantic poetry (19; see
                        also 20-21, 134-45). </note>
                </p>
                <p>One can of course note many differences between aspects of Austen’s works and
                    those of the male poets. One can also note major differences among the male
                    poets themselves, however, but these distinctions do not prevent them from being
                    studied together as participants in the same historical moment and literary
                    movement. I believe Austen shares as many key traits with the major male poets
                    as each one shares with the others, and that she can be seamlessly integrated
                    into a Romantic period class. Studying Austen in context with the major male
                    poets not only reveals aspects of Austen’s works not traditionally emphasized,
                    it also sheds new light on the male poets’ works and thus helps transform our
                    understanding of the Romantic era.</p>
