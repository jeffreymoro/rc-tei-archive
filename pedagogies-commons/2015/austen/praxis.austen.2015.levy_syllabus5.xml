                <div type="section">        
            <p rend="noCount">The recent publication of many major Romantic-era literary manuscripts in digital
                form has greatly expanded the possibilities for engagement with archival materials
                (materials that are typically held in special collections, in the US and the UK, and
                accessible only to senior experts in the field). In this course, we will closely
                read and interpret a range of these digital manuscripts to ask a series of questions
                about them, including: What can we learn -- about literary history, authorship, and
                the texts themselves -- by studying original manuscripts? How does reading a text in
                its original manuscript form (via a digital copy) differ from reading a printed
                text? How successfully do digital editions represent the original manuscripts? Our
                readings will focus on the manuscripts of Jane Austen, Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary
                Shelley, and Dorothy Wordsworth. Some of the specific questions we will ask are: How
                (and why) did Jane Austen have to modify her style and subject matter to get her
                fiction into print? What strategies did Byron use to negotiate the problems of
                censorship, as his texts moved from manuscript to print? Did Percy Shelley improve
                or diminish Mary Shelley’s novel, <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, with his
                extensive edits? Why are there so few corrections to Keats’s poetic manuscripts? Why
                did Dorothy Wordsworth publish so little of her writing during her lifetime? In
                addition to focusing on these authors, we will also explore the manuscript writing
                of many other more obscure or unknown authors of the period. We will also study
                theories of textual editing and digital remediation. For their final project,
                students can choose between creating an annotated and contextualized digital or
                print “edition” of a manuscript text we read in class, or a research essay.</p>

                            following questions: (1) These stories are funny – largely because they
                            parody existing fictional conventions. Even if you are not steeped in
                            the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> c. fiction Austen was reading, find
                            at least two comical elements from the stories to discuss; (2) What
                            might have made these stories more suitable for circulation within a
                            family, as opposed to public circulation via print? Specific examples
                            are helpful. (3) What are some of the more serious elements in this
                            fiction? How does Austen speak to the predicament of women in her
                            society; or issues of class, or politics, in these works?

            <p rend="noCount">Helpful details: Mary Shelley wrote a draft of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
                which still survives today. This draft is the basis for Robinson’s text in <title level="m">The Original Frankenstein</title> (and for some of the online
                manuscripts (mss) in the Shelley-Godwin Archive). Robinson, in <title level="m">The
                    Original Frankenstein</title> includes two versions of the draft: the first
                includes Percy’s revisions in <emph>italics</emph>. It also supplies
                missing sections of the draft with chapters from the printed 1818 edition; the
                second version removes Percy’s revisions – taking us back (as far as possible) to
                Mary’s draft before Percy intervened. Mary Shelley published a first edition of the
                novel (incorporating Percy’s revisions) in 1818 and a subsequent, heavily revised
                edition in 1831. For this class, we will be mostly exploring the draft version and
                the 1818 print version. However, since it is too much to read all three, please pick
                at least one to focus on closely (in addition to the specific assignment below).</p>

                        discrepancies. Focus your analysis on the following questions: (1) What are
                        the major omissions and additions in the chapter, and what is their
                        significance? (2) Are Percy Shelley’s additions/corrections retained in the
                        printed edition, and, if so, what is their effect on the meaning? (3) Does
                        Mary Shelley make any significant changes between manuscript and print, and
                        if so, why?</cell>

            <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Presentation #1</hi>: Here you are presenting new material on the
                author that we have read for the week. Your presentation should be around 10-15
                minutes. It will provide a brief overview of the text that you have read. However,
                most of your time should be spent focusing on some aspect of the text that you find
                interesting. Perhaps you will choose to relate it to the readings for the week?
                Perhaps you will look at the composition, publication or reception history? Ideally,
                you will choose an author you are interested in working on for your first essay or
                project, and use this as an opportunity to deepen your understanding of the author’s
                work. All presentations should be summarized in a handout, or PowerPoint, as you
                like, to be posted to canvas no later than a day after you have given the
                presentation.</p>
            <p rend="noCount"><hi rend="bold">Presentation #2</hi>: For this presentation, you are responsible for
                a lengthy work of scholarship on our week’s readings. Your presentation should be
                10-15 minutes in length. For monographs, you should provide a summary of the basic
                argument that the author is making. You will want to review the evidence he/she
                presents. Most importantly, however, you should offer your evaluation of the book.
                What readings or analysis do you agree or disagree with, and why? How is the book
                written – is it accessible or difficult to follow? For editions, you will be asked
                to provide a detailed assessment of the structure and contents of the volume(s).
                What kind of an edition is it? How are variants noted? How useable is the text? For
                either a monograph or critical edition, you are welcome to consult other reviews
                (just be sure to include citations in your presentation write-up). All presentations
                should be summarized in a handout, or PowerPoint, as you like, to be posted to
                canvas no later than two days after you have given the presentation.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">For both presentations, I am open to substitutions of other texts. Just run your
                ideas by me.</p>
