            <p rend="noCount">This essay explores the challenges of teaching literature in the
               unique setting of higher education programs in correctional institutions.
               Based on the author's experience teaching a romantic-literature course in
               prison, it explores some of the cultural and logistical obstacles at play in
               prison education and possibilities for how these obstacles can be
               successfully negotiated. Finally, it suggests possible examples of how to
               adapt Austen for other nontraditional audiences.

            <p>There might seem to be few less auspicious settings for a discussion of Jane Austen
               than a classroom in a men’s penitentiary. In fact, when I mentioned to a colleague
               that I had taught <title level="m">Perusasion</title> behind bars, she related a
               telling anecdote: In describing a proposed prison higher education program to a
               university administrator, when asked to talk about course content, she used Austen as
               the paradigmatic example of what <emph>not</emph> to teach in prison. But in our age
               when her novels have found vast new audiences through films and even, unbelievably,
               popular mashup horror fiction, perhaps the notion of Austen in prison blues may be
               easier to entertain.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 2012 I had the opportunity to teach as a volunteer instructor at the
               Education Justice Project, a program based at the University of Illinois at
               Urbana-Champaign and serving Danville Correctional Center, a medium-high security
               men’s prison about 40 miles away from campus.<note place="foot"
                  resp="editors"> For more information on the Education Justice Project, see
                     <ref target="http://www.educationjustice.net"
                     >its website</ref>.</note> The brainchild of Rebecca
               Ginsburg, a UIUC professor of landscape architecture, EJP has one paid staffer and
               survives on donations of time, money, and labor, primarily by professors, graduate
               students, and community members who serve as administrators, teachers, tutors, and
               workshop leaders. Unlike the prison’s adult basic education, high school equivalency,
               and community college programs, EJP does not receive any funds from the state. Its
               exclusive focus is on upper-level college instruction. Only students who have
               completed the equivalent of an Associate’s Degree are accepted into the program, and
               although EJP itself grants no degrees, classes are fully transferable to
               degree-granting programs at UIUC and other four-year schools upon a student’s
               release. EJP students are often regarded both by prison staff and the general
               population as role models—not only for their academic achievement, but also for their
               discipline, fortitude, and work ethic.</p>
            <p> With only a small library and a handful of computers, the use of which by students
               is severely restricted, many traditional classroom expectations need to be trimmed.
               Papers cannot be expected to be typed, for instance, since most of the students have
               limited computer access and many do not have keyboarding proficiency. The lack of
               internet access and small library make traditional research papers difficult, so like
               many instructors I chose to emphasize reflective, critical papers. Perhaps most
               significantly, having to go through X-rays and several security doors, walk past snipers, and teach class with correctional officers standing outside creates its own
               psychological challenges, not to mention the 90-minute commute, drug test, finger
               printing, tuberculosis test, and thorough background screening required just to be
               able to get into the prison. All this made me distinctly less sympathetic to
               colleagues complaining about long photocopier lines and poorly worded student emails
               in their classes back on campus.</p>
            <p> And yet, like every EJP teacher I’ve talked to, it remains the single greatest
               teaching experience I’ve had. The students all come from different levels in terms of
               background knowledge, but all share a hunger for learning more. The class size (about
               16 students) promotes the feel of a large seminar, and I became used to students
               requesting extra reading and getting up during class to find more information from
               the library. There was technically a break in the midst of classes, but it never
               really felt like it, since most of the students would remain and continue the
               discussion with me until the correctional officer announced that class had “resumed.”
               A completely unique educational environment developed, with an optimal balance
               between the level of personal respect and decorum the students showed to me and each
               other, and the tenacity and passion of the intellectual arguments that arose.</p>
            <p> My class was specifically designed for EJP, and focused on methodological issues of
               literary history focusing on two discrete but connected eras—late Romantic England
               and the Harlem Renaissance. The overarching theme of the class was how writers
               engaged with their historical moment, how they articulated the role of literature in
               shaping historical change, and how they responded to and transformed the literary
               tradition they inherited. Teaching a class so heavily dependent upon historical
               context is difficult in a situation where external research beyond a very small
               library is impossible, and budget constraints forced me to use only major works in
               thrift editions. What we lacked in resources, however, was more than made up for
               through depth of engagement. Without much in the way of secondary materials, the
               class had fewer facts at their hands to provide contextualization for the novel, but
               they probed those facts more forcefully and thoroughly than a typical undergraduate
               class, often detecting lines of connection between the works that I had never thought
               of before.</p>
            <p> For the Romantic unit of the class, I chose two novels, <title level="m"
                  >Persuasion</title> (1818) and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1816), and
               three major poets, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats. This fairly
               conventional syllabus was in part dictated by the necessity of using thrift editions,
               but also reflected my desire, in a class centered on questions of literary-historical
               influence, to choose especially influential writers and works. Despite having some
               initial reservations about the suitability of Austen for an all-male classroom, I
               soon felt she was indispensable to the course I was trying to create. In particular,
               her satiric voice, depth of characterization, and psychological realism formed an
               important counterpoint to the forms of Romantic subjectivity embodied in the male
               poets. <title level="m">Persuasion </title>also seemed the logical choice of Austen’s
               books for a class designed around questions of historicity, because of its
               connections to the Napoleonic Wars and other contemporary events, as well as the
               recursive quality of the narrative. What better way to explore questions of memory
               and historical imagination than with a novel obsessed with these concerns, a novel
               that is in many ways a “second-chance” story, commencing at a point in the heroine’s
               life years after the breakdown of a youthful romance. In effect, <title level="m"
                  >Persuasion</title> was an Austen novel taking place after the conventional Austen
               plot had already failed.</p>
            <p> It would be nice to report that the power of Austen’s prose won my students over
               immediately, and I suddenly had a room full of committed Janeites. It would be
               equally satisfying to report that the students approached the text with hostility and
               that I, through my own pedagogical skill and sensitivity, convinced them of the
               book’s merits. The reality, of course, was more complicated. <title level="m"
                  >Persuasion</title> faced more resistance than almost any other work we read over
               the course of the semester, and while most of the students left with a grudging
               respect for the novel and a sense of Austen’s importance, I still detected no great
               love for her, except for one or two students. How I reached even that point, however,
               is an interesting story.</p>
            <p> In later conversations with Austen teachers, I learned that male students’
               difficulty with Austen is a nearly universal phenomenon, and I had found that to be
               true in my own teaching of Austen on campus as well. Beyond the gender barrier, I
               found additional challenges in the prison context. The students viewed,
               understandably, all the works read through the prism of their own experiences.
               Austen’s satirical depictions of the social conventions of the landed classes in
               early 19<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>-century England, and the female-centered marriage
               plot, made <title level="m">Persuasion</title> seem as far removed as imaginable from
               the student’s lived experience. Other writers engendered a similar skepticism (the
               aestheticism of Keats evoked some particularly withering comments, while Byron and
               Shelley fared somewhat better), but <title level="m">Persuasion</title> had the
               additional difficulties of Austen’s narrative style. The very factors that make her
               so significant in the history of the English novel—the meticulously precise diction,
               verbose yet elegant prose, the psychological complexity of characterization, the use
               of free indirect discourse, and the levels of irony at work in her narrative
               voice—all create challenges for contemporary readers.</p>
            <p> Nonetheless, I did find one advantage in teaching Austen in this environment: the
               lack of familiarity with filmed Austen enabled the students to meet the novel on its
               own terms. Filmed versions, in my experience, often favor a lush romanticism at the
               expense of Austen’s social satire, and even the most effective film cannot fully
               capture the sense of a novel in which so much of the action takes place inside
               characters’ minds. In television and film adaptations, the narrator’s voice has often
               been “clumsily and inappropriately translated into dialogue” (Roger 194). Taking advantage
               of the students’ ability to read with open minds and asking them to think about
               Austen in historical relationship to other writers of the time helped yield some
               surprising insights. Even today, Austen is often taught at the undergraduate level as
               either the culmination of the eighteenth century novel or, as it was taught to me, as
               the progenitor of Victorian fiction. I wanted to make a case to my class for a
               Romantic Austen, as deeply enmeshed in the debates and events of her time as Byron,
               Shelley, Leigh Hunt, or William Hazlitt. Making available selections from secondary
               works by Jeffery Cox and James Chandler helped students make these historical
               connections.</p>
            <p> One choice I made early in structuring the course paid particular dividends when we
               got to Austen. I designated one student to be responsible for leading the class in
               discussing each of the works, something I had done often in my campus classes but
               never before to this extent. I appreciated the seminar feel that developed once I
               relinquished leadership of the class, and also liked enabling (or forcing) students
               to take more ownership. Giving each student a turn also helped to democratize the EJP
               class significantly. Because EJP students are largely self-taught, their knowledge
               base and skill sets differ widely, and some students were much more comfortable
               expressing their ideas either verbally or in writing. Giving each student an
               opportunity to lead discussion confirmed that everyone had something important to
               contribute to the class. Moreover, every student diligently and creatively discharged
               his responsibility, making the overall class much more dynamic and interesting than
               it would have been had I been leading discussion. The success of this system
               confirmed for me the truth of a key EJP axiom, that when you set extremely high
               expectations they are likely to be not just met but exceeded.</p>
            <p> When we reached <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, I was fortunate to have
               discussion led by an extremely energetic, thoughtful, and charismatic student.
               Equally fortuitously, he also happened to be the only student who expressed
               uncritical admiration for the novel. He broke down the residence of some other
               students to Austen’s prose style and the seeming lack of relatibility of her
               characters by suggesting that all enduring works of literature had something
               important to teach contemporary audiences across temporal bounds, and it was the
               reader’s job to make the imaginative and critical effort to transcend his historical
               experience. By repeatedly asking what Austen is trying to teach us today, he steered
               discussion in a direction that turned potentially disruptive resistance into a
               productive source of engagement. He preempted much of my plan for teaching the class
               by suggesting that our reasons for finding Austen difficult suggest the close
               relationship between literary works and their historical contexts, and that not
               merely had political and economic arrangements and language changed, but the
               fundamental ways people narrated and experienced their subjectivity in the world was
               different in Austen’s time than today. Moreover, his sheer energy helped transform
               what otherwise seemed likely to be an uncharacteristically sleepy EJP class.</p>
            <p>My students voiced many of the same difficulties that other modern readers, particularly
               male readers, are likely to encounter. They were not especially sympathetic to the
               romance plot, the lack of conventional “action,” or the intense fascination with the
               mores and manners of the social class Austen describes. Foregrounding Austen’s
               satirical voice helped overcome this objection to some extent, by showing the novels
               had more “bite” than they initially thought. I also found that bringing some of
               the other poems and prose texts we had read into the discussion helped them put together
               a picture of the intense social and economic changes going on at the time. Although I
               did not implement it in this iteration of the class, I think future writing
               assignments that focus on unpacking Austen’s complex narrative voice and language,
               and in particular her use of free indirect discourse, could help improve student
               comprehension for the novel. For instance, requiring students to paraphrase a
               paragraph of the novel in their own words, or conversely, describe a situation in
               their own lives by mimicking Austen’s prose style, could help penetrate some of the
               linguistic and narrative challenges presented by the novel.</p>
            <p> A second key move was in framing our discussion around historical events—not only
               on the macro-level (such as changing gender relationships and expectations for
               marriage, the rise of an urban commercial class, and the corresponding decline in the
               prestige of the gentry), but also more precise historical contexts, such as the final
               phase of the Napoleonic Wars after Napoleon’s escape from Elba. Without historical
               contextualization, the students would have had no way of knowing that “Austen makes
               the events of the novel coincide precisely” with Napoleon’s post-exile campaign, with
               Waterloo very much “at the forefront of Austen’s mind” (Deresiewicz 146).</p>
            <p> Here I followed Chandler’s argument for a model of literary-historical scholarship
               that emphasizes very tight windows of periodization. I also drew on the sense of
               Romantic-era war as reshaping the consciousness of temporality, based on the
               pioneering work of Mary Favret. Favret has pointed out that, perhaps somewhat
               counterintuitively, readership and discussion of Austen has spiked in periods of war.
               During the two world wars, Austen was foremost among the literary treasures cited as
               “fortification” against the “upheavals of wartime,” a possibility with striking
               resonance for the contemporary Austen boom in a period which, for Americans, is not
               exactly wartime, but not peacetime either (Favret).</p>
            <p> Reading through the lens of wartime helped the students understand the changing
               status of the navy. Austen, herself the sister of two naval officers, left the navy
               alone unscathed from her satiric pen among major British cultural institutions. This
               reverence for the navy, and the generally sympathetic treatment of Wentworth, became
               more readily apparent to the students once we examined how Britain’s continued
               independence—let alone its empire and commercial prospects—depended upon control of
               the seas. In turn, this also helped the class appreciate the larger social trends at
               work in the novel, as they saw how the professional status of a naval officer would
               be so important, and correspondingly, for a commercialized and industrial society, how the possession of a good family name meant less and less. The combination of the
               historical background and the energetic contributions of our discussion leader helped
               warm the class towards <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, which was reflected in
               their written work as well. Historicizing the work, and exploring it in terms of
               political, economic, and social relationships rather than just the marriage plot,
               improved the novel’s legibility and accessibility.</p>
            <p> One final analytical tool helped dramatically bring <title level="m"
                  >Persuasion</title> alive. Throughout the class we had explored the period’s
               foundational arguments about the acts of reading and writing, and what the ultimate
               goal of literary expression should be. Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence of
                  Poetry</title> and Keats’s letters had both generated intense and lively
               discussion about the promises and pitfalls of reading and writing. The morality and
               methods of reading are an enduring concern in Austen’s work, most notably in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, but significantly in <title level="m"
                  >Persuasion</title> as well, which probes questions such as how one should read,
               what material should be read, and what ultimate purpose reading serves. We spent
               significant class time probing two of the major instances of reading in the text. Sir
               Walter Elliott’s obsessive reading and notetaking on the baronetage registry at the
               beginning of the novel suggested one model of reading, conservative and
               self-oriented. Sir Walter read in order confirm his own beliefs, assuage doubts about
               his own rapidly shrinking social status, and shore up his faith in a disappearing
               order. In contrast, Captain Benwick’s preferred reading matter, flowery Romantic
               poetry, marks him as highly sensitive and refined, but also more delicate and less
               practical than Wentworth, whom the novel regards as a more suitable masculine role
               model. We eventually suggested a third model of reading that Austen seems to be
               promoting though the demands she makes on her own readers: reading as an active
               exercise of critical intelligence, as opposed the escapist (in different ways)
               methods of reading favored by Benwick and Sir Walter. In the course of our time on
                  <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, we problematized the act of reading itself in
               ways that resonated throughout the remainder of the semester. We learned that the
               meaning of “good” or “effective” reading is not universal, but has been contested at
               different historical moments.</p>
            <p> Bringing out the theme of different approaches to the purpose and value of reading
               eventually proved the most productive way to generate engagement with the novel.
               Having read Wordsworth’s 1800 "Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>,"
               the students were already aware of the period’s anxieties about the effect of
               inappropriate or "low-quality" reading on the aesthetic taste and moral commitments
               of different segments of society. The students implicitly grasped this idea; as
               well-read autodidacts themselves, they already had a commitment to reading as a mode
               of intellectual and moral uplift that few of my undergraduates at my home institution
               shared. For them, the writers we studied were not an abstract intellectual exercise;
               rather, Keats, Shelley, Byron, etc. represented living ideas, with the power to teach
               lessons that could be applied to their daily experience. They also had the experience
               of expressing tastes in reading that might come across as effete to some of the other
               inmates. Furthermore, they had the experience of having their own reading, viewing,
               and listening habits relentlessly scrutinized by prison authorities. So, by
               emphasizing <title level="m">Persuasion</title> as a work in part about the promise
               and perils of reading, we situated the novel as an intervention to debates that they
               were already actively involved in.</p>
            <p> As my experience shows, Austen has the potential to reach all types of audiences,
               although different classrooms will demand different pedagogical approaches. We have
               seen film and television adaptations and pulp novelizations help to spread Austen’s
               appeal and create new generations of Janeites. But it is important not to
               underestimate the ability of the novels themselves to speak directly to even those
               contemporary readers without much experience reading literary fiction. At a time of
               shrinking enrollments in English classes and renewed fears about the health of the
               discipline, Austen is one of the field’s most reliable attractions to undergraduate
               students, standing perhaps second only to Shakespeare in possessing an equally high
               degree of cultural capital and popular appeal. My students at Danville Correctional
               Center taught me that her success endures not in spite of her difficulty, but rather
               directly because of the demands she places upon reading as an active exercise of
               critical intelligence. </p>
