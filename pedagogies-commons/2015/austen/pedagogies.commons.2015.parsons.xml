            <p rend="noCount">As part of a fall 2011 honors seminar on Jane and the Austenites,
               my students analyzed various cinematic adapations of Austen's novels.  When
               they viewed a clip involving Alan Rickman, who played Colonel Brandon in Ang
               Lee's production of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1995), they immediately linked the
               actor to his role as Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films.  This
               essay examines how students utilized their knowledge of the Harry Potter
               series and films as a gateway for a close reading of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>.
               Their understanding and affinity for Snape provided a blueprint for unlocking
               Colonel Brandon's emotions, motives, and the way he conducts himself in
               tension-filled situations.

            <p> Jane Austen is one of those rare authors whose novels and life story transcends time
               and a multitude of boundaries. As a clergyman’s daughter, her literary prowess was
               influenced by the dynamics of family and village life. Because she published her
               novels anonymously, only her family and a few friends were aware of her
               accomplishments when she died in 1817. Yet, from the publication of James Edward
               Austen-Leigh’s <title level="m">Memoir of Jane Austen</title> in 1870 to the release
               of the film <title level="m">Becoming Jane</title> in 2007, interest in Jane Austen’s
               life and novels have grown unabatedly. As I was planning my fall 2011 honors seminar
               titled “Jane and the Austenites,” I was unsure how familiar my students would be with
               Austen’s life and work. Besides undertaking a close reading of the novels for the
               insights they provided on marriage, class, finance, genteel society and Regency
               culture, my goal was to examine the development of Austen’s popularity in American
               and British culture and how her life and work had been bifurcated between academic
               scholarship and popular culture. Because this generation of students has such a
               strong visual orientation, a major aspect of the seminar was to analyze the ways in
               which cinematic adaptations of Austen’s novels and life have driven her canonical and
               celebrity status. </p>
            <p> While many of my students had seen <title level="m">Becoming Jane</title> and the
               Keira Knightley version of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> (2005), they
               were unfamiliar with the contributions Colin Firth had made to our understanding of
               Mr. Darcy or with the fact that Emma Thompson had written the screenplay for the Ang
               Lee production of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1995). More
               shocking than the realization that several students had never read a single page of
               Austen’s novels was their reaction to seeing Colonel Brandon’s appearance in the
               cinematic version of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>. When we first
               meet the Colonel, it is his undivided attention to Marianne’s performance, where she
               sings and accompanies herself at the pianoforte, that denotes him as a gentleman and
               a man of deep thought. Yet, my students saw nothing of Brandon’s intellect or
               penetrating reflection. They squealed “Professor Snape!” in delight as though they
               had been re-introduced to a beloved mentor from their childhood. At that moment,
               Austen’s novel had entered the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> paradigm, and we
               had to find a way to link the two characters’ personal histories and motives as a
               means to draw my students’ attention back to Colonel Brandon and <title level="m"
                  >Sense and Sensibility</title>. This essay will highlight the various ways in
               which we were able to connect these two disparate characters. It will show how
               utilizing students’ knowledge of Professor Snape and the <title level="m">Harry
                  Potter</title> series gave them easier access to understanding Colonel Brandon’s
               interactions with other characters, as well as his reactions to various events, and
               provided a gateway for close readings of Jane Austen’s novels.</p>
            <p> Students respond so enthusiastically to both Austen and J.K. Rowling’s novels for a
               variety of reasons. On a basic level, when they start reading they get lost in the
               story. They escape into another world which allows them to momentarily forget their
               problems or concerns. Students find themselves on the front line of the action with
               the knowledge that no harm will come their way. The circumstances Austen and
               Rowling’s characters encounter are similar in several ways to what many students
               today experience, as they too have well-meaning parents whose agendas for their
               careers may differ from their own interests. Their family dynamics are also
               comparable: their parents may have very contrasting personalities, they may be raised
               by a single parent, or their siblings may not share their altruistic goals. They
               mingle with the opposite sex at social events where casual conversation may occur
               over dessert, or they might listen to live music together. The threat of
               conflict—whether it be war in a foreign country or acts of terrorism at home—appears
               in both Austen and Rowling’s novels and in their own lives. Several students have
               noted that reading how fictional characters responded to a personal irritation such
               as a gossiping mother, immature siblings, or childhood bullies influenced their own
               reactions to similar situations.</p>
            <p> On an intensely personal level, students are attracted to Austen and Rowling’s
               novels because they identify with specific characters. My female students saw
               themselves in Elizabeth Bennet, Elinor Dashwood, and Anne Elliot. Many wanted to be
               Elizabeth Bennet, and not just because she married Fitzwilliam Darcy. For them,
               Elizabeth was snarky. They acknowledged her judgment errors, but were inspired by her
               determination to stand her ground as she turned down marriage proposals by Mr.
               Collins and Mr. Darcy, or when she defended her integrity and principles to Lady
               Catherine de Bourgh. My male students tended to identify with Mr. Darcy. They admired
               how well he ran his estate, his good standing in Derbyshire, and his ability to see
               through scheming women. While students were inclined to view Mr. Darcy as the
               definition of a gentleman, they were also mesmerized by his and Elizabeth’s banter.
               Many students openly acknowledged that these lively exchanges were what they wanted
               in their own personal relationships. </p>
            <p>My students had grown up reading the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> series,
               and for them the books are cherished friends to whom they continually return. As we
               discussed their attachment to the series, many revealed how they identified with a
               particular character that then helped them deal with whatever issues they faced as
               they were maturing. It might be Harry Potter, whose miserable childhood at the
               Dursley’s taught him how to stand up to bullies, read people’s motives, and empathize
               with others who were facing difficult situations; Luna Lovegood, who always appeared
               to be comfortable in her own skin and reveled in genuine friendships; or Hermione
               Granger, who knew that her critical thinking skills were her greatest asset. After
               all, Viktor Krum, the seeker for the Bulgarian National Quidditch team, had a legion
               of female Hogwarts students following his every move during his participation in the
               Triwizard Tournament, yet he chose to spend his free time in the Hogwarts library so
               he could be near her. </p>
            <p>I understood their affinity for Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna, but Snape—head of
               Slytherin, a reformed Death Eater, and a bitter man who rarely uttered a positive
               word? What did he offer my students? How did his character provide consolation in
               times of need? What did he teach my students about themselves and their world? I was
               perplexed at how Severus Snape with his “greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow
               skin” (<title level="m">Sorcerer’s Stone</title> 126) was synonymous with Colonel
               Brandon, who although being “on the wrong side of five and thirty” had an
               “appearance….[that] was not unpleasing” (<title level="m">Sense &amp;
                  Sensibility</title> 27). Colonel Brandon was unassuming and had a tendency to
               blend into the environment. Although well-liked and respected by all who befriended
               him, he is defined by his gravity, reserve and, to Marianne Dashwood’s disapproval, a
               liking of “flannel waistcoats” (<title level="m">Sense &amp; Sensibility</title>
               30). How could my students possibly see Professor Snape in him? Everything about
               Snape commands attention, whether it is his ability to hold his students’ attention
               in the palm of his hand by speaking “in barely more than a whisper,” (<title
                  level="m">Sorcerer’s Stone</title> 136), possessing eyes that “were cold and
               empty and made you think of dark tunnels” (<title level="m">Sorcerer’s Stone</title>
               136), or by alternating a “very cold voice” (<title level="m">Chamber of
                  Secrets</title> 78) with one that “snapped” (<title level="m">Chamber of
                  Secrets</title> 79), “roared” (<title level="m">Chamber of Secrets</title> 187),
               and even “snarled” (<title level="m">Prisoner of Azkaban</title> 171). Severus is
               not a man to cross even in the best of times. But when we probed deeper at these two
               gentlemen’s countenances, we found much hidden beneath their exteriors.</p>
            <p>Alan Rickman has been celebrated for his masterful depiction of Professor Severus
               Snape in the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> films. He has also garnered
               critical attention in the Austen scholarship for his portrayal of Colonel Brandon in
               the Ang Lee production of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>. In this
               particular role Rickman was noted for “convey[ing] particularly well the saturnine
               melancholy of a man who has been disappointed in love but takes a chance on loving
               again” (Sue Parrill 37). While Penny Gay’s critique of the film focuses on the ways
               in which Rickman’s costumes transform Colonel Brandon “into the image of the romantic
               Byronic hero” and as an ex-military man into something “splendidly virile in his
               red-coated colonel’s dress uniform” (Gay 98), she also concedes that it was Alan
               Rickman “who br[ought] to the role a brooding sexual presence” (106). Cheryl L. Nixon
               is more circumspect when she contrasts the Colonel Brandon that we find in Austen’s
               novel to the one in the Lee production and claims that “the film rema[de] Brandon
               into a standard-bearer of true emotion” (39) Since one of the goals of the seminar
               was to undertake a close reading of Austen’s novels, I wanted my students to focus on
               her command of language and the precision of her word choice. In looking for
               similarities between Colonel Brandon and Professor Snape, I expected them to rely on
               the respective narratives and provide textual evidence for their ideas.</p>
            <p>We began our study of Snape and Brandon by analyzing the factors that make Professor
               Snape’s character the most complex in the series, and the ways in which his
               conflicted emotions drive the narrative at key moments. We talked about his
               never-ending love for his childhood friend Lily Potter, how he was unable to protect
               her from Lord Voldemort, and the grief he suffered at her death. I challenged my
               students to find similar constructions in Colonel Brandon. I asked them to consider
               how the Colonel’s past is similar to Snape’s, and the ways in which Marianne
               Dashwood’s life and actions are similar to that of Harry Potter. My goal was to get
               them to see that the Colonel is also a man of complexity–to make them question what
               was hidden behind his mask. My students needed to probe beyond his veil of silence
               and gravity to understand <emph>why</emph> he is so well-liked and respected by those
               who call him friend and what he has to offer Marianne as a life partner. </p>
            <p>It is the complexity of the two characters—their concern for the well-being of
               others, the passion that hides behind their impenetrable masks, and overall their
               capacity to love—that connects them. Both epitomize the definition of gentlemen in
               their respective worlds, and both suffered a tragic loss that is the defining moment
               in their lives. Snape and Brandon are private men who keep their personal feelings to
               themselves. They teach us to dive deep beneath the surface before we pass judgment on
               their motives and integrity. As Harry continues to doubt Snape’s allegiance to the
               Order of the Phoenix during the second war with Voldemort, Remus Lupin reminds him
               that “Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us”
                  (<title level="m">Half-Blood Prince</title> 332). In the Order’s discussion of
               Snape’s involvement in Dumbledore’s death and their disbelief that he could be
               capable of such a heinous act, Professor McGonagall reveals that “[Dumbledore] always
               hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape…” (<title level="m"
                  >Half-Blood Prince</title> 616). That reason—the protection of Harry Potter as he
               grows from infant to adult—was not revealed outside the Order until Harry’s final
               duel with Voldemort. I asked students where they found similar instances of daring
               and bravery in Colonel Brandon. </p>
            <p> Students discussed Colonel Brandon’s reaction to Marianne Dashwood’s musical
               performance where “[h]e paid her only the compliment of attention” (<title level="m"
                  >Sense and Sensibility</title> 27) and which set his response against the
               over-the-top ones by Sir John and Lady Middleton. His silence was their first clue
               that there is more to Brandon that what meets the eye. Their second clue came during
               Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, and Marianne’s subsequent discussion of the Colonel. Although
               Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor are impressed by him, Marianne complains “[b]ut he talked of
               flannel waistcoats…and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with
               aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
               the feeble” (<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 30). Eileen Sutherland
               reminds us that when Marianne complains about the waistcoat she is actually revealing
               “her naiveté and ignorance of the world” (58). Growing up in a sheltered environment,
               she does not realize that she “should have connected it with danger, endurance, and
               courage…” (Sutherland 58). The disconnect between the clothing accessory and what it
               actually symbolizes leads to further discussion on Colonel Brandon and his time in
               the East Indies. Elinor tells Marianne and Willoughby that the Colonel “has seen a
               great deal of the world; has been abroad; has read, and has a thinking mind” (<title
                  level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 39). Yet, Marianne only recalls his
               complaints that “the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome” (<title
                  level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 39). Marianne (and Willoughby) displays
               no understanding of the British government’s concern over a “revival of French power”
               (Roberts 96) or the possibly of a French invasion on English soil. Because the
               Colonel does not talk in detail about his time abroad, we do not know what he
               experienced. Did he perform heroically on the battlefield? Did he watch one of his
               close friends die? Did his experiences abroad lead to his promotion to Colonel? Tim
               Fulford persuasively argues that Austen was more focused on “the contexts of those
               battles and [parliamentary] bills, away from the public arena, in the country as a
               whole” (163). We needed to stop and consider how the Napoleonic wars and the English
               militia’s foreign postings affected village life and those who had valiantly served
               their country. While Willoughby has youth and a certain amount of swagger on his
               side, Brandon is the more formidable man when we consider his credentials and
               experiences. Marianne has to experience her own close encounter with death before she
               can see past Willoughby’s façade.</p>
            <p> Colonel Brandon’s military experiences then led to a comparison of his and Professor
               Snape’s personal integrity. Students recalled that Snape had never been popular when
               he was a student at Hogwarts. He loathed James Potter and his friends Sirius Black
               and Remus Lupin. Even though Potter and Black taunted and publicly humiliated him,
               Snape did not turn his back on Lupin when he truly needed his help. Snape
               successfully concocts the Wolfsbane potion for Remus Lupin every month so that when
               the full moon causes his transformation into a werewolf, he can retain his mental
               faculties and position as teacher of the Defense Against the Dark Arts course—a
               position that Snape openly coveted. As for Colonel Brandon, we considered his
               sensitivity to others in embarrassing or distressing situations. For instance, when
               Mrs. Jennings attempts to discover the identity of the young man who has captured
               Elinor’s heart, the Colonel follows Lady Middleton’s lead in the discussion on the
               weather by adding commentary on the rain and thereby shutting down the enquiry. When
               he hears that Edward Ferrars has been disinherited by his mother because of his
               engagement to Lucy Steele, Brandon attempts to rectify Edward’s financial destitution
               by offering him the modest living at Delaford. Due to the delicacy of the situation
               and his unease at disclosing the reasons why he wants to make this offer, he asks
               that Elinor approach Edward for him. The Colonel tells her that “[t]he cruelty…of
               dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached to each other, is
               terrible—Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing—what she may drive her son
               to” (<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 213). The Colonel does not want
               to see another good man endure pain and misery just because his vocational endeavors
               or romantic liaisons do not meet a parent’s expectations or financial needs.
               Furthermore, Colonel Brandon watches Marianne and Willoughby’s interactions and
               believes, as do others, that they are secretly engaged. After Willoughby coldly ends
               their friendship, and while Colonel Brandon never believes there is a sliver of hope
               of Marianne looking favorably toward him, he visits the Miss Dashwoods regularly
               while they are in London. He tries to ascertain Marianne’s mental and emotional
               states either by watching her demeanor or talking with Elinor. The Colonel shows
               concern for Marianne’s well-being even when he has nothing to gain. </p>
            <p>I want to go back for a moment to my earlier questions regarding my students’
               affinity for Professor Snape. What he offered or taught them about themselves and
               their world involved the ability to love, the luck of finding one’s soul mate as a
               young adult, and the need to honor and respect that love when tragedy strikes. Only
               when it is absolutely necessary do he and Colonel Brandon reveal the reason for their
               silence, gravity, and disconnect. Indeed, the over-arching theme that connects
               Colonel Brandon to Professor Snape is the love and companionship the two men found
               with Eliza and Lily Evans during their childhoods. These two girls were more than
               just their best friends. They were the loves of their lives. Different circumstances
               led both to lose their loves at an early age. At 17, Eliza entered a loveless
               marriage with Colonel Brandon’s older brother as a means to secure financially his
               father’s estate. Severus Snape’s loss of Lily Evans was much more gradual. At age 11,
               both entered Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Although the sorting hat
               placed them in rival houses, Lily tried to maintain her friendship with Severus. This
               was made more difficult by his friendships with soon-to-be Death Eaters and his
               fascination with the Dark Arts. Even though Lily attempted to come to Snape’s aid
               while he was being taunted by James Potter, his calling her a
                  “<foreign>Mudblood</foreign>” was the catalyst for her terminating the friendship
                  (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 675). Snape tried to apologize later,
               but Lily told him in no uncertain terms that “[y]ou’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen
               mine” (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 676). Snape never stops loving
               Lily.</p>
            <p>After Lily Potter’s death, it was Albus Dumbledore who showed Snape the “way forward”
                  (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 678). Lily’s one-year-old son, Harry,
               was the only known wizard to have survived the killing curse. Dumbledore realized
               that when Voldemort returned to power, Harry’s life would be in danger. To ensure
               that Lily had not died in vain, he wanted Snape’s help in protecting the child. He
               secured Snape’s alliance after revealing that Harry “has her eyes, precisely her
               eyes” (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 678). Every time Snape looks Harry
               in the eye he sees Lily. To conceal his concern for Harry’s well-being, he uses his
               loathing of James Potter to create the veneer of contempt and the taunts that follow
               Harry’s every move at Hogwarts. As Snape is dying from the wounds inflicted by
               Nagini, Voldemort’s snake, memories “gushed from his mouth and his ears and his
               eyes…” (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 657). Snape gives Harry 18
               different memories that involve his mother and which reveal his close friendship with
               her, his attempts to protect her and Harry, his loyalty to Dumbledore, and the role
               he played as a double agent in trying to secure Harry’s safety and the destruction of
               the Dark Lord. It is only in the face of death that Harry discovered the real man and
               uncovered his acts of bravery.</p>
            <p> When we turned our attention to <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, we
               examined the scene between Elinor and Brandon at Mrs. Jennings’s home in London. When
               Marianne is suffering from Willoughby’s rejection, Colonel Brandon tries to ease her
               pain by revealing to Elinor his knowledge of Willoughby’s relationships with other
               women. It is at this point we learn about the Eliza whom he loved and lost, his
               actions in ensuring that she did not die alone or in squalor, her daughter Eliza
               Williams to whom he acts as a dutiful guardian, and how this young woman’s downfall
               came at the hands of Willoughby. Colonel Brandon tells Elinor he reveals this
               information in hopes of providing “lasting conviction to your sister’s mind” (152).
               Yet, Colonel Brandon also concedes that he sees “a very strong resemblance between
               [Eliza and Marianne], as well in mind and person. The same warmth of heart, the same
               eagerness of fancy and spirits” (153). He lays bare the intense pain he and his
               guardian have suffered as a means to contextualize Willoughby’s perfidy and
               Marianne’s escape. When my students started questioning whether the Colonel saw
               Marianne as Marianne or as a substitute Eliza, I knew we were discussing Austen’s
               characters based on their own identity and unique qualities rather than a cinematic
               casting of actors, and that Professor Snape was now allowed to remain off-stage.</p>
            <p> Due to my Jane Austen students’ enthusiasm for the <title level="m">Harry
                  Potter</title> series, I created a new honors seminar on “Harry Potter and the
               Quest for Enlightenment” which debuted in spring 2012. Now that I possess deeper
               knowledge of the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> series, I know <emph>how</emph>
               I could have incorporated my Austen students’ enthusiasm for <title level="m">Harry
                  Potter</title> better into Jane Austen’s novels. </p>
            <p>When we read Austen and Rowling’s texts, we find many instances where characters are
               obsessed with their status in their community. In fearing that her nephew has
               proposed to a woman “of no importance in the world” (<title level="m">Pride and
                  Prejudice</title> 271) Lady Catherine de Bourgh haughtily informs Elizabeth
               Bennet of the irrevocable harm her marriage to Mr. Darcy will bring him and his
               family. She is so focused on their differing stations in life that she does not
               consider the emotional maturation or fortitude that Elizabeth possesses which will
               allow her to act as Mr. Darcy’s partner and not as his trophy wife. On his initial
               train ride to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Draco Malfoy tells Harry
               Potter that “[y]ou’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than
               others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort” (<title
                  level="m">Sorcerer’s Stone</title> 108). Harry had just met Ron Weasley, who comes
               from a close-knit, pure-blood wizarding family and who does not judge others by their
               blood status. If we had focused our discussions more closely on status and class, we
               could have critiqued how misguided ideals adversely affect specific characters’
               actions and the community as a whole. We could have related the Black family’s
               ownership of <title level="m">Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy</title>
                  (<title level="m">Order of the Phoenix</title> 116) to Sir Walter’s constant
               perusal of “the Baronetage” (<title level="m">Persuasion</title> 9). What does their
               preoccupation reveal about their own fears regarding an evolving society? Finally, I
               would have asked my students to analyze women’s lives in Austen and Rowling’s novels.
               What opportunities do Austen’s heroines have to pursue their interests? How does this
               compare to Amelia Bones, who is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement;
               Poppy Pomfrey, who is the Hogwarts school nurse; or Nymphadora Tonks, who is an Auror?
               How do Austen’s female characters make valuable contributions to their families and
               their communities? What do both authors have to say about the importance of
               motherhood? We could have judged Mrs. Dashwood’s attempts to advance Elinor and
               Edward’s courtship and her growing regard for Colonel Brandon to Molly Weasley’s
               affections for her seven children and her ability to kill Bellatrix Lestrange during
               the Battle of Hogwarts after a deadly curse nearly missed striking her only daughter.
               In Austen and Rowling’s novels we find several demonstrations of the extreme lengths
               mothers will go to protect the opportunities and lives of their children. We could
               have charted these actions throughout the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title>
               series and in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> and <title level="m"
                  >Pride and Prejudice</title>.</p>
            <p> Utilizing Professor Snape as the lens through which to view Colonel Brandon allowed
               my students to build a foundation upon which to critique characters motives and
               interactions with their peers more succinctly. As they became more familiar with
               Austen’s novels, they were able to offer detailed analyses of specific scenes and
               explain how what was left unsaid may have been more revealing than what was divulged.
               Through their perusal of first-edition Austen novels in our university library’s
               special collections department, several students discussed the thrill of holding
               volume one and reading the opening paragraphs as Austen’s readers had once done. They
               were momentarily transported back into the eighteenth century. Austen’s readers were
               as excited to read her novels as my students were to read the latest installment in
               the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> series. As teachers we can channel this
               excitement and emphasize the ways in which popular culture holds clues to the canon
               of the future. In 1811, who would have thought that the anonymous author of <title
                  level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> would develop such a strong, devout
               following of fans? In making connections between Austen’s characters, settings, and
               language to that of J.K. Rowling's, we help students understand why novels of earlier
               centuries can retain their appeal in a post-modern world.</p>
