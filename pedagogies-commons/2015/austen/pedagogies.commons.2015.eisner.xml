                <p rend="noCount">This essay describes an advanced undergraduate course on “Jane
                    Austen and the Gothic.” Breaking with a literary-historical narrative of
                    development in which Austen corrects the Gothic’s excess, the course
                    interspersed a selection of Austen’s novels with Gothic fiction of the
                    1780s and 90s to explore what these works share, and what their differences
                    could prompt students to see about Austen’s fiction, about the Gothic, and
                    about novels and novel reading in general. Reading Austen with the Gothic
                    helped highlight the uneasiness and “agitation” permeating Austen’s
                    evocations of apparently ordered social worlds, and helped students
                    understand disordering moments in both Austen and the Gothic through a shared
                    network of formal and ideological concerns linking political and social
                    debates to questions of narrative and the representation of character. As the
                    course played out, the striking diversity of student responses to Austen and
                    to the Gothic—responses shaped in part by the divergent afterlives of
                    Austen and the Gothic in today’s popular culture—focused our discussion
                    in surprising ways not only on the social and epistemological value accorded
                    different genres and modes of writing, but also on the kinds of privilege
                    accorded different modes of reading (for example, fast or slow, compulsive or
                    disciplined, credulous or skeptical), both in the Romantic period and in our
                    own classroom practice.

                        than the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The very
                        curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another the lock
                        of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter. Hollow
                        murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than once her blood was
                        chilled by the sound of distant moans.” <ab rend="indent2">(Jane Austen,
                                <title level="m">Northanger Abbey, </title>117)</ab></quote>
                </epigraph>
                <p>So, in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, Austen parodies the Gothic
                    thrillers Catherine Morland has been reading, sends up the Gothic’s deluded and
                    sleepless readers, and at the same time indulges in the fun. The conjunctions
                    and disjunctions between Austen’s fiction and the machinations of the Gothic
                    tale formed the basis of the advanced undergraduate course, “Jane Austen and the
                    Gothic,” I designed and taught in 2008. Cross-listed in English and Women’s
                    Studies, the course juxtaposed a selection of Austen’s novels with
                    representative Gothic fiction of the 1780s and 90s to explore what these works
                    might share, and what their differences could help students see about Austen’s
                    fiction, about the Gothic, and about the various interests and pleasures of
                    novel reading (and writing) in general. Breaking with the neat categories and
                    sequences that often organize period surveys, the course was both challenging
                    and exciting to teach—not least because, in ways I hadn’t anticipated at the
                    start of the semester, I found myself making new connections along with my
                    students, and thinking about the wider field of writing along new lines. In what follows, I outline the rationale behind the course, how I
                    structured it, and what I learned as I taught.</p>
                <p> The idea to offer a course on Austen and the Gothic arose in part from the
                    historicist impulse that Patricia Matthew and Miriam Wallace see motivating many
                    courses on Romantic-era fiction (par. 1). Linking Austen with the Gothic returns
                    her novels to important aspects of the discursive contexts in which they were
                    produced and initially read. On one level, the course aimed to take account of
                    the Gothic’s prominence in the literary landscape in which Austen’s habits of
                    reading and writing took shape: if the heyday of the Gothic predates the
                    publication of her novels, it coincides with her first forays into novel-writing
                    in the 1790s. Helped by the work of such critics as Marilyn Butler, Mary Poovey,
                    and Claudia Johnson, I hoped students would see that both Austen’s fiction and
                    Gothic novels of the 1780s and 90s respond to a social world in transformation,
                    participating in the cultural debates swirling around key institutions—marriage,
                    the family, patriarchal authority, property transmission.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors">Recently Nancy Armstrong has written about the connection
                        between the Gothic and property transmission in Austen: in her account,
                        Austen’s fiction goes Gothic when the link between property and personhood
                        is disrupted (237).</note> Austen’s fiction and the Gothic novel alike
                    experiment with new forms for representing subjectivity, and test the
                    relationship of individual desire to social forms; both foreground the role of
                    feeling in organizing or disturbing individual and social bodies. Teaching
                    Austen with the Gothic additionally offers students a way into the era’s debates
                    over the social role and social effects of the novel and novel-reading, and into
                    the contest between “real life and manners” and “romance” central to the
                    theorization of the novel underway in the period.</p>
                <p> To be sure, one might map out this shared terrain in courses configured under
                    other rubrics: “Romantic Fiction,” or “Austen and her Contemporaries,”
                    “Literature of Sensibility,” or even “Gothic Novels,” say. Plus or minus a novel
                    or two, our reading list— works by Charlotte Smith, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew
                    Lewis, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Helen Maria Williams. along with <title
                        level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title>, and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>—might well have
                    fit comfortably under any of these titles. To my mind, though, my own rubric
                    offered two key advantages. First, I hoped the apparent opposition between
                    Austen’s controlled realism and the Gothic’s extravagance could function as a
                    useful heuristic to get students thinking about questions of genre and mode
                    comparatively. Second, and more crucially, I wanted to capitalize on the
                    recognition factor both Austen and the Gothic hold for readers (and viewers)
                        today.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I deliberately avoided using the
                        terms “Romantic” or “Romantic-era” in my title. My thinking was that these
                        terms might either perform a leveling function (reducing everything we read
                        to iterations of “Romanticism”) or interfere with students’ response to what
                        they read (if they were importing notions of what “Romantic” could mean). By
                        the same token, I wanted to resist letting the Gothic stand as simply
                        another name for the Romantic. As the course progressed, I found we did not
                        require the terminology of Romanticism to accomplish the pedagogical goals I
                        had in mind. </note> Austen’s status as cultural icon and her moment as hot
                    Hollywood property coexist with the Gothic’s continuing power as a cultural
                    mode: the Gothic novelists of the late eighteenth century may not themselves be
                    widely read anymore, but the sensibility and the forms they helped launch live
                    on, and they do so as part of a self-conscious tradition. If, in one sense, my
                    course directed students to the reading world Austen herself inhabited, then the
                    course at the same time forced the question of how and why both Austen and the
                    Gothic have enjoyed such different, but equally spectacular, cultural
                    afterlives. Combining the canonical power of Austen with the <emph>frisson
                    </emph>of the Gothic—or somewhat theatrically contrasting the two—not only
                    turned out to be a potent draw for students (a good thing if you are under
                    pressure to meet enrollment targets), it proved a pedagogically productive
                    experiment as well.</p>
                <p>In our opening discussions, I was surprised to find how many of the students
                    arrived already holding fairly firm views on what reading Austen and reading the
                    Gothic would be like, whether or not they had actually read much of either. We
                    had a few self-professed Janeites who’d been reading her devotedly since high
                    school or before, and a number of these expressed serious skepticism about the
                    Gothic. We had some fans of Gothic fiction—at least in its more recent
                    manifestations—some of whom volunteered (eyes rolling) that they were willing to
                    wade through some Austen if it got them to some juicy Gothic novels, but that
                    didn’t mean they weren’t going to like it. Several students announced themselves
                    as participants in fan or fan fiction communities organized around Austen or the
                    Gothic or both.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a recent example of
                        Gothicized Austen fan fiction, see the blog “<ref target="http://www.darkjaneaustenbookclub.com/">Dark Jane Austen Book Club</ref>.”</note> But even those more catholic
                    or agnostic in their tastes—including the significant number of students who had
                    read neither a single Austen novel nor a single work of Gothic fiction—seemed
                    puzzled by the course title, which they took as downright oxymoronic: what could
                    the world of “ladylike” Jane Austen, which they pictured as all period dresses
                    and clever repartee, possibly have to do with the Gothic, by which they
                    understood (not incorrectly) sex, crime and madness? Though when I taught this
                    course, in 2008, <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</title> (2009)
                    was still a year away, that title describes essentially the way my students
                    understood my own course title: that spoof (like the whole franchise it has
                    spawned) plays on the same sense of mashing up incongruities, mixing the
                    decorous with the degraded, my students anticipated.<note place="foot"

                </p>
                <p>I do not mean to present my students’ expectations as naïve, nor simply as
                    misjudgments to be corrected. They gave voice to what Clara Tuite describes as
                    Austen’s “canonicity effects,” “modes of cultural affect which serve specific
                    functions within and investments of literary culture,” interlinking concepts of
                    formal mastery, class privilege, English cultural heritage, and the romantic
                    marriage plot (2). This is the “safe” Austen, as Deidre Lynch puts it, dominant
                    in cinematic and television adaptations of the past several decades (Lynch
                    “Introduction” 5). Austen scholarship over those same decades—especially
                    historicist, feminist and queer readings of her fiction—suggests many avenues
                    for challenging the straightforward identification of Austen’s fiction with
                    these values, and this course was designed to open up such alternative ways of
                    reading Austen.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example, Johnson,
                        Tuite, and Heydt-Stevenson. </note> Rather than immediately dismissing my
                    students’ received take on Austen, however, I asked them to see it as a cultural
                    formation, and to think about what cultural needs this construction of Austen
                    answers, whose interests it serves (Lynch “Introduction” 5). This moved our
                    discussion to processes of reception and canon formation, and gave me an
                    opportunity to explain (drawing on the terrific collection of essays in Lynch’s
                    volume <title level="m">Janeites</title>) that the cultural meanings of Austen
                    have not always looked as stable and self-evident as they might now; rather,
                    they emerged through a long, complex, and varied reception history.</p>
                <p>Still, the relationship between Austen and the Gothic articulated by my students
                    parallels a developmental narrative often embedded in standard literary
                    histories as well as in our syllabi, perhaps especially in survey courses. In
                    this narrative, Austen’s writing marks the point at which the English novel
                    straightens out and grows up. We pit Austen’s maturity against the Gothic’s
                    adolescent acting-out, or else, somewhat contradictorily, Austen’s modernity
                    against the Gothic’s old-fashioned weirdness, and we produce this relationship
                    in part just by assigning Austen after the Gothic, or reading excerpts from
                    Radcliffe as we teach <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, so that it
                    appears Austen comes along to correct what comes before.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> Clifford Siskin argues that Austen’s formal choices, along
                        with her methods of publication and presentation, not only perform her
                        difference from the novel as she received it, but also collude with the
                        language of her earliest critics to represent that difference as an advance
                        in the developmental terms I have outlined (193–209). Siskin sees this as a
                        watershed moment in the development of the modern idea of "literature" itself
                        (205).</note> This developmental narrative often describes an ethical as
                    well technical advance, paralleled in turn by the maturation plots of her
                    novels. According to this story, in other words, where the Gothic functions like
                    the unconscious, Austen acts as the ego ideal: in this version of things, if the
                    Gothic shows us who we fear we were, or are, Austen shows us who we want to
                    become.</p>
                <p>To help imagine alternatives to such a developmental narrative and the typecast
                    roles it assigns, my course partially dispensed with chronological sequence,
                    instead alternating between Gothic novels and Austen’s fiction. We opened, not
                    unconventionally, with Radcliffe’s <title level="m">The Italian</title> (1797),
                    followed by <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> (1818). But we then went
                    back to Lewis’s <title level="m">The Monk</title> (1796) and Wollstonecraft’s
                        <title level="m">Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman </title> (1798), before
                    reading <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1811) and watching the
                    Ang Lee film (1995). Late in the semester, we tackled Smith’s <title level="m"
                        >Emmeline, or the Orphan of the Castle </title>(1788), concluding with
                        <title level="m">Persuasion </title>(1818) and a final viewing session for
                    some episodes of <title level="m">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</title> (1997-2003),
                    the TV series whose sensibility merges dark, suburban Gothic with Austenian wit,
                    irony and romance. While the syllabus thus exploited anachronistic conjunctions,
                    one could argue such anachronism is built into much of Austen’s fiction
                    already—integral to all her novels that began life in earlier versions in the
                    1790s, though most obvious in the case of <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title>, which is introduced in Austen’s advertisement as a text from
                    an earlier day. </p>
                <p> I confess I walked out of that first class feeling fairly nervous about what
                    might lie in store: would half the class just trash whatever we were reading in
                    a given week? As the course played out, however, my students’ divided initial
                    responses proved an excellent starting point for our discussions. What surprised
                    me over the course of the semester was not just the richness of the connections
                    students were able to draw on their own across the texts we read (e.g., in
                    linking and comparing heroines—<title level="m">The Italian</title>’s Ellena,
                    Catherine Morland, Wollstonecraft’s Maria, Marianne Dashwood, Emmeline, Anne
                    Elliot—or male leads—Henry Tilney, <title level="m">Maria</title>’s Darnford,
                    Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, Emmeline’s suitors Delamere and Godolphin, William
                    Elliot, Frederick Wentworth, and so on), but also how our sustained experience
                    with the Gothic shifted what we looked for in Austen, and how we saw it.
                    Juxtaposed as they were, Austen and the Gothic could, in a sense, read one
                    another. Repeatedly turning to Austen from the Gothic brought into sharper
                    relief the unease and instability troubling Austen’s evocations of ordered
                    social worlds—especially in the form of alternative or marginalized plotlines
                    (for example, the doubled Elizas in <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title>), or in occasions of suspense, where anxiety can be
                    oppressively intense for characters and for the reader, and where deranging
                    outcomes feel all too likely. This changed how my students understood Austen’s
                    marriage plot: instead of taking for granted the inevitability of narrative
                    closure, students were more willing to imagine the situations of dispossession,
                    powerlessness, danger or simply open-ended waiting in which Austen’s female
                    characters often find themselves as situations from which there may indeed be no
                    magical rescue. We could see the novels emphasizing forms of disconnection as
                    much as forms of community.</p>
                <p>Moreover, turning to Austen from the Gothic and back again had the effect of
                    denaturalizing Austen’s realism. Categories of reader response associated with
                    the Gothic—suspense, horror, anxiety, fascination, boredom, laughter,
                    disgust—became central to our discussions of Austen, too. Gothic novels, we
                    noticed, never let the reader forget she’s reading a book: they are full of
                    obtrusive indices of materiality and textuality. By contrast, I’d had trouble in
                    the past getting students to think of Austen’s fiction as anything other than a
                    transparent representation of reality. Coming back to Austen from the Gothic,
                    however, we were better positioned to ask what Austen does differently so that
                    our immersion in the narrative world she creates goes uninterrupted, to see that
                    it takes particular strategies (free indirect discourse, irony, appeals to
                    common sense and common situations, and so forth) to make this happen. Not only
                    in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey,</title> but across her fiction, students
                    were attuned to the way Austen repurposes literary conventions (for example, in
                    landscape prospects, or in epistolary exchanges) and they could now read these
                    elements of the novel in sophisticated ways. Mary Favret’s <title level="m"
                        >Romantic Correspondence</title> proved especially helpful in tracking the
                    function of reading and writing letters in Austen’s fiction against the backdrop
                    of sentimental convention. </p>
                <p>Moving between Austen and the Gothic also helped us think in productive ways
                    about Austen’s representations of consciousness and interiority. The Gothic’s
                    representations of emotional extremity and psychic fragmentation sensitized us
                    to the language of “agitation” and anxiety permeating Austen’s fiction. In the
                    Gothic, the boundary between the self and what lies outside it is
                    characteristically dissolved: the self projects itself into the world, or the
                    other invades the self. Where Romantic-era Gothic typically diagnoses the
                    breakdown of social bonds by isolating subjectivities, shrinking the
                    possibilities for social interaction, Austen’s comedies of manners obviously
                    work in the opposite direction, examining the fraying of social bonds by looking
                    at moments of dissonance among a circle of interacting characters, and imagining
                    the repair of bonds in groups knit together by sympathetic understanding. Her
                    narrative imperatives require, however, the differentiation of her heroines from
                    social worlds that can’t keep pace with their strength of imagination or desire,
                    producing a gap between the self and social reality that can feel Gothic in
                    force. Like the Gothic, too, Austen often dramatizes inwardness by focusing on
                    the permeability of the boundary between inside and outside.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> See, for example, Adela Pinch’s account of how in Anne
                        Elliot’s experience “mental space is always impinged upon” by what’s outside
                        it (116).</note> The claustrophobia Austen’s heroines frequently
                    experience—necessary to produce their distinction from their social worlds—might
                    evoke parallels for students with the claustrophobic states so crucial to Gothic
                    psychology. </p>
                <p>As we read, the balance of value among these works shifted in surprising ways.
                    The Gothic was no longer just “context” or background, and the fact that some
                    students <emph>preferred </emph>the Gothic to Austen’s brand of realism allowed
                    for productive discussions about how and why we value certain kinds of texts,
                    and about the privilege we accord to certain modes of reading. Austen (we always
                    say) schools us in reading reflectively, with an appreciation for subtleties and
                    precision of language, where re-reading moves us toward a revised understanding
                    and greater clarity. Austen models the skeptical, recursive close reading our
                    discipline—and especially our classroom practice—makes central. By contrast, the
                    Gothic solicits reading as voracious consumption, propelled by curiosity; when
                    you get to the end of the novel, you’re not expected to re-read, you look for
                    the next book. Coleridge pinpoints exactly this feature of the Gothic in his
                    1794 review of <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title>: <quote>Curiosity
                        is raised oftener than it is gratified; or rather, it is raised so high that
                        no adequate gratification can be given it; the interest is completely
                        dissolved when once the adventure is finished, and the reader, when he is
                        got to the end of the work, looks about in vain for the spell which had
                        bound him so strongly to it. (par. 1)</quote> Led by student responses to
                    the novels we were reading, our class discussions ended up canvassing this
                    dichotomous sorting of readerly attitude. This, in turn, raised a series of
                    questions I tried to negotiate as I taught. How well do these opposed models of
                    reading describe what happens in readers’ actual practice? What are our actual
                    investments (pedagogic or scholarly) in these models of reading? How might such
                    an opposition between “close reading” and enthralled, compulsive reading block
                    access to a more nuanced, more useful phenomenology of reading? </p>
                <p>Certainly, as I told my students, I think the Gothic texts we were studying
                    reward close and careful reading (and re-reading). Not all of my students were
                    spell-bound by these Gothic fictions, of course, and I don’t want to minimize
                    the challenge in teaching them. Students can use a lot of help getting through
                    long, strange, convoluted novels like <title level="m">The Monk </title>or
                        <title level="m">Emmeline</title>, both in simply holding onto the thread of
                    the narrative and in knowing when to slow down and read more closely (I ended up
                    distributing chapter-by-chapter notes for <title level="m">The Italian</title>,
                        <title level="m">The Monk</title> and <title level="m">Emmeline</title>,
                    avoiding plot summary but guiding students to significant passages and making
                    key narrative developments explicit). Still, as I’ve been suggesting, many of
                    them did report really getting carried away, especially by <title level="m">The
                        Italian </title>and <title level="m">The Monk</title>. I cherish an e-mail I
                    got early in the semester from one student, a talented close reader: she
                    acknowledged that the reading assignments are long, “but generally,” she
                    continued, sounding a little like Catherine Morland, “my problem has been
                    stopping at the assigned reading. It's hard not to get into these books. […] I
                    robbed myself of several hours of sleep last night reading <title level="m">The
                        Monk</title> almost to the end” (Fix). One of the pleasures of teaching this
                    course was hearing this kind of response, and I mention it partly as
                    encouragement to those teachers thinking about assigning some of these Gothic
                    works. At the same time, one of the challenges of the course—one I can’t claim
                    to have solved to my satisfaction—was figuring out how to talk about this kind
                    of response in the classroom, besides simply welcoming it with relief. All our
                    training tells us to try to get students to slow down, to linger over words;
                    what then do we do with texts that impel readers to speed up? As Rita Felski
                    observes, and as my experience teaching this course brought home to me, our
                    discipline has a surprisingly impoverished vocabulary for talking critically (in
                    the classroom, or in our scholarship) about modes of non-detached reading
                    without lapsing into either platitudes or castigation (2). While we didn’t
                    arrive at a solution to this problem, the course at least succeeded in moving
                    these questions out into the open for me as well as for my students.<note

                <p>As we talked about their responses to these texts and considered how they worked
                    towards or against ideals of “close reading,” I tried to get students to think
                    about the formal features that encourage rapid, absorbed reading, and to think
                    about what makes terror or sensation a source of pleasure for readers. We
                    approached these questions in part historically through eighteenth-century
                    theories of terror writing, including Anna and John Aikin’s “On the Pleasure
                    Derived From Objects of Terror,” and period reviews. Coleridge’s reviews of
                    Radcliffe and Lewis take the form of elaborate reflections on, or theories of,
                    affective readerly response and how it is generated. Comparing Gothic or
                    sentimental writing with the new realism Austen’s fiction represents, Walter
                    Scott’s review of <title level="m">Emma</title> similarly distinguishes these
                    genres in part on the basis of the different way each affects the reader.
                    Scott’s review is especially interesting because, while it identifies Austen’s
                    fiction as a singular break with the “old <emph>régime</emph>” (192) of the
                    novel, it is far from a ringing endorsement of her realism. Instead, Scott holds
                    open the space his own historical fiction will occupy, blending “romance” and
                    “real life” and manners, and at the same time imagines a new nineteenth-century
                    figure, the general reader, who turns with equal delight to realism or romance,
                    but who goes to each for different kinds of pleasures (200).</p>
                <p>The Austen novels we were reading, of course, thematize forms of intense readerly
                    attachment: Catherine Morland’s addictive reading of the Gothic; Marianne
                    Dashwood’s overidentification with sentimental fiction; the many kinds of
                    bookishness on display in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, such as Captain
                    Benwick’s Byronism and Anne Elliot’s memory stored with poetry (Pinch). We discussed how
                    and why the potentially dangerous effects of (too much) reading became such a
                    charged topic in the period, and why the Gothic in particular focused cultural
                    anxieties about reading: fears about the reader’s susceptibility to the
                    contagion of feeling or ideas, about the reader’s loss of self-control or
                    self-mastery, about who was reading (women, the lower classes), about the
                    specter of a mass reading public, about the commodification of literature and
                    the industrialization of literary production. As E. J. Clery suggests, the
                    irrationalism of the Gothic seemed to many to mirror the irrationalism of the
                    transfixed reading public, and in turn the irrationalism of commercial modernity
                    more generally (148). I emphasized the emergence of the Gothic in the 1790s as a
                    recognizable “system,” facilitated by the development of new techniques of
                    publishing, marketing, and distribution, exemplified by the growth of
                    circulating libraries and the innovations of William Lane’s Minerva Press. When
                    Catherine Morland remarks that “something very shocking indeed, will soon come
                    out in London” and Henry Tilney recognizes that she is expecting “nothing more
                    dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three
                    duo-decimo volumes…with a frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a
                    lantern,” the exchange draws attention to the regularity of this London-based
                    system of production and its networks of distribution into the provinces (<title

                    system appeared to create a spiral of demand, where an ever-increasing flood of
                    books only further intensified the desire of an insatiable reading public for
                    more. </p>
                <p>That Eleanor mistakes Catherine’s meaning and instead understands her to be
                    talking about actual riots in London points to the ambivalent association
                    between “terrorist writing” and the decade’s fears about political
                    unrest—between riots in the streets and a “riot in the brain,” a persistent
                    theme in our discussions.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Johnson and
                        Hopkins on the relationship between the novel, the Gothic, and 1790s
                        politics.</note> Are Gothic fictions destabilizing social forces like mobs
                    in the street, or is the Gothic an escape or distraction from the potential for
                    real violence? Does the Gothic channel anxieties about political unrest, or work
                    to contain or defuse the tensions that might give rise to insurrection? Excerpts
                    from Edmund Burke along with contemporary prints helped my students see how in
                    the paranoid post-Revolutionary climate of the 1790s the language of Gothic
                    terror infected political discourse; we also discussed how Gothic fiction could
                    be turned to explicitly political uses (as in <title level="m">Maria </title>or
                    Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>), and in any case inevitably
                    took on political dimensions.</p>
                <p> To get a sense for the Gothic as a contested category and to see how period
                    discourse mapped different kinds of reading onto different kinds of readers, we
                    looked at William Wordsworth’s denunciation (in his “Preface” to the <title
                        level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>) of the “degrading thirst after outrageous
                    stimulation” generated by “frantic novels, sickly and stupid German Tragedies,
                    and “deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse,” a reading habit he
                    connects with the simultaneously hyper-stimulating and deadening environment of
                    urban mass culture (177). My students had no trouble locating the metaphors of
                    disease and addiction Wordsworth uses to describe a sick social body, and easily
                    followed the connection, articulated by Karen Swann among others, between
                    Wordsworth’s attack and modern-day complaints about the addictive, stupefying
                    effects of mass culture. We circled back then to think about how Wordsworth’s
                    divisions between “high” and “low” culture and his alignment of these spheres
                    with reflective and sensation-seeking modes of reading correlated with the kind
                    of opposition the class had registered in our course title.</p>
                <p>Like Michael Gamer and Robert Miles, rather than stress the coherence of a Gothic
                    “tradition” or “mode” represented by a catalogue of conventions, I presented the
                    Gothic as a “shifting ‘aesthetic’” (Gamer 4) privileging certain processes or
                    forces: destabilization, fragmentation, contagion and the breaking of
                    boundaries, repetition and proliferation, totalization, abjection, exaggeration,
                    concealment, the operation of uncanny or invisible agency. This more flexible
                    understanding of the Gothic allowed us to track Gothic effects more widely and
                    to think about how the Gothic produces those effects, rather than simply
                    identifying static motifs. In background lectures, I sketched the rise of a
                    taste for the Gothic in the eighteenth century, connecting it with the vogue for
                    ruins; literate culture’s ambivalent fascination with the superstitious tales of
                    oral, folk culture; and the romance of the wild, the primitive, and the outdated
                    in a world of enlightened progress. We talked about how the Gothic’s fascination
                    with the unknowable or the unspeakable contrasted with the drive in Austen’s
                    novels towards clarity, visibility, and open communication. As one explanation
                    for the Gothic’s popularity we could test out over the semester, I proposed
                    Clery’s analysis of Gothic reading as granting a temporary illusion of control,
                    as the anxieties produced by the apparent irrationalism of modernity “could be
                    assuaged by binding them to a narrative repeated over and over with only minor
                    variations” (153). I juxtaposed this historicist perspective on the Gothic as a
                    function of consumer culture with a brief introduction to psychoanalytic
                    perspectives on horror, drawing especially on Kristeva’s theory of
                    abjection.</p>
                <p> I chose <title level="m">The Italian </title>in preference to other Radcliffe
                    novels as a (relatively) compact and classic example of “terrorist” writing at
                    its 1790s peak. Students responded well to the novel (they were especially
                    fascinated by the mysterious Schedoni). I found Gamer’s discussion of the Gothic
                    as an interested, local deployment of broader cultural codes—sentimentality, the
                    sublime—useful in thinking about how to help my students through the narrative.
                    In their initial reading, I discovered, students often skipped over just those
                    passages where Radcliffe most obviously engages such codes, such as in her
                    lengthy landscape descriptions; to the students, such passages just felt tedious
                    and unrelated to the plot. However, once students see that these passages look
                    like departures from the plot precisely because Radcliffe really does go out of
                    her way to call attention to specific non-narrative codes, they can recognize
                    the work these passages are doing, and pick up on the deployment of the same
                    codes in other novels. Anticipating Austen’s concerns with the management of
                    information at the level of narrative technique and its circulation among
                    characters through gossip or letters, I drew attention to the many instances of
                    represented storytelling in <title level="m">The Italian</title>, and the
                    importance of the control of information both within the plot and as a device of
                    suspense (for example, the servant Paulo’s narrative of the confessional of the
                    Black Penitents [80-82], or Ellena’s attempt to read Vivaldi’s note in the
                    convent, closely recalled in Catherine’s attempt to read what turns out to be
                    the laundry list in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> [132]). </p>
                <p>Turning to <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> from <title level="m">The
                        Italian</title>, students quickly recognized Austen’s debt to the Gothic as
                    well as her critique of it. They were receptive to the argument that Austen does
                    not simply reject Gothic irrationality, but rather mobilizes its energies and
                    resources to her own ends.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Judith Wilt’s
                            <title level="m">Ghosts of the Gothic</title> presents a compelling
                        reading of the novel within a Gothic tradition.</note> As Claudia Johnson
                    points out, <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> “domesticates the Gothic,”
                    showing how its dangers are not comfortably distant but shockingly close to the
                    English reader (47). The novel spotlights sources of real terror in Catherine’s
                    world: the aforementioned riots; tyrannical and mercenary authority figures;
                    invidious forms of social deception. And as George Levine argues, the Gothic
                    devices Austen parodies in fact move the plot towards an ending every bit as
                    magical as any romance. To set up discussion of these aspects of the novel, I
                    assigned Johnson’s chapter on the novel from <title level="m">Jane Austen:
                        Women, Politics and the Novel</title> and Robert Hopkins’s “General Tilney
                    and the Affairs of State: The Political Gothic of <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title>,” both excerpted in the Norton Critical edition we used;
                    Jillian Heydt-Stevenson’s discussion of Catherine’s discovery of the linen
                    inventory as an entry into the “Gothicized” economies of the household worked
                    very well also as a focus for discussion (Heydt-Stevenson 130-1). Levine’s
                    accessible “Translating the Monstrous” would also make good secondary reading
                    for undergraduates. </p>
                <p>Given the interests of the course, I had anticipated that much of our discussion
                    would focus on Catherine’s addictive reading and the curiosity it inspires.
                    Instead, however, taking their cue in part from Johnson’s astute observation
                    that Henry Tilney largely scripts Catherine’s “Radcliffean excesses” at the
                    Abbey in advance (39), my students quickly brought our discussion around to
                    Tilney himself and his self-appointed role as instructor, a topic that sparked
                    pronounced (and productive) disagreement. My students took widely varying
                    viewpoints both on how to locate Tilney’s voice in relation to Austen’s
                    authorial perspective, and—a separate but related issue—on how to understand
                    Tilney himself (charming, kind, and reasonable, or insufferable, bullying, and
                    ineffectual). Since Tilney so prominently asserts his own authority as a reader,
                    this debate proved an excellent way to try to calibrate Austen’s own take on
                    novel reading, and it opened up avenues into the novel’s representation of
                    masculinity more generally. Our discussion of Tilney’s pedantry led us naturally
                    to the question of what, if anything, Catherine learns over the course of the
                    novel, and how. Many of my students voiced skepticism about a straightforward
                    narrative of Catherine’s maturation as a progress from delusion to accurate
                    judgment of reality, wondering instead about alternative descriptions of the
                    novel’s plot: is the Catherine so eager to marry Henry Tilney as deluded a
                    reader as ever? Has Catherine’s “strange, unaccountable character” been properly
                    redirected, or absorbed by an (exaggeratedly) conventional fiction (<title
                        level="m">NA </title>6)? </p>
                <p><title level="m">The Monk</title>’s sheer strangeness as a novel, its length, and
                    especially its digressions and inset narratives and poetry, can prove
                    challenging in the classroom. Taking these digressions and fragmentations
                    seriously by asking why they are included and what work they perform—especially
                    the “Bleeding Nun” narrative—can in fact be a useful technique for getting at
                    larger patterns or issues in the novel (I recommend Peter Brooks’s essay “Virtue
                    and Terror” along these lines). Students were able to see the novel’s
                    fragmentation and incoherence not as a failing but as an alternative, juxtaposed
                    against the principles of coherence and closure governing Austen’s realism—and
                    so understand those elements of Austen’s work both as artistically achieved (not
                    simply given) and as interested (not simply neutral). The instructor also has an
                    opportunity here to introduce engaging material from the many adaptations and
                    repackagings the novel spawned, from hilariously condensed chapbook versions
                        (<title level="m">Almagro and Claude; or Monastic Murder; Exemplified by the
                        Dreadful Doom of an Unfortunate Nun </title>(1803)), to phantasmagoria
                    set-pieces, to stage versions (<title level="m">Aurelio and Miranda</title>,
                    starring Kemble and Sarah Siddons, and a “Heroic Pantomime Ballet” of “Alonzo
                    the Brave and the Fair Imogine” that ran more than a year at Sadler’s Wells)
                    (Clery 144). That the novel’s pastiche form lends itself immediately to this
                    kind of commercial reproduction, and in fact absorbs it, will be obvious. </p>
                <p>Since I’d already introduced students to the political climate of the 1790s
                    through <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, they were able to place
                        <title level="m">The Monk</title> in this context easily as well. Excerpts
                    from Helen Maria Williams’s <title level="m">Letters Written in France</title>
                    (1790) helped us connect the novel to representations of revolutionary spectacle
                    and spectatorship. <title level="m">The Monk</title> and <title level="m">Maria
                    </title>worked well read in succession, since both engage a post-Revolutionary
                    discourse of sensibility (especially through the figure of the libertine), and
                    both explore the potentially “anarchic” force of individual desire that, as Mary
                    Poovey points out, Austen also contemplates through the figure of Marianne
                    Dashwood (Poovey 101, 185-194). By the time we reached <title level="m">Sense
                        and Sensibility</title>, students were well-prepared to recognize in
                    “sensibility” a contested cultural system (Butler 192). <title level="m"
                        >Maria</title>’s critique of marriage and Wollstonecraft’s analysis of the
                    systematic, institutional logic of women’s dispossession prime students to
                    understand the frustration and precariousness in Elinor and Marianne’s situation
                    in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>: the real threat of an
                    intolerably closed existence. With <title level="m">Maria</title>’s exploration
                    of mother-daughter relationships in mind, we focused on representations of the
                    maternal in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>—its bustling cast of
                    mothers a nice change of pace after all the villainous fathers we’d been
                    discussing. Ang Lee’s film adaptation of the novel, together with Deborah
                    Kaplan’s essay “Mass Marketing Jane Austen,” brought us back to the questions
                    about contemporary constructions of Austenian romance with which we began.</p>
                <p>Coming to <title level="m">Emmeline</title> late in the semester, students had a
                    good sense of what to look for in a novel that might otherwise have been
                    mystifying and confusing. They could recognize that while many of the elements
                    of later Gothic novels are already present—distressed orphan, check; old castle,
                    check; random acts of poetry-writing, check—this work of the 1780s predates the
                    more codified Gothic of novels like <title level="m">The Italian</title> and
                        <title level="m">The Monk</title>, and characters and plot don’t fully
                    conform to Gothic stereotype: the mode is still in formation. Built around
                    waiting for a considered attachment rather than rushing into the marriage
                    market, the novel, Smith’s first, offers many possible lines of connection with
                        <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> and <title level="m"
                        >Persuasion </title>in particular. If Delamere (lauded by Austen as among
                    the “first of men” in her <title level="m">History of England </title>[<title
                        level="m">NA </title>201]) and Godolphin foreshadow many of Austen’s male
                    leads, Adelina’s poetry-writing and madness can be read against Marianne
                    Dashwood’s story, whereas Emmeline’s emotional responsiveness and autonomy look
                    forward in some ways to Anne Elliot’s. There are plot similarities too: as
                    Loraine Fletcher notes in her excellent introduction to the Broadview edition (a
                    great teaching text), Emmeline and Anne both reject the suitor with family
                    connections and marry a naval officer instead (21). Reading the novel together
                    with some of Smith’s sonnets, we focused on the construction of Emmeline’s
                    interiority though her solitary reveries and her sympathetic imagination, and
                    the almost magical power her ability to feel deeply seems to grant her. My
                    students were intrigued by all the rivalries between men in the book, and the
                    way they constantly threaten to derail the heterosexual courtship plot. The
                    obviousness with which Smith doles out rewards and punishments at the novel’s
                    end makes for a good lesson in how novelistic closure performs ideological work:
                    what values or social positions are vindicated and what values or social
                    positions are criticized by the novel at the end? How does the ending of the
                    novel rearrange or reinforce social or power relations?<note place="foot"

                        <title level="m">Persuasion </title>felt in some ways like a significant
                    departure from the novels I’ve been discussing. There’s nothing remotely Gothic
                    about Kellynch Hall, and in the end, the old manor neither witnesses a
                    triumphant return of the rightful owner, nor falls down (the other Gothic
                    outcome for old houses). Mr. Elliot may be as dissolute and calculating as any
                    Gothic villain— “a designing, wary, cold-blooded being...black at heart, hollow
                    and black!” (132)—but the threat he poses Anne isn’t ever as immediate. Where
                    novels like <title level="m">The Monk </title>warn against the dangers of
                    individual will unmoored from social structures and traditional roles (Brooks),
                        <title level="m">Persuasion </title>seems to celebrate that possibility. In
                    its close, shifting away from the inheritance plot to a world where people rent
                    rather than own their houses, the novel signals a shift in terrain and mode for
                    the anxiety conjured by Gothic fictions. The terror attached to specific spaces
                    in the Gothic is diffused into the less locatable, but perhaps less containable,
                    anxiousness of everyday life.</p>
                <p>Teaching this class has encouraged me to experiment with setting up similar
                    collisions among heterogeneous groups of novels to energize other courses I
                    teach. In a British Romanticism graduate seminar, for example, where in the past
                    I’d usually taught one or two novels along with poetry of the period—and those
                    novels the usual suspects, typically Austen and/or Mary Shelley—I interspersed
                    our reading in poetry with Maria Edgeworth’s <title level="m">Castle
                        Rackrent</title> (1800), Charlotte Dacre’s <title level="m">Zofloya, or the
                        Moor </title>(1806), Scott’s <title level="m">Guy Mannering</title> (1815),
                    and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. This was a rewarding move, and not only
                    because my students found these novels a lot of fun to read. Making such jumps
                    among novels and such leaps between genres, students can gain an exciting sense
                    of the heterogeneity of a Romantic-era literary field characterized by forceful
                    but radically differing claims for what literature can or should be.</p>
