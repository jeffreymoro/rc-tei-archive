                        <p rend="noCount"> This article was inspired by the author’s identification
                            of a common problem in the literary classroom: how to allow for
                            subjective reading along with the objective meaning of a work. Alexander
                            engages in a few brief close readings to show how the perception of
                            certain characters in the novel controls a reader’s response to the
                            whole. She argues that teachers must direct their students to certain
                            conclusions from Austen’s text or they will otherwise misguidedly
                            misinterpret them. The article advocates for the importance of teachers
                            showing students <emph>how</emph> to read.</p>

                        <p rend="noCount"> Starting from the global popularity of Austen inside and
                            outside of the classroom, this article argues that her work should be
                            approached cross-culturally, in order to help undergraduates better
                            understand British culture and inspire a greater interest in literature.
                            Amano developed this approach to teaching Austen’s novels with students
                            in Japan who struggled with the text in its original English. In order
                            to help them better understand the text, Amano developed two thematic
                            teaching devices, explored in detail in the article: the picturesque in
                                <title level="m">Northanger Abbey </title>and humor in <title

                            serve to break down the divide between Austen the canonical author and
                            Austen the pop icon of romantic film comedy. </p></item>

                            novel, using Austen’s <title level="m">Emma</title> and <title level="m"
                                >Persuasion </title>to demonstrate the gendered perspective of the
                            texts and how they represent the larger theme of individual perception.
                            The word “handsome” is explored as an example of a word that must be
                            defined in is historical context (“good looking and tall”) in order for
                            Austen’s meaning to become clear. The narrator of such characters’
                            descriptions is also mentioned as a topic worthy of study, because in
                            those two novels, they often “Photoshop” others, to better serve their
                            own appearance. As a result, they are unreliable. Barlow author argues
                            that this is an intentional narrative style that forces the reader to
                            look more closely at the text, both in its immediate location and in
                            relation to the novel as a whole. </p></item>

                        <p rend="noCount"> Brownstein argues that the phenomenon of developing a
                            personal relationship with Austen and her texts is indicative of how
                            there is more at stake in reading literature than textual
                            interpretation. Austen has been considered the epitome of taste, an
                            identity she consciously constructed and one that is evocative of the
                            personal interpretations many readers bring to her works. This article
                            "examines how taste operates” in both Austen’s narratives and in the
                            personal opinions and lives of her readers: as part of a shared social
                            world that literature invites us to participate in, as told through
                            anecdotes about Brownstein’s class. </p></item>

                        <p rend="noCount"> This book opens with a brief summary of Austen’s

                            literary and cultural analysis with personal accounts in order to probe
                            the interconnectedness of readers of Austen. The chapter “Why We Read
                            Jane Austen” details student reactions to various Austen novels, as
                            observed over the course of Brownstein’s teaching career. It details
                            questions she used in her own class to address the themes of Austen’s

                        <p rend="noCount"> This article questions why Austen’s novels (particularly

                            adaptations, are considered appropriate reading for men and women.
                            Demory proposes examining this 21<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi>-century
                            phenomenon and how it functions as part of a larger intertextual canon,
                            rather than seeking to measure how faithful the adaptations are to the
                            novels. Breaking <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice
                            </title>adaptations into three strands of a "tapestry," she sets out to
                            determine why the films are gendered as “chick flicks” and what this
                            says about women’s roles today. </p></item>

                        <p rend="noCount"> This essay debates the pros and cons of showing film
                            clips of Austen’s work in conjunction with the texts, either before or
                            reading the novel itself. Diana tested this by teaching her introductory
                            English course in two groups, one of which viewed the Academy
                            Award-winning version of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>
                            in its entirety, and the other which only read Austen’s novel. The
                            groups were then reversed. She gathered results from comprehension
                            quizzes, an essay, and a questionnaire, which revealed that those who
                            viewed the film first followed the novel’s plot more closely, were more
                            involved in the story and its characters, and recalled more plot
                            details. Appreciation for Austen’s novel was greater after viewing the
                            movie, and Diana believes that better engagement can be gained from a
                            screening of the film before the text itself is read. </p></item>

                        <p rend="noCount"> The argument of this article is that Austen’s novels are
                            valuable for their historical context as well as for their contributions
                            to literature. Dryden argues that Austen’s middle class characters often
                            challenge the more wealthy and established families in ways that mirror
                            real life in post–French Revolution England. He documents a new
                            historically based course he taught, “Jane Austen’s Great Britain,” in
                            which students investigated the connections between her works and the
                            history of the period, as well as examined closely the allusions to the
                            Napoleonic War, Industrial Revolution and age of Revolution hidden
                            beneath the marriage plot.</p></item>

                            have occurred at such an event in Austen’s time and to
                            the preparation and consumption of a Georgian or Regency tea. Over time,
                            this became a tradition with an expanded guest list, and further
                            promoted the goals of the event: to give a more tangible sensory
                            experience to Austen and early nineteenth-century England. Other themes,
                            such as domesticity and hospitality, gender, masculine privilege, social
                            class, and feminism, were brought up in reflections on these events.

                            country dance in order to better understand Austen’s dance scenes as
                            metaphors and social markers. She sees them more broadly as a method of
                            learning in which readers must use their entire bodies to experience
                            literature. One method of this teaching process involved volunteer
                            students literally standing in for Austen’s heroines in the novels and
                            walking the classroom in a physical representation of how the characters
                            moved around in physical space in the narrative. Easton looked at how
                            those movements could be compared to those in other Austen novels and in
                            the construction of prose in general. </p></item>

                            of the original text and the movie versions. Eggleston’s students

                            home responded to war, inspiring the question of why we often choose to
                            sit home and read during times of crisis. Favret offers evidence in
                            support of Austen as wartime novelist who helped form modern opinions of
                            war as more than just dates of battles fought and explains how this
                            insight can be taught in the classroom. She also gives attention to how
                            Austen demonstrates that the lasting effects of past events can
                            influence current lives. </p></item>

                        <p rend="noCount"> Fulk details how he bypassed restrictions placed upon him
                            by a small, Christian university in the South through a feminist unit on
                                <title level="m">Emma</title>, a text largely considered
                            heterosexual “safe reading.” Using close reading in conjunction with
                            theories by Adrienne Rich and Mary Louise Pratt, Fulk aimed to keep
                            students’ repulsed reactions to Emma and Harriet in check and to invite
                            queer readings of the text, although he did not identify them as such.
                            More specific details on how this can be accomplished are examined using
                            chapters one and two of Austen’s novel as a guide. Fulk demonstrates how
                            discussions of power and gender in <title level="m">Emma</title> can
                            address sexuality in the text without risking reprisals from
                            conservative audiences. </p></item>

                            thesis statement of sorts, calling on his students to see all prose as
                            rhetorically based. Further examples for classroom analysis include the
                            novel’s first chapter, Mr. Collins's introduction letter, Darcy’s
                            decisive letter to Elizabeth, their first encounter at the ball, and
                            Charlotte’s decision to marry Collins. </p></item>

                        <p rend="noCount"> This essay identifies Austen’s novels as falling into one
                            of two categories: those containing grave, less obvious humor (<title
                                level="m">Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park, Persuasion</title>)
                            and those with witty but imperfect heroines (<title level="m">Northanger
                                Abbey, Pride and Prejudice, Emma</title>). However, in the latter
                            group, <title level="m">Emma</title> stands out for its significantly
                            less likeable heroine and titular character. Meihuizen argues that it
                            should be taught for its valuable lesson on perceptions of marriage
                            during the period. Other topics of importance to be emphasized are
                            interference/intervention and deception, which, when joined with the
                            topic of marriage, create a reflective, dense text that is ultimately
                            about Emma’s journey to self-discovery, a journey that the author argues
                            is worthy of study by readers of all genders. </p></item>

                            repulsive. They criticized the characters as snobbish and hypocritical,
                            ignored the still-relevant problem of social status, and found trouble
                            with the plot in general, due to ignorance of the period in which it is
                            set, the author argues. In an attempt to remedy these problems, Morgan
                            engaged the class in defining terms and recognizing how modern society
                            deals with things like wealth and background, although she reports that
                            the best discussion came not from the examination of the novel itself,

                            how the author’s assumptions about teaching gender were challenged and
                            altered by the experience. Initially, the students were nervous to voice

                            importance on courtship and marrying at a young age. The students
                            expressed admiration for Elizabeth Bennet’s ability to remain mentally

                            the meaning of one word as it occurs throughout the text, then in an
                            extended passage or paragraph, and finally in comparing two passages
                            from different parts of a novel. Austen functions as the “sensitivity
                            training” introduction to the first part of this sequence, offering a
                            clear example of a text where words and phrases hold meanings of their
                            own. In Stewart’s experience, students quickly identify Austen’s prose
                            style as confident and calm, capable of carrying hidden meanings. The
                            “recognition scenes” in this novel examined for such moments are those

                        <p rend="noCount"> This essay details the motivation behind the author’s
                            decision to teach Austen in a small, seminar-type class setting, rather
                            than a lecture format. Students showed such a high interest in the class
                            that the author had to handpick its members. Trilling believes that
                            Austen was appealing to so many young people because she offers a repose
                            from a modern world they feel out of place in, with her genteel
                            visual-based world, and construction of characters to whom they can
                            relate. He draws the conclusion that, despite all of the unfamiliar
                            aspects of the Romantic period and Austen’s world, humanism is what
                            ultimately creates the bond between the modern reader and Austen, an
                            idea expanded upon in this article to include other authors and texts.

                        <p rend="noCount"> Wallace promotes teaching the artistic shift from
                            classical to Romantic in both music and literature through the work of
                            Emily Brontë, Jane Austen, Beethoven and Mozart using concepts of tempo,
                            melody, and rhythm. Wallace discusses his decision to include these
                            artists instead of others, and explains what resources he used to
                            complete the class goals. He also details assignments and reading
                            suggestions garnered from the experience of teaching the course multiple
                            times. </p></item>

                                    >Persuasion</title> and Pedagogy: On Teaching Ethics with Jane
                                Austen.” <title level="j">Teaching Philosophy</title> (2008):
                                311–31. Print.</hi></label>
                        <p rend="noCount"> Watkins suggests that the best way to teach complex
                            characters in a moral philosophy course is through the study of novels,
                            and particularly of <title level="m">Persuasion, </title>for its
                            detailed and complex descriptions. Doing so emphasizes philosophical
                            examples, revealing the text to be one of interdisciplinary ethical
                            engagement. To overcome students' tendency to focus on plot only,
                            Watkins introduced the novel at the end of the class, in order to ensure
                            that the students have had a solid philosophical background from which
                            to draw their analysis, in addition to short readings that accompany the
                            various chapters of Austen’s work. <title level="m">Persuasion
                            </title>serves the ethics class more readily than other Austen novels
                            because of its accessible heroine, lack of distortion of the story by a
                            Hollywood movie version, and emphasis on pride and virtue.</p></item>

                            learning and self-discovery in moral education become visible. Teaching
                            Austen and Rowling together reveals how both authors focused their plots
                            around one character’s perspective and encourage imagination, and this
                            article demonstrates how <title level="m">Emma </title>and <title

                        <p rend="noCount"> Zaal begins with analysis of the sophisticated strategies
                            Austen employs in the main movements of the novel and the character
                            construction of Emma. The essay suggests ways to introduce the text to a
                            modern audience through two key questions: should marriage partners be
                            chosen based on social status, and is it ever okay to conceal one
                            relationship by hiding behind false feelings for someone else? Teachers
                            can gain additional benefits by using the Socratic method, engaging in
                            close reading of the text, and having prepared questions. Zaal also says
                            that Austen’s humor is so intertwined with other subjects in the book
                            that it should not be given separate treatment. </p>
