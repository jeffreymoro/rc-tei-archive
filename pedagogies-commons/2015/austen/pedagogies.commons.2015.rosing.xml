                <p rend="noCount">This article argues that Romantic-era children’s literature
                    provides a useful means of introducing first-year students to Austen’s
                    novels. By comparing children's decision-making processes in texts for young
                    readers to the dilemmas faced by novel heroines, students better understand
                    Austen’s era and the stakes of her heroines’ choices.

                <p>Reading and writing about a Jane Austen novel can be quite challenging for
                    first-year composition students, and <title level="m">Emma </title>(1816) is an
                    especially difficult read for those who are unfamiliar with Austen or the
                    Romantic era. Lacking the suspense of <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title> (1818) or the dramatic accident at the heart of <title
                        level="m">Persuasion</title> (1818), <title level="m">Emma </title>concerns
                    the everyday preoccupations of a spoiled heiress and the village society over
                    which she presides. As Julia Prewitt Brown notes, the novel has “less story and
                    outward moral conflict than the previous Austen novels” and “the climax . . . is
                    an insulting remark spoken at a picnic” (18). The students in my composition
                    courses, most of whom are engineering or business majors, struggle with the
                    novel’s slow pace, as well as the unfamiliar language and class structure that
                    define Highbury society. I have found that assigning a handful of Maria
                    Edgeworth’s stories for children immediately after students read <title
                        level="m">Emma</title> gives them a way into the culture and customs of this
                    baffling world and helps illuminate the stakes of the choices Austen’s
                    characters make. </p>
                <p>Teaching a children’s text alongside a canonical novel like <title level="m"
                        >Emma</title> is fairly unusual, in part because Romantic-era children’s
                    literature has long been considered unworthy of serious study. Overviews of
                    children’s literature traditionally described how the drearily didactic books of
                    the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were replaced by the Victorian
                    fantasy texts that ushered in a golden age of children’s literature. Percy Muir,
                    writing in 1954, characterizes the Romantic period’s female writers for children
                    as a “monstrous regiment of women,” noting that, “They had obviously studied the
                    previous output of children’s publishers, and had made up their minds that they
                    could do exactly the same sort of thing, only very much better than it had been
                    done before. Therefore all their books are strongly flavoured with morals”
                    (82-3). Muir’s summary is typical of how critics tended to deride children's
                    writers as amateurs, yet mocked them for studying the literary market. Even
                    thirty years later, Nigel Cross describes writing for children as a popular
                    choice for “the averagely educated but uninspired and inexperienced literary
                    woman” because such writing “required neither genius nor learning, only patience
                    and necessity” (199- 200). Recent monographs and scholarly journals have
                    complicated such accounts by attending to previously ignored Romantic-era texts
                    for children, but these studies often consider children’s literature apart from
                    the canonical works of “adult” authors like Austen.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> The journals <title level="j">Children’s Literature</title>
                        and <title level="j">The Children’s Literature Association
                        Quarterly</title>, for example, publish solely on children’s literature, and
                        many articles and books over the past two decades have also been dedicated to the topic.</note> This separation also occurs in the classroom,
                    where students read children’s texts in a single unit or a course dedicated to
                    children’s or young adult literature. While such courses do the important work
                    of bringing neglected literature to the attention of students, isolating
                    children’s texts from their wider literary context risks missing the ways they
                    engaged with the political and social issues of the era. </p>
                <p>Texts by complex figures like Maria Edgeworth, Hannah More, Anna Letitia
                    Barbauld, and Charlotte Smith (who were poets, novelists, and pedagogy theorists
                    as well as writers for children) entered wholeheartedly into the period’s
                    debates about education and child-rearing, as well as slavery, poverty, and
                        war.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Critics have shown the many ways that
                        children’s literature engages with the social and political issues under
                        debate in the period. Elizabeth A. Dolan, for example, explores how
                        Charlotte Smith’s children’s literature critiques the treatment of the poor,
                        while M.O. Grenby examines how the politics of the French Revolution and the
                        Napoleonic wars emerge in children’s texts. </note> Reading these texts
                    helps students appreciate the richness of the era’s children’s literature and
                    also provides a valuable context for more “canonical” Romantic texts. Although
                    children’s texts have been dismissed because of their simple language and
                    straightforward didacticism, these very qualities offer students an accessible
                    context for the work of a writer like Austen. The relative brevity and
                    simplicity of many children’s texts make them easier for students to digest than
                    a longer novel like <title level="m">Emma</title>. More importantly, by
                    depicting children learning how to interact with members of their
                    communities—including other children, adults, social superiors or inferiors, and
                    even animals—the texts clarify social expectations for students unfamiliar with
                    the era, teaching them these values along with the child protagonists.</p>
                <p>Didactic texts might seem unlikely to attract students, but I have found that the
                    everyday situations and clear moral choices in children’s literature help
                    students who are uncomfortable writing and talking about Romantic-era literature
                    feel authorized to participate in discussions about these dilemmas. In fact,
                    didactic texts work particularly well in the introductory composition or
                    literature classroom because students’ unfamiliarity with hierarchies of “high”
                    and “low” literature, or even of “didactic” as a category, enables them to read
                    with fewer preconceptions about which kinds of texts deserve their attention and
                    which do not.</p>
                <p>Further, reading overtly didactic children’s literature alerts students to the
                    more subtle didactic elements in Austen’s work. Students often perceive Austen’s
                    novels solely as love stories, but reading her work alongside children’s
                    literature reveals that Austen is as concerned with moral behavior as the
                    writers of children’s literature are. The young heroes and heroines of texts for
                    children struggle with the same essential dilemmas that Austen’s characters
                    face. When Rosamond—the child heroine of Edgeworth’s series of children’s
                    stories, first published in <title level="m">The Parent’s Assistant
                    </title>(1796)—must decide between the beautiful purple jar she desires and the
                    sensible shoes she needs, she experiences a miniature version of Marianne
                    Dashwood’s or Elizabeth Bennet’s quandary when choosing between a charming
                    scoundrel and a more appropriate (if initially unappealing) suitor. Of all the
                    Austen heroines, Emma Woodhouse is most like an older version of Edgeworth’s
                    irrepressible Rosamond. Like her younger counterpart, Emma’s mistaken confidence
                    in her ability to read the world around her leads her to make a series of poor
                    choices. Pairing the Rosamond stories with <title level="m">Emma </title>helps
                    students understand the profound consequences of the apparently trivial choices
                    that Emma and others in the novel make. </p>
                <p>Although students in my first-year composition course on “Information Networks”
                    find reading <title level="m">Emma</title> challenging, the novel’s concern with
                    communication of all kinds (especially mistakes and misreadings) helps them
                    think about how their writing participates in information networks in our own
                    era of texting and tweeting. The class, which builds on the previous semester’s
                    writing course, covers a range of time periods and genres, from Austen to
                    Raymond Chandler’s detective novel <title level="m">Farewell, My Lovely</title>
                    (1940) and M.T. Anderson’s dystopian young adult novel <title level="m"
                        >Feed</title> (2002). Throughout the semester, students connect these
                    diverse texts by writing about the ways that information networks persist and
                    shift across time and culture. Beginning the course with the enclosed and even
                    claustrophobic information networks of Austen’s Highbury establishes a reference
                    point by which students measure the sprawling information networks of Chandler’s
                    menacing Los Angeles or Anderson’s blighted suburbia. While the characters and
                    cultures in all these texts are very distant from my students’ experience, in
                    some ways the world of <title level="m">Emma </title>strikes them as the
                    strangest, and children’s texts like Edgeworth’s Rosamond stories provide a
                    useful map for navigating it. </p>
                <p>We read <title level="m">Emma</title> in fairly brief segments and discuss them
                    over the course of six fifty-minute class periods. When we finish reading <title
                        level="m">Emma</title>, I assign three of Maria Edgeworth’s stories: “The
                    Purple Jar,” “The Two Plums,” and “The Hyacinths,” all featuring young
                    Rosamond’s adventures. Because students have finished <title level="m">Emma
                    </title>before reading the Rosamond stories, they are able to trace the pattern
                    of Emma’s failed match-making attempts and compare them to Rosamond’s mistakes.
                    Although Edgeworth’s stories can stand independently, each tale builds on the
                    previous one as Rosamond’s experiences guide her new decisions. In each story,
                    Rosamond chooses between an object that will grant her short-lived pleasure and
                    one that will prove more useful in the long term. In “The Purple Jar,” she
                    wastes money on a jar instead of purchasing the new shoes she needs. Rosamond
                    learns from this mistake, and in the story of “The Two Plums” she chooses a
                    useful sewing box over a decorative stone plum. Finally, in “The Hyacinths,” she
                    rejects damaged hyacinth blossoms in favor of roots that will bloom later.</p>
                <p>My students and I spend most of our class time discussing Edgeworth’s most famous
                    story, “The Purple Jar,” which vividly depicts the serious consequences of an
                    impulsive choice. The story opens as seven-year-old Rosamond shops with her
                    mother. She is enchanted by the dazzling objects she sees in the shop windows,
                    particularly a purple jar that she wants to use for a flower vase. Her mother
                    tells her that she will give her money to spend either on the jar or on the new
                    shoes she desperately needs. Rosamond pleads for help making this decision, but
                    her mother only advises her to examine the jar closely before making up her
                    mind. Although Rosamond insists that she does not need to inspect the jar, she
                    still craves her mother’s approval. When her mother asks if she has made a
                    decision, she answers, “Mamma! – yes, – I believe. – If you please – I should
                    like the flower-pot; that is, if you won’t think me very silly, mamma.” Her
                    mother responds, “Why, as to that, I can’t promise you, Rosamond; but, when you
                    are to judge for yourself, you should chuse what will make you the happiest; and
                    then it would not signify who thought you silly, mamma” (117). Rather than
                    interfering in her daughter’s choice or its consequences, Rosamond’s mother
                    allows her to think and talk through the problem on her own.</p>
                <p>The mother’s policy of non-interference extends to her refusal to mitigate the
                    consequences of Rosamond’s choice. When the jar arrives at her home and Rosamond
                    discovers that it is only a clear container filled with a purple liquid, her
                    mother insists that she must abide by her decision and wait another month to buy
                    new shoes. Not only must Rosamond endure the pain of walking in tattered shoes,
                    she is unable to go on an excursion with her father because he refuses to take
                    her in such a “slip-shod” condition (119). Rosamond realizes she has made the
                    wrong decision and declares, “I am sure—no, not quite sure—but, I hope, I shall
                    be wiser another time” (119). My students usually protest that the consequences
                    of Rosamond’s choice seem unduly severe, and their horror or amusement at the
                    mother’s sternness leads to lively class discussion. Although students initially
                    dismiss the mother’s pedagogical method as a harsh and outmoded approach to
                    child-rearing, they begin to complicate this progress narrative as we
                    contextualize her behavior in two ways: looking closely at the adult/child
                    interactions in the story and reading excerpts from contemporary child-rearing
                    texts and literature for children. </p>
                <p>I first ask students to pay attention to the mother’s own explanations of her
                    pedagogical methods. In “The Hyacinths,” for example, she provides a clear
                    explanation of why she refuses to give her daughter explicit guidance: “‘Don’t
                    consult my eyes, Rosamond,’ said her mother, smiling: ‘You shall see nothing in
                    my eyes;’ and her mother turned away her head.—‘Use your own understanding,
                    because you will not always have my eyes to see with’” (146). The mother’s
                    remark hints at inevitable loss; Rosamond must learn to make her own decisions
                    and to abide by their consequences because she will eventually need to function
                    without her mother’s guidance.</p>
                <p>Asking students to read the dialogues between Rosamond and her mother aloud (with
                    one reader taking each part) highlights the contrast between the child’s
                    effusive pleas for affirmation and her mother’s terse replies. Barbara
                    McClintock Folsom likewise suggests having students explore the
                    misunderstandings between Elizabeth and Darcy in<title level="m"> Pride and
                        Prejudice</title> by analyzing their conversations (103). A similar exercise
                    works particularly well with children’s literature because so many of the texts
                    foreground conversation in educational dialogues, rational debates, and
                    passionate arguments.</p>
                <p>As they read dialogue aloud, students begin to see the method behind the mother’s
                    apparent detachment and trace how carefully she shapes her responses. The voices
                    of mother and daughter form an especially vivid contrast in the passage in which
                    Rosamond discovers her mistake about the jar: <quote><p rend="noCount">“Oh, dear
                            mother!” cried [Rosamond], as soon as she had taken off the top, “but
                            there’s something dark in it—it smells disagreeably—what is it? I didn’t
                            want this black stuff.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “Nor I neither, my dear.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “But what shall I do with it, mamma?”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “That I cannot tell.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “But will be of no use to me, mamma.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “That I can’t help.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “But I must pour it out, and fill the flower-pot with
                            water.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “That’s as you please, my dear.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “Will you lend me a bowl to pour it into, mamma?”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount"> “That was more than I promised you, my dear; but I will
                            lend you a bowl.” (118)</p></quote> Reading this dialogue aloud
                    highlights its tightly controlled yet flexible structure.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> The austerity of Rosamond’s mother had already begun to seem
                        excessively harsh by the Victorian era. Rose, the child protagonist of
                        Louisa May Alcott’s <title level="m">Eight Cousins</title> (1875), whose own
                        name echoes that of Edgeworth’s heroine, declares “‘I always thought it
                        very unfair in her mother not to warn the poor thing a little bit; and she
                        was regularly mean when Rosamond asked for a bowl to put the purple stuff
                        in, and she said, in such a provoking way, ‘I did not agree to lend you a
                        bowl, but I will, my dear.’ Ugh! I always want to shake that hateful woman,
                        though she was a moral mamma’” (186). </note> The mother shapes and guides
                    the exchange, but Rosamond actively questions and participates in the
                    conversation. Performing this passage also provides a glimpse of how Edgeworth’s
                    original readers may have engaged with the text, perhaps as an adult read the
                    dialogue aloud with a child who interrupted to question and clarify.</p>
                <p>After we consider the interactions between Rosamond and her mother, I offer more
                    background on the mother’s pedagogical methods by placing her in the tradition
                    of children’s texts that feature wise female mentors. Some Romantic children’s
                    texts and treatises on education feature male educators, like the tutor of Jean
                    Jacques Rousseau’s <title level="m">Emile</title> (1762) or Mr. Barlow in Thomas
                    Day’s <title level="m">The History of Sandford and Merton</title> (1783), but
                    Mitzi Myers points to the prevalence of female mentors in the era’s children’s
                    literature, noting that these woman-authored texts offer “a new mode of female
                    heroism” that emphasizes “rationality, self-command, and moral autonomy”
                    (“Impeccable” 34). If time allows, I may assign excerpts from children’s texts
                    that feature powerful female mentors, such as Mary Wollstonecraft’s <title
                        level="m">Original Stories from Real Life</title> (1788) or Charlotte
                    Smith’s <title level="m">Rural Walks </title>(1795). Contrasting Edgeworth’s
                    object-based pedagogy with the moral discourses and community interactions that
                    mentors in the Wollstonecraft and Smith texts facilitate demonstrates the
                    diverse pedagogical approaches included under the umbrella term of “didactic”
                    literature. </p>
                <p>In addition to understanding Rosamond’s mother as part of a tradition of female
                    mentors in children’s literature, students analyze her pedagogical practice in
                    more depth by reading excerpts from contemporary texts on child-rearing, such as
                        <title level="m">Practical Education </title>(1798), which Edgeworth
                    co-wrote with her father Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Students are often quick to
                    dismiss the methods of Rosamond’s mother as an example of oppressive
                    child-rearing practices that have been replaced by enlightened approaches that
                    allow the child more freedom. Learning more about the remarkable degree of
                    self-awareness that <title level="m">Practical Education</title> and the
                    Rosamond stories attribute to children, however, helps complicate this simple
                    progress narrative. The chapter on “Truth,” which cautions parents against
                    guiding children too closely, is particularly useful for understanding the
                    apparent detachment of Rosamond’s mother: “Children are alarmed if they see that
                    you are very anxious and impatient for their answer, they think that they hazard
                    much by their reply; they hesitate, and look eagerly in your face, to discover
                    by your countenance what they ought to think and feel, and what sort of answer
                    you expect” (321-2). The pedagogical methods the Edgeworths describe in <title
                        level="m">Practical Education</title> are not simply meant to wean children
                    from dependence to independence but rather to teach them to be self-reliant yet
                    responsible community members: the same notion of maturity that the Rosamond
                    stories and <title level="m">Emma</title> envision for their heroines. </p>
                <p>Reading excerpts from non-fiction texts about child-rearing alongside books
                    intended for children also gives students a grounding in the ways that the
                    pressing issues of social inequity and slavery intersect with debates about
                    childhood education. <title level="m">Practical Education</title> underscores
                    how the child’s interactions with adults are inevitably shaped by her
                    subordination, noting that, “[T]he hope of conciliating the good will of the
                    powerful beings by whom they are surrounded, is one of the first wishes that
                    appears in the minds of intelligent and affectionate children” (291-2).
                    Edgeworth links the child’s subordination to other kinds of social oppression,
                    arguing that Irish laborers’ apparent deceptiveness derives from a similar wish
                    to please, and that subordination is also responsible for the “propensity to
                    falsehood of the negro slaves” (208, 211). Reading passages like this along with
                    Edgeworth’s ameliorist tale “The Grateful Negro” (1804) helps students identify
                    the ways she draws attention to oppression even as she reinforces the race and
                    class assumptions that underpin such oppression. </p>
                <p>Edgeworth’s stories assert that the child’s apparently trivial decisions matter
                    because they determine the kinds of choices she will make as an adult.
                    Witnessing Rosamond’s decision-making process is meant to train young readers to
                    examine their own options closely, to privilege the useful over the ornamental,
                    and to choose long-term happiness over instant gratification. Mitzi Myers notes
                    the empowering implications of such lessons for girl readers: “[E]ach tale acts
                    to remedy culturally determined female deficiency in independent thinking and
                    affirms that girls can achieve control of their wits and hence in some measure
                    of their own lives” (“Dilemmas” 73). Like Rosamond, Emma is occupied by a series
                    of choices that initially seem unimportant but prove to have profound
                    consequences for her own happiness and the stability of her community. </p>
                <p><title level="m">Emma </title>is filled with everyday objects (like Rosamond’s
                    purple jar and her stone plum) that become significant elements in the larger
                    plot. Like Rosamond, Emma initially misreads objects like Mr. Elton’s charade
                    and Jane Fairfax’s pianoforte: she interprets the charade as a sign of Mr.
                    Elton’s attachment to Harriet although it is really a message meant for her, and
                    she reads the mysterious pianoforte as proof of Jane’s involvement with Mr.
                    Dixon, unaware that it is a present from Frank Churchill. Like Rosamond refusing
                    to examine the purple jar before buying it, Emma fails to scrutinize the
                    evidence before coming to a conclusion. When she finally realizes that Mr. Elton
                    meant to pay his addresses to her rather than Harriet, Emma admits that her
                    desires have twisted the evidence: “She had taken up the idea, she supposed, and
                    made everything bend to it” (95). Emma resolves to learn from her misreading of
                    Mr. Elton’s intentions much as Rosamond declares her “hope” that she will make a
                    better choice next time: <quote>It was foolish, it was wrong, to take so active
                        a part in bringing any two people together. It was adventuring too far,
                        assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious—a trick of what
                        ought to be simple. She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do
                        such things no more. (97)</quote> In spite of this determination, however,
                    Emma soon proceeds with her plans to pair Harriet with Frank Churchill, a match
                    that is also doomed to fail. Emma repeats the same mistakes in part because she
                    does not see herself as a Rosamond figure in need of education, but rather as a
                    mentor figure like Rosamond’s mother.</p>
                <p>Reading children’s texts that depict powerful female mentors helps students
                    understand why Emma wishes to take on this kind of authority, especially at a
                    time when few avenues of exerting social power were available to women, even
                    those of her privileged station. Emma’s appropriation of the mentor role is most
                    obvious in her interactions with Harriet Smith, whom she casts in the role of
                    the child in need of instruction. Harriet, in Mr. Knightley’s words, “‘is the
                    natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at
                    all, and certainly no respectable relations’” (45). Reading the dialogue between
                    Emma and Harriet in light of the passage from <title level="m">Practical
                        Education</title> that describes children’s desire to please “powerful
                    beings” shows how the unequal power balance between Emma and Harriet dictates
                    the form and content of their conversation. As <title level="m">Practical
                        Education</title> suggests, while Harriet’s need for affirmation may
                    certainly be evidence of her naïveté, her inferior social status predisposes her
                    to value Emma’s opinion over her own in the same way that Rosamond craves her
                    mother’s approval. </p>
                <p>Emma’s appropriation of the wise mentor role becomes comically evident in the
                    passage in which she and Harriet discuss Robert Martin’s proposal letter. My
                    students and I return to this passage after reading the Rosamond stories; I ask
                    two students to read the dialogue aloud, while a third reads the narrator’s
                    lines. As when reading the passage from “The Purple Jar,” performing this
                    dialogue aloud draws attention to the marked contrast between Harriet’s appeals
                    for affirmation and Emma’s attempts to withhold advice: <quote>
                        <p rend="noCount">“What would you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss
                            Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have
                            nothing to do with it. This is a point which you must settle with your
                            own feelings . . . I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a
                            woman <emph>doubts</emph> as to whether she should accept a man or not,
                            she certainly ought to refuse him . . . I thought it my duty as a
                            friend, and older than yourself, to say this much to you. But do not
                            imagine that I want to influence you.”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">“Oh, no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if
                            you would just advise me what I had best do—no, no, I do not mean
                            that—as you say, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—one should not be
                            hesitating—it is a very serious thing. It will be safer to say ‘No,’
                            perhaps. Do you think I had better say ‘No’?”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would
                            I advise you either way. You must be the best judge of your own
                            happiness.” (38-9)</p>
                    </quote> Because they have already analyzed the dialogue between Rosamond and
                    her mother, my students quickly notice how Emma mimics an ideal mentor’s
                    detachment even as she subtly manipulates Harriet’s decision-making. This
                    passage can even be read as a critique of the pedagogical method Edgeworth
                    advocates because it demonstrates how easily the more powerful person can
                    dominate such interactions.</p>
                <p>While I usually teach only a single Austen novel in a first-year composition
                    course, pairing the Rosamond stories with additional Austen novels in a
                    literature survey or a dedicated Austen course would help students identify
                    further connections between both sets of texts. Reading <title level="m"
                        >Persuasion</title> along with the Rosamond stories, for example, frames
                    Anne Elliot’s initial refusal to marry Captain Wentworth as the kind of choice
                    that Rosamond learns to make, one that values practical considerations over
                    ephemeral desires. Yet Anne’s unhappiness after the broken engagement points to
                    the problems with relying too closely on the advice of her mentor Lady Russell.
                    She even seems to unlearn some of the lessons Rosamond dutifully digests; Anne
                    “had been forced into prudence in her youth,” but “learned romance as she grew
                    older—the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning” (58). While <title level="m"
                        >Persuasion</title> seems to critique the model of development the Rosamond
                    stories advocate, the novel complicates rather than counters the message of
                    Edgeworth’s stories by disrupting a narrative of simple growth from youth to
                    maturity.</p>
                <p>Edgeworth’s tales provide an especially appealing introduction to Romantic
                    children’s literature and they pair well with most of Austen’s novels, but
                    reading other contemporary children’s texts can also help students grasp the
                    Romantic period’s conceptions of childhood and education. As I have described,
                    texts by Smith and Wollstonecraft help establish the importance of female
                    mentors in this literature, and other children’s texts help illuminate key ideas
                    about education in the Romantic era as well as nature and the Gothic. Simple
                    comparisons between an Austen novel and a children’s text reveal the broad
                    didactic structure of Austen’s work. When teaching <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title> (1811), for example, I might ask students to compare the
                    novel to one of the many children’s texts that feature wise/foolish sister
                    pairs, from early folk tales to Harriet Martineau’s <title level="m">Five Years
                        of Youth; or, Sense and Sentiment</title> (1831), showing how Austen’s
                    account of the Dashwood sisters draws on childhood stories about the competing
                    demands of prudence and romance.</p>
                <p>Discussions of <title level="m">Mansfield Park </title>(1814), with its emphasis
                    on the far-reaching repercussions of early education, benefit even more from the
                    kinds of contextualization children’s texts offer, given that students may find
                    the novel’s relatively static plot even more challenging than <title level="m"
                        >Emma</title>. The contrast between the education of the Bertram sisters and
                    their cousin Fanny Price foreshadows the choices they will make as women. The
                    Bertrams can “[R]epeat the chronological order of the kings of England, with the
                    dates of their accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns … and
                    of the Roman emperors as low as Severus; besides a great deal of the Heathen
                    Mythology, and all the Metals, Semi-Metals, Planets, and distinguished
                    philosophers,” while Fanny “cannot put the map of Europe together … cannot tell
                    the principal rivers in Russia … she never heard of Asia Minor … she does not
                    know the difference between water-colours and crayons!” (54-5). Fanny, of
                    course, possesses “the less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity,
                    and humility” that the Bertrams lack, and her subsequent happiness is a reward
                    for exercising these qualities (55). In spite of these admirable attributes,
                    Fanny is often considered the least likeable of Austen’s heroines. In contrast
                    to the witty Elizabeth or the endearingly conceited Emma, she is something of a
                    cipher; children’s literature provides a helpful context for understanding her
                    character. </p>
                <p>In the early sections of the novel, Fanny is a mute witness of everyone else’s
                    folly. During the haphazard tour of Mr. Rushworth’s estate, she waits patiently
                    on a bench while the other characters pass before her in a kind of panorama of
                    petulance and selfishness. In this and similar scenes, Fanny resembles the
                    “spectator” figure that appears in many forms in the era’s literature. While
                    versions of the spectator figure vary, children’s texts like Ellenor Fenn’s
                        <title level="m">The Fairy Spectator, or, The Invisible Monitor</title>
                    (1789), in which a benevolent but severe judge observes and judges the actions
                    of children, offer a usefully succinct version of the spectator figure and
                    highlights Fanny’s function as the moral center of Mansfield Park. Fanny watches
                    the landscape as closely as she watches the people surrounding her, and
                    children’s texts can also help students understand organizing concepts of nature
                    that become important in Austen’s novels. Anne’s musings on poetry and nature in
                        <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, for example, recall children’s texts
                    like Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">Rural Walks</title> (1795) and its
                    sequel <title level="m">Rambles Farther</title> (1796) that feature female
                    mentors who engage their students in encounters with nature that provide moral
                    instruction and solace for profound loss. Reading Austen and Smith together
                    gives students a wider context for Romantic notions of the beautiful and the
                    sublime or the idea of the picturesque, especially when paired with passages
                    from Edmund Burke and William Gilpin.</p>
                <p>Discussions of the Gothic and fears about female readership taking place in an
                    introductory Romanticism course are also enriched by engaging with children’s
                    literature. Reading <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> alongside Mary
                    Lamb’s children’s story “The Young Mahometan” or Charles Lamb’s “The Witch
                    Aunt,” both from the 1809 <title level="m">Mrs. Leicester’s School</title>, and
                    both featuring young girls whose unsupervised reading of frightening texts
                    causes them unbearable terrors, demonstrates how Gothic trappings are deployed
                    to underscore the dangers of indiscriminate reading for both child and adult
                    audiences.</p>
                <p>I encourage students to explore the connections between children’s texts and
                    Austen’s novels in more depth through a set of writing assignments that ask them
                    to place the fiction we study in context with non-fiction texts, make personal
                    connections to the literature, compare texts to one another, and rewrite one
                    text in the form of another. This set of writing practices helps draw out the
                    ways that Romantic children’s literature engages with the diverse concerns of
                    the era. As I discuss above, students gain valuable context for the fiction they
                    read by exploring non-fiction texts on child-rearing. They might write, for
                    example, about the ways a text like <title level="m">Practical Education</title>
                    illuminates the contrasting educations of Fanny and the Bertram sisters in
                        <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>. </p>
                <p>I also ask students to make personal connections to the texts by writing brief
                    essays that reflect on two pivotal decisions they made in their own lives, one
                    as a child and one as an adult. Writing about how they made these choices and
                    comparing them to the decision-making that happens in an Austen novel or a
                    children’s text helps students gain a more immediate understanding of the high
                    stakes of the seemingly simple choices in the Austen novels and children’s
                    texts. Creating assignments that make comparisons between texts supplements the
                    kinds of comparisons my students do in class by reading aloud parallel dialogues
                    from “The Purple Jar” and <title level="m">Emma</title>. One paper assignment
                    might ask them to identify an obvious didactic moment in a children’s text and
                    to find a similar moment in an Austen novel, describing what the lesson is and
                    how it gets learned. By requiring students to identify subtle didactic moments
                    in Austen’s texts, this assignment complicates assumptions that Romantic-era
                    children’s texts are merely dreary moral tales or that Austen’s novels are
                    simple love stories.</p>
                <p>Finally, students can make connections between Austen’s novels and children’s
                    texts by rewriting an incident from an Austen novel in imitation of the dialogue
                    and incidents of a children’s text. For example, asking students to reimagine
                    the climactic scene at Box Hill in <title level="m">Emma</title> as one of
                    Rosamond’s experiences leads to a discussion of how Emma’s rudeness to Miss
                    Bates would be corrected by Rosamond’s mother if her daughter had made a similar
                    misstep. Like the previous assignment, this rewriting task helps students first
                    recognize the didactic elements of Austen’s work and then consider its
                    relationship with children’s texts that are also concerned with how and what
                    girls and women learn. Students can reinforce such connections by engaging in a
                    “time travel” exercise in which they imagine a child character like Rosamond
                    grown up and faced with the choices of Emma, Elizabeth, or Anne. How would she
                    make decisions, given her past experiences? Contextualizing, connecting,
                    comparing, and rewriting exposes the process by which children’s texts teach
                    their young readers to acquire the social values and behaviors that can seem so
                    mysterious to a first-time reader of Austen. Engaging with this process helps
                    students discover, like many an Austen heroine, that both prudence and romance
                    can be learned.</p>
