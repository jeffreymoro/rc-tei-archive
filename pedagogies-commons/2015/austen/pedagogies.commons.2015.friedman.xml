               Marketplaces</head>

            <p>Prior to my current job, I did not consider myself an “Austen scholar.” That said, I
               have long used Jane Austen as a way to anchor and engage students, which is the
               subject of this essay. I am aware that the Austen name sells not only her six
               complete novels, but endless adaptations, action figures, how-to guides, and other
               material. Within academia, Austen is a name to conjure with in times of declining
               enrollments: whether or not a student has read Jane Austen, the odds are high that
               they recognize the name. Rare is the institution where a course with Austen in the
               title will not fill rapidly.</p>
            <p>This is a double-edged sword: as an eighteenth-centuryist, I am keenly (and sometimes
               uncomfortably) aware of the way that Austen becomes an alpha and omega: the end of
               the eighteenth-century, and the opening salvo into what will be the Victorian novel.
               To people outside my profession, I found myself short-handing the “what do you
               study/teach?” question with “the stuff before and around Jane Austen.” My official
               specialty is the long eighteenth-century, a period roughly bounded (depending on who
               you ask) by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 and the beginning of Victoria’s
               reign in 1837. Within my department my duties at the undergraduate level usually
               include the first half of the British survey (ending in 1778), the eighteenth-century
               novel course, and the late eighteenth-century/Romantic period course called the “Age
               of Revolutions” (1770-1830).</p>
            <p>This essay will primarily discuss a course that fell outside of the typical
               curricular needs I fill. In the fall of 2011, the annual course titled
               nineteenth-century novel needed to be covered and our usual Victorianist faculty were
               busy with leave and other administrative duties. The course is offered often enough
               that it is not taught as a survey, but as a topics course depending on the
               instructor’s particular interests, so long as the novels covered were produced
               between 1800 and 1899. I was asked, and accepted the offer to teach the course.</p>
            <p>What emerged was a class I called the “not-Austen” course: a course that invoked
               Austen in its title and referred back to Austen often without itself being an
               “Austen” course. I will show how courses can be fruitfully haunted by Austen. In
               addition, this course allowed me to experiment with a final project that has had a
               long life beyond this one course. Thus, I will also describe how the original course
               and its final editing assignment has dramatically altered the ways in which I teach
               my upper-division courses.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The Course</head>
               <p>It’s perhaps no surprise that when asked to teach a nineteenth-century novel
                  course I would ask for permission to teach the course as an <emph>early</emph>
                  nineteenth-century course. My very first use of Austen-as-rationale was in its
                  title: “Two Hundred Years Since: Austen's Sister-Novelists in the Literary
                  Marketplace” a title that obviously made use of Austen’s popularity (or at least
                  name recognition) and more subtly nodded to Austen’s fellow-author Walter Scott,
                  whose first novel <title level="m">Waverley</title> (1814) was subtitled “’Tis
                  Sixty Years Since.” </p>
               <p>For the purposes of the course, “Austen’s Literary Marketplace” was encapsulated
                  in less than two decades, spanning from 1800 until her death in 1817. This focus
                  could, with different justifications, be both narrower and wider: Austen’s first
                  published novel, <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, did not appear
                  until 1811, though Austen had been attempting to publish her work ever since 1797,
                  when her father unsuccessfully offered <title level="m">First Impressions</title>
                  (later <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>) to Thomas Cadell for
                  consideration. Those who might wish to widen the scope still further could of
                  course reach back to Austen’s many influences: <title level="m">First
                     Impressions</title>, after all, was initially pitched as “about the length of
                  Miss Burney's <title level="m">Evelina</title>” according to J.A.
                  Austen-Leigh–invoking a novel published in 1778. Equally justly, one could expand
                  beyond Austen’s death date, especially as the last two novels, <title level="m"
                     >Northanger Abbey</title> and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, were
                  published posthumously. This particular course could not, by the parameters set by
                  the department, reach backward, and I was loath to reach much further beyond. </p>
               <p>This narrow focus was repeatedly invoked in student evaluations as an aid to a
                  feeling of student mastery. Even in a class with mostly English majors, Austen is
                  known often only as a cultural signifier: erroneously referred to as "Victorian,"
                  representative of a certain set of costume-drama social codes—we know the
                  shorthand "Austen" often stands for. Students were quickly yanked out of their
                  preconceived notions about Austen's world by exposure to a variety of novelists
                  working as rivals to Austen, many of whom couldn't be more different from one
                  another. My goal was to explode their notion of what novels of the period were by
                  showing them a diverse range of fiction produced in the same years that Austen was
                  writing and publishing. Thus, it became unofficially known as the “Not-Austen”
                  course.</p>
               <p>Auburn’s enrollment system means that students register early and very little
                  shuffling occurs after the registration period, so I was able to email students
                  and ask them to read Austen’s<title level="m"> Pride and Prejudice</title> for the
                  first week of class. At a different institution with different enrollment rhythms,
                  I might reserve early time in the semester to guide the students through a reading
                  of the novel; in the course as taught, students made repeated reference to the
                  novel throughout, with shifting understandings of this “baseline” text.</p>
               <p>In the course of the semester, students read Mary Robinson’s <title level="m"><ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/robinson/mrletterfrst.htm">A
                     Letter to the Women of England</ref></title> and <title level="m">The Natural
                     Daughter</title> (1799), Elizabeth Hamilton’s<title level="m"> Memoirs of
                     Modern Philosophers</title> (1800), Anne Plumptre’s<title level="m"> Something
                     New</title> (1801), Maria Edgeworth’s <title level="m">Castle Rackrent
                  </title>(1800), Lady Owenson’s <title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl</title>
                  (1806), Hannah More’s <title level="m">Coelebs in Search of a Wife </title>(1809),
                  Jane Porter’s <title level="m">The Scottish Chiefs</title> (1810) and the
                  anonymously-published <title level="m">The Woman of Colour</title> (1808). These
                  novels were selected in part for their availability in teachable classroom
                  editions: for example, <title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl</title> and <title
                     level="m">Castle Rackrent</title> have been printed together in a Riverside
                  Edition, and Broadview and Valancourt each have an enormous number of texts from
                  the period. Length was of course also a consideration, though one of the most
                  popular texts of the semester was the substantial <title level="m">Scottish
                     Chiefs</title>.</p>
               <p>These long readings were punctuated by in-class readings of reviews and readings
                  about the novel form from Cheryl L. Nixon’s <title level="m">Novel Definitions: An
                     Anthology of Commentary on the Novel, 1688-1815</title>. Depending on its
                  length, a single review takes approximately 5-8 minutes in class for students to
                  read with care, and they incorporate well into larger discussions. I began the
                  semester with Nixon’s collection of prize-winning student essays on “The Love of
                  Novels” from <title level="m">The Juvenile Library</title> (1800). Each essay is
                  extremely brief, and the authors are a few years younger than my students (14 or
                  15). Moreover, the question “Whether such a Love of Novels as excludes all other
                  reading, or no reading at all, is most to be condemned?” resonates strongly with
                  students familiar with the debates over Young Adult (YA) literature, especially
                  the debate between the camp of “at least they’re reading” and that of “YA is
                  brain-rotting and dangerous.” From the very first day, they understand that the
                  novel’s history is one of an ongoing debate about its status, and its effects on
                  its readers. Nixon’s anthology is full of similar essays and reviews from various
                  eighteenth-century voices, and my students became deeply interested in these
                  debates. Later in the semester, students were assigned to lead discussion on some
                  of these assigned in-class readings, which I had chosen both to pair well with the
                  novels as well as highlight different definitions and anxieties about the novel in
                  the period. Edgeworth’s <title level="m">Castle Rackrent </title>is usefully
                  discussed in light of her thoughts on books in <title level="m">A Practical
                     Education</title> (1798), for example. Nixon’s book is, as its full title
                  suggests, useful for a much more substantial survey of the novel, but contains
                  enough material within the two decades of this course to fill the semester. </p>
               <p>In a similar fashion, the data held in Cardiff University’s open-access <title
                     level="m"><ref target="http://www.british-fiction.cf.ac.uk/search.asp">British
                        Fiction, 1800–1829: A Database of Production, Circulation, and
                        Reception</ref></title> can also be fruitfully used to provide this sort of
                  initial access. That database incorporates information about a book’s initial
                  format, later editions and translations in the period, publisher information, and
                  correspondence where available, as well as advertisements, reviews, and anecdotal
                  information from private correspondence. Moreover, it includes information about
                  subscribers and which circulating libraries owned copies, allowing students to
                  discover important information about the way the reading public gained access to
                  the fiction of the day.</p>

               <head>Final Project: Making A Scholarly Edition</head>
               <p>Parallel to this analysis of Austen's literary marketplace was an investigation of
                  the modern literary marketplace. Thus, in addition to key term exams,
                  discussion-leading, and weekly responses, students were responsible for creating a
                  proposal for a modern classroom edition of an early nineteenth-century text not
                  yet edited. This aspect of the course might not have happened but for its
                  experimental nature, but it also had some clear influences, most explicitly
                  assignments created by Miranda Yaggi and Marta Kvande.<note place="foot"
                     resp="editors">As a graduate instructor at Indiana University, Yaggi had led
                     her students through an assignment culminating in digital editions of short
                     Victorian-era texts to be posted online. Kvande, an associate professor at
                     Texas Tech, has her graduate students do bibliographic work on texts found in
                     Texas Tech's collections.</note> I have worked with special collections
                  librarians each semester in my courses since I was a graduate student, from
                  surveys to graduate seminars, and was eager to do more. Because the focus of the
                  “Not-Austen” course was so tight, I created a series of scaffolded assignments
                  that allowed us to take advantage of the students’ emerging depth of knowledge and
                  apply it to a concrete project.</p>
               <p>Prior to the start of the semester, I sat down with Greg Schmidt, one of the
                  librarians in Special Collections, and we made a list of the materials we hold
                  from the period under consideration so that students could select from a
                  controlled lists of texts. These texts were checked against commonly-available
                  modern editions as well as resources like the Oxford Dictionary of National
                  Biography to ensure that at least some information about the author and other
                  contextual information would be readily available to a diligent, if novice,
                  researcher.</p>
               <p>It is worth noting at this point that I work at a flagship state institution in
                  the South with decidedly modest physical holdings in eighteenth- and early
                  nineteenth-century texts in our Special Collections; our institution is renowned
                  for its engineering school and for other STEM fields. Thus, like many other
                  institutions, database access can be spotty: we do have Eighteenth-Century
                  Collections Online (ECCO), but microforms are considered sufficient for access to
                  the holdings that are now offered as periodical databases like the Burney
                  Collection of British Newspapers, British Periodicals I and II, and other major
                  literary-historical databases such as Early English Books Online (EEBO). Because
                  of our geographical location, the nearest institutions with more substantial
                  holdings are over an hour or two away, often in the bordering state of Georgia. </p>
               <p>I mention all of this because while this course represents certain kinds of
                  privilege (curricular freedom, multiple offerings in my subfield each year, modest
                  teaching load, some access to major databases), I also navigate a series of uneven
                  challenges as well. In this case, we found we needed to expand our list to include
                  texts from the 1820s, as well as to embrace multiple genres (plays, poetry, and
                  short stories) in order to create a substantial list of available choices. </p>
               <p>Within the first two weeks of the course, students were taken to Special
                  Collections for an introductory session, where students were guided through both
                  relevant works they might choose as well as supplementary resources they might use
                  to consult as they researched their primary text. On that day they completed a
                  substantial two-page worksheet analyzing one text of their choice, examining the
                  physical and bibliographic features of the work in order to understand the initial
                  audience [see Appendix 1]. As they found themselves gravitating to one text or
                  another, they also began to talk to one another and discuss group formation.
                  Ultimately, while most groups selected novels, one group selected a volume of
                  short stories, and two groups selected collections of poetry.</p>
               <p>Each group had to read their chosen text, select a suitable amount to edit, and
                  use that as the basis for a proposal for a modern edition. Composed in Word for
                  the sake of (relative) simplicity, and ultimately submitted in both hard copy and
                  PDF form, each "edition" proposal included justifications for their editorial
                  choices, a group-written critical introduction, and sample chapters, as well as
                  individual appendices. These appendices were primary source texts related in some
                  fashion to the main text, which they individually edited to confirm to “house
                  style.” Groups had a choice of how to convey extratextual information, but they
                  were required to include some form of notes (either footnotes or endnotes). Each
                  student also produced a critical essay on an aspect of their text. Group tasks
                  were paralleled by individual tasks that demonstrated the same skills: individual
                  and group text selection, editing and layout assignments, and individual and group
                  papers. This mitigated some of the pitfalls of group work: unfair distribution of
                  labor, etc.</p>
               <p>This project was aided immensely by my colleagues at Auburn: in addition to the
                  work done by Greg Schmidt in Special Collections, English subject librarian Jaena
                  Alabi guided students through hands-on research in order to find appropriate
                  appendix items and scholarship (if any) on their individual text, as well as
                  crafting useful footnotes. In hands-on lab time, my colleague in Technical and
                  Professional Communication Derek Ross and his graduate students taught students
                  about the basic principles of document design to guide their layout. During this
                  in-class session, each group agreed on a “house style” and helped design an
                  appropriate cover for their work. Students designed their own covers, relying on
                  discussions they had with Brett McLethan of Broadview Press, who made himself
                  available for questions about publishing and acquisition practices. In a later
                  version of this course, Brett also brought a sample pricing sheet, which opened
                  students’ eyes still further to the costs incurred even before books are printed
                  and bound.</p>
               <p>During the last class day, students created exhibits in Special Collections
                  featuring their proposals, including posters that advertised and explained their
                  text, including examples of the transformation from nineteenth into twenty-first
                  century type, historical and cultural information, and the like. They were able to
                  display “their” editions alongside the original early-nineteenth-century
                  originals. Because the final product was turned in both as hardcopy and PDF, we
                  are able to display the physical copies in Special Collections, and are currently
                  working on how best to curate their work digitally on the Library website.</p>
               <p>The groups from the first iteration of the course chose a diverse set of texts.
                  Perhaps the most ambitious group tackled Robert Charles Dallas’s <title level="m"
                     >Percival, or Nature Vindicated</title> (1801), the only full-length novel
                  selected by any group. Two groups selected collections of “tales” by the novelist
                  Maria Edgeworth: one group editing her <title level="m">Moral Tales for Young
                     People</title> (1809), another <title level="m">Tales of Fashionable
                     Life</title> (1809). One group selected a work of poetry: Maria De Fleury’s
                     <title level="m">Divine Poems and Essays on Various Subjects</title> (1804).
                  The gravitation of students towards works that contain shorter fiction or poetry
                  rather than a full-length novel is not very surprising in retrospect. While the
                  intent of our initial curated list of works was to provide precisely this sort of
                  diversity, I now think that more would be gained from more uniformity of text
                  length and genre.</p>
               <p>According to students, this assignment opened their eyes in a variety of ways: to
                  the rationale behind the cost of their assigned novels, to new career
                  possibilities, and to the historical context in which these texts were written.
                  Several students have gone on to take courses in document design as well as the
                  eighteenth-century novel. Two members of this group, Shelby Chase and Amelia
                  Dixon, would go on in the spring of 2013 to present their work to the
                  University-wide Undergraduate Research Forum, where they won first prize. </p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Later Variations</head>
               <p>After the success of the “Not-Austen” class and its final assignment, I adapted
                  the assignment for my eighteenth-century novel course. Because of the challenges
                  of text selection encountered in the prior course, in this version the class
                  worked as a single group, and I selected the text to be edited, assigned
                  individual students chapters, and built the class around it. The novel was Mary
                  Brunton’s <title level="m">Self-Control</title> (1811), a novel that draws richly
                  upon a variety of prior novels from across the eighteenth century, and was
                  unavailable in a modern classroom edition.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A new
                     edition by Anthony Mandal was since published in November 2013 as part of
                     Pickering and Chatto’s Chawton House Library series. See Brunton.</note> The
                  novel also has the virtue of being available online in a plain-text form without
                     notes,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See P.J Labrocca’s website <ref
                        target="http://labrocca.com/marybrunton/">Mary Brunton</ref>.</note> so
                  students could focus on the work of formatting, creating notes, etc. rather than
                  transcription. Similar work could be done with texts from Project Gutenberg,
                  though they do not provide information about the source edition, eliminating a key
                  piece of information. HathiTrust or Google Books, because they are presented as
                  PDFs, generally include the relevant bibliographic data, though they do require
                  transcription. Instructors wishing to replicate this assignment will often thus
                  need to choose between the competing goods of the convenience of cut-and-paste and
                  the important contextual cues. Given that my goal with this assignment is to
                  impress upon students the importance of reliable and judicious selection of source
                  text, I sacrifice convenience. </p>
               <p>In the editing portion of the Brunton class assignment, technical writing graduate
                  student Stephen Carradini and I guided the class through the decisions relevant to
                  creating a style sheet, which they discussed and voted on during class time. As
                  with the first iteration of the course, students produced appendices and critical
                  essays. If the edited text is read and given some class time at the beginning of
                  the semester, this approach can work well for classes where access to original
                  texts is particularly limited. As I have noted in <title level="m">Women’s
                     Writing</title>, Brunton was a direct contemporary with Jane Austen, and Austen
                  read <title level="m">Self-Control </title>with initial anxiety that they might be
                  writing in the same territory–though Austen found herself relieved.</p>
               <p>In the spring of 2014 I taught my first class in a new active learning space, the
                     <ref target="http://auburn.edu/easl/">E.A.S.L.</ref> (Engaged Active Student
                  Learning) classroom being piloted at Auburn. This classroom is designed in five
                  “pods” that can allow groups of up to nine students to work together with a shared
                  oversized monitor, glassboards, and wireless connections that allow students to
                  collaborate using their laptops or any mobile device that uses the iOS or Android
                  operating platforms. As of this writing, I am beginning my first course in that
                  classroom that includes a group editing component. Because such a classroom is
                  designed to work best with in-class projects, I plan to shift more of the work of
                  editing and researching into the classroom. This shift will allow me to more
                  directly guide students through the work of editing while allowing me to return to
                  the smaller-group format of the first version of the assignment. </p>
               <p>This course also has a further afterlife. In 2015, my colleague Derek Ross and I
                  will team-teach a course on the “History of the Book in Theory and Practice,”
                  where we hope to deepen and broaden the scaffolding around the previous iterations
                  of the course. This course will give the students the ability to encounter both
                  historical and modern methods of print production in a hands-on manner, embedding
                  the textual editing assignment in the context of more reading in book history. It
                  is our hope that we will be able to have our public and professional writing
                  students will better understand the origins of terms and practices they learn in
                  their document design and editing courses, while our literature students better
                  understand the history and transformations that are connected to changing forms of
                  media production. As unlikely as it seemed at the start, all of these future
                  courses have their grounding in the experiment of the “Not-Austen”
                  course.<pb/></p>
