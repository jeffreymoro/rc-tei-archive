            <p rend="noCount">Jane Austen is arguably one of those rare authors whose novels and life story
                transcends time and a multitude of boundaries. As a clergyman’s daughter her
                literary prowess was influenced by the dynamics of family and village life. Because
                she published her novels anonymously, only her family and a few friends were aware
                of her accomplishments when she died in 1817. Yet, from the publication of James
                Edward Austen-Leigh’s <title level="m">Memoir of Jane Austen</title> in 1870 to the
                release of the film <title level="m">Becoming Jane</title> in 2007, interest in Jane
                Austen’s life has grown unabatedly. Indeed, Austen’s life story has become so
                fictionalized and commodified that we risk losing the novelist herself. In this
                seminar we will chart Jane Austen’s ascendancy from obscurity to that of a cultural
                icon and even a highly marketable product. We will examine the development of
                Austen’s popularity in American and British culture and how her life and work is
                bifurcated between academic scholarship and popular culture. Simultaneously we will
                analyze Austen’s novels for the insights they provide on marriage, class, finance,
                genteel society and Regency culture. As we discuss the reception history of the
                novels we will look at how the formation of the Janeites, the Austenites, and the
                Pemberleans as well as how film adaptations of her novels and life have driven her
                canonical and celebrity status. </p>

            <p rend="noCount">1. Class Participation and Attendance: Since this class meets only once a week, we
                cover the material at a very quick pace. Regular attendance and active class
                participation is necessary in order to facilitate thorough discussions of the texts.
                One unexcused absence will not affect your grade. Thereafter, your
                participation/attendance grade will drop a letter grade per week for each unexcused
                absence. Please let me know in advance if you will be unable to attend a class
                session.</p>
            <p rend="noCount">2. Discussion Questions: There is so much information to cover when we engage in
                close readings of Austen’s novels as well as when we critique the impact her work
                and life has had on nearly two centuries of readers. To ensure that we are covering
                topics that interest the class, each week (excepting the three when your essays are
                due) you will submit to me via email 2-3 discussion questions about Austen’s novels
                or <title level="m">Jane’s Fame</title> readings that you would like the class to
                consider. Your questions can focus on specific scenes, characters, turning points in
                the plot, themes, cultural references, reception of Austen’s work, etc. Your
                questions should also be detailed. Why do you think a specific scene, theme,
                character development, or literary reference is important to our interpretation of
                the novel? Why do you think generations of readers have been captivated by Austen’s
                novels and her life? Make sure you list the volume number, chapter number, and page
                number for each question. I will compile everyone’s submissions into a set of
                anonymous discussion questions for us to analyze during class. Questions will be
                listed chronologically and then thematically. Each set of discussion questions is
                worth 10 points. <hi rend="bold">Questions are due by Tuesday 11:59 pm each
                    week</hi>. Due dates include: January 25; February 1, 8, 22; March 1, 22, 29;
                April 5, 12, 19, 26. No late papers will be accepted.</p>

                    Austen Conquered The World</title> we are told that “[t]he longer Austen remained
                unpublished, the more experimental she became, and the more licence she assumed with
                bold, brilliant moves.” (p. 38) In<hi rend="bold">your</hi> opinion how is <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> “experimental?” What are some examples
                of the “bold, brilliant moves” that Austen makes in her narrative? Think of it this
                way: Why are 21<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi>-century readers still drawn to this novel? How
                does it hold our attention? What does the narrative make us question and why? With
                which characters do we empathize and why? What do we learn about writing from
                Austen? There are many questions to ask, and you are not limited to those posed
                above. On the same note, you are not expected to answer every question listed in the
                description. Basically, I want to know why you believe this novel was successful and
                how it became the blueprint for Austen and subsequent novelists to follow. I am not
                looking for the “right answers” but rather for a persuasive argument. You will need
                to include a thesis statement, develop your argument, provide examples to support
                the points you make, and draw your own conclusions. You need to cite in a footnote

                citations. You will also need to include a bibliography. Your paper should be 4-5
                pages in length. The paper will receive a letter grade.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">After Jane Austen’s death the manuscript for <title level="m">The Watsons</title> was
                found among her papers. Imagine that a publisher has purchased this manuscript, and
                an editor has hired you to revise and complete the novel. This essay asks you to
                consider how you would develop the plot so that 21<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi>-century
                readers will believe they are reading an original novel by Jane Austen. You are <hi

                believe Austen would have expanded this particular work. Your exploration is guided
                by your readings of Austen’s novels. For your new version, you will need to consider
                the following:</p>

            <p rend="noCount">Even though Jane Austen was virtually unknown as an author during her lifetime, today
                her novels are more popular and more widely read than those by her contemporaries or

                find her fiction so appealing? Why is her life so intriguing? What do we learn about
                ourselves when we study her novels, her letters, and her story? What do we learn
                about Regency culture and society? Your final essay will require you to study an
                aspect of Jane Austen’s narrative life and to contextualize it within a particular
                time frame, society, or culture (i.e. discuss the relevance of your topic to the
