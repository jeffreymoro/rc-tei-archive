               may be profitably integrated in upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses.
               In particular, it examines how the digital collection <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> can be used by students to (1) understand Austen’s material practices of writing
               and sharing her fiction, and the different audiences she anticipated in script and
               print; (2) study her development as a writer, through comparison and analysis of her
               fiction manuscripts, which represent her writing at every stage of her career; (3)
               survey the differences between script, print, and digital media, and critically examine
               how we interact with them; and (4) evaluate different theories of textuality and editorial

               <p>Jane Austen was an early entrant to the World Wide Web. One of the best-known and
                  most-visited of all author-based fan sites, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.pemberley.com"><em>The Republic of Pemberley</em></a>, began its online life back in 1996, at a period when “just 20 million American adults
                  had access to the Internet, about as many as subscribe to satellite radio today” (Manjoo).

                           who are not) of what the Internet was like in 1996.</span></div>
                  </div> The website offers a brief account of its early history, informing us that it began
                  as “a one-horse web bulletin board (message board)” (<em>The Republic of Pemberley</em>). Needless to say, Austen’s web presence—as measured by the hundreds of websites
                  that are devoted to her, both fan-based and academic in orientation—has grown exponentially
                  in the past two decades: a search for “Jane Austen” on Google records 25,800,000 hits.

                           might be expected, garners far more hits than both: 71,800,000 (based on my searches
                           conducted in August, 2013). YouTube alone yields 146,000 results for a “Jane Austen”

                  inexhaustible; in this short essay, however, I will focus on the open-access, scholarly-edited
                  resource released in 2010 that digitally remediates all extant manuscripts of her

                           editions devoted (in whole or part) to ancient and modern manuscripts. For a more
                           general discussion of the potential of digitized manuscripts, see Grace Ioppolo’s
                           “Switching on the World of Dramatic Manuscripts” and my essay (with Laura Estill),
                           “Evaluating Digital Remediations of Women’s Manuscripts.” For a recently released

                  </div> Of vastly superior quality and far greater accessibility than print facsimiles of
                  her manuscripts, these digitized texts provide students (and scholars) with unprecedented
                  access to high-quality digital surrogates and transcriptions of Austen’s fiction manuscripts.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Use of this resource can be profitably integrated in upper-division undergraduate
               and graduate courses. In this essay, I want to consider how <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> can be used to explore the following three topics:</p>
            <ol>
               <li class="item" id="d1112e241">Austen’s material practices of writing and sharing her fiction, and the different
                  audiences she anticipated for her writing in script and print.</li>
               <li class="item" id="d1112e242">Austen’s development as a writer through comparison and analysis of her fiction manuscripts,
                  which represent her writing at every stage of her career (from 1787, when she was
                  twelve, to 1817, the year of her death).</li>
               <li class="item" id="d1112e243">The nature of literary archives: what survives and in what form, and the benefits
                  and drawbacks of digitization, with consideration of interface design and screen reading.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the following essay, I will touch upon each of these topics, providing specific
                  examples of ways in which I have used the material in past courses, as well as offering
                  student feedback and suggestions for future use. I should add that most of these strategies
                  have been used in semester-long, upper-division courses devoted to Austen, as well
                  more recently in a course that was structured around the analysis of various Romantic
                  period manuscripts (using additional digital resources),

                           the following digital archives of manuscript material: The Shelley-Godwin Archive

                  can provide a bridge into introducing the digital surrogates—even in undergraduate
                  surveys—thereby allowing students to begin to take stock of the variety of ways (besides
                  print) that literary texts circulated in the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Most undergraduate students of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century literature
                     are afforded little—if any—access to manuscripts from the period. The reasons for
                     this are obvious: manuscripts are rare, unique documents and are almost always held
                     by special or private collections, most of which are not available for viewing by
                     undergraduate students. Until very recently, the only way of reproducing manuscripts
                     for those unable to access them in person was via microform or print facsimiles; assigning
                     an undergraduate class text on microform, for which usually only one copy exists and
                     which must be viewed in the library, presents obvious difficulties, while print facsimiles
                     (the way Austen’s manuscripts have historically been reproduced) are generally too
                     expensive to include on a student reading list, or are out of print.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
                              (8)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Even the most recent facsimile of an Austen text, The History of England, published
                              by Algonquin Books in 1993, is now out of print.</span></div>
                     </div> However, many of our period’s canonical texts were unprinted during the author’s lifetime:
                     Wordsworth’s <em>The Prelude</em>; Dorothy Wordsworth’s <em>Journals</em>; Shelley’s “The Masque of Anarchy”; Keats’ poems to Fanny Brawne; and Byron’s “Dedication”
                     to <em>Don Juan</em>, to name just a few. Other works, like Coleridge’s <em>Christabel</em>, circulated for nearly two decades (from 1798 until 1816) in manuscript. But when
                     students encounter theses texts in anthologies, the text’s publication status is usually
                     obscured, and is thus rarely noticed by—or explained to—them.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For example in Norton Anthology of English Literature, the most widely used literary
                              anthology in North America, the only reference to composition and publication dates
                              (and any significant gap between them) is typically found only at the end of each
                              textual entry, where the dates are situated.</span></div>
                     </div> Moreover, most manuscript texts that students are introduced to—and this is certainly
                     true of Austen’s—have been subjected to the normalizing processes of print, in which
                     spelling has been regularized, evidence of revision has been removed, abbreviations
                     expanded, and so on.</p>
               </div>
               <p>With the release of new digital manuscript archives, the ability to teach students
                  about the material and social practices of manuscript culture, which continued to
                  operate alongside of print, are now emerging. Indeed, high-resolution digital photography,
                  combined with the storage capacity and ease of transmission enabled by the internet,
                  finally seems to have overcome many of the long-standing difficulties involved in
                  the reproduction of high-quality facsimiles of handwritten documents. Current generation
                  digital photography eclipses anything possible in the bi-tonal worlds of lithography
                  and photography, the main technologies for reproducing handwritten documents during
                  the last century and a half. With <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> we are presented with a resource that was unthinkable even a few years ago: digital
                  surrogates of all the extant fiction manuscripts, which amounts to 1,100 pages of
                  fiction written in Austen’s own hand.</p>
               <p>A study of Austen’s manuscripts offers occasion for instruction in the period’s material
                  literary culture. Students encountering a digital surrogate of a manuscript such as
                  Austen’s <em>History of England</em> will likely be confronted with a series of new challenges and questions, ones that
                  do not arise when they read the novels—or even the juvenilia—as reproduced in print
                  editions. Unlike most print books, legibility can be an issue with manuscripts. Although
                  the <em>History of England</em> is a fair copy, students may have trouble, at least initially, deciphering Austen’s
                  script. In addition, students can learn about the potential difficulties of attribution
                  and dating in manuscripts (issues that arise far less frequently in print). Nothing
                  in the manuscript of <em>The History of England, </em>for example, plainly indicates that the handwriting and authorship are Austen’s, nor
                  that the watercolor portraits were made by Cassandra Austen. The date of “Saturday
                  Nov. 26th 1791” is presented only on the final page, an unusual placement for those
                  familiar with bibliographical codes derived from modern print. Students will need
                  to learn about how provenance establishes Austen’s authorship and handwriting, and
                  Cassandra’s contributions, and they will also need to be instructed in how questions
                  of dating persist with other fiction manuscripts (such as <em>Lady Susan</em> and <em>The Watsons</em>).</p>
               <p>One of the ways I begin to engage students with the surviving manuscripts is to have
                  them peruse the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/manuscripts/index.html">index of Austen’s manuscripts</a> (a useful exercise <em>before</em> they have begun to read the manuscript texts). Here they find a list of nine manuscripts:
                  (1) the three volumes of juvenilia, <em>Volume the First</em>, <em>Volume the Second</em>, and <em>Volume the Third</em>; (2) <em>Lady Susan</em>; (3) <em>Susan</em>; (4) <em>The Watsons</em>; (5) <em>Persuasion</em>; (6) <em>Sanditon</em>; (7) “Plan of a Novel according to hints from various quarters”; (8) “Opinions of
                  Mansfield Park, Opinions of <em>Emma</em>”; (9) “Profits of my Novels.” Even the more uninformed students will notice something
                  striking: with the exception of <em>Persuasion</em>, there are no manuscripts of any of the printed novels. Students might recognize
                  <em>Susan</em> as the early title of <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, but the manuscript is merely a small rectangular scrap, with only the words, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/facsimile/susan-title/1.html">“Susan. a Novel in Two Volumes”</a> written on it (<em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em>). This scrap and the cancelled chapter of <em>Persuasion</em> are all that remains of what became the print novels.</p>
               <p>Initially, the realization that no complete manuscript versions of the print novels
                  survive may come as a disappointment to students, eager to see the development of
                  the novels that they have or will read. However, it is possible to reverse this disappointment
                  by inviting students to consider Austen’s purpose in writing the manuscripts that
                  have survived. Whereas with a printed text, one can usually infer that the author
                  intended it to be read by a (potentially) wide audience, with a manuscript, more detective
                  work is required to discern the intended audience as well as the ways in which it
                  actually circulated. Donald Reiman has usefully categorized modern manuscripts (i.e.
                  those produced in the print era) as private, confidential, or public (65), and with
                  some investigation students will find that Austen’s surviving writing fits all of
                  these categories: her print novels address the public; her juvenilia and fair copy
                  fiction, like <em>Lady Susan</em>, belong to Reiman’s middle category of the confidential; and some of her most biting
                  satires (such as “Plan of the Novel”) and possibly her drafts, shared with only a
                  very select few, align with Reiman’s category of the private.</p>
               <p>In the <em>History of England</em>, to return to that example, we find Austen addressing her family readers (the story
                  is dedicated to “To Miss Austen, eldest daughter of the Revd. George Austen”), whom
                  she could expect to understand and appreciate her parody of the historical genre and
                  her comic self-deprecation (on the title page, she describes herself as “a partial,
                  prejudiced, &amp; ignorant Historian,” and offers the following note: “NB. There will
                  be very few Dates in this History”). By examining the digital surrogate of <em>The History of England</em> on <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em>, students will also see that it appears within a larger manuscript book (<em>Volume the Second</em>), which is itself part of a larger collection of her youthful writing (the three
                  volumes of the juvenilia, <em>Volume the First</em>, <em>Volume the Second</em>, and <em>Volume the Third</em>), which offer additional context for understanding Austen’s social manuscripts. The
                  three volumes themselves reflect Austen’s practices of selecting and copying the juvenile
                  writing that she wished to preserve. Like her letters, these manuscripts offer a point
                  of entry into Austen’s social character; they also offer a glimpse of her as a working
                  writer, something that the finished print novels do not.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Another strategy I’ve used to initiate students into the study of Austen’s manuscripts
                     is to ask them to investigate the various physical forms the manuscripts take. Dividing
                     them into small groups, I ask them to complete the following chart (Table 1). This
                     exercise forces them to consider the visual/physical—rather than textual—evidence
                     of the manuscripts. The term “draft” will likely be known to them; “fair copy” may
                     need a brief explanation, but both terms are readily explicable through their own
                     experiences of essay writing (as are complete/incomplete). Through this exercise,
                     students will acquire a basic typology of modern manuscripts, distinguishing between
                     the various categories such as drafts and fair or presentation copies, all of which
                     are exemplified in Austen’s extant manuscripts. Most students will be uncertain about
                     “Catherine” (given the existence of some revisions to the manuscript), will readily
                     recognize <em>Lady Susan</em> as a fair copy, and the remaining three manuscripts as drafts. The question of whether
                     the text is incomplete or not is more difficult based on visual evidence alone, but
                     a quick reading of the final page or two will likely reveal that both <em>The Watsons</em> and <em>Sanditon </em>are unfinished, whereas <em>Lady Susan</em> (with its “Conclusion”) is complete.

                     </div> What students will have gleaned from this short exercise is that (1) several of Austen’s
                     manuscripts were unfinished and abandoned by her (formulating an answer as to why
                     requires a fuller engagement with the text and her biography); and (2) several of
                     her manuscripts are fair copies made for reading by or recital to others, including
                     unfinished works, such as “Catherine, or the Bower.”</p>

               <p>Careful examination of digitized copies of Austen’s manuscripts can help students
                  imagine the ways literature was experienced beyond the printed page—through the exchange
                  and collection of handwritten documents and oral recitation and performance, forms
                  of literary transmission that were a vital part of her domestic experience. The manuscripts
                  establish Austen’s collaborative practices (with Cassandra’s illustrations in <em>The History of England</em>); delineate a circle of readers (through her dedications and other personal allusions);
                  intimate her early desire for print (through the conventions of tables of contents,
                  dedications, indices, pagination); and demonstrate her (and her family’s) pride in
                  the early writing, which was carefully copied and preserved.</p>
               <p>Once students delve more deeply into the digital archive by reading some of the manuscripts
                  of works ranging across her career, from “Love and Friendship” and <em>The History of England</em> to “Plan of the Novel” and <em>Sanditon</em>, her trenchant social and literary satire becomes apparent. Margaret Anne Doody has
                  noticed Austen’s expressive freedom in the juvenilia, but it applies to later manuscript
                  works as well, in which Austen’s acid tongue finds more room for play than in the
                  print novels. Such differences suggest Austen’s careful discrimination in terms of
                  audience—how she modulated her writing depending on whom she expected to read her
                  works (and how she trusted these readers not to disseminate them further).</p>
               <p>Jillian Heydt-Stevenson, Colleen A. Sheehan, and most recently Janine Barchas have
                  excavated the ribald, risqué, and private allusions in the print novels, yet Austen
                  appears far less constrained when working within manuscript. Indeed, even within the
                  few surviving manuscripts it may be possible to discern different levels of intended
                  audiences: the bound juvenilia volumes (into which Austen exercised editorial control
                  by not copying all of her extant writing), for example, seem to imply a less circumscribed
                  readership, as the books would likely have been on display or accessible to family
                  members and visitors, whereas the separate sheets of “The Plan of a Novel,” a form
                  which could be more easily secreted, seem to suggest a more limited readership (in
                  keeping with the private digs she directs at the various suppliers of “hints,” including
                  some family members and friends). Considering the manuscripts in relation to at least
                  some of the print novels, which students will likely be reading as well, allows them
                  to explore the ways in which Austen negotiated both her own familial and social circles
                  as well as the public world of print. Many if not most of the authors of the day faced
                  a similar problem with at least some of their texts, whether because they were socially
                  or politically risky. Students are undoubtedly familiar with modern analogues by which
                  they too attempt to carve out some privacy in our own Facebook age of chronic “oversharing.”</p>

                  <p>Comparison of Austen’s manuscripts to one another can also provide a starting point
                     for discussions of her compositional processes, as well as her practices of revision,
                     ranging from sentence-level edits to large-scale reworkings of plot (as in <em>Persuasion</em>). Reading Austen in manuscript presents a fuller picture of her authorial range and
                     complexity. Manuscript facsimiles provide students with stark visual evidence of Austen
                     working and reworking her writing, directly contradicting her brother Henry’s assurance
                     in 1818 that “everything came finished from her pen” (141). The transcriptions readily
                     allow students to overcome some of the problems that usually present with deciphering
                     manuscript material, particularly when the hand is difficult to read or there are
                     heavy cancellations and emendations. The manuscripts, taken as a whole, may offer
                     clues as to why it took her so long (over two decades) to break into print.

               <p>One of the ways I attempt to explain Austen’s difficulty finding a publisher (a fact
                  that stuns many students) is to return to the chart students previously completed—
                  with additional columns that address pertinent issues of style and narration (see
                  Table 2). My belief is that Austen struggled with several elements of her fiction—
                  with the transition from an epistolary to a narrative style, and the consequent development
                  of the narrative voice; with the fleshing out of her heroines; and with the strong
                  proclivity to satire—and this chart can be used to turn their attention to these issues.
                  Students can work independently or in small groups to complete it, or it could be
                  done together as a class exercise, with time for reflection on the significance of
                  the patterns in reveals.</p>

               <p>The individual manuscripts also reward careful attention for what they can tell us
                  about Austen’s compositional habits. There are several possible pedagogical directions
                  that can be taken. One would be to compare the two cancelled chapters of <em>Persuasion</em> with the final three substituted chapters. This comparison is made easier with the
                  use of <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.juxtacommons.org">Juxta Commons</a>—an online collation tool that allows for side-by-side comparison of the two versions.
                  The screen shots below (fig. 1 &amp; 2) visualize the differences between the cancelled
                  chapters (on the left) and final chapters (on the right) with the light blue highlighting
                  denoting all changes between the versions. This comparison contrasts the original
                  ending (with Wentworth confronting Anne, at the Admiral’s behest, about rumors of
                  her engagement to Mr. Elliot) to the substituted chapters (as Anne converses with
                  Harville about women’s constancy, and Wentworth overhears). The complete rewriting
                  that Austen does here is apparent in the sea of blue—and the connective bars between
                  the texts allow one to scroll down to see exact points of convergence and divergence
                  in the versions. The heavy rewriting apparent here may be contrasted with the much
                  lighter revisions towards the end of the chapter, as seen in fig. 2.</p>

                  <p>Another approach involves having students use the digitized manuscript page facsimiles
                     and the diplomatic transcriptions to examine various authorial acts of revision within
                     a single manuscript. Significant revisions are apparent in the working drafts of <em>The Watsons</em>, <em>Persuasion</em>, and <em>Sanditon</em>, and I like to begin by asking students to experiment with transcribing a page or
                     two of one of these texts from the manuscript (which they can then check against the
                     diplomatic transcriptions on the site).

                     students have expressed frustration with the reading experience. Used to clean, edited
                     reading texts in print anthologies and student editions, the messiness of manuscripts
                     can come as a shock and induce frustration.

                              manuscripts (particularly compilations by less known or unknown writers) having been
                              neglected by book and literary historians, see Margaret J. M. Ezell’s essay on “Invisible
                              Books.” </span></div>
                     </div> One way to acclimatize students to this messiness is by introducing them to John Bryant’s
                     concept of the fluid text, which denies the primacy of a single moment in a text’s
                     genesis and instead endeavors “to edit a literary work in such a way as to showcase
                     revision, versions, and the multiple and shifting moments of intentionality throughout
                     the creative process” (John Bryant, <a class="link_ref" href="http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/melville/intro-editing.xqy">“Editing a Fluid Text”</a>). In doing so, the editor: <span class="quote">‘presumes the validity of all moments of revision and requires an editorial approach
                        that can accommodate and, most importantly, render readable the flow of shifting intentions.
                        This new focus on revision requires editors to develop strategies of displaying texts
                        to reflect a work’s textual fluidity; at the same time, readers need new strategies
                        in how to read revision and versions (John Bryant, “Editing a Fluid Text”).’</span> This understanding of textuality is encouraged by reading texts in a variety of forms
                     (such as digitized manuscript facsimiles and diplomatic transcriptions), though as
                     Bryant notes even a diplomatic transcription can hide layers of revisions contained
                     within a single manuscript. While his digital edition of Melville’s <em>Typee</em> begins to untangle these multiple stages of revision, with <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> it is up to students to discriminate between different kinds of editorial changes
                     and to work out a possible sequence of revisions.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Returning to the pages they have transcribed, students can begin to parse different
                     types of revisions, and to conjecture as to when and why they were made. With attentive
                     reading, they begin to distinguish between different types of revision: 
                     <ol>
                        <li class="item" id="d1112e682">those immediate second-thoughts made at the original moment of composition (often
                           identifiable by their placement on the page—on the same line as the cancellation);
                           and</li>
                        <li class="item" id="d1112e683">those made at a later point (often identifiable by interlinear or marginal additions/corrections;
                           by changes in ink or hand; by insertions on separate sheets, pasted in (as in <em>Persuasion</em>) or affixed by pins (as in <em>The Watsons</em>) to hide or extend a reworked passage).</li>
                     </ol>Students, having experimented with transcription and carefully examined some local
                     sites of revision, will thus be in a position to delve more deeply into the significance
                     of Austen’s writing process. For example, the three pinned additions to <em>The Watsons</em> (which may be seen <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/search/qmwats/b7-7.html?hl=">here</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/search/qmwats/b9-2.html?hl=">here</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/search/qmwats/b10-3.html?hl=">here</a>; and <em>Later Manuscripts, </em>336-7, 353-5, and 369-70) all involve a fleshing out of character by reworking and
                     expanding dialogue—with the substituted <em>Persuasion </em>chapters offering similar examples. I have argued previously that a study of the manuscripts
                     reveals that Austen appears to develop her heroines at a later stage of the compositional
                     process, and these additions provide evidence of this pattern of revision (Levy 1023-25).
                     Her revisions offer intriguing glimpses into her working method and what mattered
                     to her—how she corrects herself to get her facts right, or to develop characters more
                     precisely.

                  <p>While <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> invites this kind of careful review of the manuscripts and transcriptions, it does
                     not support more sustained reading, whether of the facsimiles alone or alongside the
                     transcriptions, for a few reasons. Although the editors are “unapologetic in saying
                     that the website contains objects to be used,” as opposed to texts for continuous
                     reading, there is no reason the choice has to be dichotomous (Sutherland and Pierazzo
                     209). Allowing users to view the diplomatic transcriptions independently, apart from
                     the manuscript pages, could enhance continuous reading. While this wouldn’t prioritize
                     the manuscript to the same extent, it would provide more flexibility for students.
                     Some of these manuscripts are lengthy (<em>Lady Susan </em>is 158 pages; <em>The Watsons </em>is 85 pages; the two cancelled <em>Persuasion</em> chapters are 32 pages; <em>Sanditon</em> is 136 pages), and it is a tedious process to click on each page and wait for it to
                     load (the delay being a function of the high quality of the images, which are being
                     loaded alongside of the transcriptions).

                     </div> Another way in which <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> could be vastly improved is with a download function—now available on many other sites—that
                     would allow a complete text (or portion of it) to be viewed (and saved, and printed)
                     as a pdf. (Of course, this would come at the cost of image quality, but it is a trade
                     off worth making for ease of reading).</p>

                     writing. Fortunately, with the release of Broadview’s <em>Jane Austen’s Manuscripts</em> in 2012, there is now a reasonably priced and meticulously edited collection of most

                     with the manuscripts, students will be in a better position to debate the importance
                     of having diplomatic transcriptions in addition to reading texts (at present, students

                     be surprised by the degree of editing that appears to be left in the hands of the
                     printer, who, at the very least, appears to have normalized Austen’s spelling and
                     introduced paragraph breaks. And students will be intrigued by the recent controversy
                     that has erupted over claims made by Kathryn Sutherland (the editor of <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em>) that Austen’s prose style (for which she is so celebrated) owes much to the interventions
                     of an editor, possibly William Gifford.

                  “Plan of a Novel,” “Opinions of Mansfield Park, Opinions of <em>Emma</em>,” and “Profits of my Novels,” can offer valuable insight into Austen’s self-perceptions
                  as a writer. Together, they paint a portrait of an author eager for material and critical
                  success, but also unwilling to suffer fools. “Plan of a Novel” and “Opinions” in particular
                  offer some of the most prolonged reflections on the writing and the reception of her
                  novels. These manuscripts could be usefully compared to the few other meta-fictional
                  statements we have from Austen—the “Advertisement” to <em>Northanger Abbey</em> and Chapter 5 of that novel; the letter to the publisher Benjamin Crosby dated 9
                  April 1809, under the pseudonym Mrs Ashton Dennis, allowing her to close her letter
                  to “I am Gentlemen &amp;c &amp;c MAD.-” (Le Faye, 182); and the letters to her niece, Anna
                  Lefroy, in 1814-1815 (<em>Later Manuscripts</em>, 214-225)—reflecting the negotiations and compromises that Austen was compelled to

               <p>Involving students with <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> further provides opportunities to discuss the nature of the surviving archive record,
                  both in its physical form and its most recent virtual incarnation. Students will have
                  already learned that Austen did not keep any of the drafts or fair or press copies
                  of her novels, but why this is the case warrants some consideration. It seems that
                  many novelists of the period did not keep their manuscripts after their novels were
                  printed, though some (including Walter Scott) did (<em>Later Manuscripts</em>, xlv). Why the practices relating to fiction manuscripts are so different than poetic
                  manuscripts, which were often retained, warrants some scrutiny. It is also perhaps
                  surprising that the manuscripts of Austen’s two posthumously published novels (<em>Northanger Abbey </em>and <em>Persuasion</em>) were destroyed, when their value may have been more apparent.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The survival and dispersal of Austen’s manuscripts also offers a fascinating narrative
                     of the familial and cultural significance of manuscript artifacts. Dispensed as mementoes
                     by Cassandra to various family members upon her death in 1845, and subsequently, via
                     auction, to public and private collections in the 1920s, the story of the dissemination
                     of Austen’s manuscripts, and their subsequent publication, also invites attention.
                     The way these manuscripts gradually entered the public eye—first with a mention in
                     her nephew’s <em>Memoir</em> of 1870, then incrementally published in expurgated form in the second edition of
                     the <em>Memoir</em> in 1871, and more fully and accurately in the decades that followed—offers yet another
                     strand in the rich reception history of Austen’s manuscripts that could be explored
                     more fully by students in their own research. Students respond with interest (and
                     sometimes indignation) to discovering how disparagingly her juvenilia was treated
                     by her earliest editors—her nephew and later R.W. Chapman—who infamously dismissed
                     all of Austen’s manuscript works as “Minor.”

               <p>The remediation of these manuscripts, first in print facsimiles and now in digital
                  form, reflects a long-standing effort to bring them out of the domestic and into the
                  public realm, but the actual manuscripts are still very much under lock and key at
                  various institutions. (A librarian at the British Library informed me that their holdings
                  of Jane Austen’s fiction require the highest level of clearance to access). While
                  students (and indeed most scholars) are unlikely to come into contact with an actual
                  Austen manuscript, they are instinctively aware of the differences, as a three-dimensional
                  object represented on a two dimensional screen, the digital environment necessarily
                  flattens and disables any physical interaction with the original. Videos of Kathryn
                  Sutherland presenting Austen’s manuscripts (produced by the Bodleian and the British
                  Library) help to mitigate the reductive nature of digital remediation by capturing
                  the scale of the manuscripts in relation to the human body, and presenting them in
                  their three-dimensionality (see Online Resources and Tools, below).</p>
               <p>The affordances of full-color, high-resolution digital images are many, for they can
                  enhance what may be seen with the naked eye, creating in effect “a digital magnifying
                  glass” allowing for inspection of minute details: variations of ink color and line
                  thickness, and even the minutiae of abraded paper and binding thread (Griffin 60).
                  What does this level of detail allow students and scholars to see, and how might these
                  visual cues be meaningful? I have already suggested one of the reasons why variations
                  in ink may be important—to detect different moments in the revision process. Being
                  able to view her hand-made notebooks (in <em>The Watsons</em> and <em>Sanditon</em>), though changed by modern conservation efforts, demonstrates the handiwork that
                  went into her writing. Simply being able to see the paper, ink, and type of support
                  in such detail provides an occasion to teach students about the mechanics of writing
                  in the period (Hurford).</p>
               <p>Students can also be invited to consider what else they can do with a digital archive.
                  One benefit of the encoded transcriptions is that they enable full-text searching.
                  Students are likely familiar with the benefits of keyword searching of born-digital
                  websites and many digitized printed texts (those that have been subject to Optical
                  Character Recognition [OCR] software and hence are searchable), but this kind of functionality
                  is rarely available with digitized manuscripts, which are not machine readable in
                  the same way as print. The use of search functionality has become such a ubiquitous
                  academic practice for students and researches alike that we rarely scrutinize how
                  and why we use it—and how it differs from the ways in which we search printed material
                  (such as via indices, scanning, and annotation). What kind of research questions can
                  we devise with this capacity to search accurately and in a matter of seconds through
                  hundreds of transcribed manuscript pages? To ask a question that perennially arises
                  in the digital humanities, what is the value added beyond what we can do with the
                  original manuscript or print sources?</p>
               <p>Students can also be called upon to evaluate how well digital archives are designed
                  for their purposes and become critical users of the technological interfaces they
                  are increasingly being asked to use in our courses. I ask students to identify one
                  aspect of a digital resource that worked well, and one other that didn’t. Collectively,
                  students responded enthusiastically to many features of the site, but they can also
                  be sharply critical, and together have noted the following impediments to usability:
                  no e-table of contents for the juvenilia; no ability to zoom when viewing the diplomatic
                  display alongside of the facsimile; no ability (without opening a separate browser
                  window) to compare manuscripts—a somewhat serious flaw given that one of the aims
                  of the site is to enable “simultaneous ocular comparison of” the physically separated
                  manuscripts; no ability to read the transcriptions alone; no reading texts; no ability
                  to download complete documents; no aligning of facsimile and transcription—scrolling
                  down one does not automatically bring the other with it. Although some of these objections
                  are more minor than others, my own sense is that the site could be better adapted
                  to encourage prolonged reading and facilitate comparisons between manuscripts. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>An additional limitation of the site, in my view, is that none of the encoding is
                     shared. It would be extremely helpful, for teaching purposes, to provide students
                     with even a brief glimpse of the skilled interpretative work that is required to produce
                     the precise diplomatic transcriptions that are rendered on the site.

                              through the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, and the errors that
                              this process introduces. TypeWright is a crowd-sourcing tool for correcting errors
                              introduced with OCR, and text-version of a document made up of page images.</span></div>
                     </div> Further, although the site is open-access, it is not “a social edition,” and thus
                     offers no ability to contribute to conversations about, or scholarship on, the text.

                              aims to “to use existing social media tools to change the role of the scholarly editor
                              from the sole authority on the text to a facilitator who brings traditional and citizen
                              scholars into collaboration through ongoing editorial conversation.”</span></div>
                     </div> Such opportunities may be important motivators for students, helping them “to take
                     their work more seriously and to increase their engagement” (Norcia 105). It is possible
                     for instructors to devise other means (such as class websites) for students to publicize
                     their work, and I have recently experimented with having my advanced undergraduate
                     and graduate students prepare their own digital editions of some of Austen’s manuscript
                     works.

                     </div> These projects can present their own challenges—intellectual and technical—though
                     I have found my students are keen to experiment with modes of research beyond the
                     essay, including new digital forms of dissemination.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Another helpful exercise, if students have been assigned a print edition of the manuscripts
                  such as Broadview’s, is to ask them to compare it to a digital edition. What are the
                  merits/demerits of the way each medium reproduces Austen’s text? Though it styles
                  itself as a digital edition, <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> is devoid of the editorial apparatus usually found in critical editions (a scholarly
                  apparatus is promised in a forthcoming “print edition” that “will be enhanced by richer
                  annotation, discursive essays on the genesis and composition of the manuscript works.”)
                  In particular, <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</em> lacks an introduction, and the annotations and contextual material that are found
                  in the Broadview edition. As it stands, what the digital and the print treatments
                  of Austen’s manuscripts offer are bifurcated: one provides reading texts and a critical
                  apparatus; the other diplomatic transcriptions, page images, and detailed descriptions
                  of the manuscripts, as well as discussions of provenance and conservation measures.
                  Students can scrutinize the choices that have been made for each kind of edition,
                  weigh the pros and cons of each, and consider the reasons that may lie behind what
                  is included and omitted from each edition. Recent findings about the limitations of
                  screen reading may mean that this hybrid (print and digital) approach is ideal: students
                  long for and need the deep engagement that it seems only reading paper and ink can
                  provide, and yet they can benefit enormously from access to rare materials that can
                  only be made available digitally.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I have outlined some of the many directions that teaching Austen’s manuscripts can
                     lead—but the best justification for introducing a selection of her manuscript texts
                     is the pleasure they afford, and the rewards students reap in acquiring a more capacious
                     understanding of her as an author. In reading her manuscripts, we find a writer different
                     from that of the six printed novels, one who is more playfully meta-fictional about
                     writing and contemporary literary genres; more caustically embittered, particularly
                     about the status of women; more penetratingly satirical about the world in which she
                     lived; and more willing to touch directly both on day-to-day life (the extended sequence
                     on the preparation of “Cocoa &amp; Toast” in <em>Sanditon</em> offers one delightful example) and a wider array of social classes.

                              the manuscripts can “come as quite a shock,” “show[ing] Austen pushing the conventional
                              boundaries of fiction in a way quite at odds with the published novels” (12). So too
                              Sutherland and Pierazzo: ‘The manuscript evidence therefore represents a different
                              Jane Austen: different in the range of subjects, themes, and narrative experimentation
                              they contain from the novels we know only from print; and different in what they reveal
                              about the workings of her imagination: in particular, what they can tell us of the
                              ebb …</span></div>
                     </div> Investigating the differences between Austen’s appearance in script and print is a
                     worthwhile and fruitful pedagogical endeavor—and for the first time these conversations
                     may be had in our classrooms, with ease and little expense, because of the superb
                     digital and print editions of Austen’s manuscripts that are now available to us.</p>
