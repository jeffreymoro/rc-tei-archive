            <p rend="noCount"> Below are some topics I have used for papers (usually 5-7 pages) or exam essays in
                my “English Literature of the Romantic Period” course for upper-division
                undergraduates. The topics could also be used for discussion prompts or small-group
                assignments. The two Austen novels I have used in this class are <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> and <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, but
                instructors may be able to apply the topics listed to other Austen works. In
                addition, they may think of other works by male (or female) Romantic writers that
                could be treated with these topics. </p>
                    <p rend="noCount"> In my directions, I tell students that the questions included in each topic are
                meant to help them generate ideas, but all of the questions do not necessarily need
                to be addressed in their essays and some questions may be more relevant than others
                depending on which works and issues they choose to explore. Also, for each topic
                students are asked to treat only two writers and no more than four works total (for
                example, one Austen novel and one, two, or at most three poems by one poet).</p>
                    <p rend="noCount"> In my Romantic Period class, students write a final term paper for which they
                generate their own topics (according to guidelines I establish) and use outside
                sources. The topics listed here I have used for either a first paper or a final
                exam, for which students are asked to draw on evidence from the primary texts, any
                secondary works assigned for the course, and points brought up in class discussions,
                but not outside research.</p>
            <list type="ordered"><item><p rend="noCount">Analyze the treatment of gender roles and male/female relationships in two of the
                following writers. How are men and women represented by each writer: what are their

                to conventional depictions of male and female roles and to what extent do they
                challenge or undermine these? If problems exist in male/female roles or
                relationships, who or what is to blame (eg., the man, the woman, another person,
                society, education, etc.)? Do the writers suggest that problems between men and
                women can be resolved‑‑if so, how? What overall attitudes toward love, sexuality,
                and/or gender roles does each writer express? Compare and contrast. </p>

                works between two belief or value systems that may be variously characterized as
                idealism and realism, romance and reality, faith and skepticism, optimism and
                pessimism, emotional and rational, or the like. Choose two writers (between two and
                four works total) and explore the conflicts between different values or points of
                view in their works. How would you define and characterize the competing belief or
                value systems; how are these expressed (eg., through contrasting characters, changes
                undergone or inner debates experienced by a central character or speaker, symbols or
                image patterns, etc.)? Does one value system or point of view predominate; do both
                remain in tension or conflict; or is a healthy balance achieved? Compare and
                contrast.</p>

                community. Choose between two and four works (total) from two authors and explain
                how each treats this issue. What are the attractions of solitude and/or commitment
                to others in each work (solitude may involve rejection of the human community in
                favor of some spiritual, otherwordly companionship); what are the dangers or
                drawbacks of either condition; does the author value one state over the other,
                reflect ambivalence, or change opinions in the course of his/her career? Compare and

                characterized variously as maturation or as a fall from innocence to experience
                (which may in turn be either a fortunate or an unfortunate fall). Compare the
                treatment of this topic in two Romantic writers, analyzing between two and four
                works total. How are the different stages of life characterized; is the passage from
                youth to maturity or innocence to experience regarded as growth, decline, or some
                combination of the two? If problems occur in any of the stages of life, who or what
                is to blame (eg., the individual, society, the natural or supernatural order)? Do
                the works provide solutions to problems or suggest that a healthy and happy adult
                state is possible? Does the gender of the writer make a difference in the treatment
                of youth and adulthood? </p>

            <item><p rend="noCount">Many Romantic writers challenged the traditional, hierarchical social system,
                which assumes that some people (upper classes, men) are inherently superior to
                others (lower classes, women) and embraced an egalitarian, meritocratic outlook,
                which emphasizes the rights and of all people and the worth of each individual's
                thoughts, feelings, and experiences. A meritocratic outlook also demands that people
                be judged on their individual characteristics, not on the basis of the position in
                life into which they are born or other arbitrary matters of appearance, gender, etc.
                Compare the egalitarian concepts expressed by two of the following writers and no
                more than four works total. Consider both content (theme, plot characters, direct
                statements, etc.) and style (language, genre, tone, etc.). What democratic or
                egalitarian ideals are expressed; how radical or far‑reaching is the author's
                vision; does the writer express any ambivalence or contradictions in his/her
                attitudes toward equal vrs. hierarchical or democratic vs. elitist relationships? </p>

            <p rend="noCount"> Below is a sample outline of main points I have used as a handout to give students
                an idea of how to approach and organize a comparison essay on topics such as those
                listed above. This outline responds to topic #4. I emphasize that many other points
                besides these could be made about Wordsworth’s poem and Austen’s novel.</p>
            <p rend="noCount"> Both Wordsworth in “Ode: Intimations of Immortality” and Austen in <title level="m"
                    >Pride and Prejudice</title> depict a process of maturation or growth from youth to
                adulthood. </p>
            <p rend="noCount"> Wordsworth celebrates childhood as the preferred state. The child is wise and
                closest to divinity; he perceives the divine in nature. For Austen, by contrast,
                youth is characterized by foolishness and lack of virtue (especially selfishness).
                Lydia, the youngest Bennet, and childish Mrs. Bennet illustrate these flaws. Also
                Elizabeth is flawed initially and gains greater reasoning ability and judges less by
                her own self-interest after she reads Darcy’s letter and matures. </p>
            <p rend="noCount"> Although Wordsworth and Austen differ in which stage each values, we can see a
                similarity in that both go against gender stereotypes for their time: Wordsworth as
                a man celebrating childhood and nature; Austen as a woman valuing maturity, sound
                reasoning, knowledge of self and others.</p>
            <p rend="noCount"> Another similarity is that maturity for both Wordsworth and Austen involves greater
                closeness to other people than the youthful state. Wordsworth finds “soothing
                thoughts that spring / Out of human suffering” and appreciates the “human heart.” As
                he loses contact with the divine, he gains closer connection to other mortals.
                Elizabeth in <title level="m">P&amp;P</title> becomes less detached as she matures,
                relaxes her defensive wit, and risks emotional engagement with Darcy.</p>
            <p rend="noCount"> In conclusion, both Wordsworth and Austen explore changes that occur as individuals
                grow older and mature. They differ on which state they consider the wisest and most
                virtuous, Wordsworth preferring childhood and Austen adulthood. Nonetheless, they
                are alike in that both challenge traditional gender roles for their time. In
                addition, both agree that maturity brings greater closeness to other human
                beings.</p>
