                    evaluate different theories of textuality and editorial practice.

                <p>Jane Austen was an early entrant to the World Wide Web. One of the best-known and
                    most-visited of all author-based fan sites, <ref
                        target="http://www.pemberley.com"><title level="m">The Republic of
                            Pemberley</title></ref>, began its online life back in 1996, at a period
                    when “just 20 million American adults had access to the Internet, about as many
                    as subscribe to satellite radio today” (Manjoo).<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> This statistic is referenced in Farhad Manjoo’s amusing
                        article, “<ref target="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2009/02/jurassic_web.html">Jurassic Web</ref>,” a good refresher (for those
                        of us old enough to remember) or introduction (for those who are not) of
                        what the Internet was like in 1996.</note> The website offers a brief
                    account of its early history, informing us that it began as “a one-horse web
                    bulletin board (message board)” (<title level="m">The Republic of
                        Pemberley</title>). Needless to say, Austen’s web presence—as measured by
                    the hundreds of websites that are devoted to her, both fan-based and academic in
                    orientation—has grown exponentially in the past two decades: a search for “Jane
                    Austen” on Google records 25,800,000 hits.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        While I am wary of placing much evidentiary value on Google hits, it may be
                        worth noting that “Charles Dickens” yields 17,600,000 results.
                        “Shakespeare,” however, as might be expected, garners far more hits than
                        both: 71,800,000 (based on my searches conducted in August, 2013). YouTube
                        alone yields 146,000 results for a “Jane Austen” search, many with hundreds
                        of thousands of views.</note>
                </p>
                <p> The teaching opportunities presented by this mass of web publications are
                    practically inexhaustible; in this short essay, however, I will focus on the
                    open-access, scholarly-edited resource released in 2010 that digitally
                    remediates all extant manuscripts of her fiction, <ref
                        target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/index.html"><title level="m">Jane
                            Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title></ref>.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> Of course, this site represents just one of a wave of new
                        digital collections and editions devoted (in whole or part) to ancient and
                        modern manuscripts. For a more general discussion of the potential of
                        digitized manuscripts, see Grace Ioppolo’s “Switching on the World of
                        Dramatic Manuscripts” and my essay (with Laura Estill), “Evaluating Digital
                        Remediations of Women’s Manuscripts.” For a recently released
                        Austen-centered digital resource, see Barchas.</note> Of vastly superior
                    quality and far greater accessibility than print facsimiles of her manuscripts,
                    these digitized texts provide students (and scholars) with unprecedented access
                    to high-quality digital surrogates and transcriptions of Austen’s fiction
                    manuscripts. </p>
                <p>Use of this resource can be profitably integrated in upper-division undergraduate
                    and graduate courses. In this essay, I want to consider how <title level="m"
                        >Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title> can be used to explore the

                </list>
                <p>In the following essay, I will touch upon each of these topics, providing
                    specific examples of ways in which I have used the material in past courses, as
                    well as offering student feedback and suggestions for future use. I should add
                    that most of these strategies have been used in semester-long, upper-division
                    courses devoted to Austen, as well more recently in a course that was structured
                    around the analysis of various Romantic period manuscripts (using additional
                    digital resources),<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In addition to <title

                    allowing students to begin to take stock of the variety of ways (besides print)

                    <head>The material practices of manuscript culture</head>
                    <p>Most undergraduate students of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
                        literature are afforded little—if any—access to manuscripts from the period.
                        The reasons for this are obvious: manuscripts are rare, unique documents and
                        are almost always held by special or private collections, most of which are
                        not available for viewing by undergraduate students. Until very recently,
                        the only way of reproducing manuscripts for those unable to access them in
                        person was via microform or print facsimiles; assigning an undergraduate
                        class text on microform, for which usually only one copy exists and which
                        must be viewed in the library, presents obvious difficulties, while print
                        facsimiles (the way Austen’s manuscripts have historically been reproduced)
                        are generally too expensive to include on a student reading list, or are out
                        of print.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Even the most recent facsimile
                            of an Austen text, <title level="m">The History of England</title>,
                            published by Algonquin Books in 1993, is now out of print.</note>
                        However, many of our period’s canonical texts were unprinted during the
                        author’s lifetime: Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Prelude</title>;
                        Dorothy Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Journals</title>; Shelley’s “The
                        Masque of Anarchy”; Keats’ poems to Fanny Brawne; and Byron’s “Dedication”
                        to <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, to name just a few. Other works, like
                        Coleridge’s <title level="m">Christabel</title>, circulated for nearly
                        two decades (from 1798 until 1816) in manuscript. But when students
                        encounter theses texts in anthologies, the text’s publication status is
                        usually obscured, and is thus rarely noticed by—or explained to—them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For example in <title
                                level="m">Norton Anthology of English Literature</title>, the most
                            widely used literary anthology in North America, the only reference to
                            composition and publication dates (and any significant gap between them)
                            is typically found only at the end of each textual entry, where the
                            dates are situated. </note> Moreover, most manuscript texts that
                        students are introduced to—and this is certainly true of Austen’s—have been
                        subjected to the normalizing processes of print, in which spelling has been
                        regularized, evidence of revision has been removed, abbreviations expanded,
                        and so on. </p>
                    <p>With the release of new digital manuscript archives, the ability to teach
                        students about the material and social practices of manuscript culture,
                        which continued to operate alongside of print, are now emerging. Indeed,
                        high-resolution digital photography, combined with the storage capacity and
                        ease of transmission enabled by the internet, finally seems to have overcome
                        many of the long-standing difficulties involved in the reproduction of
                        high-quality facsimiles of handwritten documents. Current generation digital
                        photography eclipses anything possible in the bi-tonal worlds of lithography
                        and photography, the main technologies for reproducing handwritten documents
                        during the last century and a half. With <title level="m">Jane Austen’s
                            Fiction Manuscripts</title> we are presented with a resource that was
                        unthinkable even a few years ago: digital surrogates of all the extant
                        fiction manuscripts, which amounts to 1,100 pages of fiction written in
                        Austen’s own hand.</p>
                    <p>A study of Austen’s manuscripts offers occasion for instruction in the
                        period’s material literary culture. Students encountering a digital
                        surrogate of a manuscript such as Austen’s <title level="m">History of
                            England</title> will likely be confronted with a series of new
                        challenges and questions, ones that do not arise when they read the
                        novels—or even the juvenilia—as reproduced in print editions. Unlike most
                        print books, legibility can be an issue with manuscripts. Although the
                            <title level="m">History of England</title> is a fair copy, students may
                        have trouble, at least initially, deciphering Austen’s script. In addition,
                        students can learn about the potential difficulties of attribution and
                        dating in manuscripts (issues that arise far less frequently in print).
                        Nothing in the manuscript of <title level="m">The History of England,
                        </title>for example, plainly indicates that the handwriting and authorship
                        are Austen’s, nor that the watercolor portraits were made by Cassandra
                        Austen. The date of “Saturday Nov. 26th 1791” is presented only on the final
                        page, an unusual placement for those familiar with bibliographical codes
                        derived from modern print. Students will need to learn about how provenance
                        establishes Austen’s authorship and handwriting, and Cassandra’s
                        contributions, and they will also need to be instructed in how questions of
                        dating persist with other fiction manuscripts (such as <title level="m">Lady
                            Susan</title> and <title level="m">The Watsons</title>). </p>
                    <p>One of the ways I begin to engage students with the surviving manuscripts is
                        to have them peruse the <ref
                            target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/manuscripts/index.html">index of
                            Austen’s manuscripts</ref> (a useful exercise <title level="m"
                            >before</title> they have begun to read the manuscript texts). Here they
                        find a list of nine manuscripts: (1) the three volumes of juvenilia, <title
                            level="m">Volume the First</title>, <title level="m">Volume the
                            Second</title>, and <title level="m">Volume the Third</title>; (2)
                            <title level="m">Lady Susan</title>; (3) <title level="m">Susan</title>;
                        (4) <title level="m">The Watsons</title>; (5) <title level="m"
                            >Persuasion</title>; (6) <title level="m">Sanditon</title>; (7) “Plan of
                        a Novel according to hints from various quarters”; (8) “Opinions of
                        Mansfield Park, Opinions of <title level="m">Emma</title>”; (9) “Profits of
                        my Novels.” Even the more uninformed students will notice something
                        striking: with the exception of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, there
                        are no manuscripts of any of the printed novels. Students might recognize
                            <title level="m">Susan</title> as the early title of <title level="m"
                            >Northanger Abbey</title>, but the manuscript is merely a small
                        rectangular scrap, with only the words, <ref
                            target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/facsimile/susan-title/1.html"
                            >“Susan. a Novel in Two Volumes”</ref> written on it (<title level="m"
                            >Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title>). This scrap and the
                        cancelled chapter of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> are all that
                        remains of what became the print novels. </p>
                    <p>Initially, the realization that no complete manuscript versions of the print
                        novels survive may come as a disappointment to students, eager to see the
                        development of the novels that they have or will read. However, it is
                        possible to reverse this disappointment by inviting students to consider
                        Austen’s purpose in writing the manuscripts that have survived. Whereas with
                        a printed text, one can usually infer that the author intended it to be read
                        by a (potentially) wide audience, with a manuscript, more detective work is
                        required to discern the intended audience as well as the ways in which it
                        actually circulated. Donald Reiman has usefully categorized modern
                        manuscripts (i.e. those produced in the print era) as private, confidential,
                        or public (65), and with some investigation students will find that Austen’s
                        surviving writing fits all of these categories: her print novels address the
                        public; her juvenilia and fair copy fiction, like <title level="m">Lady
                            Susan</title>, belong to Reiman’s middle category of the confidential;
                        and some of her most biting satires (such as “Plan of the Novel”) and
                        possibly her drafts, shared with only a very select few, align with Reiman’s
                        category of the private. </p>
                    <p>In the <title level="m">History of England</title>, to return to that
                        example, we find Austen addressing her family readers (the story is
                        dedicated to “To Miss Austen, eldest daughter of the Revd. George Austen”),
                        whom she could expect to understand and appreciate her parody of the
                        historical genre and her comic self-deprecation (on the title page, she
                        describes herself as “a partial, prejudiced, &amp; ignorant Historian,” and
                        offers the following note: “NB. There will be very few Dates in this
                        History”). By examining the digital surrogate of <title level="m">The
                            History of England</title> on <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction
                            Manuscripts</title>, students will also see that it appears within a
                        larger manuscript book (<title level="m">Volume the Second</title>), which
                        is itself part of a larger collection of her youthful writing (the three
                        volumes of the juvenilia, <title level="m">Volume the First</title>, <title
                            level="m">Volume the Second</title>, and <title level="m">Volume the
                            Third</title>), which offer additional context for understanding
                        Austen’s social manuscripts. The three volumes themselves reflect Austen’s
                        practices of selecting and copying the juvenile writing that she wished to
                        preserve. Like her letters, these manuscripts offer a point of entry into
                        Austen’s social character; they also offer a glimpse of her as a working
                        writer, something that the finished print novels do not.</p>
                    <p>Another strategy I’ve used to initiate students into the study of Austen’s
                        manuscripts is to ask them to investigate the various physical forms the
                        manuscripts take. Dividing them into small groups, I ask them to complete
                        the following chart (Table 1). This exercise forces them to consider the
                        visual/physical—rather than textual—evidence of the manuscripts. The term
                        “draft” will likely be known to them; “fair copy” may need a brief
                        explanation, but both terms are readily explicable through their own
                        experiences of essay writing (as are complete/incomplete). Through this
                        exercise, students will acquire a basic typology of modern manuscripts,
                        distinguishing between the various categories such as drafts and fair or
                        presentation copies, all of which are exemplified in Austen’s extant
                        manuscripts. Most students will be uncertain about “Catherine” (given the
                        existence of some revisions to the manuscript), will readily recognize
                            <title level="m">Lady Susan</title> as a fair copy, and the remaining
                        three manuscripts as drafts. The question of whether the text is incomplete
                        or not is more difficult based on visual evidence alone, but a quick reading
                        of the final page or two will likely reveal that both <title level="m">The
                            Watsons</title> and <title level="m">Sanditon </title>are unfinished,
                        whereas <title level="m">Lady Susan</title> (with its “Conclusion”) is
                            complete.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For students who have
                            already encountered some of the novels, the study of the “Conclusion” to
                                <title level="m">Lady Susan</title> may open up questions about
                            Austen’s more general difficulty with endings.</note> What students will
                        have gleaned from this short exercise is that (1) several of Austen’s
                        manuscripts were unfinished and abandoned by her (formulating an answer as
                        to why requires a fuller engagement with the text and her biography); and
                        (2) several of her manuscripts are fair copies made for reading by or
                        recital to others, including unfinished works, such as “Catherine, or the
                        Bower.” </p>

                        manuscripts</p>
                    <p>Careful examination of digitized copies of Austen’s manuscripts can help
                        students imagine the ways literature was experienced beyond the printed
                        page—through the exchange and collection of handwritten documents and oral
                        recitation and performance, forms of literary transmission that were a vital
                        part of her domestic experience. The manuscripts establish Austen’s
                        collaborative practices (with Cassandra’s illustrations in <title level="m"
                            >The History of England</title>); delineate a circle of readers (through
                        her dedications and other personal allusions); intimate her early desire for
                        print (through the conventions of tables of contents, dedications, indices,
                        pagination); and demonstrate her (and her family’s) pride in the early
                        writing, which was carefully copied and preserved.</p>
                    <p>Once students delve more deeply into the digital archive by reading some of the
                        manuscripts of works ranging across her career, from “Love and Friendship”
                        and <title level="m">The History of England</title> to “Plan of the Novel”
                        and <title level="m">Sanditon</title>, her trenchant social and literary
                        satire becomes apparent. Margaret Anne Doody has noticed Austen’s expressive
                        freedom in the juvenilia, but it applies to later manuscript works as well,
                        in which Austen’s acid tongue finds more room for play than in the print novels.
                        Such differences suggest Austen’s careful discrimination in terms of
                        audience—how she modulated her writing depending on whom she expected to
                        read her works (and how she trusted these readers not to disseminate them
                        further). </p>
                    <p>Jillian Heydt-Stevenson, Colleen A. Sheehan, and most recently Janine Barchas
                        have excavated the ribald, risqué, and private allusions in the print
                        novels, yet Austen appears far less constrained when working within
                        manuscript. Indeed, even within the few surviving manuscripts it may be
                        possible to discern different levels of intended audiences: the bound
                        juvenilia volumes (into which Austen exercised editorial control by not
                        copying all of her extant writing), for example, seem to imply a less
                        circumscribed readership, as the books would likely have been on display or
                        accessible to family members and visitors, whereas the separate sheets of
                        “The Plan of a Novel,” a form which could be more easily secreted, seem to
                        suggest a more limited readership (in keeping with the private digs she
                        directs at the various suppliers of “hints,” including some family members
                        and friends). Considering the manuscripts in relation to at least some of
                        the print novels, which students will likely be reading as well, allows them
                        to explore the ways in which Austen negotiated both her own familial and
                        social circles as well as the public world of print. Many if not most of the
                        authors of the day faced a similar problem with at least some of their
                        texts, whether because they were socially or politically risky. Students are
                        undoubtedly familiar with modern analogues by which they too attempt to
                        carve out some privacy in our own Facebook age of chronic “oversharing.”</p>

                    <p>Comparison of Austen’s manuscripts to one another can also provide a starting
                        point for discussions of her compositional processes, as well as her
                        practices of revision, ranging from sentence-level edits to large-scale
                        reworkings of plot (as in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>). Reading
                        Austen in manuscript presents a fuller picture of her authorial range and
                        complexity. Manuscript facsimiles provide students with stark visual
                        evidence of Austen working and reworking her writing, directly contradicting
                        her brother Henry’s assurance in 1818 that “everything came finished from
                        her pen” (141). The transcriptions readily allow students to overcome some
                        of the problems that usually present with deciphering manuscript material,
                        particularly when the hand is difficult to read or there are heavy
                        cancellations and emendations. The manuscripts, taken as a whole, may offer
                        clues as to why it took her so long (over two decades) to break into print.
                            <note place="foot" resp="editors"> A more full argument about the nature
                            of Austen’s struggles, as evident in the manuscript record, has been
                            made in my essay “Austen’s Manuscripts and the Publicity of
                            Print.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the ways I attempt to explain Austen’s difficulty finding a publisher
                        (a fact that stuns many students) is to return to the chart students
                        previously completed— with additional columns that address pertinent issues
                        of style and narration (see Table 2). My belief is that Austen struggled
                        with several elements of her fiction— with the transition from an epistolary
                        to a narrative style, and the consequent development of the narrative voice;
                        with the fleshing out of her heroines; and with the strong proclivity to
                        satire—and this chart can be used to turn their attention to these issues.
                        Students can work independently or in small groups to complete it, or it
                        could be done together as a class exercise, with time for reflection on the
                        significance of the patterns in reveals.</p>

                        narrative elements</p>
                    <p>The individual manuscripts also reward careful attention for what they can
                        tell us about Austen’s compositional habits. There are several possible
                        pedagogical directions that can be taken. One would be to compare the two
                        cancelled chapters of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> with the final
                        three substituted chapters. This comparison is made easier with the use of
                        <ref target="http://www.juxtacommons.org">Juxta Commons</ref>—an online
                        collation tool that allows for side-by-side comparison of the two versions.
                        The screen shots below (fig. 1 &amp; 2) visualize the differences between
                        the cancelled chapters (on the left) and final chapters (on the right) with
                        the light blue highlighting denoting all changes between the versions. This
                        comparison contrasts the original ending (with Wentworth confronting Anne,
                        at the Admiral’s behest, about rumors of her engagement to Mr. Elliot) to
                        the substituted chapters (as Anne converses with Harville about women’s
                        constancy, and Wentworth overhears). The complete rewriting that Austen does
                        here is apparent in the sea of blue—and the connective bars between the
                        texts allow one to scroll down to see exact points of convergence and
                        divergence in the versions. The heavy rewriting apparent here may be
                        contrasted with the much lighter revisions towards the end of the
                        chapter, as seen in fig. 2.</p>

                    <p>Another approach involves having students use the digitized manuscript page
                        facsimiles and the diplomatic transcriptions to examine various authorial
                        acts of revision within a single manuscript. Significant revisions are
                        apparent in the working drafts of <title level="m">The Watsons</title>,
                            <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, and <title level="m"
                            >Sanditon</title>, and I like to begin by asking students to experiment
                        with transcribing a page or two of one of these texts from the manuscript
                        (which they can then check against the diplomatic transcriptions on the
                            site).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Some sites, like <title

                        demonstrates some of the difficulties that are involved in working with
                        manuscript material—and involves them in thinking more carefully about the
                        nature and effect of revisions by providing them with access to, as it were,
                        Austen’s mind in process. Working with any of these manuscripts also draws
                        out the difficulties in ascertaining the layers of revision and can thus lay
                        bare the reality of these texts as truly “fluid” ones, to use John Bryant’s
                            term.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> John Bryant’s online edition of

                            useful supplement to course readings for instructors wanting to
                            introduce textual theory. A more extensive discussion is found in his

                    <p>Because this resource does not present a reading text but only diplomatic
                        transcriptions, students have expressed frustration with the reading
                        experience. Used to clean, edited reading texts in print anthologies and
                        student editions, the messiness of manuscripts can come as a shock and
                        induce frustration.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a discussion of
                            the “messiness” of manuscripts, and why this has resulted in many
                            manuscripts (particularly compilations by less known or unknown writers)
                            having been neglected by book and literary historians, see Margaret J.
                            M. Ezell’s essay on “Invisible Books.” </note> One way to acclimatize
                        students to this messiness is by introducing them to John Bryant’s concept
                        of the fluid text, which denies the primacy of a single moment in a text’s
                        genesis and instead endeavors “to edit a literary work in such a way as to
                        showcase revision, versions, and the multiple and shifting moments of
                        intentionality throughout the creative process” (John Bryant, <ref
                            target="http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/melville/intro-editing.xqy"
                            >“Editing a Fluid Text”</ref>). In doing so, the editor:
                    <quote>presumes the validity of all moments of revision and requires an editorial
                        approach that can accommodate and, most importantly, render readable the
                        flow of shifting intentions. This new focus on revision requires editors to
                        develop strategies of displaying texts to reflect a work’s textual fluidity;
                        at the same time, readers need new strategies in how to read revision and
                        versions (John Bryant, “Editing a Fluid Text”).</quote>
                    This understanding of textuality is encouraged by reading texts in a variety
                        of forms (such as digitized manuscript facsimiles and diplomatic
                        transcriptions), though as Bryant notes even a diplomatic transcription can
                        hide layers of revisions contained within a single manuscript. While his
                        digital edition of Melville’s <title level="m">Typee</title> begins to
                        untangle these multiple stages of revision, with <title level="m">Jane

                        discriminate between different kinds of editorial changes and to work out a

                    <p>Returning to the pages they have transcribed, students can begin to parse
                        different types of revisions, and to conjecture as to when and why they were
                        made. With attentive reading, they begin to distinguish between different
                        types of revision: <list type="ordered">
                            <item>those immediate second-thoughts made at the original moment of
                                composition (often identifiable by their placement on the page—on
                                the same line as the cancellation); and</item>
                            <item>those made at a later point (often identifiable by interlinear or
                                marginal additions/corrections; by changes in ink or hand; by
                                insertions on separate sheets, pasted in (as in <title level="m"
                                    >Persuasion</title>) or affixed by pins (as in <title level="m"
                                    >The Watsons</title>) to hide or extend a reworked
                                passage).</item>
                        </list>Students, having experimented with transcription and carefully
                        examined some local sites of revision, will thus be in a position to delve
                        more deeply into the significance of Austen’s writing process. For example,
                        the three pinned additions to <title level="m">The Watsons</title> (which may
                        be seen <ref

                        353-5, and 369-70) all involve a fleshing out of character by reworking and
                        expanding dialogue—with the substituted <title level="m">Persuasion
                        </title>chapters offering similar examples. I have argued previously that a
                        study of the manuscripts reveals that Austen appears to develop her heroines
                        at a later stage of the compositional process, and these additions provide
                        evidence of this pattern of revision (Levy 1023-25). Her revisions offer
                        intriguing glimpses into her working method and what mattered to her—how she
                        corrects herself to get her facts right, or to develop characters more
                            precisely.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a discussion of the

                    <p>While <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title> invites this
                        kind of careful review of the manuscripts and transcriptions, it does not
                        support more sustained reading, whether of the facsimiles alone or alongside
                        the transcriptions, for a few reasons. Although the editors are
                        “unapologetic in saying that the website contains objects to be used,” as
                        opposed to texts for continuous reading, there is no reason the choice has
                        to be dichotomous (Sutherland and Pierazzo 209). Allowing users to view the
                        diplomatic transcriptions independently, apart from the manuscript pages,
                        could enhance continuous reading. While this wouldn’t prioritize the
                        manuscript to the same extent, it would provide more flexibility for
                        students. Some of these manuscripts are lengthy (<title level="m">Lady Susan
                        </title>is 158 pages; <title level="m">The Watsons </title>is 85 pages; the
                        two cancelled <title level="m">Persuasion</title> chapters are 32 pages;
                            <title level="m">Sanditon</title> is 136 pages), and it is a tedious
                        process to click on each page and wait for it to load (the delay being a
                        function of the high quality of the images, which are being loaded alongside

                    <p>In the absence of such a function, and given the difficulties of prolonged
                        screen reading, it may be beneficial to assign students a printed text of
                        the manuscript writing. Fortunately, with the release of Broadview’s <title

                        reasonably priced and meticulously edited collection of most of her fiction
                        manuscripts available for student use.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> It

                        a fascinating exercise to have students compare these to the online
                        diplomatic transcriptions so they may see the editing decisions that have
                        been made to create a clean reading text. Having worked with the
                        manuscripts, students will be in a better position to debate the importance
                        of having diplomatic transcriptions in addition to reading texts (at
                        present, students have the diplomatic transcriptions online, and reading

                        may be surprised by the degree of editing that appears to be left in the
                        hands of the printer, who, at the very least, appears to have normalized
                        Austen’s spelling and introduced paragraph breaks. And students will be
                        intrigued by the recent controversy that has erupted over claims made by

                    <p> Finally, the three short manuscripts (so short they could even be read
                        during class), “Plan of a Novel,” “Opinions of Mansfield Park, Opinions of
                            <title level="m">Emma</title>,” and “Profits of my Novels,” can offer
                        valuable insight into Austen’s self-perceptions as a writer. Together, they
                        paint a portrait of an author eager for material and critical success, but
                        also unwilling to suffer fools. “Plan of a Novel” and “Opinions” in
                        particular offer some of the most prolonged reflections on the writing and
                        the reception of her novels. These manuscripts could be usefully compared to
                        the few other meta-fictional statements we have from Austen—the
                        “Advertisement” to <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> and Chapter 5
                        of that novel; the letter to the publisher Benjamin Crosby dated 9 April
                        1809, under the pseudonym Mrs Ashton Dennis, allowing her to close her
                        letter to “I am Gentlemen &amp;c &amp;c MAD.-” (Le Faye, 182); and the
                        letters to her niece, Anna Lefroy, in 1814-1815 (<title level="m">Later
                            Manuscripts</title>, 214-225)—reflecting the
                        negotiations and compromises that Austen was compelled to make with her
                        readers throughout her life.</p>

                            Manuscripts</title> further provides opportunities to discuss the nature
                        of the surviving archive record, both in its physical form and its most
                        recent virtual incarnation. Students will have already learned that Austen
                        did not keep any of the drafts or fair or press copies of her novels, but
                        why this is the case warrants some consideration. It seems that many
                        novelists of the period did not keep their manuscripts after their novels
                        were printed, though some (including Walter Scott) did (<title level="m"
                            >Later Manuscripts</title>, xlv). Why the practices relating to fiction
                        manuscripts are so different than poetic manuscripts, which were often
                        retained, warrants some scrutiny. It is also perhaps surprising that the
                        manuscripts of Austen’s two posthumously published novels (<title level="m"
                            >Northanger Abbey </title>and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>) were
                        destroyed, when their value may have been more apparent. </p>
                    <p>The survival and dispersal of Austen’s manuscripts also offers a fascinating
                        narrative of the familial and cultural significance of manuscript artifacts.
                        Dispensed as mementoes by Cassandra to various family members upon her death
                        in 1845, and subsequently, via auction, to public and private collections in
                        the 1920s, the story of the dissemination of Austen’s manuscripts, and their
                        subsequent publication, also invites attention. The way these manuscripts
                        gradually entered the public eye—first with a mention in her nephew’s <title
                            level="m">Memoir</title> of 1870, then incrementally published in
                        expurgated form in the second edition of the <title level="m">Memoir</title>
                        in 1871, and more fully and accurately in the decades that followed—offers
                        yet another strand in the rich reception history of Austen’s manuscripts
                        that could be explored more fully by students in their own research.
                        Students respond with interest (and sometimes indignation) to discovering
                        how disparagingly her juvenilia was treated by her earliest editors—her
                        nephew and later R.W. Chapman—who infamously dismissed all of Austen’s
                        manuscript works as “Minor.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See

                    <p>The remediation of these manuscripts, first in print facsimiles and now in
                        digital form, reflects a long-standing effort to bring them out of the
                        domestic and into the public realm, but the actual manuscripts are still
                        very much under lock and key at various institutions. (A librarian at the
                        British Library informed me that their holdings of Jane Austen’s fiction
                        require the highest level of clearance to access). While students (and
                        indeed most scholars) are unlikely to come into contact with an actual
                        Austen manuscript, they are instinctively aware of the differences, as a
                        three-dimensional object represented on a two dimensional screen, the
                        digital environment necessarily flattens and disables any physical
                        interaction with the original. Videos of Kathryn Sutherland presenting
                        Austen’s manuscripts (produced by the Bodleian and the British Library) help
                        to mitigate the reductive nature of digital remediation by capturing the
                        scale of the manuscripts in relation to the human body, and presenting them
                        in their three-dimensionality (see Online Resources and Tools, below).</p>
                    <p> The affordances of full-color, high-resolution digital images are many, for
                        they can enhance what may be seen with the naked eye, creating in effect “a
                        digital magnifying glass” allowing for inspection of minute details:
                        variations of ink color and line thickness, and even the minutiae of abraded
                        paper and binding thread (Griffin 60). What does this level of detail allow
                        students and scholars to see, and how might these visual cues be meaningful?
                        I have already suggested one of the reasons why variations in ink may be
                        important—to detect different moments in the revision process. Being able to
                        view her hand-made notebooks (in <title level="m">The Watsons</title> and
                            <title level="m">Sanditon</title>), though changed by modern
                        conservation efforts, demonstrates the handiwork that went into her writing.
                        Simply being able to see the paper, ink, and type of support in such detail
                        provides an occasion to teach students about the mechanics of writing in the
                        period (Hurford). </p>
                    <p> Students can also be invited to consider what else they can do with a
                        digital archive. One benefit of the encoded transcriptions is that they
                        enable full-text searching. Students are likely familiar with the benefits
                        of keyword searching of born-digital websites and many digitized printed
                        texts (those that have been subject to Optical Character Recognition [OCR]
                        software and hence are searchable), but this kind of functionality is rarely
                        available with digitized manuscripts, which are not machine readable in the
                        same way as print. The use of search functionality has become such a
                        ubiquitous academic practice for students and researches alike that we
                        rarely scrutinize how and why we use it—and how it differs from the ways in
                        which we search printed material (such as via indices, scanning, and
                        annotation). What kind of research questions can we devise with this
                        capacity to search accurately and in a matter of seconds through hundreds of
                        transcribed manuscript pages? To ask a question that perennially arises in
                        the digital humanities, what is the value added beyond what we can do with
                        the original manuscript or print sources?</p>
                    <p>Students can also be called upon to evaluate how well digital archives are
                        designed for their purposes and become critical users of the technological
                        interfaces they are increasingly being asked to use in our courses. I ask
                        students to identify one aspect of a digital resource that worked well, and
                        one other that didn’t. Collectively, students responded enthusiastically to
                        many features of the site, but they can also be sharply critical, and
                        together have noted the following impediments to usability: no e-table of
                        contents for the juvenilia; no ability to zoom when viewing the diplomatic
                        display alongside of the facsimile; no ability (without opening a separate
                        browser window) to compare manuscripts—a somewhat serious flaw given that
                        one of the aims of the site is to enable “simultaneous ocular comparison of”
                        the physically separated manuscripts; no ability to read the transcriptions
                        alone; no reading texts; no ability to download complete documents; no
                        aligning of facsimile and transcription—scrolling down one does not
                        automatically bring the other with it. Although some of these objections are
                        more minor than others, my own sense is that the site could be better
                        adapted to encourage prolonged reading and facilitate comparisons between
                        manuscripts. </p>
                    <p>An additional limitation of the site, in my view, is that none of the
                        encoding is shared. It would be extremely helpful, for teaching purposes, to
                        provide students with even a brief glimpse of the skilled interpretative
                        work that is required to produce the precise diplomatic transcriptions that
                        are rendered on the site.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Students could
                            also be advised as to how transcriptions of print texts are generated
                            through the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, and the
                            errors that this process introduces. <ref

                        social edition,” and thus offers no ability to contribute to conversations
                        about, or scholarship on, the text.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                            chief example is <ref

                            on the text to a facilitator who brings traditional and citizen scholars
                            into collaboration through ongoing editorial conversation.”</note> Such
                        opportunities may be important motivators for students, helping them “to
                        take their work more seriously and to increase their engagement” (Norcia
                        105). It is possible for instructors to devise other means (such as class
                        websites) for students to publicize their work, and I have recently
                        experimented with having my advanced undergraduate and graduate students
                        prepare their own digital editions of some of Austen’s manuscript
                            works.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Lindsey Seatter’s edition

                        present their own challenges—intellectual and technical—though I have found
                        my students are keen to experiment with modes of research beyond the essay,
                        including new digital forms of dissemination.</p>
                    <p> Another helpful exercise, if students have been assigned a print edition of
                        the manuscripts such as Broadview’s, is to ask them to compare it to a
                        digital edition. What are the merits/demerits of the way each medium
                        reproduces Austen’s text? Though it styles itself as a digital edition,
                            <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title> is devoid of
                        the editorial apparatus usually found in critical editions (a scholarly
                        apparatus is promised in a forthcoming “print edition” that “will be
                        enhanced by richer annotation, discursive essays on the genesis and
                        composition of the manuscript works.”) In particular, <title level="m">Jane
                            Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title> lacks an introduction, and the
                        annotations and contextual material that are found in the Broadview edition.
                        As it stands, what the digital and the print treatments of Austen’s
                        manuscripts offer are bifurcated: one provides reading texts and a critical
                        apparatus; the other diplomatic transcriptions, page images, and detailed
                        descriptions of the manuscripts, as well as discussions of provenance and
                        conservation measures. Students can scrutinize the choices that have been
                        made for each kind of edition, weigh the pros and cons of each, and consider
                        the reasons that may lie behind what is included and omitted from each
                        edition. Recent findings about the limitations of screen reading may mean
                        that this hybrid (print and digital) approach is ideal: students long for
                        and need the deep engagement that it seems only reading paper and ink can
                        provide, and yet they can benefit enormously from access to rare materials
                        that can only be made available digitally.</p>

                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>I have outlined some of the many directions that teaching Austen’s
                        manuscripts can lead—but the best justification for introducing a selection
                        of her manuscript texts is the pleasure they afford, and the rewards
                        students reap in acquiring a more capacious understanding of her as an
                        author. In reading her manuscripts, we find a writer different from that of
                        the six printed novels, one who is more playfully meta-fictional about
                        writing and contemporary literary genres; more caustically embittered,
                        particularly about the status of women; more penetratingly satirical about
                        the world in which she lived; and more willing to touch directly both on
                        day-to-day life (the extended sequence on the preparation of “Cocoa &amp;
                        Toast” in <title level="m">Sanditon</title> offers one delightful example)
                        and a wider array of social classes.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                            editors of <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Manuscript Works</title>
                            similarly claim that the reading of the manuscripts can “come as quite a
                            shock,” “show[ing] Austen pushing the conventional boundaries of fiction
                            in a way quite at odds with the published novels” (12). So too
                            Sutherland and Pierazzo: <quote>The manuscript evidence therefore
                                represents a different Jane Austen: different in the range of
                                subjects, themes, and narrative experimentation they contain from
                                the novels we know only from print; and different in what they
                                reveal about the workings of her imagination: in particular, what
                                they can tell us of the ebb and flow, the struggle or ease of
                                creation (191).</quote></note> Investigating the differences between
                        Austen’s appearance in script and print is a worthwhile and fruitful
                        pedagogical endeavor—and for the first time these conversations may be had
                        in our classrooms, with ease and little expense, because of the superb
                        digital and print editions of Austen’s manuscripts that are now available to
                        us. </p>
