            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">This essay describes an advanced undergraduate course on “Jane
                    Austen and the Gothic.” Breaking with a literary-historical narrative of
                    development in which Austen corrects the Gothic’s excess, the course
                    interspersed a selection of Austen’s novels with Gothic fiction of the
                    1780s and 90s to explore what these works share, and what their differences
                    could prompt students to see about Austen’s fiction, about the Gothic, and
                    about novels and novel reading in general. Reading Austen with the Gothic
                    helped highlight the uneasiness and “agitation” permeating Austen’s
                    evocations of apparently ordered social worlds, and helped students
                    understand disordering moments in both Austen and the Gothic through a shared
                    network of formal and ideological concerns linking political and social
                    debates to questions of narrative and the representation of character. As the
                    course played out, the striking diversity of student responses to Austen and
                    to the Gothic—responses shaped in part by the divergent afterlives of
                    Austen and the Gothic in today’s popular culture—focused our discussion
                    in surprising ways not only on the social and epistemological value accorded
                    different genres and modes of writing, but also on the kinds of privilege
                    accorded different modes of reading (for example, fast or slow, compulsive or
                    disciplined, credulous or skeptical), both in the Romantic period and in our
                    own classroom practice.

                  <quote>“The storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even
                        than the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The very
                        curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another the lock
                        of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter. Hollow
                        murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than once her blood was
                        chilled by the sound of distant moans.” <ab rend="indent2">(Jane Austen,
                                <title level="m">Northanger Abbey, </title>117)</ab>
                  </quote>
               </epigraph>
               <p>So, in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, Austen parodies the Gothic
                    thrillers Catherine Morland has been reading, sends up the Gothic’s deluded and
                    sleepless readers, and at the same time indulges in the fun. The conjunctions
                    and disjunctions between Austen’s fiction and the machinations of the Gothic
                    tale formed the basis of the advanced undergraduate course, “Jane Austen and the
                    Gothic,” I designed and taught in 2008. Cross-listed in English and Women’s
                    Studies, the course juxtaposed a selection of Austen’s novels with
                    representative Gothic fiction of the 1780s and 90s to explore what these works
                    might share, and what their differences could help students see about Austen’s
                    fiction, about the Gothic, and about the various interests and pleasures of
                    novel reading (and writing) in general. Breaking with the neat categories and
                    sequences that often organize period surveys, the course was both challenging
                    and exciting to teach—not least because, in ways I hadn’t anticipated at the
                    start of the semester, I found myself making new connections along with my
                    students, and thinking about the wider field of writing along new lines. In what follows, I outline the rationale behind the course, how I
                    structured it, and what I learned as I taught.</p>
               <p> The idea to offer a course on Austen and the Gothic arose in part from the
                    historicist impulse that Patricia Matthew and Miriam Wallace see motivating many
                    courses on Romantic-era fiction (par. 1). Linking Austen with the Gothic returns
                    her novels to important aspects of the discursive contexts in which they were
                    produced and initially read. On one level, the course aimed to take account of
                    the Gothic’s prominence in the literary landscape in which Austen’s habits of
                    reading and writing took shape: if the heyday of the Gothic predates the
                    publication of her novels, it coincides with her first forays into novel-writing
                    in the 1790s. Helped by the work of such critics as Marilyn Butler, Mary Poovey,
                    and Claudia Johnson, I hoped students would see that both Austen’s fiction and
                    Gothic novels of the 1780s and 90s respond to a social world in transformation,
                    participating in the cultural debates swirling around key institutions—marriage,
                    the family, patriarchal authority, property transmission.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Recently Nancy Armstrong has written about the connection
                        between the Gothic and property transmission in Austen: in her account,
                        Austen’s fiction goes Gothic when the link between property and personhood
                        is disrupted (237).</note> Austen’s fiction and the Gothic novel alike
                    experiment with new forms for representing subjectivity, and test the
                    relationship of individual desire to social forms; both foreground the role of
                    feeling in organizing or disturbing individual and social bodies. Teaching
                    Austen with the Gothic additionally offers students a way into the era’s debates
                    over the social role and social effects of the novel and novel-reading, and into
                    the contest between “real life and manners” and “romance” central to the
                    theorization of the novel underway in the period.</p>
               <p> To be sure, one might map out this shared terrain in courses configured under
                    other rubrics: “Romantic Fiction,” or “Austen and her Contemporaries,”
                    “Literature of Sensibility,” or even “Gothic Novels,” say. Plus or minus a novel
                    or two, our reading list— works by Charlotte Smith, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew
                    Lewis, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Helen Maria Williams. along with <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title>, and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>—might well have
                    fit comfortably under any of these titles. To my mind, though, my own rubric
                    offered two key advantages. First, I hoped the apparent opposition between
                    Austen’s controlled realism and the Gothic’s extravagance could function as a
                    useful heuristic to get students thinking about questions of genre and mode
                    comparatively. Second, and more crucially, I wanted to capitalize on the
                    recognition factor both Austen and the Gothic hold for readers (and viewers)
                        today.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I deliberately avoided using the
                        terms “Romantic” or “Romantic-era” in my title. My thinking was that these
                        terms might either perform a leveling function (reducing everything we read
                        to iterations of “Romanticism”) or interfere with students’ response to what
                        they read (if they were importing notions of what “Romantic” could mean). By
                        the same token, I wanted to resist letting the Gothic stand as simply
                        another name for the Romantic. As the course progressed, I found we did not
                        require the terminology of Romanticism to accomplish the pedagogical goals I
                        had in mind. </note> Austen’s status as cultural icon and her moment as hot
                    Hollywood property coexist with the Gothic’s continuing power as a cultural
                    mode: the Gothic novelists of the late eighteenth century may not themselves be
                    widely read anymore, but the sensibility and the forms they helped launch live
                    on, and they do so as part of a self-conscious tradition. If, in one sense, my
                    course directed students to the reading world Austen herself inhabited, then the
                    course at the same time forced the question of how and why both Austen and the
                    Gothic have enjoyed such different, but equally spectacular, cultural
                    afterlives. Combining the canonical power of Austen with the <emph>frisson
                    </emph>of the Gothic—or somewhat theatrically contrasting the two—not only
                    turned out to be a potent draw for students (a good thing if you are under
                    pressure to meet enrollment targets), it proved a pedagogically productive
                    experiment as well.</p>
               <p>In our opening discussions, I was surprised to find how many of the students
                    arrived already holding fairly firm views on what reading Austen and reading the
                    Gothic would be like, whether or not they had actually read much of either. We
                    had a few self-professed Janeites who’d been reading her devotedly since high
                    school or before, and a number of these expressed serious skepticism about the
                    Gothic. We had some fans of Gothic fiction—at least in its more recent
                    manifestations—some of whom volunteered (eyes rolling) that they were willing to
                    wade through some Austen if it got them to some juicy Gothic novels, but that
                    didn’t mean they weren’t going to like it. Several students announced themselves
                    as participants in fan or fan fiction communities organized around Austen or the
                    Gothic or both.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a recent example of
                        Gothicized Austen fan fiction, see the blog “<ref target="http://www.darkjaneaustenbookclub.com/">Dark Jane Austen Book Club</ref>.”</note> 
                    But even those more catholic
                    or agnostic in their tastes—including the significant number of students who had
                    read neither a single Austen novel nor a single work of Gothic fiction—seemed
                    puzzled by the course title, which they took as downright oxymoronic: what could
                    the world of “ladylike” Jane Austen, which they pictured as all period dresses
                    and clever repartee, possibly have to do with the Gothic, by which they
                    understood (not incorrectly) sex, crime and madness? Though when I taught this
                    course, in 2008, <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</title> (2009)
                    was still a year away, that title describes essentially the way my students
                    understood my own course title: that spoof (like the whole franchise it has
                    spawned) plays on the same sense of mashing up incongruities, mixing the
                    decorous with the degraded, my students anticipated.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On such hybrid productions see Wells 177–205.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I do not mean to present my students’ expectations as naïve, nor simply as
                    misjudgments to be corrected. They gave voice to what Clara Tuite describes as
                    Austen’s “canonicity effects,” “modes of cultural affect which serve specific
                    functions within and investments of literary culture,” interlinking concepts of
                    formal mastery, class privilege, English cultural heritage, and the romantic
                    marriage plot (2). This is the “safe” Austen, as Deidre Lynch puts it, dominant
                    in cinematic and television adaptations of the past several decades (Lynch
                    “Introduction” 5). Austen scholarship over those same decades—especially
                    historicist, feminist and queer readings of her fiction—suggests many avenues
                    for challenging the straightforward identification of Austen’s fiction with
                    these values, and this course was designed to open up such alternative ways of
                    reading Austen.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example, Johnson,
                        Tuite, and Heydt-Stevenson. </note> Rather than immediately dismissing my
                    students’ received take on Austen, however, I asked them to see it as a cultural
                    formation, and to think about what cultural needs this construction of Austen
                    answers, whose interests it serves (Lynch “Introduction” 5). This moved our
                    discussion to processes of reception and canon formation, and gave me an
                    opportunity to explain (drawing on the terrific collection of essays in Lynch’s
                    volume <title level="m">Janeites</title>) that the cultural meanings of Austen
                    have not always looked as stable and self-evident as they might now; rather,
                    they emerged through a long, complex, and varied reception history.</p>
               <p>Still, the relationship between Austen and the Gothic articulated by my students
                    parallels a developmental narrative often embedded in standard literary
                    histories as well as in our syllabi, perhaps especially in survey courses. In
                    this narrative, Austen’s writing marks the point at which the English novel
                    straightens out and grows up. We pit Austen’s maturity against the Gothic’s
                    adolescent acting-out, or else, somewhat contradictorily, Austen’s modernity
                    against the Gothic’s old-fashioned weirdness, and we produce this relationship
                    in part just by assigning Austen after the Gothic, or reading excerpts from
                    Radcliffe as we teach <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, so that it
                    appears Austen comes along to correct what comes before.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Clifford Siskin argues that Austen’s formal choices, along
                        with her methods of publication and presentation, not only perform her
                        difference from the novel as she received it, but also collude with the
                        language of her earliest critics to represent that difference as an advance
                        in the developmental terms I have outlined (193–209). Siskin sees this as a
                        watershed moment in the development of the modern idea of "literature" itself
                        (205).</note> This developmental narrative often describes an ethical as
                    well technical advance, paralleled in turn by the maturation plots of her
                    novels. According to this story, in other words, where the Gothic functions like
                    the unconscious, Austen acts as the ego ideal: in this version of things, if the
                    Gothic shows us who we fear we were, or are, Austen shows us who we want to
                    become.</p>
               <p>To help imagine alternatives to such a developmental narrative and the typecast
                    roles it assigns, my course partially dispensed with chronological sequence,
                    instead alternating between Gothic novels and Austen’s fiction. We opened, not
                    unconventionally, with Radcliffe’s <title level="m">The Italian</title> (1797),
                    followed by <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> (1818). But we then went
                    back to Lewis’s <title level="m">The Monk</title> (1796) and Wollstonecraft’s
                        <title level="m">Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman </title> (1798), before
                    reading <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1811) and watching the
                    Ang Lee film (1995). Late in the semester, we tackled Smith’s <title level="m">Emmeline, or the Orphan of the Castle </title>(1788), concluding with
                        <title level="m">Persuasion </title>(1818) and a final viewing session for
                    some episodes of <title level="m">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</title> (1997-2003),
                    the TV series whose sensibility merges dark, suburban Gothic with Austenian wit,
                    irony and romance. While the syllabus thus exploited anachronistic conjunctions,
                    one could argue such anachronism is built into much of Austen’s fiction
                    already—integral to all her novels that began life in earlier versions in the
                    1790s, though most obvious in the case of <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title>, which is introduced in Austen’s advertisement as a text from
                    an earlier day. </p>
               <p> I confess I walked out of that first class feeling fairly nervous about what
                    might lie in store: would half the class just trash whatever we were reading in
                    a given week? As the course played out, however, my students’ divided initial
                    responses proved an excellent starting point for our discussions. What surprised
                    me over the course of the semester was not just the richness of the connections
                    students were able to draw on their own across the texts we read (e.g., in
                    linking and comparing heroines—<title level="m">The Italian</title>’s Ellena,
                    Catherine Morland, Wollstonecraft’s Maria, Marianne Dashwood, Emmeline, Anne
                    Elliot—or male leads—Henry Tilney, <title level="m">Maria</title>’s Darnford,
                    Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, Emmeline’s suitors Delamere and Godolphin, William
                    Elliot, Frederick Wentworth, and so on), but also how our sustained experience
                    with the Gothic shifted what we looked for in Austen, and how we saw it.
                    Juxtaposed as they were, Austen and the Gothic could, in a sense, read one
                    another. Repeatedly turning to Austen from the Gothic brought into sharper
                    relief the unease and instability troubling Austen’s evocations of ordered
                    social worlds—especially in the form of alternative or marginalized plotlines
                    (for example, the doubled Elizas in <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title>), or in occasions of suspense, where anxiety can be
                    oppressively intense for characters and for the reader, and where deranging
                    outcomes feel all too likely. This changed how my students understood Austen’s
                    marriage plot: instead of taking for granted the inevitability of narrative
                    closure, students were more willing to imagine the situations of dispossession,
                    powerlessness, danger or simply open-ended waiting in which Austen’s female
                    characters often find themselves as situations from which there may indeed be no
                    magical rescue. We could see the novels emphasizing forms of disconnection as
                    much as forms of community.</p>
               <p>Moreover, turning to Austen from the Gothic and back again had the effect of
                    denaturalizing Austen’s realism. Categories of reader response associated with
                    the Gothic—suspense, horror, anxiety, fascination, boredom, laughter,
                    disgust—became central to our discussions of Austen, too. Gothic novels, we
                    noticed, never let the reader forget she’s reading a book: they are full of
                    obtrusive indices of materiality and textuality. By contrast, I’d had trouble in
                    the past getting students to think of Austen’s fiction as anything other than a
                    transparent representation of reality. Coming back to Austen from the Gothic,
                    however, we were better positioned to ask what Austen does differently so that
                    our immersion in the narrative world she creates goes uninterrupted, to see that
                    it takes particular strategies (free indirect discourse, irony, appeals to
                    common sense and common situations, and so forth) to make this happen. Not only
                    in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey,</title> but across her fiction, students
                    were attuned to the way Austen repurposes literary conventions (for example, in
                    landscape prospects, or in epistolary exchanges) and they could now read these
                    elements of the novel in sophisticated ways. Mary Favret’s <title level="m">Romantic Correspondence</title> proved especially helpful in tracking the
                    function of reading and writing letters in Austen’s fiction against the backdrop
                    of sentimental convention. </p>
               <p>Moving between Austen and the Gothic also helped us think in productive ways
                    about Austen’s representations of consciousness and interiority. The Gothic’s
                    representations of emotional extremity and psychic fragmentation sensitized us
                    to the language of “agitation” and anxiety permeating Austen’s fiction. In the
                    Gothic, the boundary between the self and what lies outside it is
                    characteristically dissolved: the self projects itself into the world, or the
                    other invades the self. Where Romantic-era Gothic typically diagnoses the
                    breakdown of social bonds by isolating subjectivities, shrinking the
                    possibilities for social interaction, Austen’s comedies of manners obviously
                    work in the opposite direction, examining the fraying of social bonds by looking
                    at moments of dissonance among a circle of interacting characters, and imagining
                    the repair of bonds in groups knit together by sympathetic understanding. Her
                    narrative imperatives require, however, the differentiation of her heroines from
                    social worlds that can’t keep pace with their strength of imagination or desire,
                    producing a gap between the self and social reality that can feel Gothic in
                    force. Like the Gothic, too, Austen often dramatizes inwardness by focusing on
                    the permeability of the boundary between inside and outside.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, for example, Adela Pinch’s account of how in Anne
                        Elliot’s experience “mental space is always impinged upon” by what’s outside
                        it (116).</note> The claustrophobia Austen’s heroines frequently
                    experience—necessary to produce their distinction from their social worlds—might
                    evoke parallels for students with the claustrophobic states so crucial to Gothic
                    psychology. </p>
               <p>As we read, the balance of value among these works shifted in surprising ways.
                    The Gothic was no longer just “context” or background, and the fact that some
                    students <emph>preferred </emph>the Gothic to Austen’s brand of realism allowed
                    for productive discussions about how and why we value certain kinds of texts,
                    and about the privilege we accord to certain modes of reading. Austen (we always
                    say) schools us in reading reflectively, with an appreciation for subtleties and
                    precision of language, where re-reading moves us toward a revised understanding
                    and greater clarity. Austen models the skeptical, recursive close reading our
                    discipline—and especially our classroom practice—makes central. By contrast, the
                    Gothic solicits reading as voracious consumption, propelled by curiosity; when
                    you get to the end of the novel, you’re not expected to re-read, you look for
                    the next book. Coleridge pinpoints exactly this feature of the Gothic in his
                    1794 review of <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title>: <quote>Curiosity
                        is raised oftener than it is gratified; or rather, it is raised so high that
                        no adequate gratification can be given it; the interest is completely
                        dissolved when once the adventure is finished, and the reader, when he is
                        got to the end of the work, looks about in vain for the spell which had
                        bound him so strongly to it. (par. 1)</quote> Led by student responses to
                    the novels we were reading, our class discussions ended up canvassing this
                    dichotomous sorting of readerly attitude. This, in turn, raised a series of
                    questions I tried to negotiate as I taught. How well do these opposed models of
                    reading describe what happens in readers’ actual practice? What are our actual
                    investments (pedagogic or scholarly) in these models of reading? How might such
                    an opposition between “close reading” and enthralled, compulsive reading block
                    access to a more nuanced, more useful phenomenology of reading? </p>
               <p>Certainly, as I told my students, I think the Gothic texts we were studying
                    reward close and careful reading (and re-reading). Not all of my students were
                    spell-bound by these Gothic fictions, of course, and I don’t want to minimize
                    the challenge in teaching them. Students can use a lot of help getting through
                    long, strange, convoluted novels like <title level="m">The Monk </title>or
                        <title level="m">Emmeline</title>, both in simply holding onto the thread of
                    the narrative and in knowing when to slow down and read more closely (I ended up
                    distributing chapter-by-chapter notes for <title level="m">The Italian</title>,
                        <title level="m">The Monk</title> and <title level="m">Emmeline</title>,
                    avoiding plot summary but guiding students to significant passages and making
                    key narrative developments explicit). Still, as I’ve been suggesting, many of
                    them did report really getting carried away, especially by <title level="m">The
                        Italian </title>and <title level="m">The Monk</title>. I cherish an e-mail I
                    got early in the semester from one student, a talented close reader: she
                    acknowledged that the reading assignments are long, “but generally,” she
                    continued, sounding a little like Catherine Morland, “my problem has been
                    stopping at the assigned reading. It's hard not to get into these books. […] I
                    robbed myself of several hours of sleep last night reading <title level="m">The
                        Monk</title> almost to the end” (Fix). One of the pleasures of teaching this
                    course was hearing this kind of response, and I mention it partly as
                    encouragement to those teachers thinking about assigning some of these Gothic
                    works. At the same time, one of the challenges of the course—one I can’t claim
                    to have solved to my satisfaction—was figuring out how to talk about this kind
                    of response in the classroom, besides simply welcoming it with relief. All our
                    training tells us to try to get students to slow down, to linger over words;
                    what then do we do with texts that impel readers to speed up? As Rita Felski
                    observes, and as my experience teaching this course brought home to me, our
                    discipline has a surprisingly impoverished vocabulary for talking critically (in
                    the classroom, or in our scholarship) about modes of non-detached reading
                    without lapsing into either platitudes or castigation (2). While we didn’t
                    arrive at a solution to this problem, the course at least succeeded in moving
                    these questions out into the open for me as well as for my students.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a thoughtful discussion of reading with

               </p>
               <p>As we talked about their responses to these texts and considered how they worked
                    towards or against ideals of “close reading,” I tried to get students to think
                    about the formal features that encourage rapid, absorbed reading, and to think
                    about what makes terror or sensation a source of pleasure for readers. We
                    approached these questions in part historically through eighteenth-century
                    theories of terror writing, including Anna and John Aikin’s “On the Pleasure
                    Derived From Objects of Terror,” and period reviews. Coleridge’s reviews of
                    Radcliffe and Lewis take the form of elaborate reflections on, or theories of,
                    affective readerly response and how it is generated. Comparing Gothic or
                    sentimental writing with the new realism Austen’s fiction represents, Walter
                    Scott’s review of <title level="m">Emma</title> similarly distinguishes these
                    genres in part on the basis of the different way each affects the reader.
                    Scott’s review is especially interesting because, while it identifies Austen’s
                    fiction as a singular break with the “old <emph>régime</emph>” (192) of the
                    novel, it is far from a ringing endorsement of her realism. Instead, Scott holds
                    open the space his own historical fiction will occupy, blending “romance” and
                    “real life” and manners, and at the same time imagines a new nineteenth-century
                    figure, the general reader, who turns with equal delight to realism or romance,
                    but who goes to each for different kinds of pleasures (200).</p>
               <p>The Austen novels we were reading, of course, thematize forms of intense readerly
                    attachment: Catherine Morland’s addictive reading of the Gothic; Marianne
                    Dashwood’s overidentification with sentimental fiction; the many kinds of
                    bookishness on display in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, such as Captain
                    Benwick’s Byronism and Anne Elliot’s memory stored with poetry (Pinch). We discussed how
                    and why the potentially dangerous effects of (too much) reading became such a
                    charged topic in the period, and why the Gothic in particular focused cultural
                    anxieties about reading: fears about the reader’s susceptibility to the
                    contagion of feeling or ideas, about the reader’s loss of self-control or
                    self-mastery, about who was reading (women, the lower classes), about the
                    specter of a mass reading public, about the commodification of literature and
                    the industrialization of literary production. As E. J. Clery suggests, the
                    irrationalism of the Gothic seemed to many to mirror the irrationalism of the
                    transfixed reading public, and in turn the irrationalism of commercial modernity
                    more generally (148). I emphasized the emergence of the Gothic in the 1790s as a
                    recognizable “system,” facilitated by the development of new techniques of
                    publishing, marketing, and distribution, exemplified by the growth of
                    circulating libraries and the innovations of William Lane’s Minerva Press. When
                    Catherine Morland remarks that “something very shocking indeed, will soon come
                    out in London” and Henry Tilney recognizes that she is expecting “nothing more
                    dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three
                    duo-decimo volumes…with a frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a
                    lantern,” the exchange draws attention to the regularity of this London-based
                    system of production and its networks of distribution into the provinces (<title level="m">NA </title>77-8). <!-- What is "NA" ? Title or N/A -->The Gothic
                    system appeared to create a spiral of demand, where an ever-increasing flood of
                    books only further intensified the desire of an insatiable reading public for
                    more. </p>
               <p>That Eleanor mistakes Catherine’s meaning and instead understands her to be
                    talking about actual riots in London points to the ambivalent association
                    between “terrorist writing” and the decade’s fears about political
                    unrest—between riots in the streets and a “riot in the brain,” a persistent
                    theme in our discussions.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Johnson and
                        Hopkins on the relationship between the novel, the Gothic, and 1790s
                        politics.</note> Are Gothic fictions destabilizing social forces like mobs
                    in the street, or is the Gothic an escape or distraction from the potential for
                    real violence? Does the Gothic channel anxieties about political unrest, or work
                    to contain or defuse the tensions that might give rise to insurrection? Excerpts
                    from Edmund Burke along with contemporary prints helped my students see how in
                    the paranoid post-Revolutionary climate of the 1790s the language of Gothic
                    terror infected political discourse; we also discussed how Gothic fiction could
                    be turned to explicitly political uses (as in <title level="m">Maria </title>or
                    Godwin’s <title level="m">Caleb Williams</title>), and in any case inevitably
                    took on political dimensions.</p>
               <p> To get a sense for the Gothic as a contested category and to see how period
                    discourse mapped different kinds of reading onto different kinds of readers, we
                    looked at William Wordsworth’s denunciation (in his “Preface” to the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>) of the “degrading thirst after outrageous
                    stimulation” generated by “frantic novels, sickly and stupid German Tragedies,
                    and “deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse,” a reading habit he
                    connects with the simultaneously hyper-stimulating and deadening environment of
                    urban mass culture (177). My students had no trouble locating the metaphors of
                    disease and addiction Wordsworth uses to describe a sick social body, and easily
                    followed the connection, articulated by Karen Swann among others, between
                    Wordsworth’s attack and modern-day complaints about the addictive, stupefying
                    effects of mass culture. We circled back then to think about how Wordsworth’s
                    divisions between “high” and “low” culture and his alignment of these spheres
                    with reflective and sensation-seeking modes of reading correlated with the kind
                    of opposition the class had registered in our course title.</p>
               <p>Like Michael Gamer and Robert Miles, rather than stress the coherence of a Gothic
                    “tradition” or “mode” represented by a catalogue of conventions, I presented the
                    Gothic as a “shifting ‘aesthetic’” (Gamer 4) privileging certain processes or
                    forces: destabilization, fragmentation, contagion and the breaking of
                    boundaries, repetition and proliferation, totalization, abjection, exaggeration,
                    concealment, the operation of uncanny or invisible agency. This more flexible
                    understanding of the Gothic allowed us to track Gothic effects more widely and
                    to think about how the Gothic produces those effects, rather than simply
                    identifying static motifs. In background lectures, I sketched the rise of a
                    taste for the Gothic in the eighteenth century, connecting it with the vogue for
                    ruins; literate culture’s ambivalent fascination with the superstitious tales of
                    oral, folk culture; and the romance of the wild, the primitive, and the outdated
                    in a world of enlightened progress. We talked about how the Gothic’s fascination
                    with the unknowable or the unspeakable contrasted with the drive in Austen’s
                    novels towards clarity, visibility, and open communication. As one explanation
                    for the Gothic’s popularity we could test out over the semester, I proposed
                    Clery’s analysis of Gothic reading as granting a temporary illusion of control,
                    as the anxieties produced by the apparent irrationalism of modernity “could be
                    assuaged by binding them to a narrative repeated over and over with only minor
                    variations” (153). I juxtaposed this historicist perspective on the Gothic as a
                    function of consumer culture with a brief introduction to psychoanalytic
                    perspectives on horror, drawing especially on Kristeva’s theory of
                    abjection.</p>
               <p> I chose <title level="m">The Italian </title>in preference to other Radcliffe
                    novels as a (relatively) compact and classic example of “terrorist” writing at
                    its 1790s peak. Students responded well to the novel (they were especially
                    fascinated by the mysterious Schedoni). I found Gamer’s discussion of the Gothic
                    as an interested, local deployment of broader cultural codes—sentimentality, the
                    sublime—useful in thinking about how to help my students through the narrative.
                    In their initial reading, I discovered, students often skipped over just those
                    passages where Radcliffe most obviously engages such codes, such as in her
                    lengthy landscape descriptions; to the students, such passages just felt tedious
                    and unrelated to the plot. However, once students see that these passages look
                    like departures from the plot precisely because Radcliffe really does go out of
                    her way to call attention to specific non-narrative codes, they can recognize
                    the work these passages are doing, and pick up on the deployment of the same
                    codes in other novels. Anticipating Austen’s concerns with the management of
                    information at the level of narrative technique and its circulation among
                    characters through gossip or letters, I drew attention to the many instances of
                    represented storytelling in <title level="m">The Italian</title>, and the
                    importance of the control of information both within the plot and as a device of
                    suspense (for example, the servant Paulo’s narrative of the confessional of the
                    Black Penitents [80-82], or Ellena’s attempt to read Vivaldi’s note in the
                    convent, closely recalled in Catherine’s attempt to read what turns out to be
                    the laundry list in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> [132]). </p>
               <p>Turning to <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> from <title level="m">The
                        Italian</title>, students quickly recognized Austen’s debt to the Gothic as
                    well as her critique of it. They were receptive to the argument that Austen does
                    not simply reject Gothic irrationality, but rather mobilizes its energies and
                    resources to her own ends.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Judith Wilt’s
                            <title level="m">Ghosts of the Gothic</title> presents a compelling
                        reading of the novel within a Gothic tradition.</note> As Claudia Johnson
                    points out, <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> “domesticates the Gothic,”
                    showing how its dangers are not comfortably distant but shockingly close to the
                    English reader (47). The novel spotlights sources of real terror in Catherine’s
                    world: the aforementioned riots; tyrannical and mercenary authority figures;
                    invidious forms of social deception. And as George Levine argues, the Gothic
                    devices Austen parodies in fact move the plot towards an ending every bit as
                    magical as any romance. To set up discussion of these aspects of the novel, I
                    assigned Johnson’s chapter on the novel from <title level="m">Jane Austen:
                        Women, Politics and the Novel</title> and Robert Hopkins’s “General Tilney
                    and the Affairs of State: The Political Gothic of <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title>,” both excerpted in the Norton Critical edition we used;
                    Jillian Heydt-Stevenson’s discussion of Catherine’s discovery of the linen
                    inventory as an entry into the “Gothicized” economies of the household worked
                    very well also as a focus for discussion (Heydt-Stevenson 130-1). Levine’s
                    accessible “Translating the Monstrous” would also make good secondary reading
                    for undergraduates. </p>
               <p>Given the interests of the course, I had anticipated that much of our discussion
                    would focus on Catherine’s addictive reading and the curiosity it inspires.
                    Instead, however, taking their cue in part from Johnson’s astute observation
                    that Henry Tilney largely scripts Catherine’s “Radcliffean excesses” at the
                    Abbey in advance (39), my students quickly brought our discussion around to
                    Tilney himself and his self-appointed role as instructor, a topic that sparked
                    pronounced (and productive) disagreement. My students took widely varying
                    viewpoints both on how to locate Tilney’s voice in relation to Austen’s
                    authorial perspective, and—a separate but related issue—on how to understand
                    Tilney himself (charming, kind, and reasonable, or insufferable, bullying, and
                    ineffectual). Since Tilney so prominently asserts his own authority as a reader,
                    this debate proved an excellent way to try to calibrate Austen’s own take on
                    novel reading, and it opened up avenues into the novel’s representation of
                    masculinity more generally. Our discussion of Tilney’s pedantry led us naturally
                    to the question of what, if anything, Catherine learns over the course of the
                    novel, and how. Many of my students voiced skepticism about a straightforward
                    narrative of Catherine’s maturation as a progress from delusion to accurate
                    judgment of reality, wondering instead about alternative descriptions of the
                    novel’s plot: is the Catherine so eager to marry Henry Tilney as deluded a
                    reader as ever? Has Catherine’s “strange, unaccountable character” been properly
                    redirected, or absorbed by an (exaggeratedly) conventional fiction (<title level="m">NA </title>6)? </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">The Monk</title>’s sheer strangeness as a novel, its length, and
                    especially its digressions and inset narratives and poetry, can prove
                    challenging in the classroom. Taking these digressions and fragmentations
                    seriously by asking why they are included and what work they perform—especially
                    the “Bleeding Nun” narrative—can in fact be a useful technique for getting at
                    larger patterns or issues in the novel (I recommend Peter Brooks’s essay “Virtue
                    and Terror” along these lines). Students were able to see the novel’s
                    fragmentation and incoherence not as a failing but as an alternative, juxtaposed
                    against the principles of coherence and closure governing Austen’s realism—and
                    so understand those elements of Austen’s work both as artistically achieved (not
                    simply given) and as interested (not simply neutral). The instructor also has an
                    opportunity here to introduce engaging material from the many adaptations and
                    repackagings the novel spawned, from hilariously condensed chapbook versions
                        (<title level="m">Almagro and Claude; or Monastic Murder; Exemplified by the
                        Dreadful Doom of an Unfortunate Nun </title>(1803)), to phantasmagoria
                    set-pieces, to stage versions (<title level="m">Aurelio and Miranda</title>,
                    starring Kemble and Sarah Siddons, and a “Heroic Pantomime Ballet” of “Alonzo
                    the Brave and the Fair Imogine” that ran more than a year at Sadler’s Wells)
                    (Clery 144). That the novel’s pastiche form lends itself immediately to this
                    kind of commercial reproduction, and in fact absorbs it, will be obvious. </p>
               <p>Since I’d already introduced students to the political climate of the 1790s
                    through <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, they were able to place
                        <title level="m">The Monk</title> in this context easily as well. Excerpts
                    from Helen Maria Williams’s <title level="m">Letters Written in France</title>
                    (1790) helped us connect the novel to representations of revolutionary spectacle
                    and spectatorship. <title level="m">The Monk</title> and <title level="m">Maria
                    </title>worked well read in succession, since both engage a post-Revolutionary
                    discourse of sensibility (especially through the figure of the libertine), and
                    both explore the potentially “anarchic” force of individual desire that, as Mary
                    Poovey points out, Austen also contemplates through the figure of Marianne
                    Dashwood (Poovey 101, 185-194). By the time we reached <title level="m">Sense
                        and Sensibility</title>, students were well-prepared to recognize in
                    “sensibility” a contested cultural system (Butler 192). <title level="m">Maria</title>’s critique of marriage and Wollstonecraft’s analysis of the
                    systematic, institutional logic of women’s dispossession prime students to
                    understand the frustration and precariousness in Elinor and Marianne’s situation
                    in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>: the real threat of an
                    intolerably closed existence. With <title level="m">Maria</title>’s exploration
                    of mother-daughter relationships in mind, we focused on representations of the
                    maternal in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>—its bustling cast of
                    mothers a nice change of pace after all the villainous fathers we’d been
                    discussing. Ang Lee’s film adaptation of the novel, together with Deborah
                    Kaplan’s essay “Mass Marketing Jane Austen,” brought us back to the questions
                    about contemporary constructions of Austenian romance with which we began.</p>
               <p>Coming to <title level="m">Emmeline</title> late in the semester, students had a
                    good sense of what to look for in a novel that might otherwise have been
                    mystifying and confusing. They could recognize that while many of the elements
                    of later Gothic novels are already present—distressed orphan, check; old castle,
                    check; random acts of poetry-writing, check—this work of the 1780s predates the
                    more codified Gothic of novels like <title level="m">The Italian</title> and
                        <title level="m">The Monk</title>, and characters and plot don’t fully
                    conform to Gothic stereotype: the mode is still in formation. Built around
                    waiting for a considered attachment rather than rushing into the marriage
                    market, the novel, Smith’s first, offers many possible lines of connection with
                        <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> and <title level="m">Persuasion </title>in particular. If Delamere (lauded by Austen as among
                    the “first of men” in her <title level="m">History of England </title>[<title level="m">NA </title>201]) and Godolphin foreshadow many of Austen’s male
                    leads, Adelina’s poetry-writing and madness can be read against Marianne
                    Dashwood’s story, whereas Emmeline’s emotional responsiveness and autonomy look
                    forward in some ways to Anne Elliot’s. There are plot similarities too: as
                    Loraine Fletcher notes in her excellent introduction to the Broadview edition (a
                    great teaching text), Emmeline and Anne both reject the suitor with family
                    connections and marry a naval officer instead (21). Reading the novel together
                    with some of Smith’s sonnets, we focused on the construction of Emmeline’s
                    interiority though her solitary reveries and her sympathetic imagination, and
                    the almost magical power her ability to feel deeply seems to grant her. My
                    students were intrigued by all the rivalries between men in the book, and the
                    way they constantly threaten to derail the heterosexual courtship plot. The
                    obviousness with which Smith doles out rewards and punishments at the novel’s
                    end makes for a good lesson in how novelistic closure performs ideological work:
                    what values or social positions are vindicated and what values or social
                    positions are criticized by the novel at the end? How does the ending of the
                    novel rearrange or reinforce social or power relations?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I would like to thank my colleague Deborah Kaplan for
                        suggesting I assign <title level="m">Emmeline</title> in this course.
                    </note>
               </p>
               <p>Despite the connections with <title level="m">Emmeline</title> I’ve mentioned,
                        <title level="m">Persuasion </title>felt in some ways like a significant
                    departure from the novels I’ve been discussing. There’s nothing remotely Gothic
                    about Kellynch Hall, and in the end, the old manor neither witnesses a
                    triumphant return of the rightful owner, nor falls down (the other Gothic
                    outcome for old houses). Mr. Elliot may be as dissolute and calculating as any
                    Gothic villain— “a designing, wary, cold-blooded being...black at heart, hollow
                    and black!” (132)—but the threat he poses Anne isn’t ever as immediate. Where
                    novels like <title level="m">The Monk </title>warn against the dangers of
                    individual will unmoored from social structures and traditional roles (Brooks),
                        <title level="m">Persuasion </title>seems to celebrate that possibility. In
                    its close, shifting away from the inheritance plot to a world where people rent
                    rather than own their houses, the novel signals a shift in terrain and mode for
                    the anxiety conjured by Gothic fictions. The terror attached to specific spaces
                    in the Gothic is diffused into the less locatable, but perhaps less containable,
                    anxiousness of everyday life.</p>
               <p>Teaching this class has encouraged me to experiment with setting up similar
                    collisions among heterogeneous groups of novels to energize other courses I
                    teach. In a British Romanticism graduate seminar, for example, where in the past
                    I’d usually taught one or two novels along with poetry of the period—and those
                    novels the usual suspects, typically Austen and/or Mary Shelley—I interspersed
                    our reading in poetry with Maria Edgeworth’s <title level="m">Castle
                        Rackrent</title> (1800), Charlotte Dacre’s <title level="m">Zofloya, or the
                        Moor </title>(1806), Scott’s <title level="m">Guy Mannering</title> (1815),
                    and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. This was a rewarding move, and not only
                    because my students found these novels a lot of fun to read. Making such jumps
                    among novels and such leaps between genres, students can gain an exciting sense
                    of the heterogeneity of a Romantic-era literary field characterized by forceful
                    but radically differing claims for what literature can or should be.</p>

               <p>Prior to my current job, I did not consider myself an “Austen scholar.” That said, I
               have long used Jane Austen as a way to anchor and engage students, which is the
               subject of this essay. I am aware that the Austen name sells not only her six
               complete novels, but endless adaptations, action figures, how-to guides, and other
               material. Within academia, Austen is a name to conjure with in times of declining
               enrollments: whether or not a student has read Jane Austen, the odds are high that
               they recognize the name. Rare is the institution where a course with Austen in the
               title will not fill rapidly.</p>
               <p>This is a double-edged sword: as an eighteenth-centuryist, I am keenly (and sometimes
               uncomfortably) aware of the way that Austen becomes an alpha and omega: the end of
               the eighteenth-century, and the opening salvo into what will be the Victorian novel.
               To people outside my profession, I found myself short-handing the “what do you
               study/teach?” question with “the stuff before and around Jane Austen.” My official
               specialty is the long eighteenth-century, a period roughly bounded (depending on who
               you ask) by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 and the beginning of Victoria’s
               reign in 1837. Within my department my duties at the undergraduate level usually
               include the first half of the British survey (ending in 1778), the eighteenth-century
               novel course, and the late eighteenth-century/Romantic period course called the “Age
               of Revolutions” (1770-1830).</p>
               <p>This essay will primarily discuss a course that fell outside of the typical
               curricular needs I fill. In the fall of 2011, the annual course titled
               nineteenth-century novel needed to be covered and our usual Victorianist faculty were
               busy with leave and other administrative duties. The course is offered often enough
               that it is not taught as a survey, but as a topics course depending on the
               instructor’s particular interests, so long as the novels covered were produced
               between 1800 and 1899. I was asked, and accepted the offer to teach the course.</p>
               <p>What emerged was a class I called the “not-Austen” course: a course that invoked
               Austen in its title and referred back to Austen often without itself being an
               “Austen” course. I will show how courses can be fruitfully haunted by Austen. In
               addition, this course allowed me to experiment with a final project that has had a
               long life beyond this one course. Thus, I will also describe how the original course
               and its final editing assignment has dramatically altered the ways in which I teach
               my upper-division courses.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Course</head>
                  <p>It’s perhaps no surprise that when asked to teach a nineteenth-century novel
                  course I would ask for permission to teach the course as an <emph>early</emph>
                  nineteenth-century course. My very first use of Austen-as-rationale was in its
                  title: “Two Hundred Years Since: Austen's Sister-Novelists in the Literary
                  Marketplace” a title that obviously made use of Austen’s popularity (or at least
                  name recognition) and more subtly nodded to Austen’s fellow-author Walter Scott,
                  whose first novel <title level="m">Waverley</title> (1814) was subtitled “’Tis
                  Sixty Years Since.” </p>
                  <p>For the purposes of the course, “Austen’s Literary Marketplace” was encapsulated
                  in less than two decades, spanning from 1800 until her death in 1817. This focus
                  could, with different justifications, be both narrower and wider: Austen’s first
                  published novel, <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, did not appear
                  until 1811, though Austen had been attempting to publish her work ever since 1797,
                  when her father unsuccessfully offered <title level="m">First Impressions</title>
                  (later <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>) to Thomas Cadell for
                  consideration. Those who might wish to widen the scope still further could of
                  course reach back to Austen’s many influences: <title level="m">First
                     Impressions</title>, after all, was initially pitched as “about the length of
                  Miss Burney's <title level="m">Evelina</title>” according to J.A.
                  Austen-Leigh–invoking a novel published in 1778. Equally justly, one could expand
                  beyond Austen’s death date, especially as the last two novels, <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, were
                  published posthumously. This particular course could not, by the parameters set by
                  the department, reach backward, and I was loath to reach much further beyond. </p>
                  <p>This narrow focus was repeatedly invoked in student evaluations as an aid to a
                  feeling of student mastery. Even in a class with mostly English majors, Austen is
                  known often only as a cultural signifier: erroneously referred to as "Victorian,"
                  representative of a certain set of costume-drama social codes—we know the
                  shorthand "Austen" often stands for. Students were quickly yanked out of their
                  preconceived notions about Austen's world by exposure to a variety of novelists
                  working as rivals to Austen, many of whom couldn't be more different from one
                  another. My goal was to explode their notion of what novels of the period were by
                  showing them a diverse range of fiction produced in the same years that Austen was
                  writing and publishing. Thus, it became unofficially known as the “Not-Austen”
                  course.</p>
                  <p>Auburn’s enrollment system means that students register early and very little
                  shuffling occurs after the registration period, so I was able to email students
                  and ask them to read Austen’s<title level="m"> Pride and Prejudice</title> for the
                  first week of class. At a different institution with different enrollment rhythms,
                  I might reserve early time in the semester to guide the students through a reading
                  of the novel; in the course as taught, students made repeated reference to the
                  novel throughout, with shifting understandings of this “baseline” text.</p>
                  <p>In the course of the semester, students read Mary Robinson’s <title level="m">
                        <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/robinson/mrletterfrst.htm">A
                     Letter to the Women of England</ref>
                     </title> and <title level="m">The Natural
                     Daughter</title> (1799), Elizabeth Hamilton’s<title level="m"> Memoirs of
                     Modern Philosophers</title> (1800), Anne Plumptre’s<title level="m"> Something
                     New</title> (1801), Maria Edgeworth’s <title level="m">Castle Rackrent
                  </title>(1800), Lady Owenson’s <title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl</title>
                  (1806), Hannah More’s <title level="m">Coelebs in Search of a Wife </title>(1809),
                  Jane Porter’s <title level="m">The Scottish Chiefs</title> (1810) and the
                  anonymously-published <title level="m">The Woman of Colour</title> (1808). These
                  novels were selected in part for their availability in teachable classroom
                  editions: for example, <title level="m">The Wild Irish Girl</title> and <title level="m">Castle Rackrent</title> have been printed together in a Riverside
                  Edition, and Broadview and Valancourt each have an enormous number of texts from
                  the period. Length was of course also a consideration, though one of the most
                  popular texts of the semester was the substantial <title level="m">Scottish
                     Chiefs</title>.</p>
                  <p>These long readings were punctuated by in-class readings of reviews and readings
                  about the novel form from Cheryl L. Nixon’s <title level="m">Novel Definitions: An
                     Anthology of Commentary on the Novel, 1688-1815</title>. Depending on its
                  length, a single review takes approximately 5-8 minutes in class for students to
                  read with care, and they incorporate well into larger discussions. I began the
                  semester with Nixon’s collection of prize-winning student essays on “The Love of
                  Novels” from <title level="m">The Juvenile Library</title> (1800). Each essay is
                  extremely brief, and the authors are a few years younger than my students (14 or
                  15). Moreover, the question “Whether such a Love of Novels as excludes all other
                  reading, or no reading at all, is most to be condemned?” resonates strongly with
                  students familiar with the debates over Young Adult (YA) literature, especially
                  the debate between the camp of “at least they’re reading” and that of “YA is
                  brain-rotting and dangerous.” From the very first day, they understand that the
                  novel’s history is one of an ongoing debate about its status, and its effects on
                  its readers. Nixon’s anthology is full of similar essays and reviews from various
                  eighteenth-century voices, and my students became deeply interested in these
                  debates. Later in the semester, students were assigned to lead discussion on some
                  of these assigned in-class readings, which I had chosen both to pair well with the
                  novels as well as highlight different definitions and anxieties about the novel in
                  the period. Edgeworth’s <title level="m">Castle Rackrent </title>is usefully
                  discussed in light of her thoughts on books in <title level="m">A Practical
                     Education</title> (1798), for example. Nixon’s book is, as its full title
                  suggests, useful for a much more substantial survey of the novel, but contains
                  enough material within the two decades of this course to fill the semester. </p>
                  <p>In a similar fashion, the data held in Cardiff University’s open-access <title level="m">
                        <ref target="http://www.british-fiction.cf.ac.uk/search.asp">British
                        Fiction, 1800–1829: A Database of Production, Circulation, and
                        Reception</ref>
                     </title> can also be fruitfully used to provide this sort of
                  initial access. That database incorporates information about a book’s initial
                  format, later editions and translations in the period, publisher information, and
                  correspondence where available, as well as advertisements, reviews, and anecdotal
                  information from private correspondence. Moreover, it includes information about
                  subscribers and which circulating libraries owned copies, allowing students to
                  discover important information about the way the reading public gained access to
                  the fiction of the day.</p>

                  <head>Final Project: Making A Scholarly Edition</head>
                  <p>Parallel to this analysis of Austen's literary marketplace was an investigation of
                  the modern literary marketplace. Thus, in addition to key term exams,
                  discussion-leading, and weekly responses, students were responsible for creating a
                  proposal for a modern classroom edition of an early nineteenth-century text not
                  yet edited. This aspect of the course might not have happened but for its
                  experimental nature, but it also had some clear influences, most explicitly
                  assignments created by Miranda Yaggi and Marta Kvande.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As a graduate instructor at Indiana University, Yaggi had led
                     her students through an assignment culminating in digital editions of short
                     Victorian-era texts to be posted online. Kvande, an associate professor at
                     Texas Tech, has her graduate students do bibliographic work on texts found in
                     Texas Tech's collections.</note> I have worked with special collections
                  librarians each semester in my courses since I was a graduate student, from
                  surveys to graduate seminars, and was eager to do more. Because the focus of the
                  “Not-Austen” course was so tight, I created a series of scaffolded assignments
                  that allowed us to take advantage of the students’ emerging depth of knowledge and
                  apply it to a concrete project.</p>
                  <p>Prior to the start of the semester, I sat down with Greg Schmidt, one of the
                  librarians in Special Collections, and we made a list of the materials we hold
                  from the period under consideration so that students could select from a
                  controlled lists of texts. These texts were checked against commonly-available
                  modern editions as well as resources like the Oxford Dictionary of National
                  Biography to ensure that at least some information about the author and other
                  contextual information would be readily available to a diligent, if novice,
                  researcher.</p>
                  <p>It is worth noting at this point that I work at a flagship state institution in
                  the South with decidedly modest physical holdings in eighteenth- and early
                  nineteenth-century texts in our Special Collections; our institution is renowned
                  for its engineering school and for other STEM fields. Thus, like many other
                  institutions, database access can be spotty: we do have Eighteenth-Century
                  Collections Online (ECCO), but microforms are considered sufficient for access to
                  the holdings that are now offered as periodical databases like the Burney
                  Collection of British Newspapers, British Periodicals I and II, and other major
                  literary-historical databases such as Early English Books Online (EEBO). Because
                  of our geographical location, the nearest institutions with more substantial
                  holdings are over an hour or two away, often in the bordering state of Georgia. </p>
                  <p>I mention all of this because while this course represents certain kinds of
                  privilege (curricular freedom, multiple offerings in my subfield each year, modest
                  teaching load, some access to major databases), I also navigate a series of uneven
                  challenges as well. In this case, we found we needed to expand our list to include
                  texts from the 1820s, as well as to embrace multiple genres (plays, poetry, and
                  short stories) in order to create a substantial list of available choices. </p>
                  <p>Within the first two weeks of the course, students were taken to Special
                  Collections for an introductory session, where students were guided through both
                  relevant works they might choose as well as supplementary resources they might use
                  to consult as they researched their primary text. On that day they completed a
                  substantial two-page worksheet analyzing one text of their choice, examining the
                  physical and bibliographic features of the work in order to understand the initial
                  audience [see Appendix 1]. As they found themselves gravitating to one text or
                  another, they also began to talk to one another and discuss group formation.
                  Ultimately, while most groups selected novels, one group selected a volume of
                  short stories, and two groups selected collections of poetry.</p>
                  <p>Each group had to read their chosen text, select a suitable amount to edit, and
                  use that as the basis for a proposal for a modern edition. Composed in Word for
                  the sake of (relative) simplicity, and ultimately submitted in both hard copy and
                  PDF form, each "edition" proposal included justifications for their editorial
                  choices, a group-written critical introduction, and sample chapters, as well as
                  individual appendices. These appendices were primary source texts related in some
                  fashion to the main text, which they individually edited to confirm to “house
                  style.” Groups had a choice of how to convey extratextual information, but they
                  were required to include some form of notes (either footnotes or endnotes). Each
                  student also produced a critical essay on an aspect of their text. Group tasks
                  were paralleled by individual tasks that demonstrated the same skills: individual
                  and group text selection, editing and layout assignments, and individual and group
                  papers. This mitigated some of the pitfalls of group work: unfair distribution of
                  labor, etc.</p>
                  <p>This project was aided immensely by my colleagues at Auburn: in addition to the
                  work done by Greg Schmidt in Special Collections, English subject librarian Jaena
                  Alabi guided students through hands-on research in order to find appropriate
                  appendix items and scholarship (if any) on their individual text, as well as
                  crafting useful footnotes. In hands-on lab time, my colleague in Technical and
                  Professional Communication Derek Ross and his graduate students taught students
                  about the basic principles of document design to guide their layout. During this
                  in-class session, each group agreed on a “house style” and helped design an
                  appropriate cover for their work. Students designed their own covers, relying on
                  discussions they had with Brett McLethan of Broadview Press, who made himself
                  available for questions about publishing and acquisition practices. In a later
                  version of this course, Brett also brought a sample pricing sheet, which opened
                  students’ eyes still further to the costs incurred even before books are printed
                  and bound.</p>
                  <p>During the last class day, students created exhibits in Special Collections
                  featuring their proposals, including posters that advertised and explained their
                  text, including examples of the transformation from nineteenth into twenty-first
                  century type, historical and cultural information, and the like. They were able to
                  display “their” editions alongside the original early-nineteenth-century
                  originals. Because the final product was turned in both as hardcopy and PDF, we
                  are able to display the physical copies in Special Collections, and are currently
                  working on how best to curate their work digitally on the Library website.</p>
                  <p>The groups from the first iteration of the course chose a diverse set of texts.
                  Perhaps the most ambitious group tackled Robert Charles Dallas’s <title level="m">Percival, or Nature Vindicated</title> (1801), the only full-length novel
                  selected by any group. Two groups selected collections of “tales” by the novelist
                  Maria Edgeworth: one group editing her <title level="m">Moral Tales for Young
                     People</title> (1809), another <title level="m">Tales of Fashionable
                     Life</title> (1809). One group selected a work of poetry: Maria De Fleury’s
                     <title level="m">Divine Poems and Essays on Various Subjects</title> (1804).
                  The gravitation of students towards works that contain shorter fiction or poetry
                  rather than a full-length novel is not very surprising in retrospect. While the
                  intent of our initial curated list of works was to provide precisely this sort of
                  diversity, I now think that more would be gained from more uniformity of text
                  length and genre.</p>
                  <p>According to students, this assignment opened their eyes in a variety of ways: to
                  the rationale behind the cost of their assigned novels, to new career
                  possibilities, and to the historical context in which these texts were written.
                  Several students have gone on to take courses in document design as well as the
                  eighteenth-century novel. Two members of this group, Shelby Chase and Amelia
                  Dixon, would go on in the spring of 2013 to present their work to the
                  University-wide Undergraduate Research Forum, where they won first prize. </p>

                  <head>Later Variations</head>
                  <p>After the success of the “Not-Austen” class and its final assignment, I adapted
                  the assignment for my eighteenth-century novel course. Because of the challenges
                  of text selection encountered in the prior course, in this version the class
                  worked as a single group, and I selected the text to be edited, assigned
                  individual students chapters, and built the class around it. The novel was Mary
                  Brunton’s <title level="m">Self-Control</title> (1811), a novel that draws richly
                  upon a variety of prior novels from across the eighteenth century, and was
                  unavailable in a modern classroom edition.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A new
                     edition by Anthony Mandal was since published in November 2013 as part of
                     Pickering and Chatto’s Chawton House Library series. See Brunton.</note> The
                  novel also has the virtue of being available online in a plain-text form without
                     notes,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See P.J Labrocca’s website <ref target="http://labrocca.com/marybrunton/">Mary Brunton</ref>.</note> so
                  students could focus on the work of formatting, creating notes, etc. rather than
                  transcription. Similar work could be done with texts from Project Gutenberg,
                  though they do not provide information about the source edition, eliminating a key
                  piece of information. HathiTrust or Google Books, because they are presented as
                  PDFs, generally include the relevant bibliographic data, though they do require
                  transcription. Instructors wishing to replicate this assignment will often thus
                  need to choose between the competing goods of the convenience of cut-and-paste and
                  the important contextual cues. Given that my goal with this assignment is to
                  impress upon students the importance of reliable and judicious selection of source
                  text, I sacrifice convenience. </p>
                  <p>In the editing portion of the Brunton class assignment, technical writing graduate
                  student Stephen Carradini and I guided the class through the decisions relevant to
                  creating a style sheet, which they discussed and voted on during class time. As
                  with the first iteration of the course, students produced appendices and critical
                  essays. If the edited text is read and given some class time at the beginning of
                  the semester, this approach can work well for classes where access to original
                  texts is particularly limited. As I have noted in <title level="m">Women’s
                     Writing</title>, Brunton was a direct contemporary with Jane Austen, and Austen
                  read <title level="m">Self-Control </title>with initial anxiety that they might be
                  writing in the same territory–though Austen found herself relieved.</p>
                  <p>In the spring of 2014 I taught my first class in a new active learning space, the
                     <ref target="http://auburn.edu/easl/">E.A.S.L.</ref> (Engaged Active Student
                  Learning) classroom being piloted at Auburn. This classroom is designed in five
                  “pods” that can allow groups of up to nine students to work together with a shared
                  oversized monitor, glassboards, and wireless connections that allow students to
                  collaborate using their laptops or any mobile device that uses the iOS or Android
                  operating platforms. As of this writing, I am beginning my first course in that
                  classroom that includes a group editing component. Because such a classroom is
                  designed to work best with in-class projects, I plan to shift more of the work of
                  editing and researching into the classroom. This shift will allow me to more
                  directly guide students through the work of editing while allowing me to return to
                  the smaller-group format of the first version of the assignment. </p>
                  <p>This course also has a further afterlife. In 2015, my colleague Derek Ross and I
                  will team-teach a course on the “History of the Book in Theory and Practice,”
                  where we hope to deepen and broaden the scaffolding around the previous iterations
                  of the course. This course will give the students the ability to encounter both
                  historical and modern methods of print production in a hands-on manner, embedding
                  the textual editing assignment in the context of more reading in book history. It
                  is our hope that we will be able to have our public and professional writing
                  students will better understand the origins of terms and practices they learn in
                  their document design and editing courses, while our literature students better
                  understand the history and transformations that are connected to changing forms of
                  media production. As unlikely as it seemed at the start, all of these future
                  courses have their grounding in the experiment of the “Not-Austen”
                  course.<pb/>

               Friedman discuss the history of and the state of the scholarship of teaching
               Jane Austen, a surprisingly underdeveloped area of study, given Austen's
               ubiquity in the English curriculum at the college level.

               <p>“Is Jane Austen out of date for the classroom?” asked a British Council weblog entry
               in August 2013. The blogger, Chris Lima, answers immediately “no,” but her response
               follows an eye-catching photo of a woman holding up an exquisitely made teapot-shaped
               cookie, decorated with Austen’s supposed silhouette. The photo is captioned, “You
               don't have to bribe your students with Jane Austen tea cookies to get them to read
               her books.” At first glance, this short essay could be mistaken for a tongue-in-cheek
               article from <title level="j">The Onion</title>. </p>
               <p>The questioning of Austen’s fashionability or relevance for the classroom, however,
               appears to be entirely in earnest. Lima argues that Austen’s language is not as
               inaccessible to students as we might think, that her themes are still relevant, and
               that using the film adaptations such as the 1995 BBC <title level="m">Pride and
                  Prejudice</title> to help with contextualization offers a useful classroom tool.
               Lima, who teaches Austen at the University of Leicester, concludes, “The novel
                  [<title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>] is so popular around the world that
               the vast majority [of students] are quite familiar with the story and the characters
               and by the end of the course I feel they have created a quite strong connection with
               the book.” One might be tempted to ask if this is true with or without the tea
               cookies.</p>
               <p>What is startling about this feature on the UK’s premier international cultural
               organization’s website goes far beyond the question of bribes and cookies. It seems
               strange that the teaching of Austen today would be framed in such a defensive way,
               particularly just after the announcement that her face would be featured on the £10
               note. If Austen isn’t out of date for currency, shouldn’t we start with the
               assumption that she is also perfectly current for the college curriculum? </p>
               <p>Perhaps the question posed means to interrogate whether Austen <emph>has
                  currency</emph> among younger people, those of traditional college age. If so, the
               answer is even clearer. The popular vlog, <title level="j">The Lizzie Bennet
                  Diaries</title>, demonstrates Austen’s strong positioning among so-called classic
               authors in emerging new media and youth culture, at least among girls (Green and Su).
               Students may no longer know that Colin Firth played Mr. Darcy in the BBC <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> (1995), as Donna Parsons argues in her essay
               in this special issue, but many do know that Lizzie of the Emmy Award Winning series
               is a modern-day, updated version of Austen’s nineteenth-century heroine. </p>
               <p>What the British Council’s blog post may reveal is that our conversations about
               teaching Austen remain in a rather fledgling state, especially given how often she is
               included on college or postsecondary (and, to a lesser extent, high school or
               secondary) syllabi in the US, Canada, and the UK. Are we really still in the position
               of needing to educate fellow educators about whether Austen’s themes are relevant?
               That would seem to be “How to Teach Jane Austen” on training wheels. Scholarship on
               Austen has developed by leaps and bounds over the past forty years, but the
               scholarship of teaching Austen has merely inched forward during this period. We hope
               that our special issue will join an outpouring of new, more sophisticated scholarship
               of <emph>teaching</emph> Austen.</p>
               <p>The essays collected here describe curricular ideas, innovations, and practices that
               seek to move us beyond simple questions of Austen’s accessibility, relevance, and
               context. The contributors (whose essays began as presentations in two linked
               “Teaching Jane Austen” sessions at the Modern Language Association Convention in
               Boston in January 2013) ask how we might enrich the teaching of Austen’s fiction by
               seeing her in conversation with manuscript culture, children’s literature, Harry
               Potter, or Romantic poetry. Collectively, these essays look to what it means to teach
               Austen in many kinds of classes and classrooms, with differently-located learners,
               and with a variety of texts, tools, and assignments. Although all of us teach at the
               college level in North America, many of us also seek to explore what it means to
               teach Austen in a global context and in alternative educational contexts—both hers
               and our own—as her reach has become virtually worldwide (Dryden). </p>
               <p>Four substantial books and dozens of essays about teaching Austen have been published over the
               past fifty years. These are joined by copious web-based materials, many hosted by
               publishing companies. The four books remain valuable ones. Marcia McClintock Folsom’s
               three edited collections in the “MLA Approaches to Teaching” series, <title level="m">Approaches to Teaching Austen’s</title> Pride and Prejudice (1993), <title level="m">Approaches to Teaching Austen’s</title> Emma (2004), and <title level="m">Approaches to Teaching Austen’s</title> Mansfield Park (2014) include
               valuable information about editions, criticism, and strategies for discussion. They
               feature essays that illuminate various approaches to the novel. Even so, only the new
                  <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> volume benefits from the most up to date
               scholarship, film adaptations, and other popular phenomena: the <title level="m">Emma</title> volume is now a decade old and her <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> volume is now
               more than twenty years old. One additional limitation to books in the series is that
               their focus must necessarily be on strategies for teaching a single Austen text, not
               on teaching an Austen-centered course or on teaching her other writings.</p>
               <p>As strong as they are, none of Folsom’s edited volumes sets out to do more than dip
               into the filmic, print, or stage adaptations and sequels for their potential uses in
               the Austen classroom. For those interested in such an approach, Louise Flavin’s
                  <title level="m">Jane Austen in the Classroom: Viewing the Novel / Reading the
                  Film </title>(2004) offers an alternative place to begin. Flavin describes the
               possibilities for teaching Austen in an image-rich environment, in which issues of
               originality, adaptation, and interpretation are brought to the fore. Flavin’s book,
               too, is now a decade old. These three titles have been foundational to the
               scholarship of teaching Austen at the college level.</p>
               <p>Dozens of articles on the subject preceded these books. (NOTE TO THE READER: We have
               identified more than 60 print and online sources related to the teaching of Austen
               and have compiled an annotated bibliography that may be found in <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/pedagogies/commons/austen/pedagogies.commons.2015.looserzarka.html">a separate section of this special issue</ref>.) Adding to the challenge of
               describing the scholarship of teaching on Austen is that many of these essays were
               published hither and yon—not in high-profile books or journals, and not necessarily
               in places we would look for them. What we can see from the scholarship we have been
               able to locate is that ruminating on the problems and possibilities of teaching
               Austen is not a recent phenomenon. Although it remains a comparatively underdeveloped
               area in the vibrant arena of Austen studies, the scholarship on teaching her is by no
               means new. Devoney Looser is now at work on a project documenting the teaching of
               Austen that dates to more than a century ago. To offer but one example, a short essay
               titled, “A Novel Course for Teachers: Jane Austen” appears in the Atlanta-based
                  <title level="j">Southern Educational Journal</title> in 1898. Ideas and advice on
               how (and why) to teach Austen have a long and as yet untold history.</p>
               <p>Most of these “teaching Austen” materials were not considered important enough to
               record in bibliographies of Austen scholarship. David Gilson’s invaluable <title level="m">A Bibliography of Jane Austen</title> (Rev. ed., 1997) includes just
               three sources categorized in the index as related to “teaching,” all from the early
               1970s. It is true that some essays about teaching Austen do not sport titles
               signaling that they are about teaching. In 1975, Lionel Trilling published “Why We
               Read Jane Austen,” an essay that deals extensively with his experiences teaching her
               fiction in the classroom. Trilling sets out to describe “the intensity of feeling
               which students at my university directed to Jane Austen when I gave a course in her
               novels two years ago” (517). </p>
               <p>Trilling reports that he ran the course in a discussion-centered format rather than a
               lecture, and that “the optimum number of students would seem to be twenty and a
               practicable maximum probably cannot be higher than thirty” (518). He was amazed and
               distressed, then, when “the number of students who attended the first meeting of the
               course was something like 150” (518). It being the mid-1970s and Trilling being Trilling, he
               told the students he wanted to stick to the original enrollment he’d envisioned for
               the course and that he would conduct interviews to determine which students would be
               allowed to take it. After conducting a day and a half of interviews, he grew
               uncomfortable with the process; he had no criteria to make the decisions and worried
               that the notes he was jotting were “in some sense discriminatory” (518), having more
               to do with his sense of a student’s “personal interestingness” (518).</p>
               <p>These experiences with Austen in the classroom lead Trilling to consider Austen’s
               reputation. He discusses her place among a population of readers without credentials,
               whom he imagines as having turned her into a “pet” and a “darling” (519). Trilling
               believes that scholars of the immediate past (the early 1970s) turned “Austen into a
               figure . . . probably in part by the contemporary demand for female figures, though
               certainly not for that reason alone” (519). Trilling describes his own discomfort
               with attempting to add to our knowledge of how and why Austen had become “a figure,”
               versus approaching her as “nothing more than a good read” (520). He did not want to
               be on either pole, seeing himself as recuperating the idea of “a good read” beyond “a
               descent into mere creature-comfort, into downright coziness,” wanting to be prepared
               to discuss “why and how it is that pleasure comes to us from stories’ (520). </p>
               <p>Trilling’s interviews with prospective students led him to despair. As he writes,
               “There was something [students] wanted, not from me, as was soon apparent, but from
               Jane Austen, something that was making for an intensity in their application for the
               course such as I had no preparation for in all my teaching career” (520). Teaching
               Austen, Trilling finds, is <foreign>sui generis</foreign>. In the end, he came up
               with his list of forty students, having revised his maximum number upward, but he
               writes that he wasn’t prepared for the appeals, the expressions of bitterness (521).
               Why, Trilling asks, did this course mean so much, did Austen mean so much? One of the
               reasons he considers is that students flocked to Austen to “in some way transcend our
               sad contemporary existence” (521). </p>
               <p>He recalls a different context, only a few years earlier, in 1968, when the figure
               who had stood in that place in the college curriculum was William Blake (521).
               Trilling considers what it means that college students might flock to Blake in 1968
               and then, a handful of years later, to Austen: <quote> The style phases of our
                  culture are notoriously short; it was not to be thought anomalous that at one
                  moment disgust with modern life should be expressed through devotion to a figure
                  proposing impulse, excess, and the annihilation of authority [Blake], and then a
                  scant five years later through devotion to the presiding genius of measure,
                  decorum, and irony [Austen] (522)</quote> He turns to the then recently published
               work by Clifford Geertz, to make sense of life, culture, and aesthetics, articulating
               aspects of the vision of the value of humanism for which his criticism is famed. From
               the perspective of teaching Austen, however, several things are important to note in
               his essay, particularly his sense of college students embracing “a figure” in waves
               of fashion. Reading Trilling on Austen might strike us today as both old hat and new
               business. What is new, thanks to Trilling, is the realization that Austen’s being “a
               figure” in the college classroom itself has a long, varied, and not yet well-mined
               history.</p>
               <p>If we fast-forward ten years from Trilling, we find Patricia Meyer Spacks considering
               similar questions. Spacks published “Emma’s Happiness” in the <title level="j">ADE
                  Bulletin</title>, commenting on her teaching of Austen and offering another
               anecdotal view of continuity and change. She writes that her students came to the
               classroom not only seeking in Austen a “figure” or a pet and a darling (in Trilling’s
               terms) but because they “interest themselves” in Austen’s female characters,
               suggesting a kind of identification with the heroines (17). Problems arise with
                  <title level="m">Emma</title>, then, as students are loathe to “interest
               themselves” in a character they see as “overprivileged” and a novel that “offends
               feminist sensibilities and disappoints romantic expectations” (17). Spacks writes
               that “Every time I teach <title level="m">Emma</title>, the novel, I run into the
               same problem: students don’t like Emma, the character” (17). Spacks talks about the
               difficulties of getting students beyond thinking of characters as people to thinking
               of characters as characters, giving specific tactics for prompting other kinds of
               readings. </p>
               <p>She concludes that “Perhaps the best thing we can do for students of <title level="m">Emma</title> is to confuse them: to make them realize how many questions Austen
               raises, how few she distinctly answers, how much they themselves may resemble Emma
               precisely in her mistakes, how difficult it is to acknowledge such resemblance” (18).
               By 1986, Spacks’s essay implies, students were coming to Austen’s novels with several
               kinds of desires and impulses, seeking an identification with the heroine, a
               ratification of feminist sensibilities, and the satisfaction of romantic
               expectations—all at once. How different is this—or is this different at all?—from
               Trilling’s students’ desires? How different is it from the desires of our respective
               students today?</p>
               <p>Both Spacks and Trilling were teaching Austen at tony institutions in classes
               presumably made up of majority-white, economically privileged young Americans. We
               need more accounts of what it means to teach Austen to other student populations and
               in many kinds of classrooms. Nora Nachumi’s "'I Am Elizabeth Bennet': Defining One's
               Self through Austen's Third Novel,” is a trailblazing essay in this vein, describing
               her experiences teaching <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> to Orthodox
               Jewish women students. As Nachumi writes, “As Orthodox Jews, my students live lives
               circumscribed by expectations of feminine conduct that resemble those that appear in
               the novel. Thus <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> is more obviously
               relevant to their own lives than it is to those of most students at secular
               institutions” (120). </p>
               <p>In this special issue of <title level="m">Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons</title>, we
               have tried to make sense of what it means to teach Austen beyond the elite college
               classroom, acknowledging that all Austen classrooms have changed over the past fifty
               years. In his essay in this issue, Michael Verderame describes his experiences and
               practices teaching <title level="m">Persuasion </title>in a men’s prison. In hers,
               Donna S. Parsons describes what it means to teach Austen to Midwestern undergraduate
               students raised on the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> novels and films. Our
               collective experiences and anecdotes certainly add to the record, but there is little
               large-scale information about where Austen is being taught or to whom. Textbook
               publishers must have a good idea, as so many of them are now marketing competing
               editions, but one suspects that, for that very reason, they would be loathe to share
               the information. It would be fascinating to know how the gender, race, and class
               demographics of students enrolling in Jane Austen courses have changed over time. It
               would be interesting to know how many of the students who come to an Austen course
               (or to the reading of a particular Austen novel in a literature course) already
               consider themselves her fans. As Sarah Raff asks in her essay, what does it mean that
               her students imagine the stereotype of a student in a Jane Austen class to be a
               (straight) college girl who is desperate for a boyfriend?</p>
               <p>The nine essays that make up this special issue touch on what happens when students
               discuss issues of courtship and romance through Austen, but they also consider what
               happens when Austen is taught in less familiar contexts, whether of content or
               method. Those contexts and methods include digital media and manuscript facsimiles
               (Levy) and Austen in popular culture (Wells). They include considerations of teaching
               Austen in light of the nineteenth-century literature around her that is “not Austen,”
               allowing students to better to understand the literary marketplace that she joined
               (Friedman). They include Austen and Harry Potter (Parsons), Austen and
               nineteenth-century children’s literature, such as that by Maria Edgeworth (Rosings),
               and Austen and a wide range of Gothic novels (Eisner). They include Austen in
               conversation with the “bix six” male Romantic poets (Lau) and with serious and
               satirical advice literature on love (Raff). Collectively, these essays show that not
               only is the teaching of Austen alive and well, it is booming. If what is going on in these
               contributors’ classrooms is any indication, Austen is now at the forefront of
               vibrant, creative, and multivalent pedagogical practices in the undergraduate and
               graduate literature curriculum. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">Throughout the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, Jane
                    Austen was not treated—in published criticism or in the classroom—in
                    relation to the major male Romantic poets or thought to participate in the
                    period’s defining events and concerns, either political or literary.
                    Although these attitudes have begun to change, most scholarship on Austen
                    still treats her either in isolation or in relation to other women writers,
                    and many instructors report that they have trouble integrating Austen in
                    Romantic period courses.  My essay argues that Austen’s novels share many
                    characteristics with Romantic-era poems and can be taught alongside these in
                    a way that enhances our understanding of Romanticism.  Similarities in the
                    works of Austen and the male poets include an embrace of individualism; a
                    shift from external events to the inner life as a focus of literature; a
                    fascination with brother-sister incest; an emphasis on commonplace people and
                    settings; conflicts between the attractions of romance and reality; a
                    celebration of the sympathetic imagination and awareness of the dangers of
                    solipsism and visionary flight; and a love of the natural world.

               <p> Throughout the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, Jane Austen was not
                    treated—in published criticism or in the classroom—in relation to the major male
                    Romantic poets or thought to participate in the period’s defining events and
                    concerns, either political or literary. As late as the 7<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>
                    (2000) edition, the <title level="m">Norton Anthology's</title> "Introduction to
                    the Romantic Period" referred to Austen as “the only important author who seems
                    to be untouched by the political, intellectual, and artistic revolutions of her
                    age” (Abrams 20). In recent decades that situation has at last begun to change,
                    and an increasing body of criticism connects Austen in various ways to the
                    Romantic movement.<note place="foot" resp="editors">One indication of this
                        change is that, beginning with the 8<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> edition of the
                            <title level="m">Norton Anthology</title> (2006), the statement about
                        Austen’s detachment from the concerns of her age is gone, and in several
                        passages she is linked to the Romantic poets (Greenblatt 22; see also 14).
                        For other studies allying Austen with Romanticism, besides works cited
                        above, see essays by Nina Auerbach, a special issue of <title level="j">The
                            Wordsworth Circle</title> devoted to the topic (7.4 [Autumn 1976]),
                        Ruoff, Thomas, Tuite, Harris, and Walker.</note> But old habits apparently
                    die hard. Most scholarship on Austen still treats her either in isolation, in
                    relation to other novelists, or in conjunction with other women writers.
                    Anecdotal evidence also indicates that many instructors still have trouble
                    integrating Austen in Romantic period courses and either omit her altogether,
                    or, if they include one of her novels, emphasize its differences from the poetry
                    of the major male poets. My most recent experience of this response was at a
                    NASSR 2013 roundtable discussion of the various period courses in which Austen
                    is taught (Eighteenth-Century, Romantic, Victorian), when an audience member
                    declared that Austen has nothing in common with the male Romantic poets.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The session was entitled “Austen Over Time,”
                        organized and moderated by Debra Gettelman and Shawn Maurer. </note>
               </p>
               <p> I am committed to teaching Austen in my Romantics classes alongside William
                    Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Blake, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe
                    Shelley, and John Keats. In the first place, I consider it essential to include
                    the major novelist of the period in such courses—indeed, it is as inappropriate
                    to leave her out as it would be to omit Wordsworth or any other central figure
                    of the age. Moreover, one need not view Austen’s work as a departure from trends
                    that characterize Romantic poetry. Many central connections can be explored
                    between Austen’s novels and Romantic poems that have been, as it were, hiding in
                    plain sight all along. I do wish to make clear that I’m not arguing for teaching
                    only the “big six” poets plus Austen, or for viewing her solely in relation to
                    these writers. In my courses I do include other women writers (and often, due to
                    time constraints, leave out one or more of the major male poets) and address
                    various similarities and differences among all of the works treated. In this
                    essay, however, I focus on connections between Austen and the major male poets
                    because her supposed differences from them are what kept her out of the Romantic
                    canon in the past and, I believe, still prove a stumbling block for many
                    instructors. </p>
               <p>One of the major distinctions commonly made between Austen and the male poets is
                    that her works advocate relationships and community whereas theirs celebrate the
                    isolated self, but Austen’s novels definitely participate in the philosophy of
                    individualism that evolved in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                    centuries, as a result of various developments. These include an increasing
                    emphasis on the subjective nature of reality in response to the empirical,
                    skeptical, and associationist philosophies of mind prevalent in the eighteenth
                    century, according to which each individual’s perception of the external world
                    is unique and no universal values or conceptions may be assumed. In addition,
                    the rise of capitalism and new modes of labor and production broke down
                    traditional feudal and familial ties and encouraged competition and
                    self-reliance, but also alienation from stable relationships and rhythms of
                    life. Protestantism contributed to individualism with its emphasis on
                    self-analysis and a direct personal relationship between each person and God.
                    Finally, the growth of a more democratic and fluid society encouraged personal
                    ambition and the desire to aspire beyond the condition in which one was born.
                    The question of whether Austen was conservative or progressive in her political
                    outlook has been hotly debated, but as Mary Poovey states, even those with
                    conservative sympathies “were influenced during this period by the rhetoric and
                    practices of individualism” (181).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also
                        Thompson 7-8. Other critics who explore the rise of individualism,
                        subjectivity, and privacy in relation to Austen and other Romantic writers
                        include Hart and Swingle.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As several critics have noted, Austen shares with the Romantic poets a new
                    understanding of the self as developmental, evolving over time.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Morgan, “Jane Austen and Romanticism”
                        366-68; Siskin 3, 11-13, and chap. 6. In related but somewhat different
                        terms, Deresiewicz argues that Austen’s last three novels convey a new sense
                        of time similar to Wordsworth’s (28 and passim). Although he doesn’t compare
                        her to the Romantic poets, Thompson notes that “Austen’s narrative presents
                        its major characters as growing or maturing or developing as separate or
                        distinct or different individuals,” and he comments on “The historicity of
                        this life story,” saying “Austen is the first English novelist to portray
                        this myth in a fully fashioned form” (159).</note> All of her novels can be
                    characterized as <foreign>Bildungsroman</foreign>, a genre that developed in
                    the late eighteenth century, which depicts the maturation or coming of age of a
                    unique individual (see Stelzig 1-15). Wordsworth is especially relevant to
                    compare with Austen on this point, as many of his best-known poems—"Tintern
                    Abbey," "Intimations of Immortality," <title level="m">The Prelude</title>—are
                    concerned with the passage from childhood or youth to adulthood, but all of the
                    male poets address this issue in some fashion. Blake’s <title level="m">Songs of
                        Innocence and Experience</title> are concerned with stages of mental
                    development, and Coleridge’s poems depicting a fall from one state to another
                    ("Ancient Mariner," <title level="m">Christabel</title>) can also be read as
                    explorations of psychological evolution. Keats frequently addresses the need to
                    progress through the stages of life from a youthful and sensuous to more
                    intellectual and compassionate, both in his poems and in letters such as those
                    describing life as a “Mansion of Many Apartments” and of life as a “vale of
                    Soul-making” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 1: 280-81, 2: 101-4).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jay Clayton compares Fanny Price’s development
                        to the scheme Keats outlines in his analogy of life as a mansion of many
                        apartments. As Clayton notes, Keats’s pattern of growth is itself indebted
                        to Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Tintern Abbey</title>, and Fanny
                        significantly keeps a transparency of Tintern Abbey in her East room
                        sanctuary (67-72). Deresiewicz offers an extended comparison of Fanny in her
                        East room and <title level="m">Tintern Abbey</title> (56-62). Morgan sees
                        parallels between Emma’s pattern of growth and that outlined in Wordsworth’s
                            <title level="m">Intimations</title> Ode, as well as in Blake’s poems
                            (<title level="m">In the Meantime</title> 44-50). Karl Kroeber employs
                        Blake’s terms to describe the development of central characters in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> when he says that “the heroine
                        progresses from innocence to experience, the hero from experience to
                        redeemed innocence” (292). </note>
               </p>
               <p>Marlon Ross argues that “rituals of maturation” in literature of the Romantic
                    period are “culturally and gender-determined,” so that models of development are
                    starkly different for male and female writers, the latter of whom do not depict
                    a “struggle toward self-discovery” (234). Womanhood during the early nineteenth
                    century “is assumed . . . to be something stable,” and female maturity involves
                    “the agreement not to desire independent individuality” (Ross 159, 161).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> It should be noted that Ross is treating women
                        poets Felicia Hemans and Mary Tighe, rather than female novelists. </note>
                    Although variations can be noted in female and male life stories in Romantic
                    literature, Austen certainly is similar to her male contemporaries in depicting
                    the passage of an individual from immaturity to adulthood, and her heroines also
                    clearly “struggle toward self-discovery” and achieve “independent individuality”
                    in their maturation process. </p>
               <p>On the other hand, some might say that Austen champions maturity whereas many of
                    the male poets celebrate childhood and lament the passage to adulthood (e.g.,
                    Mellor 275, 279), but in truth all of these writers reflect nuance and
                    complexity as they explore the advantages and disadvantages of innocence and
                    experience. Two works that are particularly relevant to compare on the topic of
                    the pros and cons of maturation are <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility
                    </title>and “Tintern Abbey.” Both Marianne Dashwood and
                    the speaker in Wordsworth’s poem go through a similar process of evolving from a
                    passionate state to a more sober one as they relinquish their youthful love for
                    what seemed an all-consuming sublime or heroic presence (Willoughby for Marianne
                    and Nature for Wordsworth), that they come to realize was largely a self-created
                    projection of their own desires. Wordsworth in many ways seems to prefer and
                    yearn for his earlier intense relationship with Nature, just as many readers
                    feel that Marianne’s relationship with Willoughby remains more vital and
                    authentic than that with the flannel-waistcoated Colonel Brandon, whom she
                    marries after acquiring a “more calm and sober judgment” (429) and diminished
                        expectations.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See my “<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> and <title level="m">Tintern
                            Abbey</title>: Growth and Maturation.” </note>
               </p>
               <p>Another way in which Austen’s novels reflect the Romantic period’s focus on
                    individual subjectivity is in their depiction of the heroines’ inner lives. It
                    is commonplace to observe that little significant action occurs in Austen’s
                    fiction; the drama takes place in the internal struggles of her characters.
                    Although the heroines certainly interact with others, their most significant
                    moments—and often the climaxes of the novels—involve solitary meditation. One
                    thinks of Marianne’s serious reconsideration of her conduct during her illness,
                    which she only later confesses to her sister; of Elizabeth’s reflections and
                    self-recriminations after reading Darcy’s letter as she strolls about the
                    grounds of Hunsford; of Emma’s mortified private analyses of her behavior and
                    feelings after Mr. Elton’s proposal, the expedition to Box Hill, and Harriet’s
                    confession of her love for Mr. Knightley; of Catherine’s remorseful hours alone
                    with her own thoughts after Henry learns of her dark suspicions about his
                    father; and of Elinor’s, Fanny’s, and Anne’s many periods of private reflection
                    on past events and probable future outcomes. The latter is the most
                    introspective of all Austen’s heroines: Adela Pinch notes how “Anne is often so
                    occupied with her own rumination and recollection that impressions from the
                    outside seem to have a hard time finding their way in” (152). </p>
               <p>Wordsworth declares that one of the chief characteristics of his <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> is that “the feeling therein developed gives
                    importance to the action and situation, and not the action and situation to the
                    feeling” (448), and in poems such as <title level="a">Hart-Leap Well,</title>
                  <title level="a">Simon Lee,</title> and <title level="a">The Idiot Boy,</title>
                    he confronts the reader’s expectation for some sensational “tale” and announces
                    that instead of plot-driven narratives he tells “simple song[s] for thinking
                    hearts” (<title level="a">Heart-Leap Well</title> 97, 100), where the interest
                    lies in personal responses to experiences of everyday life. In the
                    quintessential Romantic lyric (such as Coleridge’s conversation poems, Percy
                    Shelley’s <title level="a">Ode to the West Wind,</title> and Keats’s odes), a
                    drama unfolds in the speaker’s inner debate as he struggles with a personal
                    conflict and eventually achieves a measure of resolution. In Austen and the
                    Romantic poets, the focus of literature moves from external events to the inner
                    life of the individual.</p>
               <p>Walter Scott noted the revolutionary quality of Austen’s novels when he
                    contrasted the “Big Bow-Wow strain” of his own works, which feature major
                    historical events and provide little psychological depth in their depiction of
                    characters, to her “talent for describing the involvements and feelings and
                    characters of ordinary life” (Southam 106). As the 8<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>
                    edition of <title level="m">The Norton Anthology</title>'s "Introduction to the
                    Romantic Period" notes, Austen’s model proved to be more influential than
                    Scott’s in the history of the novel, which has continued to emphasize “the mind
                    in flux” over action-driven plots (Greenblatt 22). Clifford Siskin argues that
                    both Austen’s novels and Romantic poems reflect a “lyric turn” in literary
                    history, and claims that in Austen we see the beginning of the “lyricization of
                    the novel” (132). Gabrielle Starr, like Siskin, insists that fiction and poetry
                    of the Romantic period share in the same developments and ought to be studied
                    together. According to Starr, Romantic poetry was influenced by the novel, which
                    was the first genre to depict “private experience and the inner world” of
                    middle-class people in domestic settings (7). Whether the Romantic novel was
                    lyricized or Romantic poetry was novelized, both genres reflect the period’s new
                    emphasis on depicting personal thoughts and emotions.</p>
               <p>The fact that Austen’s novels revolve around courtship plots may appear to
                    challenge the claim that her works subscribe to an individualist ethos. However,
                    the very notion that marriage ought to involve love, compatibility between
                    partners, and personal fulfillment is associated with new beliefs in “affective
                    individualism” and the validity of personal happiness (Johnson 90-91; see also
                    77-84). Elizabeth Bennet clearly suggests the association of romantic love with
                    democratic notions of each individual’s right to “the pursuit of happiness” (in
                    the words of the Preamble to the American Declaration of Independence), when she
                    tells Lady Catherine, who wants Elizabeth to promise that she will never marry
                    Darcy, “I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion,
                    constitute my happiness, without reference to <emph>you</emph>, or to any person
                    so wholly unconnected with me” (396). By refusing to acknowledge the superior
                    claim to Darcy of Miss De Bourgh, who was intended as his wife by both Lady
                    Catherine and Darcy’s mother, Elizabeth is branded an “‘Obstinate, headstrong
                    girl’” and an “‘upstart . . . young woman without family, connections, or
                    fortune’” (394-95). Mrs. Bennet makes a similar charge after Elizabeth refuses
                    to marry Mr. Collins on the ground that her “feelings in every respect forbid
                    it” (122). For Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth is a “headstrong foolish girl” who
                    “car[es] no more for [her family] than if we were at York, provided she can have
                    her own way” (123, 126). By insisting on marrying for love instead of for the
                    benefit of her own or her husband’s family, Elizabeth is regarded by those who
                    adhere to a more traditional view of marriage as guilty of the sin of selfish
                    individualism, associated with progressive, “upstart” elements of society. Fanny
                    Price is likewise considered by Sir Thomas to exhibit “wilfulness of temper,
                    self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit, which prevails
                    so much in modern days” when she refuses to accept the socially eligible Henry
                    Crawford on the grounds that she “cannot like him . . . well enough to marry
                    him” (367, 364). The fact that the heroines of Austen’s novels are chosen for
                    their personalities rather than their wealth, beauty, or status also bespeaks
                    the new ethos of the uniqueness and worth of each individual. As Robert Polhemus
                    notes, “the need to be noticed and loved for your own distinctive self”
                    expresses “the passion of modern individualism” (45; see also 31, 54).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See also my “Jane Austen, <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>” 222-23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>One type of romantic relationship common to both Austen’s novels and many
                    Romantic poems (and, in the cases of Wordsworth and Byron, their personal lives)
                    is that involving sibling incest. Both Elinor Dashwood and Emma Woodhouse marry
                    their brothers-in-law. Colonel Brandon finds in Marianne the image of his cousin
                    Eliza, who grew up in his own family like a sister. This pattern in most
                    pronounced in <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, where Fanny Price’s
                    strongest feelings are divided between her brother William and her cousin
                    Edmund, the latter of whom has lived in the same house with her like a brother
                    since she was ten years old. One explanation for the Romantic fascination with
                    incest is that it participates in the age’s celebration of childhood;
                    brother-and-sister bonds are uniquely strong because they are based on shared
                    childhood experiences. According to the empirical philosophy of
                    eighteenth-century thinkers such as John Locke, David Hume, and David Hartley,
                    each individual is born as a blank slate and develops his or her opinions,
                    values, fears, and desires through idiosyncratic personal associations. Siblings
                    are more likely to share personality traits than people who meet later in life
                    because they have the advantage of similar formative experiences and
                    associations (see Richardson 744). Colonel Brandon says of his beloved cousin
                    Eliza, “Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were
                    playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza”
                    (Austen, <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 233). In <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, after describing the happy reunion between
                    Fanny and her brother William, the narrator comments on the way “even the
                    conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal. Children of the same family, the same
                    blood, with the same first associations and habits, have some means of enjoyment
                    in their power, which no subsequent connections can supply” (273).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For further analysis of sibling incest in the

               </p>
               <p>Austen is keenly aware of the errors of selfishness, self-absorption, and
                    detachment from others; indeed, nearly all of her flawed characters suffer from
                    some version of these traits. Such characters include Marianne as well as John
                    and Fanny Dashwood, Sir Walter Eliot, Mary Musgrove, the “bad boys” Wickham,
                    Willoughby, and Henry Crawford, Isabella and John Thorpe, Lydia Bennet, Mrs.
                    Elton and many others, including to some extent Emma Woodhouse and Elizabeth
                    Bennet, the latter of whom like her father initially uses her wit as a defensive
                    technique to distance herself from intimacy with others. But many Romantic poems
                    likewise explore the dark side of individualism, as they depict the dangers and
                    misery of solipsistic isolation. Coleridge’s <title level="m">Rime of the
                        Ancient Mariner</title> is one of the most disturbing poems ever written on
                    the horrors of solitude and the disastrous consequences of self-assertion, and
                    in <title level="m">Dejection</title> the speaker laments his loveless state and
                    attributes to it a loss of imaginative power. Shelley’s <title level="m">Alastor</title> is also a cautionary tale about “The Spirit of Solitude”
                    and the danger of rejecting a proffered human relationship (the Arab Maid) for
                    an illusory ideal. Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Excursion</title> features a
                    misguided character called The Solitary, and in <title level="a">Elegiac
                        Stanzas, Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle, in a Storm</title> the
                    speaker renounces his deluded, youthful conception of nature, which disconnected
                    him from the human community (“Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone, /
                    Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind!” [53-54]). This poem, written in
                    response to John Wordsworth‘s death in a storm at sea, is perhaps an extreme
                    statement of this position, but many of Wordsworth’s most famous poems,
                    including <title level="m">Tintern Abbey</title>, the <title level="m">Intimations</title> Ode, and <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, describe
                    a process of growth in which “Love of Nature Lead[s] to Love of Mankind,” as the
                    title of Book 8 of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> announces.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Laura Dabundo insists that Wordsworth has been
                        mischaracterized as a poet of ego and solitude, and she finds many
                        similarities between his and Austen’s treatment of the value of community
                        (see especially chap. 2). </note> Keats’s odes progressively expose the
                    emptiness and sterility of a timeless, ideal realm among the society of gods and
                    goddesses, which the speaker in <title level="m">Ode to a Nightingale</title>
                    ultimately finds “forlorn” of human companionship (70) and the speaker in <title level="m">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title> rejects as “cold” and “desolate” (45,
                    40). Austen shares her awareness of the dangers of excessive individualism with
                    the male poets. All of these writers explore the advantages and disadvantages,
                    the gains and losses, of their age’s new conception of the unique self.</p>
               <p>As has already been suggested, another major similarity between Austen’s works
                    and those of the male poets is their treatment of commonplace people and
                    settings as fit subjects of literature, written in language close to that of
                    ordinary speech. William Hazlitt famously allied Wordsworth’s celebration of
                    humble life to the French Revolution’s deposition of kings and aristocrats, but
                    as Anne Rowland notes, Hazlitt could just as well have attributed Wordsworth’s
                    embrace of ordinary subjects and language to the influence of the novel
                        (125).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Stuart Tave was one of the first
                        critics to connect Wordsworth’s and Austen’s embrace of common life and
                        simple language (65-67). Hazlitt allies Wordsworth’s poetry and the French
                        Revolution in his lecture “On the Living Poets” (161-62).</note> Or, one
                    could say that both the novel and Romantic lyric poetry reflect the
                    democratizing movement of the time, the shift away from hierarchical to more
                    egalitarian, meritocratic models of society and literature. Both genres could be
                    written and read by men and women outside of the literary elite, without a
                    knowledge of classical languages and traditional conventions of subject matter,
                    style, and diction: the novel in that it depicts contemporary, usually middle
                    class people and their affairs in standard prose, and the lyric poem in that it
                    conveys the personal thoughts and feelings of the individual speaker in language
                    at least close to that “really spoken by men,” in Wordsworth’s phrase (446). </p>
               <p>Wordsworth provides the most obvious parallel to Austen on the adoption of
                    commonplace characters and subjects, but many of the other Romantic poets share
                    in this trait. In <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, for example, Byron
                    contrasts his “pedestrian Muses” to those of poets who deal in the mystical or
                    sublime (<title level="a">Dedication</title> 57). In addition, Byron’s choice of
                    Don Juan for his protagonist, in stark contrast to the heroic figures of
                    previous epics (Canto 1, stanzas 1-5), is similar to Austen’s choice of
                    Catherine Morland as the protagonist of <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title>, a girl who has none of the grandiose virtues, talents, or
                    physical attributes typical of previous novel heroines. Both Byron and Austen
                    present their unconventional leading characters as revolutionary departures from
                    previous literary tradition, in a shift from the heroic, ideal, and implausible
                    to the ordinary, down-to-earth, and natural.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

               <p>Although the depiction of common life is an important characteristic of Romantic
                    literature, the period got its name from its association with romance, involving
                    the remote, exotic, passionate, dark, and mysterious, or even supernatural.
                    Austen’s satire of these Romantic aspects in <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title> and other works might seem to set her apart from the other
                    major writers who defined the era. Austen's treatment of romance is complex,
                    however, as is that of most of the male poets. The happy endings of Austen’s
                    novels involve elements of fantasy and wish-fulfillment, and many critics have
                    argued that <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> actually follows Gothic
                    conventions. The works of the male poets too reflect tensions between romance
                    and reality, the commonplace and the exotic. Byron’s <foreign>oeuvre</foreign> can be divided into the verse romances and the realistic
                    satires (as well as his witty, sociable letters); Keats’s career can largely be
                    defined as a struggle between the attractions of romance and commitment to the
                    mortal world of pain and suffering; Coleridge wrote poems of the supernatural
                    but also the colloquial conversation poems, with their close observation of the
                    natural world; and Wordsworth’s poetry too, despite his condemnation of Gothic
                    sensationalism in the Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (which
                    itself may be compared to Austen’s ridicule of the Gothic in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>), actually includes Gothic figures such as
                    characters who suffer from madness and guilt, and a brooding, mysterious,
                    chastising presence in nature.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On Gothic

                    Exploring conflicts or tensions between romance and reality yields many
                    similarities between Austen’s works and those of the male poets. Two particular
                    works I have compared on this topic are <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title> and Keats’s <title level="m">The Eve of St. Agnes</title>.
                    Both express a criticism of young women who lose touch with reality from their
                    engagement with supernatural tales, but both also participate in the romance
                    they ostensibly satirize (“Jane Austen and John Keats” 99-107). </p>
               <p>Austen traditionally was regarded as an advocate of reason and common sense, in
                    contrast to the male poets who were considered celebrants of the creative
                        imagination.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This point is made by Mellor

                  <title level="m">Emma</title>, <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, and
                        <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> are among the novels that
                    appear to condemn flights of imagination and urge rationality and reliance on
                    empirical evidence in its place. The male poets, however, also frequently treat
                    the dangers of a visionary imagination that can lead one astray and cut one off
                    from connection to flesh-and-blood human beings. Works such as Shelley’s <title level="m">Alastor</title>, Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Elegiac
                        Stanzas</title>, many of Keats’s poems including <title level="m">Ode to a
                        Nightingale</title> and <title level="m">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title>, and
                    Coleridge’s <title level="m">Eolian Harp </title>and <title level="m">Constancy
                        to an Ideal Object</title> convey this cautionary attitude toward the
                    imagination. In his 1813 lecture on <title level="m">Hamlet</title>, Coleridge
                    analyzes the protagonist’s problems in terms that directly recall the errors of
                    Emma Woodhouse and Catherine Morland. Hamlet is said to suffer from an
                    “overbalance of imagination,” so that his mind “is for ever occupied with the
                    world within him, and abstracted from external things: his words give a
                    substance to shadows: and he is dissatisfied with commonplace realities” (<title level="m">Lectures </title>1: 544). </p>
               <p>On the other hand, claims that Austen’s novels unequivocally condemn flights of
                    imagination are undermined by many readings that note ways in which imaginative
                    heroines supposedly rebuked—Catherine, Emma, Marianne—actually engage our
                    sympathies, and a strictly rational perspective is also revealed to be flawed or
                    impossible to maintain. Catherine Morland’s mother is completely devoid of
                    imagination (“Her own family were plain matter-of-fact people” Catherine
                    reflects [Austen, <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> 62]), but she is
                    imperceptive about the nature of her daughter’s unhappiness when she returns
                    from Northanger Abbey suffering from a wounded heart. Elinor Dashwood,
                    supposedly the exemplar of rational common sense, invents fictions when she
                    believes the hair in a ring Edward is wearing must be her own, even though she
                    never gave him a lock, and when she assumes Edward’s mother must be the cause of
                    his coolness toward herself. Rather than oppose the male poets as celebrants of
                    imagination and Austen as an advocate of rationality and empiricism, as with
                    other issues treated above it is more accurate and productive to explore the
                    balance or conflicts between reason and imagination in the works of these
                    writers. As Lucy Newlyn notes, many scholars see a “duality [in] Romanticism,
                    [a] tendency towards ambivalence, irony, and self-critique” (9) rather than a
                    single, confident perspective. William Deresiewicz argues that Austen’s
                    depiction of ambivalent feelings and relationships allies her with the Romantic
                    poets, “for whom ambivalent feelings are their favorite feelings of all”
                    (46).</p>
               <p>Austen’s novels unquestionably convey support for one type of imaginative
                    activity that the male poets also championed: the sympathetic imagination, or
                    the faculty by which individuals project themselves into the thoughts and
                    feelings of others. Percy Shelley claims that “The great instrument of moral
                    good is the imagination” in that it allows one to “put himself in the place of
                    another and of many others” (517). Keats also celebrates this quality, which he
                    calls “disinterestedness” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 2: 79), using a term
                    and concept he adopted from Hazlitt. All of Austen’s vindicated heroines possess
                    this capacity, which often distinguishes them from other, less empathic
                    characters. Elinor Dashwood is sensitive to the needs of others while Marianne
                    remains wrapped up in her own concerns and rudely ignores those around her. In
                    this sense, Elinor is more imaginative than Marianne. Similarly, one can say
                    that Emma does not need to suppress her imagination but shift from one form to
                    another, from a visionary to a sympathetic imagination that is directed toward
                    entering into others’ perspectives.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On this

                    imagination, from an agency that transports us “away from all our troubles”
                    (“I stood tip-toe upon a little hill” 138) to an
                    ideal realm, one that engages us with mortal men and women and the natural world

               </p>
               <p>Another related form of imagination Austen can be said to endorse as the male
                    poets do is the ability to lose herself in her creations. Keats praised the
                    identityless poet of “Negative Capability,” in contrast to the “[W]ordsworthian
                    or egotistical sublime” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 1: 193-94, 386-87).
                    For Keats, Coleridge, and Hazlitt, Shakespeare was the supreme creative genius
                    because of his protean or chameleonic ability to efface his own personality as
                    he entered into his characters. Austen has often been compared to Shakespeare in
                    her ability to create a range of fully realized characters that betray little of
                    the author’s personal identity. Indeed, Austen can be said to exemplify more
                    than any other writer of the period the Romantic ideal of the protean,
                    Shakespearean, Negatively Capable writer.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For

               <p>One of the major traits usually associated with Romantic poetry is a celebration
                    of nature, and Austen’s novels of manners may not appear to participate in her
                    contemporaries’ love of the nonhuman world. A growing body of criticism,
                    however, notes various ways in which nature figures significantly in Austen’s
                    work and allies it in this respect with Romantic poetry. Like Wordsworth she
                    finds cities like London, Bath, and Portsmouth uncongenial and prefers rural
                    villages and country houses, often presenting these as more conducive to moral
                    health than urban spaces. Edmund Bertram in <title level="m">Mansfield Park
                    </title>declares that “We do not look in great cities for our best morality”
                    (108), much as Wordsworth in <title level="m">The Prelude</title> insists that
                    “Love . . . does [not] thrive at ease / Among the close and overcrowded haunts /
                    Of cities, where the human heart is sick” (1850; 13.202-4). As Jonathan Bate
                    states, many of Austen’s heroines such as Fanny Price “read Cowper rather than
                    Wordsworth, but they would be broadly in sympathy with the argument of the
                    preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> that . . . the essential
                    passions of the heart ‘find a better soil’” in the country, where “the passions
                    of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature.” In
                    her support for human communities that are closely integrated with rural life
                    and rhythms of nature, Bate argues, “Austen comes closer to the sensibility of
                    Romanticism than we usually allow her to be” (550).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Bate quotes from "Wordsworth’s Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>" 447. Stuart Tave also notes Austen’s and
                        Wordsworth’s shared aversion to cities and belief that the provinces are
                        “the center of life” (65). He compares <title level="m">Mansfield
                            Park</title> to Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Michael</title>. </note>
               </p>
               <p>In addition, many key scenes in Austen’s novels take place out of doors. This is
                    typically where the hero and heroine finally come to an understanding and reveal
                    their love for one another, when they are free from the constraints of social
                    decorum. This pattern applies in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>,
                        <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, <title level="m">Emma</title>, and
                        <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, and it is especially pronounced in
                        <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>, where Mr. Darcy’s first
                    proposal made indoors is rejected, whereas his second proposal, made while he
                    and Elizabeth are engaged in a long walk in the country, is accepted. Elizabeth
                    first begins to reassess her opinion of Darcy when she reads his letter while
                    walking along a country lane in Hunsford, where she has gone to “indulge herself
                    in air and exercise,” and she gains even greater respect for him when she views
                    his well-managed estate, notable for its “natural beauty . . . so little
                    counteracted by an awkward taste” (<title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>
                    217, 271). For his part, Darcy is also attracted by Elizabeth’s engagements with
                    the natural world. The Bingley sisters disapprove when Elizabeth walks across
                    the muddy countryside to visit her sister at Netherfield Park and when she shows
                    up at Pemberley “brown and coarse” or suntanned from her summer travels (299),
                    but in each situation her outdoor exercise enhances her appeal for Darcy. Alison
                    Sulloway points out that Darcy is uncomfortable among strangers in drawing rooms
                    and more at ease at home in the country, alone or with a few close friends, and
                    this fact, along with his pride and aloofness, allies him with Mr. Rochester in
                    Charlotte Bronte’s <title level="m">Jane Eyre</title>, a character who is
                    usually considered a quintessential Romantic hero (206-7). In addition, as
                    Barbara Seeber notes, some critics have seen in Darcy’s management of Pemberley
                    a type of proto-environmentalism (5). Both Elizabeth and Darcy are allied with
                    nature and this can be seen as one of the major shared values that draws them
                        together.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the importance of the
                        outdoors in <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> see my “Jane
                        Austen, <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>” 222, Curry, and
                        Altomari; all draw parallels to Wordsworth or other Romantic poets. Seeber’s
                        book is devoted to exploring Austen’s engagement with non-human nature, a
                        practice that for Seeber situates her novels within the Romantic movement
                        (6-7). Deresiewicz believes Austen’s last three novels “display a new
                        receptivity to nature” informed by her reading of Romantic poetry (19; see
                        also 20-21, 134-45). </note>
               </p>
               <p>One can of course note many differences between aspects of Austen’s works and
                    those of the male poets. One can also note major differences among the male
                    poets themselves, however, but these distinctions do not prevent them from being
                    studied together as participants in the same historical moment and literary
                    movement. I believe Austen shares as many key traits with the major male poets
                    as each one shares with the others, and that she can be seamlessly integrated
                    into a Romantic period class. Studying Austen in context with the major male
                    poets not only reveals aspects of Austen’s works not traditionally emphasized,
                    it also sheds new light on the male poets’ works and thus helps transform our
                    understanding of the Romantic era.</p>

               <p>Jane Austen was an early entrant to the World Wide Web. One of the best-known and
                    most-visited of all author-based fan sites, <ref target="http://www.pemberley.com">
                     <title level="m">The Republic of
                            Pemberley</title>
                  </ref>, began its online life back in 1996, at a period
                    when “just 20 million American adults had access to the Internet, about as many
                    as subscribe to satellite radio today” (Manjoo).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This statistic is referenced in Farhad Manjoo’s amusing
                        article, “<ref target="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2009/02/jurassic_web.html">Jurassic Web</ref>,” a good refresher (for those
                        of us old enough to remember) or introduction (for those who are not) of
                        what the Internet was like in 1996.</note> The website offers a brief
                    account of its early history, informing us that it began as “a one-horse web
                    bulletin board (message board)” (<title level="m">The Republic of
                        Pemberley</title>). Needless to say, Austen’s web presence—as measured by
                    the hundreds of websites that are devoted to her, both fan-based and academic in
                    orientation—has grown exponentially in the past two decades: a search for “Jane
                    Austen” on Google records 25,800,000 hits.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        While I am wary of placing much evidentiary value on Google hits, it may be
                        worth noting that “Charles Dickens” yields 17,600,000 results.
                        “Shakespeare,” however, as might be expected, garners far more hits than
                        both: 71,800,000 (based on my searches conducted in August, 2013). YouTube
                        alone yields 146,000 results for a “Jane Austen” search, many with hundreds
                        of thousands of views.</note>
               </p>
               <p> The teaching opportunities presented by this mass of web publications are
                    practically inexhaustible; in this short essay, however, I will focus on the
                    open-access, scholarly-edited resource released in 2010 that digitally
                    remediates all extant manuscripts of her fiction, <ref target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/index.html">
                     <title level="m">Jane

                  </ref>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Of course, this site represents just one of a wave of new
                        digital collections and editions devoted (in whole or part) to ancient and
                        modern manuscripts. For a more general discussion of the potential of
                        digitized manuscripts, see Grace Ioppolo’s “Switching on the World of
                        Dramatic Manuscripts” and my essay (with Laura Estill), “Evaluating Digital
                        Remediations of Women’s Manuscripts.” For a recently released
                        Austen-centered digital resource, see Barchas.</note> Of vastly superior
                    quality and far greater accessibility than print facsimiles of her manuscripts,
                    these digitized texts provide students (and scholars) with unprecedented access
                    to high-quality digital surrogates and transcriptions of Austen’s fiction
                    manuscripts. </p>
               <p>Use of this resource can be profitably integrated in upper-division undergraduate
                    and graduate courses. In this essay, I want to consider how <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title> can be used to explore the
                    following three topics: </p>
               <!-- Is this preceding secion an "m" or "s" -->
               <list type="ordered">
                  <item>Austen’s material practices of writing and sharing her fiction, and the
                        different audiences she anticipated for her writing in script and
                        print.</item>
                  <item>Austen’s development as a writer through comparison and analysis of her
                        fiction manuscripts, which represent her writing at every stage of her
                        career (from 1787, when she was twelve, to 1817, the year of her
                        death).</item>
                  <item>The nature of literary archives: what survives and in what form, and the
                        benefits and drawbacks of digitization, with consideration of interface
                        design and screen reading.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the following essay, I will touch upon each of these topics, providing
                    specific examples of ways in which I have used the material in past courses, as
                    well as offering student feedback and suggestions for future use. I should add
                    that most of these strategies have been used in semester-long, upper-division
                    courses devoted to Austen, as well more recently in a course that was structured
                    around the analysis of various Romantic period manuscripts (using additional
                    digital resources),<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In addition to <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title>, students consulted
                        extensively with the following digital archives of manuscript material:

                    introducing the digital surrogates—even in undergraduate surveys—thereby
                    allowing students to begin to take stock of the variety of ways (besides print)

                  <head>The material practices of manuscript culture</head>
                  <p>Most undergraduate students of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
                        literature are afforded little—if any—access to manuscripts from the period.
                        The reasons for this are obvious: manuscripts are rare, unique documents and
                        are almost always held by special or private collections, most of which are
                        not available for viewing by undergraduate students. Until very recently,
                        the only way of reproducing manuscripts for those unable to access them in
                        person was via microform or print facsimiles; assigning an undergraduate
                        class text on microform, for which usually only one copy exists and which
                        must be viewed in the library, presents obvious difficulties, while print
                        facsimiles (the way Austen’s manuscripts have historically been reproduced)
                        are generally too expensive to include on a student reading list, or are out
                        of print.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Even the most recent facsimile
                            of an Austen text, <title level="m">The History of England</title>,
                            published by Algonquin Books in 1993, is now out of print.</note>
                        However, many of our period’s canonical texts were unprinted during the
                        author’s lifetime: Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Prelude</title>;
                        Dorothy Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Journals</title>; Shelley’s “The
                        Masque of Anarchy”; Keats’ poems to Fanny Brawne; and Byron’s “Dedication”
                        to <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, to name just a few. Other works, like
                        Coleridge’s <title level="m">Christabel</title>, circulated for nearly
                        two decades (from 1798 until 1816) in manuscript. But when students
                        encounter theses texts in anthologies, the text’s publication status is
                        usually obscured, and is thus rarely noticed by—or explained to—them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For example in <title level="m">Norton Anthology of English Literature</title>, the most
                            widely used literary anthology in North America, the only reference to
                            composition and publication dates (and any significant gap between them)
                            is typically found only at the end of each textual entry, where the
                            dates are situated. </note> Moreover, most manuscript texts that
                        students are introduced to—and this is certainly true of Austen’s—have been
                        subjected to the normalizing processes of print, in which spelling has been
                        regularized, evidence of revision has been removed, abbreviations expanded,
                        and so on. </p>
                  <p>With the release of new digital manuscript archives, the ability to teach
                        students about the material and social practices of manuscript culture,
                        which continued to operate alongside of print, are now emerging. Indeed,
                        high-resolution digital photography, combined with the storage capacity and
                        ease of transmission enabled by the internet, finally seems to have overcome
                        many of the long-standing difficulties involved in the reproduction of
                        high-quality facsimiles of handwritten documents. Current generation digital
                        photography eclipses anything possible in the bi-tonal worlds of lithography
                        and photography, the main technologies for reproducing handwritten documents
                        during the last century and a half. With <title level="m">Jane Austen’s
                            Fiction Manuscripts</title> we are presented with a resource that was
                        unthinkable even a few years ago: digital surrogates of all the extant
                        fiction manuscripts, which amounts to 1,100 pages of fiction written in
                        Austen’s own hand.</p>
                  <p>A study of Austen’s manuscripts offers occasion for instruction in the
                        period’s material literary culture. Students encountering a digital
                        surrogate of a manuscript such as Austen’s <title level="m">History of
                            England</title> will likely be confronted with a series of new
                        challenges and questions, ones that do not arise when they read the
                        novels—or even the juvenilia—as reproduced in print editions. Unlike most
                        print books, legibility can be an issue with manuscripts. Although the
                            <title level="m">History of England</title> is a fair copy, students may
                        have trouble, at least initially, deciphering Austen’s script. In addition,
                        students can learn about the potential difficulties of attribution and
                        dating in manuscripts (issues that arise far less frequently in print).
                        Nothing in the manuscript of <title level="m">The History of England,
                        </title>for example, plainly indicates that the handwriting and authorship
                        are Austen’s, nor that the watercolor portraits were made by Cassandra
                        Austen. The date of “Saturday Nov. 26th 1791” is presented only on the final
                        page, an unusual placement for those familiar with bibliographical codes
                        derived from modern print. Students will need to learn about how provenance
                        establishes Austen’s authorship and handwriting, and Cassandra’s
                        contributions, and they will also need to be instructed in how questions of
                        dating persist with other fiction manuscripts (such as <title level="m">Lady
                            Susan</title> and <title level="m">The Watsons</title>). </p>
                  <p>One of the ways I begin to engage students with the surviving manuscripts is
                        to have them peruse the <ref target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/manuscripts/index.html">index of
                            Austen’s manuscripts</ref> (a useful exercise <title level="m">before</title> they have begun to read the manuscript texts). Here they
                        find a list of nine manuscripts: (1) the three volumes of juvenilia, <title level="m">Volume the First</title>, <title level="m">Volume the
                            Second</title>, and <title level="m">Volume the Third</title>; (2)
                            <title level="m">Lady Susan</title>; (3) <title level="m">Susan</title>;
                        (4) <title level="m">The Watsons</title>; (5) <title level="m">Persuasion</title>; (6) <title level="m">Sanditon</title>; (7) “Plan of
                        a Novel according to hints from various quarters”; (8) “Opinions of
                        Mansfield Park, Opinions of <title level="m">Emma</title>”; (9) “Profits of
                        my Novels.” Even the more uninformed students will notice something
                        striking: with the exception of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, there
                        are no manuscripts of any of the printed novels. Students might recognize
                            <title level="m">Susan</title> as the early title of <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, but the manuscript is merely a small
                        rectangular scrap, with only the words, <ref target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/facsimile/susan-title/1.html">“Susan. a Novel in Two Volumes”</ref> written on it (<title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title>). This scrap and the
                        cancelled chapter of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> are all that
                        remains of what became the print novels. </p>
                  <p>Initially, the realization that no complete manuscript versions of the print
                        novels survive may come as a disappointment to students, eager to see the
                        development of the novels that they have or will read. However, it is
                        possible to reverse this disappointment by inviting students to consider
                        Austen’s purpose in writing the manuscripts that have survived. Whereas with
                        a printed text, one can usually infer that the author intended it to be read
                        by a (potentially) wide audience, with a manuscript, more detective work is
                        required to discern the intended audience as well as the ways in which it
                        actually circulated. Donald Reiman has usefully categorized modern
                        manuscripts (i.e. those produced in the print era) as private, confidential,
                        or public (65), and with some investigation students will find that Austen’s
                        surviving writing fits all of these categories: her print novels address the
                        public; her juvenilia and fair copy fiction, like <title level="m">Lady
                            Susan</title>, belong to Reiman’s middle category of the confidential;
                        and some of her most biting satires (such as “Plan of the Novel”) and
                        possibly her drafts, shared with only a very select few, align with Reiman’s
                        category of the private. </p>
                  <p>In the <title level="m">History of England</title>, to return to that
                        example, we find Austen addressing her family readers (the story is
                        dedicated to “To Miss Austen, eldest daughter of the Revd. George Austen”),
                        whom she could expect to understand and appreciate her parody of the
                        historical genre and her comic self-deprecation (on the title page, she
                        describes herself as “a partial, prejudiced, &amp; ignorant Historian,” and
                        offers the following note: “NB. There will be very few Dates in this
                        History”). By examining the digital surrogate of <title level="m">The
                            History of England</title> on <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction
                            Manuscripts</title>, students will also see that it appears within a
                        larger manuscript book (<title level="m">Volume the Second</title>), which
                        is itself part of a larger collection of her youthful writing (the three
                        volumes of the juvenilia, <title level="m">Volume the First</title>, <title level="m">Volume the Second</title>, and <title level="m">Volume the
                            Third</title>), which offer additional context for understanding
                        Austen’s social manuscripts. The three volumes themselves reflect Austen’s
                        practices of selecting and copying the juvenile writing that she wished to
                        preserve. Like her letters, these manuscripts offer a point of entry into
                        Austen’s social character; they also offer a glimpse of her as a working
                        writer, something that the finished print novels do not.</p>
                  <p>Another strategy I’ve used to initiate students into the study of Austen’s
                        manuscripts is to ask them to investigate the various physical forms the
                        manuscripts take. Dividing them into small groups, I ask them to complete
                        the following chart (Table 1). This exercise forces them to consider the
                        visual/physical—rather than textual—evidence of the manuscripts. The term
                        “draft” will likely be known to them; “fair copy” may need a brief
                        explanation, but both terms are readily explicable through their own
                        experiences of essay writing (as are complete/incomplete). Through this
                        exercise, students will acquire a basic typology of modern manuscripts,
                        distinguishing between the various categories such as drafts and fair or
                        presentation copies, all of which are exemplified in Austen’s extant
                        manuscripts. Most students will be uncertain about “Catherine” (given the
                        existence of some revisions to the manuscript), will readily recognize
                            <title level="m">Lady Susan</title> as a fair copy, and the remaining
                        three manuscripts as drafts. The question of whether the text is incomplete
                        or not is more difficult based on visual evidence alone, but a quick reading
                        of the final page or two will likely reveal that both <title level="m">The
                            Watsons</title> and <title level="m">Sanditon </title>are unfinished,
                        whereas <title level="m">Lady Susan</title> (with its “Conclusion”) is
                            complete.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For students who have
                            already encountered some of the novels, the study of the “Conclusion” to
                                <title level="m">Lady Susan</title> may open up questions about
                            Austen’s more general difficulty with endings.</note> What students will
                        have gleaned from this short exercise is that (1) several of Austen’s
                        manuscripts were unfinished and abandoned by her (formulating an answer as
                        to why requires a fuller engagement with the text and her biography); and
                        (2) several of her manuscripts are fair copies made for reading by or
                        recital to others, including unfinished works, such as “Catherine, or the
                        Bower.” </p>

                        manuscripts</p>
                  <p>Careful examination of digitized copies of Austen’s manuscripts can help
                        students imagine the ways literature was experienced beyond the printed
                        page—through the exchange and collection of handwritten documents and oral
                        recitation and performance, forms of literary transmission that were a vital
                        part of her domestic experience. The manuscripts establish Austen’s
                        collaborative practices (with Cassandra’s illustrations in <title level="m">The History of England</title>); delineate a circle of readers (through
                        her dedications and other personal allusions); intimate her early desire for
                        print (through the conventions of tables of contents, dedications, indices,
                        pagination); and demonstrate her (and her family’s) pride in the early
                        writing, which was carefully copied and preserved.</p>
                  <p>Once students delve more deeply into the digital archive by reading some of the
                        manuscripts of works ranging across her career, from “Love and Friendship”
                        and <title level="m">The History of England</title> to “Plan of the Novel”
                        and <title level="m">Sanditon</title>, her trenchant social and literary
                        satire becomes apparent. Margaret Anne Doody has noticed Austen’s expressive
                        freedom in the juvenilia, but it applies to later manuscript works as well,
                        in which Austen’s acid tongue finds more room for play than in the print novels.
                        Such differences suggest Austen’s careful discrimination in terms of
                        audience—how she modulated her writing depending on whom she expected to
                        read her works (and how she trusted these readers not to disseminate them
                        further). </p>
                  <p>Jillian Heydt-Stevenson, Colleen A. Sheehan, and most recently Janine Barchas
                        have excavated the ribald, risqué, and private allusions in the print
                        novels, yet Austen appears far less constrained when working within
                        manuscript. Indeed, even within the few surviving manuscripts it may be
                        possible to discern different levels of intended audiences: the bound
                        juvenilia volumes (into which Austen exercised editorial control by not
                        copying all of her extant writing), for example, seem to imply a less
                        circumscribed readership, as the books would likely have been on display or
                        accessible to family members and visitors, whereas the separate sheets of
                        “The Plan of a Novel,” a form which could be more easily secreted, seem to
                        suggest a more limited readership (in keeping with the private digs she
                        directs at the various suppliers of “hints,” including some family members
                        and friends). Considering the manuscripts in relation to at least some of
                        the print novels, which students will likely be reading as well, allows them
                        to explore the ways in which Austen negotiated both her own familial and
                        social circles as well as the public world of print. Many if not most of the
                        authors of the day faced a similar problem with at least some of their
                        texts, whether because they were socially or politically risky. Students are

                  <p>Comparison of Austen’s manuscripts to one another can also provide a starting
                        point for discussions of her compositional processes, as well as her
                        practices of revision, ranging from sentence-level edits to large-scale
                        reworkings of plot (as in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>). Reading
                        Austen in manuscript presents a fuller picture of her authorial range and
                        complexity. Manuscript facsimiles provide students with stark visual
                        evidence of Austen working and reworking her writing, directly contradicting
                        her brother Henry’s assurance in 1818 that “everything came finished from
                        her pen” (141). The transcriptions readily allow students to overcome some
                        of the problems that usually present with deciphering manuscript material,
                        particularly when the hand is difficult to read or there are heavy
                        cancellations and emendations. The manuscripts, taken as a whole, may offer
                        clues as to why it took her so long (over two decades) to break into print.
                            <note place="foot" resp="editors"> A more full argument about the nature
                            of Austen’s struggles, as evident in the manuscript record, has been
                            made in my essay “Austen’s Manuscripts and the Publicity of
                            Print.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of the ways I attempt to explain Austen’s difficulty finding a publisher
                        (a fact that stuns many students) is to return to the chart students
                        previously completed— with additional columns that address pertinent issues
                        of style and narration (see Table 2). My belief is that Austen struggled
                        with several elements of her fiction— with the transition from an epistolary
                        to a narrative style, and the consequent development of the narrative voice;
                        with the fleshing out of her heroines; and with the strong proclivity to
                        satire—and this chart can be used to turn their attention to these issues.
                        Students can work independently or in small groups to complete it, or it
                        could be done together as a class exercise, with time for reflection on the
                        significance of the patterns in reveals.</p>

                        narrative elements</p>
                  <p>The individual manuscripts also reward careful attention for what they can
                        tell us about Austen’s compositional habits. There are several possible
                        pedagogical directions that can be taken. One would be to compare the two
                        cancelled chapters of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> with the final
                        three substituted chapters. This comparison is made easier with the use of
                        <ref target="http://www.juxtacommons.org">Juxta Commons</ref>—an online
                        collation tool that allows for side-by-side comparison of the two versions.
                        The screen shots below (fig. 1 &amp; 2) visualize the differences between
                        the cancelled chapters (on the left) and final chapters (on the right) with
                        the light blue highlighting denoting all changes between the versions. This
                        comparison contrasts the original ending (with Wentworth confronting Anne,
                        at the Admiral’s behest, about rumors of her engagement to Mr. Elliot) to
                        the substituted chapters (as Anne converses with Harville about women’s
                        constancy, and Wentworth overhears). The complete rewriting that Austen does
                        here is apparent in the sea of blue—and the connective bars between the
                        texts allow one to scroll down to see exact points of convergence and
                        divergence in the versions. The heavy rewriting apparent here may be
                        contrasted with the much lighter revisions towards the end of the
                        chapter, as seen in fig. 2.</p>

                  <p>Another approach involves having students use the digitized manuscript page
                        facsimiles and the diplomatic transcriptions to examine various authorial
                        acts of revision within a single manuscript. Significant revisions are
                        apparent in the working drafts of <title level="m">The Watsons</title>,
                            <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, and <title level="m">Sanditon</title>, and I like to begin by asking students to experiment
                        with transcribing a page or two of one of these texts from the manuscript
                        (which they can then check against the diplomatic transcriptions on the
                            site).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Some sites, like <title level="m">

                        nature and effect of revisions by providing them with access to, as it were,
                        Austen’s mind in process. Working with any of these manuscripts also draws
                        out the difficulties in ascertaining the layers of revision and can thus lay
                        bare the reality of these texts as truly “fluid” ones, to use John Bryant’s
                            term.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> John Bryant’s online edition of

                            introduce textual theory. A more extensive discussion is found in his

                  <p>Because this resource does not present a reading text but only diplomatic
                        transcriptions, students have expressed frustration with the reading
                        experience. Used to clean, edited reading texts in print anthologies and
                        student editions, the messiness of manuscripts can come as a shock and
                        induce frustration.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a discussion of
                            the “messiness” of manuscripts, and why this has resulted in many
                            manuscripts (particularly compilations by less known or unknown writers)
                            having been neglected by book and literary historians, see Margaret J.
                            M. Ezell’s essay on “Invisible Books.” </note> One way to acclimatize
                        students to this messiness is by introducing them to John Bryant’s concept
                        of the fluid text, which denies the primacy of a single moment in a text’s
                        genesis and instead endeavors “to edit a literary work in such a way as to
                        showcase revision, versions, and the multiple and shifting moments of
                        intentionality throughout the creative process” (John Bryant, <ref target="http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/melville/intro-editing.xqy">“Editing a Fluid Text”</ref>). In doing so, the editor:
                    <quote>presumes the validity of all moments of revision and requires an editorial
                        approach that can accommodate and, most importantly, render readable the
                        flow of shifting intentions. This new focus on revision requires editors to
                        develop strategies of displaying texts to reflect a work’s textual fluidity;
                        at the same time, readers need new strategies in how to read revision and
                        versions (John Bryant, “Editing a Fluid Text”).</quote>
                    This understanding of textuality is encouraged by reading texts in a variety
                        of forms (such as digitized manuscript facsimiles and diplomatic
                        transcriptions), though as Bryant notes even a diplomatic transcription can
                        hide layers of revisions contained within a single manuscript. While his
                        digital edition of Melville’s <title level="m">Typee</title> begins to
                        untangle these multiple stages of revision, with <title level="m">Jane

                        examined some local sites of revision, will thus be in a position to delve
                        more deeply into the significance of Austen’s writing process. For example,
                        the three pinned additions to <title level="m">The Watsons</title> (which may
                        be seen <ref target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/search/qmwats/b7-7.html?hl=">here</ref>, <ref target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/search/qmwats/b9-2.html?hl=">here</ref>, and <ref target="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/search/qmwats/b10-3.html?hl=">here</ref>; and <title level="m">Later Manuscripts, </title>336-7,
                        353-5, and 369-70) all involve a fleshing out of character by reworking and
                        expanding dialogue—with the substituted <title level="m">Persuasion
                        </title>chapters offering similar examples. I have argued previously that a
                        study of the manuscripts reveals that Austen appears to develop her heroines
                        at a later stage of the compositional process, and these additions provide
                        evidence of this pattern of revision (Levy 1023-25). Her revisions offer
                        intriguing glimpses into her working method and what mattered to her—how she
                        corrects herself to get her facts right, or to develop characters more
                            precisely.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a discussion of the

                  <p>While <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title> invites this
                        kind of careful review of the manuscripts and transcriptions, it does not
                        support more sustained reading, whether of the facsimiles alone or alongside
                        the transcriptions, for a few reasons. Although the editors are
                        “unapologetic in saying that the website contains objects to be used,” as
                        opposed to texts for continuous reading, there is no reason the choice has
                        to be dichotomous (Sutherland and Pierazzo 209). Allowing users to view the
                        diplomatic transcriptions independently, apart from the manuscript pages,
                        could enhance continuous reading. While this wouldn’t prioritize the
                        manuscript to the same extent, it would provide more flexibility for
                        students. Some of these manuscripts are lengthy (<title level="m">Lady Susan
                        </title>is 158 pages; <title level="m">The Watsons </title>is 85 pages; the
                        two cancelled <title level="m">Persuasion</title> chapters are 32 pages;
                            <title level="m">Sanditon</title> is 136 pages), and it is a tedious
                        process to click on each page and wait for it to load (the delay being a
                        function of the high quality of the images, which are being loaded alongside
                        of the transcriptions). In contrast, <ref target="http://www.bl.uk/turning-the-pages/?id=152707d0-a674-11db-a95e-0050c2490048&amp;type=book">The British Library’s virtual edition of Austen’s <title level="m">The

                        would allow a complete text (or portion of it) to be viewed (and saved, and
                        printed) as a pdf. (Of course, this would come at the cost of image quality,
                        but it is a trade off worth making for ease of reading). </p>

                  <p>In the absence of such a function, and given the difficulties of prolonged
                        screen reading, it may be beneficial to assign students a printed text of
                        the manuscript writing. Fortunately, with the release of Broadview’s <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Manuscripts</title> in 2012, there is now a
                        reasonably priced and meticulously edited collection of most of her fiction

                        of having diplomatic transcriptions in addition to reading texts (at
                        present, students have the diplomatic transcriptions online, and reading

                        discussion about how Austen’s texts may have been edited by publishers and
                        printers (as well the changes she made to <title level="m">Sense and

                        hands of the printer, who, at the very least, appears to have normalized
                        Austen’s spelling and introduced paragraph breaks. And students will be

                  <p> Finally, the three short manuscripts (so short they could even be read
                        during class), “Plan of a Novel,” “Opinions of Mansfield Park, Opinions of
                            <title level="m">Emma</title>,” and “Profits of my Novels,” can offer
                        valuable insight into Austen’s self-perceptions as a writer. Together, they
                        paint a portrait of an author eager for material and critical success, but
                        also unwilling to suffer fools. “Plan of a Novel” and “Opinions” in
                        particular offer some of the most prolonged reflections on the writing and
                        the reception of her novels. These manuscripts could be usefully compared to
                        the few other meta-fictional statements we have from Austen—the
                        “Advertisement” to <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> and Chapter 5
                        of that novel; the letter to the publisher Benjamin Crosby dated 9 April
                        1809, under the pseudonym Mrs Ashton Dennis, allowing her to close her
                        letter to “I am Gentlemen &amp;c &amp;c MAD.-” (Le Faye, 182); and the
                        letters to her niece, Anna Lefroy, in 1814-1815 (<title level="m">Later
                            Manuscripts</title>, 214-225)—reflecting the
                        negotiations and compromises that Austen was compelled to make with her
                        readers throughout her life.</p>

                            Manuscripts</title> further provides opportunities to discuss the nature
                        of the surviving archive record, both in its physical form and its most
                        recent virtual incarnation. Students will have already learned that Austen
                        did not keep any of the drafts or fair or press copies of her novels, but
                        why this is the case warrants some consideration. It seems that many
                        novelists of the period did not keep their manuscripts after their novels
                        were printed, though some (including Walter Scott) did (<title level="m">Later Manuscripts</title>, xlv). Why the practices relating to fiction
                        manuscripts are so different than poetic manuscripts, which were often
                        retained, warrants some scrutiny. It is also perhaps surprising that the
                        manuscripts of Austen’s two posthumously published novels (<title level="m">Northanger Abbey </title>and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>) were
                        destroyed, when their value may have been more apparent. </p>
                  <p>The survival and dispersal of Austen’s manuscripts also offers a fascinating
                        narrative of the familial and cultural significance of manuscript artifacts.
                        Dispensed as mementoes by Cassandra to various family members upon her death
                        in 1845, and subsequently, via auction, to public and private collections in
                        the 1920s, the story of the dissemination of Austen’s manuscripts, and their
                        subsequent publication, also invites attention. The way these manuscripts
                        gradually entered the public eye—first with a mention in her nephew’s <title level="m">Memoir</title> of 1870, then incrementally published in
                        expurgated form in the second edition of the <title level="m">Memoir</title>
                        in 1871, and more fully and accurately in the decades that followed—offers
                        yet another strand in the rich reception history of Austen’s manuscripts
                        that could be explored more fully by students in their own research.
                        Students respond with interest (and sometimes indignation) to discovering
                        how disparagingly her juvenilia was treated by her earliest editors—her
                        nephew and later R.W. Chapman—who infamously dismissed all of Austen’s
                        manuscript works as “Minor.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See

                  <p>The remediation of these manuscripts, first in print facsimiles and now in
                        digital form, reflects a long-standing effort to bring them out of the
                        domestic and into the public realm, but the actual manuscripts are still
                        very much under lock and key at various institutions. (A librarian at the
                        British Library informed me that their holdings of Jane Austen’s fiction
                        require the highest level of clearance to access). While students (and
                        indeed most scholars) are unlikely to come into contact with an actual
                        Austen manuscript, they are instinctively aware of the differences, as a
                        three-dimensional object represented on a two dimensional screen, the
                        digital environment necessarily flattens and disables any physical
                        interaction with the original. Videos of Kathryn Sutherland presenting
                        Austen’s manuscripts (produced by the Bodleian and the British Library) help
                        to mitigate the reductive nature of digital remediation by capturing the
                        scale of the manuscripts in relation to the human body, and presenting them
                        in their three-dimensionality (see Online Resources and Tools, below).</p>
                  <p> The affordances of full-color, high-resolution digital images are many, for
                        they can enhance what may be seen with the naked eye, creating in effect “a
                        digital magnifying glass” allowing for inspection of minute details:
                        variations of ink color and line thickness, and even the minutiae of abraded
                        paper and binding thread (Griffin 60). What does this level of detail allow
                        students and scholars to see, and how might these visual cues be meaningful?
                        I have already suggested one of the reasons why variations in ink may be
                        important—to detect different moments in the revision process. Being able to
                        view her hand-made notebooks (in <title level="m">The Watsons</title> and
                            <title level="m">Sanditon</title>), though changed by modern
                        conservation efforts, demonstrates the handiwork that went into her writing.
                        Simply being able to see the paper, ink, and type of support in such detail
                        provides an occasion to teach students about the mechanics of writing in the
                        period (Hurford). </p>
                  <p> Students can also be invited to consider what else they can do with a
                        digital archive. One benefit of the encoded transcriptions is that they
                        enable full-text searching. Students are likely familiar with the benefits
                        of keyword searching of born-digital websites and many digitized printed
                        texts (those that have been subject to Optical Character Recognition [OCR]
                        software and hence are searchable), but this kind of functionality is rarely
                        available with digitized manuscripts, which are not machine readable in the
                        same way as print. The use of search functionality has become such a
                        ubiquitous academic practice for students and researches alike that we
                        rarely scrutinize how and why we use it—and how it differs from the ways in
                        which we search printed material (such as via indices, scanning, and
                        annotation). What kind of research questions can we devise with this
                        capacity to search accurately and in a matter of seconds through hundreds of
                        transcribed manuscript pages? To ask a question that perennially arises in
                        the digital humanities, what is the value added beyond what we can do with
                        the original manuscript or print sources?</p>
                  <p>Students can also be called upon to evaluate how well digital archives are
                        designed for their purposes and become critical users of the technological
                        interfaces they are increasingly being asked to use in our courses. I ask
                        students to identify one aspect of a digital resource that worked well, and
                        one other that didn’t. Collectively, students responded enthusiastically to
                        many features of the site, but they can also be sharply critical, and
                        together have noted the following impediments to usability: no e-table of
                        contents for the juvenilia; no ability to zoom when viewing the diplomatic
                        display alongside of the facsimile; no ability (without opening a separate
                        browser window) to compare manuscripts—a somewhat serious flaw given that
                        one of the aims of the site is to enable “simultaneous ocular comparison of”
                        the physically separated manuscripts; no ability to read the transcriptions
                        alone; no reading texts; no ability to download complete documents; no
                        aligning of facsimile and transcription—scrolling down one does not
                        automatically bring the other with it. Although some of these objections are
                        more minor than others, my own sense is that the site could be better
                        adapted to encourage prolonged reading and facilitate comparisons between
                        manuscripts. </p>
                  <p>An additional limitation of the site, in my view, is that none of the
                        encoding is shared. It would be extremely helpful, for teaching purposes, to
                        provide students with even a brief glimpse of the skilled interpretative
                        work that is required to produce the precise diplomatic transcriptions that
                        are rendered on the site.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Students could
                            also be advised as to how transcriptions of print texts are generated
                            through the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, and the
                            errors that this process introduces. <ref target="http://www.18thconnect.org/typewright">TypeWright</ref> is a crowd-sourcing tool for correcting errors
                            introduced with OCR, and text-version of a document made up of page
                            images.</note> Further, although the site is open-access, it is not “a
                        social edition,” and thus offers no ability to contribute to conversations
                        about, or scholarship on, the text.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                            chief example is <ref target="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Devonshire_Manuscript">
                           <emph>A Social Edition of the</emph> Devonshire MS
                                (BL Add 17,492)</ref>, which aims to “to use existing social media
                            tools to change the role of the scholarly editor from the sole authority
                            on the text to a facilitator who brings traditional and citizen scholars
                            into collaboration through ongoing editorial conversation.”</note> Such
                        opportunities may be important motivators for students, helping them “to
                        take their work more seriously and to increase their engagement” (Norcia
                        105). It is possible for instructors to devise other means (such as class
                        websites) for students to publicize their work, and I have recently
                        experimented with having my advanced undergraduate and graduate students
                        prepare their own digital editions of some of Austen’s manuscript
                            works.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Lindsey Seatter’s edition
                            of “<ref target="http://digitizingliterature.wordpress.com/">The
                                History of England</ref>” and Audrey Ling’s edition of <ref target="http://audreylovesausten.wordpress.com/">“Henry and
                            Eliza,” “Catharine, or the Bower,” and <emph>The Watsons</emph>
                        </ref>. </note> These projects can
                        present their own challenges—intellectual and technical—though I have found
                        my students are keen to experiment with modes of research beyond the essay,
                        including new digital forms of dissemination.</p>
                  <p> Another helpful exercise, if students have been assigned a print edition of
                        the manuscripts such as Broadview’s, is to ask them to compare it to a
                        digital edition. What are the merits/demerits of the way each medium
                        reproduces Austen’s text? Though it styles itself as a digital edition,
                            <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title> is devoid of
                        the editorial apparatus usually found in critical editions (a scholarly
                        apparatus is promised in a forthcoming “print edition” that “will be
                        enhanced by richer annotation, discursive essays on the genesis and
                        composition of the manuscript works.”) In particular, <title level="m">Jane
                            Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts</title> lacks an introduction, and the
                        annotations and contextual material that are found in the Broadview edition.
                        As it stands, what the digital and the print treatments of Austen’s
                        manuscripts offer are bifurcated: one provides reading texts and a critical
                        apparatus; the other diplomatic transcriptions, page images, and detailed
                        descriptions of the manuscripts, as well as discussions of provenance and
                        conservation measures. Students can scrutinize the choices that have been
                        made for each kind of edition, weigh the pros and cons of each, and consider
                        the reasons that may lie behind what is included and omitted from each
                        edition. Recent findings about the limitations of screen reading may mean
                        that this hybrid (print and digital) approach is ideal: students long for
                        and need the deep engagement that it seems only reading paper and ink can
                        provide, and yet they can benefit enormously from access to rare materials
                        that can only be made available digitally.</p>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>I have outlined some of the many directions that teaching Austen’s
                        manuscripts can lead—but the best justification for introducing a selection
                        of her manuscript texts is the pleasure they afford, and the rewards
                        students reap in acquiring a more capacious understanding of her as an
                        author. In reading her manuscripts, we find a writer different from that of
                        the six printed novels, one who is more playfully meta-fictional about
                        writing and contemporary literary genres; more caustically embittered,
                        particularly about the status of women; more penetratingly satirical about
                        the world in which she lived; and more willing to touch directly both on
                        day-to-day life (the extended sequence on the preparation of “Cocoa &amp;
                        Toast” in <title level="m">Sanditon</title> offers one delightful example)
                        and a wider array of social classes.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                            editors of <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Manuscript Works</title>
                            similarly claim that the reading of the manuscripts can “come as quite a
                            shock,” “show[ing] Austen pushing the conventional boundaries of fiction
                            in a way quite at odds with the published novels” (12). So too
                            Sutherland and Pierazzo: <quote>The manuscript evidence therefore
                                represents a different Jane Austen: different in the range of
                                subjects, themes, and narrative experimentation they contain from
                                the novels we know only from print; and different in what they
                                reveal about the workings of her imagination: in particular, what
                                they can tell us of the ebb and flow, the struggle or ease of
                                creation (191).</quote>
                     </note> Investigating the differences between
                        Austen’s appearance in script and print is a worthwhile and fruitful
                        pedagogical endeavor—and for the first time these conversations may be had
                        in our classrooms, with ease and little expense, because of the superb
                        digital and print editions of Austen’s manuscripts that are now available to
                        us. </p>

                     <p rend="noCount"> This article was inspired by the author’s identification
                            of a common problem in the literary classroom: how to allow for
                            subjective reading along with the objective meaning of a work. Alexander
                            engages in a few brief close readings to show how the perception of
                            certain characters in the novel controls a reader’s response to the
                            whole. She argues that teachers must direct their students to certain
                            conclusions from Austen’s text or they will otherwise misguidedly
                            misinterpret them. The article advocates for the importance of teachers
                            showing students <emph>how</emph> to read.</p>

                     <p rend="noCount"> Starting from the global popularity of Austen inside and
                            outside of the classroom, this article argues that her work should be
                            approached cross-culturally, in order to help undergraduates better
                            understand British culture and inspire a greater interest in literature.
                            Amano developed this approach to teaching Austen’s novels with students
                            in Japan who struggled with the text in its original English. In order
                            to help them better understand the text, Amano developed two thematic
                            teaching devices, explored in detail in the article: the picturesque in
                                <title level="m">Northanger Abbey </title>and humor in <title level="m">Emma</title>.</p>

                            novel, using Austen’s <title level="m">Emma</title> and <title level="m">Persuasion </title>to demonstrate the gendered perspective of the
                            texts and how they represent the larger theme of individual perception.
                            The word “handsome” is explored as an example of a word that must be
                            defined in is historical context (“good looking and tall”) in order for
                            Austen’s meaning to become clear. The narrator of such characters’
                            descriptions is also mentioned as a topic worthy of study, because in
                            those two novels, they often “Photoshop” others, to better serve their
                            own appearance. As a result, they are unreliable. Barlow author argues
                            that this is an intentional narrative style that forces the reader to
                            look more closely at the text, both in its immediate location and in
                            relation to the novel as a whole. </p>

                     <p rend="noCount"> Brownstein argues that the phenomenon of developing a
                            personal relationship with Austen and her texts is indicative of how
                            there is more at stake in reading literature than textual
                            interpretation. Austen has been considered the epitome of taste, an
                            identity she consciously constructed and one that is evocative of the
                            personal interpretations many readers bring to her works. This article
                            "examines how taste operates” in both Austen’s narratives and in the
                            personal opinions and lives of her readers: as part of a shared social
                            world that literature invites us to participate in, as told through
                            anecdotes about Brownstein’s class. </p>

                     <p rend="noCount"> This article questions why Austen’s novels (particularly
                                <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>), but not the film
                            adaptations, are considered appropriate reading for men and women.
                            Demory proposes examining this 21<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi>-century
                            phenomenon and how it functions as part of a larger intertextual canon,
                            rather than seeking to measure how faithful the adaptations are to the
                            novels. Breaking <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice
                            </title>adaptations into three strands of a "tapestry," she sets out to
                            determine why the films are gendered as “chick flicks” and what this
                            says about women’s roles today. </p>

                            reading the novel itself. Diana tested this by teaching her introductory
                            English course in two groups, one of which viewed the Academy
                            Award-winning version of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>
                            in its entirety, and the other which only read Austen’s novel. The
                            groups were then reversed. She gathered results from comprehension
                            quizzes, an essay, and a questionnaire, which revealed that those who
                            viewed the film first followed the novel’s plot more closely, were more
                            involved in the story and its characters, and recalled more plot
                            details. Appreciation for Austen’s novel was greater after viewing the
                            movie, and Diana believes that better engagement can be gained from a
                            screening of the film before the text itself is read. </p>

                            to literature. Dryden argues that Austen’s middle class characters often
                            challenge the more wealthy and established families in ways that mirror
                            real life in post–French Revolution England. He documents a new

                            which students investigated the connections between her works and the
                            history of the period, as well as examined closely the allusions to the
                            Napoleonic War, Industrial Revolution and age of Revolution hidden

                            this became a tradition with an expanded guest list, and further
                            promoted the goals of the event: to give a more tangible sensory
                            experience to Austen and early nineteenth-century England. Other themes,
                            such as domesticity and hospitality, gender, masculine privilege, social
                            class, and feminism, were brought up in reflections on these events.

                            country dance in order to better understand Austen’s dance scenes as
                            metaphors and social markers. She sees them more broadly as a method of
                            learning in which readers must use their entire bodies to experience
                            literature. One method of this teaching process involved volunteer
                            students literally standing in for Austen’s heroines in the novels and
                            walking the classroom in a physical representation of how the characters
                            moved around in physical space in the narrative. Easton looked at how
                            those movements could be compared to those in other Austen novels and in
                            the construction of prose in general. </p>

                            the printed text fully, as well as prompting confusion between the plots
                            of the original text and the movie versions. Eggleston’s students
                            ultimately disliked <title level="m">Emma </title>as a novel because

                            it made little overall impact, leaving Eggleston to assert that Austen

                            sit home and read during times of crisis. Favret offers evidence in
                            support of Austen as wartime novelist who helped form modern opinions of
                            war as more than just dates of battles fought and explains how this

                            Austen demonstrates that the lasting effects of past events can

                            status as major female British authors of the nineteenth century who
                            disguised critiques of society within seemingly normative novels.
                            Lescinski says that this theory is heavily dependent on feminist
                            criticism, and she uses <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice,
                                Persuasion, Adam Bede </title>and <title level="m">The Mill on the
                                Floss</title> as her examples. Particular attention is given to the
                            female characters within these novels who appear to bend to societal
                            norms, when in fact they are bringing attention to the injustice of such
                            restraints and making choices in order to survive. </p>

                            thesis statement of sorts, calling on his students to see all prose as
                            rhetorically based. Further examples for classroom analysis include the
                            novel’s first chapter, Mr. Collins's introduction letter, Darcy’s
                            decisive letter to Elizabeth, their first encounter at the ball, and

                            did the money to create them come from?) Austen is useful for this
                            conversation not only because of the great detail in her work, but also
                            due to her acknowledgement of how these spaces confine female

                            later work. A helpful addition to the study of this text is a family and

                            less likeable heroine and titular character. Meihuizen argues that it
                            should be taught for its valuable lesson on perceptions of marriage
                            during the period. Other topics of importance to be emphasized are
                            interference/intervention and deception, which, when joined with the
                            topic of marriage, create a reflective, dense text that is ultimately
                            about Emma’s journey to self-discovery, a journey that the author argues
                            is worthy of study by readers of all genders. </p>

                            this novel to a freshman English class, who largely found the text
                            repulsive. They criticized the characters as snobbish and hypocritical,
                            ignored the still-relevant problem of social status, and found trouble
                            with the plot in general, due to ignorance of the period in which it is
                            set, the author argues. In an attempt to remedy these problems, Morgan
                            engaged the class in defining terms and recognizing how modern society
                            deals with things like wealth and background, although she reports that
                            the best discussion came not from the examination of the novel itself,
                            but rather from the issues it highlights. </p>

                            Austen to female students at an Orthodox Jewish university, describing
                            how the author’s assumptions about teaching gender were challenged and
                            altered by the experience. Initially, the students were nervous to voice
                            their true opinions about <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice,
                            </title>but journal and paper assignments gave Nachumi an insight into
                            their thoughts. She found that many women students identified with
                            Austen’s heroines, because their own culture placed significant
                            importance on courtship and marrying at a young age. The students
                            expressed admiration for Elizabeth Bennet’s ability to remain mentally
                            independent and live within societal norms, proving that literature can
                            inspire readers to examine their own lives more closely. </p>

                            previous generations and that what little is read differs from person to
                            person, unlike the shared reading experiences of previous decades. The
                            author uses a popular book for young readers, <title level="m">Harry

                            from different parts of a novel. Austen functions as the “sensitivity

                     <p rend="noCount"> Sullivan argues that teaching styles must be modified
                            over time in relation to the historical and cultural atmosphere of that
                            moment, meaning that novels must be reread constantly. Doing so will
                            promote the discovery of new interpretations and stimulate innovative
                            techniques with which to view the world. By using feminist and Marxist
                            theorists to explain the ending of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice,
                            </title>the modern reader can better make sense of how an ironic text on
                            romance ends with that very thing. Sullivan therefore moved from
                            teaching Austen’s novel as an education to a deconstructive historical
                            text where money marries love in a reflection of real life relationships
                            at the time where “propriety and property” reign. </p>

                            teach the students not only how Austen’s contemporaries gained status
                            and recognition during their lifetime, but also the importance of wealth
                            and position, as they guided society during the period. It serves to
                            educate students how Austen herself viewed the society in which she
                            lived and the practices and etiquette that shaped her life and others.
                            Materials include The Navy List, draft copies of Austen’s manuscript,

                            portrayal of class in the nineteenth century and is complimented by
                            excerpts from Sir Walter Scott’s praise for Austen’s originality.

                     <p rend="noCount"> This essay details the motivation behind the author’s
                            decision to teach Austen in a small, seminar-type class setting, rather
                            than a lecture format. Students showed such a high interest in the class
                            that the author had to handpick its members. Trilling believes that
                            Austen was appealing to so many young people because she offers a repose
                            from a modern world they feel out of place in, with her genteel
                            visual-based world, and construction of characters to whom they can
                            relate. He draws the conclusion that, despite all of the unfamiliar
                            aspects of the Romantic period and Austen’s world, humanism is what
                            ultimately creates the bond between the modern reader and Austen, an
                            idea expanded upon in this article to include other authors and texts.

                     <p rend="noCount"> Wallace promotes teaching the artistic shift from
                            classical to Romantic in both music and literature through the work of
                            Emily Brontë, Jane Austen, Beethoven and Mozart using concepts of tempo,
                            melody, and rhythm. Wallace discusses his decision to include these
                            artists instead of others, and explains what resources he used to
                            complete the class goals. He also details assignments and reading
                            suggestions garnered from the experience of teaching the course multiple

                     </label>
                     <p rend="noCount"> Watkins suggests that the best way to teach complex
                            characters in a moral philosophy course is through the study of novels,
                            and particularly of <title level="m">Persuasion, </title>for its
                            detailed and complex descriptions. Doing so emphasizes philosophical
                            examples, revealing the text to be one of interdisciplinary ethical
                            engagement. To overcome students' tendency to focus on plot only,
                            Watkins introduced the novel at the end of the class, in order to ensure
                            that the students have had a solid philosophical background from which
                            to draw their analysis, in addition to short readings that accompany the
                            various chapters of Austen’s work. <title level="m">Persuasion
                            </title>serves the ethics class more readily than other Austen novels
                            because of its accessible heroine, lack of distortion of the story by a
                            Hollywood movie version, and emphasis on pride and virtue.</p>

                            learning and self-discovery in moral education become visible. Teaching
                            Austen and Rowling together reveals how both authors focused their plots
                            around one character’s perspective and encourage imagination, and this

                     </label>
                     <p rend="noCount"> Zaal begins with analysis of the sophisticated strategies
                            Austen employs in the main movements of the novel and the character
                            construction of Emma. The essay suggests ways to introduce the text to a
                            modern audience through two key questions: should marriage partners be
                            chosen based on social status, and is it ever okay to conceal one
                            relationship by hiding behind false feelings for someone else? Teachers
                            can gain additional benefits by using the Socratic method, engaging in
                            close reading of the text, and having prepared questions. Zaal also says
                            that Austen’s humor is so intertwined with other subjects in the book
                            that it should not be given separate treatment. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">As part of a fall 2011 honors seminar on Jane and the Austenites,
               my students analyzed various cinematic adapations of Austen's novels.  When
               they viewed a clip involving Alan Rickman, who played Colonel Brandon in Ang
               Lee's production of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1995), they immediately linked the
               actor to his role as Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films.  This
               essay examines how students utilized their knowledge of the Harry Potter
               series and films as a gateway for a close reading of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>.
               Their understanding and affinity for Snape provided a blueprint for unlocking
               Colonel Brandon's emotions, motives, and the way he conducts himself in
               tension-filled situations.

               <p> Jane Austen is one of those rare authors whose novels and life story transcends time
               and a multitude of boundaries. As a clergyman’s daughter, her literary prowess was
               influenced by the dynamics of family and village life. Because she published her
               novels anonymously, only her family and a few friends were aware of her
               accomplishments when she died in 1817. Yet, from the publication of James Edward
               Austen-Leigh’s <title level="m">Memoir of Jane Austen</title> in 1870 to the release
               of the film <title level="m">Becoming Jane</title> in 2007, interest in Jane Austen’s
               life and novels have grown unabatedly. As I was planning my fall 2011 honors seminar
               titled “Jane and the Austenites,” I was unsure how familiar my students would be with
               Austen’s life and work. Besides undertaking a close reading of the novels for the
               insights they provided on marriage, class, finance, genteel society and Regency
               culture, my goal was to examine the development of Austen’s popularity in American
               and British culture and how her life and work had been bifurcated between academic
               scholarship and popular culture. Because this generation of students has such a
               strong visual orientation, a major aspect of the seminar was to analyze the ways in
               which cinematic adaptations of Austen’s novels and life have driven her canonical and
               celebrity status. </p>
               <p> While many of my students had seen <title level="m">Becoming Jane</title> and the
               Keira Knightley version of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> (2005), they
               were unfamiliar with the contributions Colin Firth had made to our understanding of
               Mr. Darcy or with the fact that Emma Thompson had written the screenplay for the Ang
               Lee production of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1995). More
               shocking than the realization that several students had never read a single page of
               Austen’s novels was their reaction to seeing Colonel Brandon’s appearance in the
               cinematic version of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>. When we first
               meet the Colonel, it is his undivided attention to Marianne’s performance, where she
               sings and accompanies herself at the pianoforte, that denotes him as a gentleman and
               a man of deep thought. Yet, my students saw nothing of Brandon’s intellect or
               penetrating reflection. They squealed “Professor Snape!” in delight as though they
               had been re-introduced to a beloved mentor from their childhood. At that moment,
               Austen’s novel had entered the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> paradigm, and we
               had to find a way to link the two characters’ personal histories and motives as a
               means to draw my students’ attention back to Colonel Brandon and <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>. This essay will highlight the various ways in
               which we were able to connect these two disparate characters. It will show how
               utilizing students’ knowledge of Professor Snape and the <title level="m">Harry
                  Potter</title> series gave them easier access to understanding Colonel Brandon’s
               interactions with other characters, as well as his reactions to various events, and
               provided a gateway for close readings of Jane Austen’s novels.</p>
               <p> Students respond so enthusiastically to both Austen and J.K. Rowling’s novels for a
               variety of reasons. On a basic level, when they start reading they get lost in the
               story. They escape into another world which allows them to momentarily forget their
               problems or concerns. Students find themselves on the front line of the action with
               the knowledge that no harm will come their way. The circumstances Austen and
               Rowling’s characters encounter are similar in several ways to what many students
               today experience, as they too have well-meaning parents whose agendas for their
               careers may differ from their own interests. Their family dynamics are also
               comparable: their parents may have very contrasting personalities, they may be raised
               by a single parent, or their siblings may not share their altruistic goals. They
               mingle with the opposite sex at social events where casual conversation may occur
               over dessert, or they might listen to live music together. The threat of
               conflict—whether it be war in a foreign country or acts of terrorism at home—appears
               in both Austen and Rowling’s novels and in their own lives. Several students have
               noted that reading how fictional characters responded to a personal irritation such
               as a gossiping mother, immature siblings, or childhood bullies influenced their own
               reactions to similar situations.</p>
               <p> On an intensely personal level, students are attracted to Austen and Rowling’s
               novels because they identify with specific characters. My female students saw
               themselves in Elizabeth Bennet, Elinor Dashwood, and Anne Elliot. Many wanted to be
               Elizabeth Bennet, and not just because she married Fitzwilliam Darcy. For them,
               Elizabeth was snarky. They acknowledged her judgment errors, but were inspired by her
               determination to stand her ground as she turned down marriage proposals by Mr.
               Collins and Mr. Darcy, or when she defended her integrity and principles to Lady
               Catherine de Bourgh. My male students tended to identify with Mr. Darcy. They admired
               how well he ran his estate, his good standing in Derbyshire, and his ability to see
               through scheming women. While students were inclined to view Mr. Darcy as the
               definition of a gentleman, they were also mesmerized by his and Elizabeth’s banter.
               Many students openly acknowledged that these lively exchanges were what they wanted
               in their own personal relationships. </p>
               <p>My students had grown up reading the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> series,
               and for them the books are cherished friends to whom they continually return. As we
               discussed their attachment to the series, many revealed how they identified with a
               particular character that then helped them deal with whatever issues they faced as
               they were maturing. It might be Harry Potter, whose miserable childhood at the
               Dursley’s taught him how to stand up to bullies, read people’s motives, and empathize
               with others who were facing difficult situations; Luna Lovegood, who always appeared
               to be comfortable in her own skin and reveled in genuine friendships; or Hermione
               Granger, who knew that her critical thinking skills were her greatest asset. After
               all, Viktor Krum, the seeker for the Bulgarian National Quidditch team, had a legion
               of female Hogwarts students following his every move during his participation in the
               Triwizard Tournament, yet he chose to spend his free time in the Hogwarts library so
               he could be near her. </p>
               <p>I understood their affinity for Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna, but Snape—head of
               Slytherin, a reformed Death Eater, and a bitter man who rarely uttered a positive
               word? What did he offer my students? How did his character provide consolation in
               times of need? What did he teach my students about themselves and their world? I was
               perplexed at how Severus Snape with his “greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow
               skin” (<title level="m">Sorcerer’s Stone</title> 126) was synonymous with Colonel
               Brandon, who although being “on the wrong side of five and thirty” had an
               “appearance….[that] was not unpleasing” (<title level="m">Sense &amp;
                  Sensibility</title> 27). Colonel Brandon was unassuming and had a tendency to
               blend into the environment. Although well-liked and respected by all who befriended
               him, he is defined by his gravity, reserve and, to Marianne Dashwood’s disapproval, a
               liking of “flannel waistcoats” (<title level="m">Sense &amp; Sensibility</title>
               30). How could my students possibly see Professor Snape in him? Everything about
               Snape commands attention, whether it is his ability to hold his students’ attention
               in the palm of his hand by speaking “in barely more than a whisper,” (<title level="m">Sorcerer’s Stone</title> 136), possessing eyes that “were cold and
               empty and made you think of dark tunnels” (<title level="m">Sorcerer’s Stone</title>
               136), or by alternating a “very cold voice” (<title level="m">Chamber of
                  Secrets</title> 78) with one that “snapped” (<title level="m">Chamber of
                  Secrets</title> 79), “roared” (<title level="m">Chamber of Secrets</title> 187),
               and even “snarled” (<title level="m">Prisoner of Azkaban</title> 171). Severus is
               not a man to cross even in the best of times. But when we probed deeper at these two
               gentlemen’s countenances, we found much hidden beneath their exteriors.</p>
               <p>Alan Rickman has been celebrated for his masterful depiction of Professor Severus
               Snape in the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> films. He has also garnered
               critical attention in the Austen scholarship for his portrayal of Colonel Brandon in
               the Ang Lee production of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>. In this
               particular role Rickman was noted for “convey[ing] particularly well the saturnine
               melancholy of a man who has been disappointed in love but takes a chance on loving
               again” (Sue Parrill 37). While Penny Gay’s critique of the film focuses on the ways
               in which Rickman’s costumes transform Colonel Brandon “into the image of the romantic
               Byronic hero” and as an ex-military man into something “splendidly virile in his
               red-coated colonel’s dress uniform” (Gay 98), she also concedes that it was Alan
               Rickman “who br[ought] to the role a brooding sexual presence” (106). Cheryl L. Nixon
               is more circumspect when she contrasts the Colonel Brandon that we find in Austen’s
               novel to the one in the Lee production and claims that “the film rema[de] Brandon
               into a standard-bearer of true emotion” (39) Since one of the goals of the seminar
               was to undertake a close reading of Austen’s novels, I wanted my students to focus on
               her command of language and the precision of her word choice. In looking for
               similarities between Colonel Brandon and Professor Snape, I expected them to rely on
               the respective narratives and provide textual evidence for their ideas.</p>
               <p>We began our study of Snape and Brandon by analyzing the factors that make Professor
               Snape’s character the most complex in the series, and the ways in which his
               conflicted emotions drive the narrative at key moments. We talked about his
               never-ending love for his childhood friend Lily Potter, how he was unable to protect
               her from Lord Voldemort, and the grief he suffered at her death. I challenged my
               students to find similar constructions in Colonel Brandon. I asked them to consider
               how the Colonel’s past is similar to Snape’s, and the ways in which Marianne
               Dashwood’s life and actions are similar to that of Harry Potter. My goal was to get
               them to see that the Colonel is also a man of complexity–to make them question what
               was hidden behind his mask. My students needed to probe beyond his veil of silence
               and gravity to understand <emph>why</emph> he is so well-liked and respected by those
               who call him friend and what he has to offer Marianne as a life partner. </p>
               <p>It is the complexity of the two characters—their concern for the well-being of
               others, the passion that hides behind their impenetrable masks, and overall their
               capacity to love—that connects them. Both epitomize the definition of gentlemen in
               their respective worlds, and both suffered a tragic loss that is the defining moment
               in their lives. Snape and Brandon are private men who keep their personal feelings to
               themselves. They teach us to dive deep beneath the surface before we pass judgment on
               their motives and integrity. As Harry continues to doubt Snape’s allegiance to the
               Order of the Phoenix during the second war with Voldemort, Remus Lupin reminds him
               that “Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us”
                  (<title level="m">Half-Blood Prince</title> 332). In the Order’s discussion of
               Snape’s involvement in Dumbledore’s death and their disbelief that he could be
               capable of such a heinous act, Professor McGonagall reveals that “[Dumbledore] always
               hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape…” (<title level="m">Half-Blood Prince</title> 616). That reason—the protection of Harry Potter as he
               grows from infant to adult—was not revealed outside the Order until Harry’s final
               duel with Voldemort. I asked students where they found similar instances of daring
               and bravery in Colonel Brandon. </p>
               <p> Students discussed Colonel Brandon’s reaction to Marianne Dashwood’s musical
               performance where “[h]e paid her only the compliment of attention” (<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 27) and which set his response against the
               over-the-top ones by Sir John and Lady Middleton. His silence was their first clue
               that there is more to Brandon that what meets the eye. Their second clue came during
               Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, and Marianne’s subsequent discussion of the Colonel. Although
               Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor are impressed by him, Marianne complains “[b]ut he talked of
               flannel waistcoats…and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with
               aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
               the feeble” (<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 30). Eileen Sutherland
               reminds us that when Marianne complains about the waistcoat she is actually revealing
               “her naiveté and ignorance of the world” (58). Growing up in a sheltered environment,
               she does not realize that she “should have connected it with danger, endurance, and
               courage…” (Sutherland 58). The disconnect between the clothing accessory and what it
               actually symbolizes leads to further discussion on Colonel Brandon and his time in
               the East Indies. Elinor tells Marianne and Willoughby that the Colonel “has seen a
               great deal of the world; has been abroad; has read, and has a thinking mind” (<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 39). Yet, Marianne only recalls his
               complaints that “the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome” (<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 39). Marianne (and Willoughby) displays
               no understanding of the British government’s concern over a “revival of French power”
               (Roberts 96) or the possibly of a French invasion on English soil. Because the
               Colonel does not talk in detail about his time abroad, we do not know what he
               experienced. Did he perform heroically on the battlefield? Did he watch one of his
               close friends die? Did his experiences abroad lead to his promotion to Colonel? Tim
               Fulford persuasively argues that Austen was more focused on “the contexts of those
               battles and [parliamentary] bills, away from the public arena, in the country as a
               whole” (163). We needed to stop and consider how the Napoleonic wars and the English
               militia’s foreign postings affected village life and those who had valiantly served
               their country. While Willoughby has youth and a certain amount of swagger on his
               side, Brandon is the more formidable man when we consider his credentials and
               experiences. Marianne has to experience her own close encounter with death before she
               can see past Willoughby’s façade.</p>
               <p> Colonel Brandon’s military experiences then led to a comparison of his and Professor
               Snape’s personal integrity. Students recalled that Snape had never been popular when
               he was a student at Hogwarts. He loathed James Potter and his friends Sirius Black
               and Remus Lupin. Even though Potter and Black taunted and publicly humiliated him,
               Snape did not turn his back on Lupin when he truly needed his help. Snape
               successfully concocts the Wolfsbane potion for Remus Lupin every month so that when
               the full moon causes his transformation into a werewolf, he can retain his mental
               faculties and position as teacher of the Defense Against the Dark Arts course—a
               position that Snape openly coveted. As for Colonel Brandon, we considered his
               sensitivity to others in embarrassing or distressing situations. For instance, when
               Mrs. Jennings attempts to discover the identity of the young man who has captured
               Elinor’s heart, the Colonel follows Lady Middleton’s lead in the discussion on the
               weather by adding commentary on the rain and thereby shutting down the enquiry. When
               he hears that Edward Ferrars has been disinherited by his mother because of his
               engagement to Lucy Steele, Brandon attempts to rectify Edward’s financial destitution
               by offering him the modest living at Delaford. Due to the delicacy of the situation
               and his unease at disclosing the reasons why he wants to make this offer, he asks
               that Elinor approach Edward for him. The Colonel tells her that “[t]he cruelty…of
               dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached to each other, is
               terrible—Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing—what she may drive her son
               to” (<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 213). The Colonel does not want
               to see another good man endure pain and misery just because his vocational endeavors
               or romantic liaisons do not meet a parent’s expectations or financial needs.
               Furthermore, Colonel Brandon watches Marianne and Willoughby’s interactions and
               believes, as do others, that they are secretly engaged. After Willoughby coldly ends
               their friendship, and while Colonel Brandon never believes there is a sliver of hope
               of Marianne looking favorably toward him, he visits the Miss Dashwoods regularly
               while they are in London. He tries to ascertain Marianne’s mental and emotional
               states either by watching her demeanor or talking with Elinor. The Colonel shows
               concern for Marianne’s well-being even when he has nothing to gain. </p>
               <p>I want to go back for a moment to my earlier questions regarding my students’
               affinity for Professor Snape. What he offered or taught them about themselves and
               their world involved the ability to love, the luck of finding one’s soul mate as a
               young adult, and the need to honor and respect that love when tragedy strikes. Only
               when it is absolutely necessary do he and Colonel Brandon reveal the reason for their
               silence, gravity, and disconnect. Indeed, the over-arching theme that connects
               Colonel Brandon to Professor Snape is the love and companionship the two men found
               with Eliza and Lily Evans during their childhoods. These two girls were more than
               just their best friends. They were the loves of their lives. Different circumstances
               led both to lose their loves at an early age. At 17, Eliza entered a loveless
               marriage with Colonel Brandon’s older brother as a means to secure financially his
               father’s estate. Severus Snape’s loss of Lily Evans was much more gradual. At age 11,
               both entered Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Although the sorting hat
               placed them in rival houses, Lily tried to maintain her friendship with Severus. This
               was made more difficult by his friendships with soon-to-be Death Eaters and his
               fascination with the Dark Arts. Even though Lily attempted to come to Snape’s aid
               while he was being taunted by James Potter, his calling her a
                  “<foreign>Mudblood</foreign>” was the catalyst for her terminating the friendship
                  (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 675). Snape tried to apologize later,
               but Lily told him in no uncertain terms that “[y]ou’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen
               mine” (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 676). Snape never stops loving
               Lily.</p>
               <p>After Lily Potter’s death, it was Albus Dumbledore who showed Snape the “way forward”
                  (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 678). Lily’s one-year-old son, Harry,
               was the only known wizard to have survived the killing curse. Dumbledore realized
               that when Voldemort returned to power, Harry’s life would be in danger. To ensure
               that Lily had not died in vain, he wanted Snape’s help in protecting the child. He
               secured Snape’s alliance after revealing that Harry “has her eyes, precisely her
               eyes” (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 678). Every time Snape looks Harry
               in the eye he sees Lily. To conceal his concern for Harry’s well-being, he uses his
               loathing of James Potter to create the veneer of contempt and the taunts that follow
               Harry’s every move at Hogwarts. As Snape is dying from the wounds inflicted by
               Nagini, Voldemort’s snake, memories “gushed from his mouth and his ears and his
               eyes…” (<title level="m">Deathly Hallows</title> 657). Snape gives Harry 18
               different memories that involve his mother and which reveal his close friendship with
               her, his attempts to protect her and Harry, his loyalty to Dumbledore, and the role
               he played as a double agent in trying to secure Harry’s safety and the destruction of
               the Dark Lord. It is only in the face of death that Harry discovered the real man and
               uncovered his acts of bravery.</p>
               <p> When we turned our attention to <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, we
               examined the scene between Elinor and Brandon at Mrs. Jennings’s home in London. When
               Marianne is suffering from Willoughby’s rejection, Colonel Brandon tries to ease her
               pain by revealing to Elinor his knowledge of Willoughby’s relationships with other
               women. It is at this point we learn about the Eliza whom he loved and lost, his
               actions in ensuring that she did not die alone or in squalor, her daughter Eliza
               Williams to whom he acts as a dutiful guardian, and how this young woman’s downfall
               came at the hands of Willoughby. Colonel Brandon tells Elinor he reveals this
               information in hopes of providing “lasting conviction to your sister’s mind” (152).
               Yet, Colonel Brandon also concedes that he sees “a very strong resemblance between
               [Eliza and Marianne], as well in mind and person. The same warmth of heart, the same
               eagerness of fancy and spirits” (153). He lays bare the intense pain he and his
               guardian have suffered as a means to contextualize Willoughby’s perfidy and
               Marianne’s escape. When my students started questioning whether the Colonel saw
               Marianne as Marianne or as a substitute Eliza, I knew we were discussing Austen’s
               characters based on their own identity and unique qualities rather than a cinematic
               casting of actors, and that Professor Snape was now allowed to remain off-stage.</p>
               <p> Due to my Jane Austen students’ enthusiasm for the <title level="m">Harry
                  Potter</title> series, I created a new honors seminar on “Harry Potter and the
               Quest for Enlightenment” which debuted in spring 2012. Now that I possess deeper
               knowledge of the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> series, I know <emph>how</emph>
               I could have incorporated my Austen students’ enthusiasm for <title level="m">Harry
                  Potter</title> better into Jane Austen’s novels. </p>
               <p>When we read Austen and Rowling’s texts, we find many instances where characters are
               obsessed with their status in their community. In fearing that her nephew has
               proposed to a woman “of no importance in the world” (<title level="m">Pride and
                  Prejudice</title> 271) Lady Catherine de Bourgh haughtily informs Elizabeth
               Bennet of the irrevocable harm her marriage to Mr. Darcy will bring him and his
               family. She is so focused on their differing stations in life that she does not
               consider the emotional maturation or fortitude that Elizabeth possesses which will
               allow her to act as Mr. Darcy’s partner and not as his trophy wife. On his initial
               train ride to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Draco Malfoy tells Harry
               Potter that “[y]ou’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than
               others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort” (<title level="m">Sorcerer’s Stone</title> 108). Harry had just met Ron Weasley, who comes
               from a close-knit, pure-blood wizarding family and who does not judge others by their
               blood status. If we had focused our discussions more closely on status and class, we
               could have critiqued how misguided ideals adversely affect specific characters’
               actions and the community as a whole. We could have related the Black family’s
               ownership of <title level="m">Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy</title>
                  (<title level="m">Order of the Phoenix</title> 116) to Sir Walter’s constant
               perusal of “the Baronetage” (<title level="m">Persuasion</title> 9). What does their
               preoccupation reveal about their own fears regarding an evolving society? Finally, I
               would have asked my students to analyze women’s lives in Austen and Rowling’s novels.
               What opportunities do Austen’s heroines have to pursue their interests? How does this
               compare to Amelia Bones, who is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement;
               Poppy Pomfrey, who is the Hogwarts school nurse; or Nymphadora Tonks, who is an Auror?
               How do Austen’s female characters make valuable contributions to their families and
               their communities? What do both authors have to say about the importance of
               motherhood? We could have judged Mrs. Dashwood’s attempts to advance Elinor and
               Edward’s courtship and her growing regard for Colonel Brandon to Molly Weasley’s
               affections for her seven children and her ability to kill Bellatrix Lestrange during
               the Battle of Hogwarts after a deadly curse nearly missed striking her only daughter.
               In Austen and Rowling’s novels we find several demonstrations of the extreme lengths
               mothers will go to protect the opportunities and lives of their children. We could
               have charted these actions throughout the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title>
               series and in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> and <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>.</p>
               <p> Utilizing Professor Snape as the lens through which to view Colonel Brandon allowed
               my students to build a foundation upon which to critique characters motives and
               interactions with their peers more succinctly. As they became more familiar with
               Austen’s novels, they were able to offer detailed analyses of specific scenes and
               explain how what was left unsaid may have been more revealing than what was divulged.
               Through their perusal of first-edition Austen novels in our university library’s
               special collections department, several students discussed the thrill of holding
               volume one and reading the opening paragraphs as Austen’s readers had once done. They
               were momentarily transported back into the eighteenth century. Austen’s readers were
               as excited to read her novels as my students were to read the latest installment in
               the <title level="m">Harry Potter</title> series. As teachers we can channel this
               excitement and emphasize the ways in which popular culture holds clues to the canon
               of the future. In 1811, who would have thought that the anonymous author of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> would develop such a strong, devout
               following of fans? In making connections between Austen’s characters, settings, and
               language to that of J.K. Rowling's, we help students understand why novels of earlier
               centuries can retain their appeal in a post-modern world.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay describes a freshman seminar called “Advice about Love
                    and the Literary Narrator.” After touching on <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>’s
                    opening sentence and some consequences of the belief that one can take advice
                    from a fiction or its narrator, I track a version of the course that moves
                    from Ovid’s <title level="m">Amores</title> to Capellanus’s courtly love treatise, Cervantes’s
                    <title level="m">Don Quixote</title>, and the proposal scenes of the eighteenth-century novel. I
                    conclude by showing how a proposal scene in <title level="m">Emma</title> illuminates earlier models
                    of advising.

               <p> Since January 2012, a dozen volumes that claim to purvey Jane Austen’s love
                    counsel have appeared in print. This explosion in the dating manual corner of
                    the Austen market is no boon for morale in college Austen classes. To those
                    students who have absorbed the lesson that literature ought not to serve any
                    practical purpose, the visibility of so many Austen guides to love suggests that
                    Austen’s novels, useful as the book trade proclaims them, must not be
                    literature, or at least not literature of the highest kind. And to any student,
                    there is the embarrassing matter of what Austen is supposed to be useful for. I
                    have been told that in certain college-age circles, it has come to seem widely
                    acknowledged that a single man or woman in possession of Austen’s novels must be
                    in want of—and desperate to find—a romantic partner.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> That this wished-for partner is often assumed to be male
                        whether the reader be woman or man is perhaps connected to Austen’s
                        association with love advice. On the social circumscriptions awaiting the
                        boy who loves Austen, see D. A. Miller, <title level="m">Jane Austen, or the
                            Secret of Style</title>, 1-9. I thank my former student Erin Reeves for
                        alerting me to the alleged desperation of the woman Austen reader. </note>
               </p>
               <p> Austen is, of course, one among legions of literary writers who have either
                    claimed for themselves a love-advisor persona or had such a persona ascribed to
                    them by readers. In a freshman seminar called “Advice about Love and the
                    Literary Narrator,” my students and I examine some of the texts these writers
                    produced. The topic of love advice serves in this course as an occasion for
                    surveying the history of literary criticism, for investigating literary
                    theoretical problems such as the nature of “belief” in fiction, for considering
                    the ways speech acts can establish relations between narrators and readers, and
                    for delving into the particulars of a wide variety of literary texts. The essay
                    that follows will lay out some of the questions the course addresses, sketch the
                    material we cover in the course’s first, pre-Austen half, and finally discuss
                    how we bring that material to bear on one of Austen’s novels most explicitly
                    concerned with love advice, <title level="m">Emma </title>(1815). I will suggest
                    that what makes literary love advice an especially fruitful topic for classroom
                    study is the tension between what it <emph>says</emph> and what it
                        <emph>does</emph>, the interplay—mobilized by Austen with special
                    dexterity—between its constative and performative dimensions.</p>

                  <head>*</head>
                  <p> The topic of love advice has a certain automatic psychological interest
                        quite apart from its relations with literature. Students arrive in class
                        already equipped with a fund of extra-literary experience that informs their
                        answers to such questions as: Why do so many people seem to share the
                        intuition that some elusive rule or piece of information holds the key to
                        love and happiness? Why would anyone ever accept advice about something so
                        private and individual as love? What, if anything, could qualify one to give
                        such counsel? What relations of power or erotic investment between a giver
                        and receiver of love counsel does a given scene of advising imply? </p>
                  <p> Further questions arise when we turn from scenarios involving real persons
                        or fictional characters to ones taking place between narrators of fiction
                        and their readers. Do special constraints or opportunities come into play
                        when the source of advice is a piece of literature? When narrators present
                        themselves as advice-givers to readers, what other kinds of relationships
                        with those readers do they thereby initiate or imply? Can the mixed motives
                        and hidden agendas that so often influence real-world advisors and
                        matchmakers still come into play when the advisor/advisee relation includes
                        only one embodied person? What, on the other hand, do readers mean when they
                        say that they are “in love” with a particular author, book, narrator, or
                        literary character? What does a literary work’s status as object of love
                        contribute to its authority as advisor about love? </p>
                  <p>Is it even possible for a literary narrator or work of art to give a reader
                        advice? Students may be tempted to answer “no” to this last question from a
                        sheer sense of respect for the difference between fiction and fact. After
                        all, if the poet “nothing affirms, and therefore never lieth,” as Sir Philip
                        Sidney claimed in his <title level="m">Defense of Poesy </title>(1595),<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Katherine Duncan-Jones, ed., <title level="m">Sir Philip Sidney</title>, 235.</note> then the poet would
                        seem to abstain altogether from offering readers direction. Indeed, to
                        borrow formulations that first-year college students are more likely to have
                        encountered in their previous studies, if poetry makes “pseudo-statements”
                        rather than verifiable statements (I. A. Richards), if “A poem should not
                        mean / But be” (Archibald Macleish), if to focus on the propositional
                        content of a literary fiction is to miss its (aesthetic) point (Cleanth
                        Brooks), then any reader who attempts to take guidance from a fiction is
                        already misguided.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I. A. Richards, <title level="m">Poetries and Sciences,</title> 59; Archibald Macleish,

                  </p>
                  <p> To be sure, the long chronological sweep of the course helps to deprive this
                        skeptical view of its air of inevitability. As we march through the
                        centuries from Ovid to George Saunders, we have many occasions to notice how
                        dominant has been the Horacian duo “<emph>utile</emph>” and
                            “<emph>dulce</emph>.” Viewed in the context of the many Western
                        commentators who take it for granted that literature should and can be
                        useful as well as sweet, instructive as well as entertaining, the Sidneyan
                        or New Critical insistence on the incommensurability between the claims of
                        fiction and the world of facts seems pedantic. There is also the difficulty
                        of imagining a work of literature that could offer no guidance to anybody. A
                        geographically ignorant reader of Balzac’s <title level="m">Le Père
                            Goriot</title> (1835) would learn from that novel that Paris is the
                        capital of France even if she were resolved not to accept as guidance any of
                        the narrator’s discursive comments. </p>
                  <p> Yet even those modern readers who agree that they can receive instruction
                        from a work of literature may balk at the idea that they can receive
                            <emph>advice </emph>from it. When I ask students how “advice” differs
                        from “instruction,” a speech-act that can, after all, take exactly the same
                        form, they usually decide that an “advisor” guides someone she
                            <emph>knows</emph>, while an “instructor” can guide acquaintances and
                        strangers alike. Unlike “instruction,” “advice” is custom-tailored to the
                        specific circumstances of the addressee. Thus, the distance of time or space
                        separating authors from readers—the fact that authors cannot be personally
                        acquainted with all the readers whom their books may eventually
                        attract—would seem to rule out the transmission of advice from literary text
                        to reader.</p>
                  <p>The fact that readers do think of themselves as taking precisely <emph>advice</emph> from
                        works of literature bears pondering. To examine that peculiar belief, as
                        well as some of the other illusions fiction can create, we draw on Robert
                        Newsom’s book <title level="m">A Likely Story: Probability and Play in
                            Fiction</title>, pursuing several lines of questioning. When I read
                            <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice </title>(1813), is my feeling that
                        Austen’s narrator is my advisor like my feeling that there was once a person
                        called Elizabeth Bennet who talked with Mr. Darcy? Are both feelings, in
                        other words, phenomena deliberately orchestrated long ago by the writer Jane
                        Austen and unlikely ever to fool me into acting as if Austen’s creative
                        product were part of my own world of facts? Or is the credence I give to the
                        notion that Austen’s narrator can advise me more like the credence with
                        which I greet the circumstances of daily life? Perhaps my belief in the
                        narrator’s ability to advise me is stronger than my belief in Elizabeth
                        Bennet’s existence. After all, I myself have supplied real-world particulars
                        to the sentences I take as Austen’s “advice.” Upon encountering, for
                        example, the first sentence of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>,
                        “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
                        a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,” I may think of a single man I
                        know and imagine that Austen’s narrator is offering me personal guidance
                        concerning this man (3). My real-world experience of the man I have in mind
                        informs my sense of the narrator’s advice. Then again, perhaps my experience
                        of real-world women with “light and pleasing” figures similarly informs my
                        sense of Elizabeth Bennet (23). However one decides the question of belief,
                        it seems clear that one way a narrator can foster the illusion that she
                        offers readers custom-built guidance is by inviting their personal
                        applications to her general statements. The result looks like a reciprocal
                        exchange: the narrator sets the topic, the reader thinks of relevant
                        material, and the narrator in turn gives an interpretation of that material. </p>
                  <p>The process does not end there: the novel’s incidents and characters further
                        inflect moments of advice-giving. In <title level="m">Pride and
                            Prejudice</title>, our sole Austen novel in some iterations of the
                        course, we find it fruitful to compare the narrator who speaks the novel’s
                        famous opening sentence with Charlotte Lucas, that cynical inventor of
                        prescriptions for courtship (“In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better
                        shew <emph>more</emph> affection than she feels” [22]); with Mr. Collins,
                        the plodding reciter of such prescriptions (“I am not now to learn that it
                        is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they
                        secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour” [107]); and
                        with Elizabeth Bennet, a disdainful observer of the calculations of each.
                        The opening sentence’s most immediate counterpoint comes, however, from Mrs.
                        Bennet, whose first-chapter airing of her wishes concerning Mr. Bingley’s
                        marriageability reflects back upon the narrator. Inviting us to recognize
                        Mrs. Bennet as Austen’s joking self-portrait, the novel’s opening statement,
                        we find, has borrowed the universalizing impulse of the matron of the Bennet
                        household and dressed up in stately language her wish concerning single men.
                        The labors of Mrs. Bennet to find marriages for her daughters become a
                        facetious representation of Austen’s matchmaking efforts on behalf both of
                        her nubile female characters and of the readers whom her narrator addresses
                        with advice. </p>
                  <p>Thanks to the famous irony of the opening sentence, this alignment between
                        Austen’s narrator and the novel’s foolish would-be matchmaker is decidedly
                        temporary. The first sentence parrots not just Mrs. Bennet herself but Mr.
                        Bennet’s disgruntled parroting of Mrs. Bennet, we suddenly realize. Our
                        double-take anticipates one of the plot’s more unexpected rhymes with the
                        opening sentence, which takes place when Elizabeth catches herself giving
                        voice to her mother’s opportunistic attitude toward Netherfield Park’s
                        occupants, then hastily backtracks with the remark that “perhaps Mr. Bingley
                        did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighborhood as
                        for his own” (178). This playing out in a speech by Elizabeth of two
                        contrary impulses in the opening sentence’s reader suggests one effect of
                        the narrator’s fleeting adoption of the love-advisor persona. In
                        spellbinding cadences that initially seem to draw the reader under the wing
                        of an ideal mentor, then gradually reveal themselves to be an unfriendly
                        mimicry of Mrs. Bennet, the narrator gives the reader the same double
                        experience of unthinking complicity and compensatory revulsion that mark
                        Elizabeth’s response to her mother and to the very idea of courtship that
                        proceeds “by design” (22). The response is not unlike that with which an
                        admirer of Austen’s novels might encounter the love guides of modern
                        Janeism. </p>
                  <p>I have found this kind of inquiry, in which the class compares a narrator’s
                        discourse with episodes in the diegetic realm, helpful throughout the many
                        versions of the course I have taught. In the case of <title level="m">Pride
                            and Prejudice</title>, such comparisons throw into relief the contrast
                        between what the narrator begins by saying about single men and what her
                        words do, namely show us that if we believe what she says, then we will
                        deserve ridicule.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a fuller explanation
                            of the way the first sentence of <title level="m">Pride and

                        Discussing <title level="m">Persuasion </title>(1817), another Austen novel
                        sometimes included in the course, we find many curious points of contact
                        between Anne Elliot’s relationship with books, her interactions with the
                        love-advisor characters—Lady Russell, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Musgrove, Mrs. Croft,
                        even Charles Musgrove—and the narrator’s dry comments about love. Sometimes
                        we begin the course with Ovid’s tale of Pygmalion, in which love crosses the
                        border between art and the real world. We follow this story of a statue that
                        comes alive when kissed with Molière’s play <title level="m">The School for
                            Wives </title>(1662), in which a would-be Pygmalion finds that the woman
                        he has fashioned harbors her own ideas about whom she will kiss; with Henry
                        James’s novel <title level="m">The Awkward Age </title>(1898-1899), in which
                        adults contend for influence over a girl who may already be shaped by books;
                        and with Tommaso Landolfi’s comical story “Gogol’s Wife” (1963), which
                        imagines the Russian author as unhappy husband to an adjustable blow-up
                        doll. The alternative sequence of texts I lay out in the following section
                        is just one of innumerable possibilities. </p>

                  <p>The seminar opens with two intensely entertaining, raunchy books by the Roman
                        poet Ovid: <title level="m">The Amores</title> (c. 15 BCE) and <title level="m">The Art of Love </title>(2-1 BCE). <title level="m">The Art of
                            Love </title>is the more explicit love guide, but <title level="m">The
                            Amores</title> is particularly interesting for the relationships it
                        establishes between its speaker, its reader, and Corinna, the woman whom the
                        speaker professes to love. We begin the class on Ovid by considering one of
                        his obsessive topics, the go-between, whom <title level="m">The
                            Amores</title>’s speaker represents first as a witch-like procuress,
                        then as a lady’s maid, a writing tablet, and the verses of the speaker.
                        Noting that <title level="m">The Amores</title> returns repeatedly to
                        scenarios in which a go-between displaces one of the principals in a love
                        affair, we examine this pattern at work in the opening poem of book 2, in
                        which the speaker declares his intention to act as facilitator of his
                        readers’ love affairs but ends up admitting that he is versifying on his own
                        behalf, for his own erotic benefit. </p>
                  <p>This intimation of author/reader rivalry gets a comical twist near the end of
                            <title level="m">The Amores</title>, when the speaker discovers that he
                        has shot himself in the foot, so to speak, by writing about his beloved. As
                        he laments, “That girl whom the town / Spoke of — till lately — as
                            <emph>mine</emph>, my solitary obsession, / I fear I must now share /
                        With all comers” (160). In Peter Green’s lively translation, Ovid’s speaker
                        wonders, “Could my poems have made her a public figure?” and concludes,
                        “That’s it: <emph>she </emph>was prostituted by <emph>my </emph>art, / And
                        serve me right for trumpeting her beauty abroad! If my darling’s / On the
                        market, it’s all my fault— / I’ve pimped her charms, I’ve marked up the
                        route for lovers, / It was I who let them in at her front door.” Some of the
                        speakers’ readers are now his erotic competitors because they have—with
                        quixotism <foreign>avant le lettre</foreign>—believed the speaker’s
                        assertions about Corinna’s perfections instead of dismissing the praise as
                        “fiction” (161). In this preview of one of the most trumpeted of
                        fiction-reading’s putative dangers—the reader’s inability to distinguish
                        fiction from reality—the figure victimized is not the reader but the author. </p>
                  <p>I enjoy moving from Ovid—so inflammatory yet familiar, who never fails to
                        prompt students’ recollections of rap songs—to the medieval cleric Andreas
                        Capellanus, who often alludes to Ovid but whose treatise <title level="m">The Art of Courtly Love </title>(1184-6) offers a glimpse of a world
                        markedly unlike our own. In answer to the first question I ask in the
                        Capellanus class, “What surprised you in the reading?”, students point to
                        Capellanus’s regimented list of the “four stages of love”: “the giving of
                        hope,” “the granting of a kiss,” “the enjoyment of an embrace,” and “the
                        yielding of the whole person” (42). They note the contrast between
                        Capellanus’s dry, scholastic style and the carnal goal toward which he
                        guides his readers. Pondering the strange idea that by performing
                        miscellaneous good deeds a man could be thought to earn and be owed a
                        woman’s love, students give an airing to the perennial question: does the
                        system of courtly love advance or impede women’s empowerment? By the time we
                        get to Capellanus’s series of dialogues demonstrating how men and women of
                        various social classes ought to debate and, it often seems, bicker with one
                        another—the man seeking to initiate a courtship, the woman refusing, and the
                        man sometimes ending the exchange by announcing in defiance that the woman’s
                        words of rejection have given him hope and thus enabled him to achieve the
                        first stage of love—students are eager to discuss whether and where the
                        treatise writer might be joking. That anyone should refer to a script
                        concerning matters so personal often strikes students as uncanny, but
                        Capellanus presents love as a highly formal endeavor, elaborately codified,
                        full of rules. </p>
                  <p>With <title level="m">Don Quixote</title> (1605, 1615), about a reader
                        deranged in his attempt to follow the rules he has found in literature,
                        Cervantes launches the modern novel by asking whether readers are
                        ever justified in taking pointers from fiction. While <title level="m">The
                            Amores</title>’s speaker takes it for granted that his readers occupy
                        the same space as himself and can consequently steal his girlfriend and
                        subject matter, <title level="m">Don Quixote </title>notices how strange it
                        can be when a figure crosses from the literary realm into the reader’s.
                        Cervantes’s novel questions the premise upon which the act of taking
                        guidance from any work of fiction seems to be predicated, namely that the
                        literary world is continuous and commensurable with the “real” one, that
                        prescriptions found in one can apply to the other. Don Quixote has in mind
                        the rule that if he ever defeats a giant, he ought to send that giant to his
                        lady as a tribute, but he does not meet any giants in his wanderings; he has
                        to content himself with windmills. The disdain so marked in some responses
                        to Janeite advice-seeking starts here, in the wonder and laughter with which
                        we are invited to greet both the absurd content of the counsel that Don
                        Quixote takes from previous genres and his very assumption that a literary
                        source can accurately guide him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Don Quixote </title>also explores advice taken from
                        non-textual sources, as we discover when we turn from the novel’s first
                        fourteen chapters to a later inset story called “The Tale of Inappropriate
                        Curiosity.” In this take-down of male sexual jealousy, Anselmo decides to
                        test his wife’s fidelity, asks his best friend Lothario to try her
                        willingness with flattery and gifts, and finds himself betrayed by his wife
                        and friend, who run away together. Before marrying, Anselmo courted his
                        future spouse by using his advisor Lothario as go-between, but after
                        marriage Anselmo becomes the unwitting go-between connecting his wife and
                        friend. I ask students in what relation the tale stands to the surrounding
                        narrative, and we debate whether Anselmo’s skepticism of his wife’s fidelity
                        might be the counterpart to Don Quixote’s readerly credulity: insane,
                        ruinous in its effects, and apt to shape the world into the form it expects.
                        We try to define Anselmo’s motives for testing his wife and for engaging
                        Lothario’s aid, and we conclude by examining René Girard’s famous model of
                        triangular or mediated desire, which we apply not just to the characters in
                        “The Tale” but to Don Quixote’s reading and to modern-day advertising. </p>
                  <p>The conclusions we have drawn in the first weeks of the course about
                        go-betweens in Ovid, the codification of courtship in Cappelanus, and
                        mediated desire in Cervantes all come into play when we arrive at the
                        eighteenth-century novel. I introduce students to the vehemence of
                        anti-novel sentiment in this period through the handout included in the
                        Appendix to this essay. Examining the handout in class, we observe that some
                        anti-novel warnings, with their visions of female readers misled by novels
                        and falling victim to a kind of textual molestation, seem not just attacks
                        on quixotism but expressions of it. Detractors, we note, often imagined the
                        novel as a pander whose prescriptions for love would link the reader with a
                        seductive fictional character, a corruptive author, or another reader. At
                        this point in the semester, we talk about the female quixotes of the
                        eighteenth-century, those heirs of Don Quixote and ancestors of contemporary
                        Janeites. We read a masterpiece of the French libertine novel, Choderlos de
                        Laclos’s <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> (1782), with its
                        multiple overlapping love triangles and letter writers who destroy the
                        advisees they claim to help. Finally, we consider some of the many scenes in
                        the British novel in which marriage proposals take the form of requests for
                        advice, marriage acceptances the form of counsel. Unlike most of the
                        previous scenes of advising we have encountered, these are dyadic exchanges,
                        with no third-party go-between. Why, we ask, do proposal scenes in Daniel
                        Defoe’s <title level="m">Moll Flanders </title>(1722), Samuel Richardson’s
                            <title level="m">Pamela </title>(1740), and Frances Burney’s <title level="m">Cecelia</title> (1782) insist on this coincidence between
                        declaring love and requesting or dispensing advice?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See, in <title level="m">Moll Flanders</title>, the
                            banker’s proposal and Moll’s response (136–37); in <title level="m">Pamela</title>, the first time Mr. B mentions marriage to Pamela
                            (251–52); and in <title level="m">Cecilia</title>, Mr. Delvile’s request
                            that Cecilia advise him but first qualify herself for offering advice by

                        seminar, for <title level="m">Emma</title>’s culminating proposal scene,
                        which carries on this tradition, suggests an answer. </p>

                  <p> In this scene, <title level="m">Emma</title> brilliantly juxtaposes the
                        dyadic advisory model of the eighteenth-century novel’s proposal scenes with
                        the triangular model we examined earlier in the semester. The slipperiness
                        of the triangular model has been causing trouble, of course, throughout
                        Austen’s novel, for Emma Woodhouse has reprised to unhappy effect some of
                        Ovid’s favorite scenarios in her attempts to make matches for friends and
                        acquaintances. Where she intends to preside over a union between two
                        subordinates, she finds herself mistaken for one of the principals, and
                        where she expects to see a grateful advisee, she finds herself saddled with
                        an unexpected rival. Despite these bad precedents, Emma and Knightley’s best
                        chances for happiness appear to them to hinge, in the lead-up to their love
                        scene, upon further love-triangle rearrangements. Imagining that Emma loves
                        Frank Churchill and is heart-broken at the news of his secret engagement to
                        Jane Fairfax, Knightley visits Emma with the plan to “soothe or counsel” her
                        concerning Frank. Emma, in turn, believes that Knightley seeks her
                        encouragement to proceed with a marriage proposal to Harriet. Knightley and
                        Emma would each gladly become the love guide who forms a new couple with one
                        of the original (putative) principals. </p>
                  <p>However, although both would like to supplant in the affections of an advisee
                        the person concerning whom they plan to offer love counsel,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a more extensive reading of <title level="m">Emma</title>’s proposal scene, see my <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Erotic Advice</title>, 85–90. </note> no supplanting
                        proves necessary, for Emma and Knightley love not Frank and Harriet but one
                        another. Knightley is the first to be released from his misunderstanding.
                        Once Emma has assured him that she does not love Frank, Knightley begins
                        impulsively to “tell you what you will not ask” only to be interrupted with
                        the words “don’t speak it, don’t speak it” from Emma, who, in her eagerness
                        to avoid hearing about Knightley’s love for Harriet, now wishes for the
                        first time to avoid the role of confidante and advisor (429). But Emma
                        relents. She generously invites the man she loves “to ask my opinion of any
                        thing that you may have in contemplation,” and Knightley now submits
                        himself, uncharacteristically, to Emma’s advice. He agrees to “accept your
                        offer” and “refer myself to you as a friend.” The object of his question to
                        Emma, however, is not Harriet, who “was nothing,” but Emma herself: not
                        three parties but two are in question here (430). The erotic triumph of Emma
                        the advisor comes about not because she detaches her advisee’s affections
                        from a third party but because she proves to have monopolized those
                        affections all along. </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Emma</title>’s version of the advice-laden proposal scene
                        contains a clue to its popularity among Austen’s eighteenth-century
                        predecessors. Knightley addresses Emma in the following terms: “Tell me,
                        then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?” (429, 430) Wonderfully, this
                        question keeps the object of Knightley’s love unspecified as ever. It also
                        neglects to pin down the kind of success, namely success in
                            <emph>love</emph>, that Knightley seeks. Although Knightley wants to
                        know whether he will succeed in winning Emma’s hand, his question seems to
                        ask, “Have I no chance of ever succeeding in life?” or “at anything?” and to
                        demand in answer a prediction of similarly broad scope. The vagueness of the
                        query acknowledges that to Knightley’s sense, any resolution of the pressing
                        uncertainties concerning his fate and future will depend upon Emma’s
                        response. To be in love and in doubt of return is to make the beloved an
                        oracle, the keeper of the answer to the burning questions commonly posed to
                        advisors: “Where shall I look for happiness, where shall I live, and what
                        kind of life shall I lead?”, “Will I win the love of the one I love?”, “Will
                        I ever marry at all?” Because practical considerations of all kinds hang
                        upon the success or failure of a given love relation, requests for love—like
                        requests for advice—get answered with implicit predictions. The beloved
                        becomes wrapped up not just in the desire to love and be loved, but in the
                        desire to know the future. </p>
                  <p>The overlap <title level="m">Emma </title>emphasizes between beloved and
                        oracle bears upon the popular image of Austen the advisor. For, of course,
                        Emma does not get to speak her advice to Knightley in phrases the reader can
                        hear. Instead, the narrator summarizes these phrases in her own words. These
                        words appear to offer advice to the female reader about how to respond to a
                        marriage proposal: “What did she say?—Just what she ought, of course. A lady
                        always does.—She said enough to show there need not be despair—and to invite
                        him to say more himself” (431). Like the speaker of <title level="m">The
                            Amores</title>, Austen’s narrator becomes an advising lover to the
                        reader, for her counsel occupies the place of a speech by Emma to Knightley
                        that accepts and declares love even as it advises. The narrator’s
                        Capellanus-like script for courtship brings to fulfillment
                        eighteenth-century fears about the novelist’s demand for the reader’s
                        affection, for even as it <emph>says </emph>how ladies respond to marriage
                        proposals, it performs a love scene between the narrator and the reader.
                        Although Austen’s narrator advises the reader about how to respond to a
                        third party’s proposal, we gather that the third party will not remain in
                        the picture long. After all, the narrator has just shown us a scene in which
                        triangular advising gives way to dyadic advising: the match the advisor
                        makes is her own. Austen’s love-advisor persona is a lover persona as well.
                        Far from desperate for some real-world third-party lover, the Janeite who
                        pauses over Austen’s love counsel may instead be enjoying the solicitations
                        of Austen’s seductive narrator herself.</p>
                  <p>By tracing the literary history of love advice, by linking works of
                        unquestioned excellence and influence not just to Austen but to Austen’s
                        scenes of advising <foreign>per se</foreign>, students come to see that it
                        need be no put-down of Austen to note that her authorial persona often looks
                        like a counsellor to the reader. Having encountered Austen in the context of
                        a didactic tradition marked by the assumption that, far from purpose-free,
                        novels ought to offer readers instruction in the momentous choices they may
                        face, among them whom to marry, students are well-equipped to track the
                        modern permutations of that tradition. Near the end of the semester, we read
                            <title level="m">Miss Lonelyhearts</title> (1933), the short novel by
                        Nathanael West about an advice columnist driven to despair by the
                        intractability of the problems he is asked to address, and George Saunders’s
                        story “Winky” (2000), about a sad sack who attends a self-help convention
                        and risks losing his best feature, his charitable impulse. We think about
                        the place of advice in popular culture—television comedy, fortune cookies,
                        YouTube videos—and appreciate the sheer complexity of advice-giving as a
                        speech act. </p>
                  <p>Instead of attempting to convince students that Austen never sought the
                        advising role with her reader, I invite them to notice the complicated
                        valences of her narrator’s advice: its implicit commentary on established
                        ideas about the role of the author as well as its resonances among Austen’s
                        own plots, the intricate dance by which Austen’s characters develop patterns
                        set in motion by the narrator. Austen’s ability to speak as a bustling Mrs.
                        Bennet at one moment and a sophisticated seducer the next; to give a rule
                        while taking it away, as in the first sentence of <title level="m">Pride and
                            Prejudice</title>; to cast us as Elizabeth Bennets, scornfully brushing
                        off counsel, as quixotes, who would deny any boundary between the novel and
                        the real world, and as Mr. Knightleys, making petitions for guidance that
                        seem like requests for love—all this, students end up agreeing, helps make
                        Austen great. Janeite guidebooks might still inflict a social stigma on
                        Austen-reading students, but the pleasures of Austen’s art deliver abundant
                        compensation.</p>

                        assez décidee pour qu’en l’ouvrant on sût à quoi s’en tenir. Celle qui,
                        malgré ce titre, en osera lire une seule page est une fille perdue; mais
                        qu’elle n’impute point sa perte à ce livre, le mal était fait d’avance.
                        Puisqu’elle a commencé, qu’elle achève de lire: elle n’a plus rien à
                        risquer.” [Never has a chaste girl read novels, and I have given this one a
                        title sufficiently decided that upon opening it one knows what to expect.
                        The girl who, despite this title, dares to read a single page, is lost. But
                        let her not impute her loss to this book. The evil was done in advance.
                        Since she has begun to read, let her finish: she has nothing left to
                        risk.]

               <p rend="noCount">This article argues that Romantic-era children’s literature
                    provides a useful means of introducing first-year students to Austen’s
                    novels. By comparing children's decision-making processes in texts for young
                    readers to the dilemmas faced by novel heroines, students better understand
                    Austen’s era and the stakes of her heroines’ choices.

               <p>[I wish to thank Stephen Behrendt
                    and the members of the 2013 NEH summer seminar on “Reassessing Romanticism”
                    at the University of Nebraska for their helpful comments and suggestions on
                    this essay.]</p>
               <p>Reading and writing about a Jane Austen novel can be quite challenging for
                    first-year composition students, and <title level="m">Emma </title>(1816) is an
                    especially difficult read for those who are unfamiliar with Austen or the
                    Romantic era. Lacking the suspense of <title level="m">Northanger
                        Abbey</title> (1818) or the dramatic accident at the heart of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> (1818), <title level="m">Emma </title>concerns
                    the everyday preoccupations of a spoiled heiress and the village society over
                    which she presides. As Julia Prewitt Brown notes, the novel has “less story and
                    outward moral conflict than the previous Austen novels” and “the climax . . . is
                    an insulting remark spoken at a picnic” (18). The students in my composition
                    courses, most of whom are engineering or business majors, struggle with the
                    novel’s slow pace, as well as the unfamiliar language and class structure that
                    define Highbury society. I have found that assigning a handful of Maria
                    Edgeworth’s stories for children immediately after students read <title level="m">Emma</title> gives them a way into the culture and customs of this
                    baffling world and helps illuminate the stakes of the choices Austen’s
                    characters make. </p>
               <p>Teaching a children’s text alongside a canonical novel like <title level="m">Emma</title> is fairly unusual, in part because Romantic-era children’s
                    literature has long been considered unworthy of serious study. Overviews of
                    children’s literature traditionally described how the drearily didactic books of
                    the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were replaced by the Victorian
                    fantasy texts that ushered in a golden age of children’s literature. Percy Muir,
                    writing in 1954, characterizes the Romantic period’s female writers for children
                    as a “monstrous regiment of women,” noting that, “They had obviously studied the
                    previous output of children’s publishers, and had made up their minds that they
                    could do exactly the same sort of thing, only very much better than it had been
                    done before. Therefore all their books are strongly flavoured with morals”
                    (82-3). Muir’s summary is typical of how critics tended to deride children's
                    writers as amateurs, yet mocked them for studying the literary market. Even
                    thirty years later, Nigel Cross describes writing for children as a popular
                    choice for “the averagely educated but uninspired and inexperienced literary
                    woman” because such writing “required neither genius nor learning, only patience
                    and necessity” (199- 200). Recent monographs and scholarly journals have
                    complicated such accounts by attending to previously ignored Romantic-era texts
                    for children, but these studies often consider children’s literature apart from
                    the canonical works of “adult” authors like Austen.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The journals <title level="j">Children’s Literature</title>
                        and <title level="j">The Children’s Literature Association
                        Quarterly</title>, for example, publish solely on children’s literature, and
                        many articles and books over the past two decades have also been dedicated to the topic.</note> This separation also occurs in the classroom,
                    where students read children’s texts in a single unit or a course dedicated to
                    children’s or young adult literature. While such courses do the important work
                    of bringing neglected literature to the attention of students, isolating
                    children’s texts from their wider literary context risks missing the ways they
                    engaged with the political and social issues of the era. </p>

                    as well as writers for children) entered wholeheartedly into the period’s
                    debates about education and child-rearing, as well as slavery, poverty, and
                        war.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Critics have shown the many ways that
                        children’s literature engages with the social and political issues under
                        debate in the period. Elizabeth A. Dolan, for example, explores how
                        Charlotte Smith’s children’s literature critiques the treatment of the poor,
                        while M.O. Grenby examines how the politics of the French Revolution and the
                        Napoleonic wars emerge in children’s texts. </note> Reading these texts
                    helps students appreciate the richness of the era’s children’s literature and
                    also provides a valuable context for more “canonical” Romantic texts. Although
                    children’s texts have been dismissed because of their simple language and
                    straightforward didacticism, these very qualities offer students an accessible
                    context for the work of a writer like Austen. The relative brevity and
                    simplicity of many children’s texts make them easier for students to digest than
                    a longer novel like <title level="m">Emma</title>. More importantly, by
                    depicting children learning how to interact with members of their
                    communities—including other children, adults, social superiors or inferiors, and
                    even animals—the texts clarify social expectations for students unfamiliar with
                    the era, teaching them these values along with the child protagonists.</p>
               <p>Didactic texts might seem unlikely to attract students, but I have found that the
                    everyday situations and clear moral choices in children’s literature help
                    students who are uncomfortable writing and talking about Romantic-era literature
                    feel authorized to participate in discussions about these dilemmas. In fact,
                    didactic texts work particularly well in the introductory composition or
                    literature classroom because students’ unfamiliarity with hierarchies of “high”
                    and “low” literature, or even of “didactic” as a category, enables them to read
                    with fewer preconceptions about which kinds of texts deserve their attention and
                    which do not.</p>
               <p>Further, reading overtly didactic children’s literature alerts students to the
                    more subtle didactic elements in Austen’s work. Students often perceive Austen’s
                    novels solely as love stories, but reading her work alongside children’s
                    literature reveals that Austen is as concerned with moral behavior as the
                    writers of children’s literature are. The young heroes and heroines of texts for
                    children struggle with the same essential dilemmas that Austen’s characters
                    face. When Rosamond—the child heroine of Edgeworth’s series of children’s
                    stories, first published in <title level="m">The Parent’s Assistant
                    </title>(1796)—must decide between the beautiful purple jar she desires and the
                    sensible shoes she needs, she experiences a miniature version of Marianne
                    Dashwood’s or Elizabeth Bennet’s quandary when choosing between a charming
                    scoundrel and a more appropriate (if initially unappealing) suitor. Of all the
                    Austen heroines, Emma Woodhouse is most like an older version of Edgeworth’s
                    irrepressible Rosamond. Like her younger counterpart, Emma’s mistaken confidence
                    in her ability to read the world around her leads her to make a series of poor
                    choices. Pairing the Rosamond stories with <title level="m">Emma </title>helps
                    students understand the profound consequences of the apparently trivial choices
                    that Emma and others in the novel make. </p>
               <p>Although students in my first-year composition course on “Information Networks”
                    find reading <title level="m">Emma</title> challenging, the novel’s concern with
                    communication of all kinds (especially mistakes and misreadings) helps them
                    think about how their writing participates in information networks in our own
                    era of texting and tweeting. The class, which builds on the previous semester’s
                    writing course, covers a range of time periods and genres, from Austen to
                    Raymond Chandler’s detective novel <title level="m">Farewell, My Lovely</title>
                    (1940) and M.T. Anderson’s dystopian young adult novel <title level="m">Feed</title> (2002). Throughout the semester, students connect these
                    diverse texts by writing about the ways that information networks persist and
                    shift across time and culture. Beginning the course with the enclosed and even
                    claustrophobic information networks of Austen’s Highbury establishes a reference
                    point by which students measure the sprawling information networks of Chandler’s
                    menacing Los Angeles or Anderson’s blighted suburbia. While the characters and
                    cultures in all these texts are very distant from my students’ experience, in
                    some ways the world of <title level="m">Emma </title>strikes them as the
                    strangest, and children’s texts like Edgeworth’s Rosamond stories provide a
                    useful map for navigating it. </p>
               <p>We read <title level="m">Emma</title> in fairly brief segments and discuss them
                    over the course of six fifty-minute class periods. When we finish reading <title level="m">Emma</title>, I assign three of Maria Edgeworth’s stories: “The
                    Purple Jar,” “The Two Plums,” and “The Hyacinths,” all featuring young
                    Rosamond’s adventures. Because students have finished <title level="m">Emma
                    </title>before reading the Rosamond stories, they are able to trace the pattern
                    of Emma’s failed match-making attempts and compare them to Rosamond’s mistakes.
                    Although Edgeworth’s stories can stand independently, each tale builds on the
                    previous one as Rosamond’s experiences guide her new decisions. In each story,
                    Rosamond chooses between an object that will grant her short-lived pleasure and
                    one that will prove more useful in the long term. In “The Purple Jar,” she
                    wastes money on a jar instead of purchasing the new shoes she needs. Rosamond
                    learns from this mistake, and in the story of “The Two Plums” she chooses a
                    useful sewing box over a decorative stone plum. Finally, in “The Hyacinths,” she
                    rejects damaged hyacinth blossoms in favor of roots that will bloom later.</p>
               <p>My students and I spend most of our class time discussing Edgeworth’s most famous
                    story, “The Purple Jar,” which vividly depicts the serious consequences of an
                    impulsive choice. The story opens as seven-year-old Rosamond shops with her
                    mother. She is enchanted by the dazzling objects she sees in the shop windows,
                    particularly a purple jar that she wants to use for a flower vase. Her mother
                    tells her that she will give her money to spend either on the jar or on the new
                    shoes she desperately needs. Rosamond pleads for help making this decision, but
                    her mother only advises her to examine the jar closely before making up her
                    mind. Although Rosamond insists that she does not need to inspect the jar, she
                    still craves her mother’s approval. When her mother asks if she has made a
                    decision, she answers, “Mamma! – yes, – I believe. – If you please – I should
                    like the flower-pot; that is, if you won’t think me very silly, mamma.” Her
                    mother responds, “Why, as to that, I can’t promise you, Rosamond; but, when you
                    are to judge for yourself, you should chuse what will make you the happiest; and
                    then it would not signify who thought you silly, mamma” (117). Rather than
                    interfering in her daughter’s choice or its consequences, Rosamond’s mother
                    allows her to think and talk through the problem on her own.</p>
               <p>The mother’s policy of non-interference extends to her refusal to mitigate the
                    consequences of Rosamond’s choice. When the jar arrives at her home and Rosamond
                    discovers that it is only a clear container filled with a purple liquid, her
                    mother insists that she must abide by her decision and wait another month to buy
                    new shoes. Not only must Rosamond endure the pain of walking in tattered shoes,
                    she is unable to go on an excursion with her father because he refuses to take
                    her in such a “slip-shod” condition (119). Rosamond realizes she has made the
                    wrong decision and declares, “I am sure—no, not quite sure—but, I hope, I shall
                    be wiser another time” (119). My students usually protest that the consequences
                    of Rosamond’s choice seem unduly severe, and their horror or amusement at the
                    mother’s sternness leads to lively class discussion. Although students initially
                    dismiss the mother’s pedagogical method as a harsh and outmoded approach to
                    child-rearing, they begin to complicate this progress narrative as we
                    contextualize her behavior in two ways: looking closely at the adult/child
                    interactions in the story and reading excerpts from contemporary child-rearing
                    texts and literature for children. </p>
               <p>I first ask students to pay attention to the mother’s own explanations of her
                    pedagogical methods. In “The Hyacinths,” for example, she provides a clear
                    explanation of why she refuses to give her daughter explicit guidance: “‘Don’t
                    consult my eyes, Rosamond,’ said her mother, smiling: ‘You shall see nothing in
                    my eyes;’ and her mother turned away her head.—‘Use your own understanding,
                    because you will not always have my eyes to see with’” (146). The mother’s
                    remark hints at inevitable loss; Rosamond must learn to make her own decisions
                    and to abide by their consequences because she will eventually need to function
                    without her mother’s guidance.</p>
               <p>Asking students to read the dialogues between Rosamond and her mother aloud (with
                    one reader taking each part) highlights the contrast between the child’s
                    effusive pleas for affirmation and her mother’s terse replies. Barbara
                    McClintock Folsom likewise suggests having students explore the
                    misunderstandings between Elizabeth and Darcy in<title level="m"> Pride and
                        Prejudice</title> by analyzing their conversations (103). A similar exercise
                    works particularly well with children’s literature because so many of the texts
                    foreground conversation in educational dialogues, rational debates, and
                    passionate arguments.</p>
               <p>As they read dialogue aloud, students begin to see the method behind the mother’s
                    apparent detachment and trace how carefully she shapes her responses. The voices
                    of mother and daughter form an especially vivid contrast in the passage in which
                    Rosamond discovers her mistake about the jar: <quote>
                     <p rend="noCount">“Oh, dear
                            mother!” cried [Rosamond], as soon as she had taken off the top, “but
                            there’s something dark in it—it smells disagreeably—what is it? I didn’t
                            want this black stuff.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “Nor I neither, my dear.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “But what shall I do with it, mamma?”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “That I cannot tell.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “But will be of no use to me, mamma.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “That I can’t help.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “But I must pour it out, and fill the flower-pot with
                            water.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “That’s as you please, my dear.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “Will you lend me a bowl to pour it into, mamma?”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount"> “That was more than I promised you, my dear; but I will
                            lend you a bowl.” (118)</p>
                  </quote> Reading this dialogue aloud
                    highlights its tightly controlled yet flexible structure.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The austerity of Rosamond’s mother had already begun to seem
                        excessively harsh by the Victorian era. Rose, the child protagonist of
                        Louisa May Alcott’s <title level="m">Eight Cousins</title> (1875), whose own
                        name echoes that of Edgeworth’s heroine, declares “‘I always thought it
                        very unfair in her mother not to warn the poor thing a little bit; and she
                        was regularly mean when Rosamond asked for a bowl to put the purple stuff
                        in, and she said, in such a provoking way, ‘I did not agree to lend you a
                        bowl, but I will, my dear.’ Ugh! I always want to shake that hateful woman,
                        though she was a moral mamma’” (186). </note> The mother shapes and guides
                    the exchange, but Rosamond actively questions and participates in the
                    conversation. Performing this passage also provides a glimpse of how Edgeworth’s
                    original readers may have engaged with the text, perhaps as an adult read the
                    dialogue aloud with a child who interrupted to question and clarify.</p>
               <p>After we consider the interactions between Rosamond and her mother, I offer more
                    background on the mother’s pedagogical methods by placing her in the tradition
                    of children’s texts that feature wise female mentors. Some Romantic children’s
                    texts and treatises on education feature male educators, like the tutor of Jean
                    Jacques Rousseau’s <title level="m">Emile</title> (1762) or Mr. Barlow in Thomas
                    Day’s <title level="m">The History of Sandford and Merton</title> (1783), but
                    Mitzi Myers points to the prevalence of female mentors in the era’s children’s
                    literature, noting that these woman-authored texts offer “a new mode of female
                    heroism” that emphasizes “rationality, self-command, and moral autonomy”
                    (“Impeccable” 34). If time allows, I may assign excerpts from children’s texts
                    that feature powerful female mentors, such as Mary Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Original Stories from Real Life</title> (1788) or Charlotte
                    Smith’s <title level="m">Rural Walks </title>(1795). Contrasting Edgeworth’s
                    object-based pedagogy with the moral discourses and community interactions that
                    mentors in the Wollstonecraft and Smith texts facilitate demonstrates the
                    diverse pedagogical approaches included under the umbrella term of “didactic”
                    literature. </p>
               <p>In addition to understanding Rosamond’s mother as part of a tradition of female
                    mentors in children’s literature, students analyze her pedagogical practice in
                    more depth by reading excerpts from contemporary texts on child-rearing, such as
                        <title level="m">Practical Education </title>(1798), which Edgeworth
                    co-wrote with her father Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Students are often quick to
                    dismiss the methods of Rosamond’s mother as an example of oppressive
                    child-rearing practices that have been replaced by enlightened approaches that
                    allow the child more freedom. Learning more about the remarkable degree of
                    self-awareness that <title level="m">Practical Education</title> and the
                    Rosamond stories attribute to children, however, helps complicate this simple
                    progress narrative. The chapter on “Truth,” which cautions parents against
                    guiding children too closely, is particularly useful for understanding the
                    apparent detachment of Rosamond’s mother: “Children are alarmed if they see that
                    you are very anxious and impatient for their answer, they think that they hazard
                    much by their reply; they hesitate, and look eagerly in your face, to discover
                    by your countenance what they ought to think and feel, and what sort of answer
                    you expect” (321-2). The pedagogical methods the Edgeworths describe in <title level="m">Practical Education</title> are not simply meant to wean children
                    from dependence to independence but rather to teach them to be self-reliant yet
                    responsible community members: the same notion of maturity that the Rosamond
                    stories and <title level="m">Emma</title> envision for their heroines. </p>
               <p>Reading excerpts from non-fiction texts about child-rearing alongside books
                    intended for children also gives students a grounding in the ways that the
                    pressing issues of social inequity and slavery intersect with debates about
                    childhood education. <title level="m">Practical Education</title> underscores
                    how the child’s interactions with adults are inevitably shaped by her
                    subordination, noting that, “[T]he hope of conciliating the good will of the
                    powerful beings by whom they are surrounded, is one of the first wishes that
                    appears in the minds of intelligent and affectionate children” (291-2).
                    Edgeworth links the child’s subordination to other kinds of social oppression,
                    arguing that Irish laborers’ apparent deceptiveness derives from a similar wish
                    to please, and that subordination is also responsible for the “propensity to
                    falsehood of the negro slaves” (208, 211). Reading passages like this along with
                    Edgeworth’s ameliorist tale “The Grateful Negro” (1804) helps students identify
                    the ways she draws attention to oppression even as she reinforces the race and
                    class assumptions that underpin such oppression. </p>
               <p>Edgeworth’s stories assert that the child’s apparently trivial decisions matter
                    because they determine the kinds of choices she will make as an adult.
                    Witnessing Rosamond’s decision-making process is meant to train young readers to
                    examine their own options closely, to privilege the useful over the ornamental,
                    and to choose long-term happiness over instant gratification. Mitzi Myers notes
                    the empowering implications of such lessons for girl readers: “[E]ach tale acts
                    to remedy culturally determined female deficiency in independent thinking and
                    affirms that girls can achieve control of their wits and hence in some measure
                    of their own lives” (“Dilemmas” 73). Like Rosamond, Emma is occupied by a series
                    of choices that initially seem unimportant but prove to have profound
                    consequences for her own happiness and the stability of her community. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Emma </title>is filled with everyday objects (like Rosamond’s
                    purple jar and her stone plum) that become significant elements in the larger
                    plot. Like Rosamond, Emma initially misreads objects like Mr. Elton’s charade
                    and Jane Fairfax’s pianoforte: she interprets the charade as a sign of Mr.
                    Elton’s attachment to Harriet although it is really a message meant for her, and
                    she reads the mysterious pianoforte as proof of Jane’s involvement with Mr.
                    Dixon, unaware that it is a present from Frank Churchill. Like Rosamond refusing
                    to examine the purple jar before buying it, Emma fails to scrutinize the
                    evidence before coming to a conclusion. When she finally realizes that Mr. Elton
                    meant to pay his addresses to her rather than Harriet, Emma admits that her
                    desires have twisted the evidence: “She had taken up the idea, she supposed, and
                    made everything bend to it” (95). Emma resolves to learn from her misreading of
                    Mr. Elton’s intentions much as Rosamond declares her “hope” that she will make a
                    better choice next time: <quote>It was foolish, it was wrong, to take so active
                        a part in bringing any two people together. It was adventuring too far,
                        assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious—a trick of what
                        ought to be simple. She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do
                        such things no more. (97)</quote> In spite of this determination, however,
                    Emma soon proceeds with her plans to pair Harriet with Frank Churchill, a match
                    that is also doomed to fail. Emma repeats the same mistakes in part because she
                    does not see herself as a Rosamond figure in need of education, but rather as a
                    mentor figure like Rosamond’s mother.</p>
               <p>Reading children’s texts that depict powerful female mentors helps students
                    understand why Emma wishes to take on this kind of authority, especially at a
                    time when few avenues of exerting social power were available to women, even
                    those of her privileged station. Emma’s appropriation of the mentor role is most
                    obvious in her interactions with Harriet Smith, whom she casts in the role of
                    the child in need of instruction. Harriet, in Mr. Knightley’s words, “‘is the
                    natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at
                    all, and certainly no respectable relations’” (45). Reading the dialogue between
                    Emma and Harriet in light of the passage from <title level="m">Practical
                        Education</title> that describes children’s desire to please “powerful
                    beings” shows how the unequal power balance between Emma and Harriet dictates
                    the form and content of their conversation. As <title level="m">Practical
                        Education</title> suggests, while Harriet’s need for affirmation may
                    certainly be evidence of her naïveté, her inferior social status predisposes her
                    to value Emma’s opinion over her own in the same way that Rosamond craves her
                    mother’s approval. </p>
               <p>Emma’s appropriation of the wise mentor role becomes comically evident in the
                    passage in which she and Harriet discuss Robert Martin’s proposal letter. My
                    students and I return to this passage after reading the Rosamond stories; I ask
                    two students to read the dialogue aloud, while a third reads the narrator’s
                    lines. As when reading the passage from “The Purple Jar,” performing this
                    dialogue aloud draws attention to the marked contrast between Harriet’s appeals
                    for affirmation and Emma’s attempts to withhold advice: <quote>
                     <p rend="noCount">“What would you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss
                            Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have
                            nothing to do with it. This is a point which you must settle with your
                            own feelings . . . I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a
                            woman <emph>doubts</emph> as to whether she should accept a man or not,
                            she certainly ought to refuse him . . . I thought it my duty as a
                            friend, and older than yourself, to say this much to you. But do not
                            imagine that I want to influence you.”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">“Oh, no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if
                            you would just advise me what I had best do—no, no, I do not mean
                            that—as you say, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—one should not be
                            hesitating—it is a very serious thing. It will be safer to say ‘No,’
                            perhaps. Do you think I had better say ‘No’?”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would
                            I advise you either way. You must be the best judge of your own
                            happiness.” (38-9)</p>
                  </quote> Because they have already analyzed the dialogue between Rosamond and
                    her mother, my students quickly notice how Emma mimics an ideal mentor’s
                    detachment even as she subtly manipulates Harriet’s decision-making. This
                    passage can even be read as a critique of the pedagogical method Edgeworth
                    advocates because it demonstrates how easily the more powerful person can
                    dominate such interactions.</p>
               <p>While I usually teach only a single Austen novel in a first-year composition
                    course, pairing the Rosamond stories with additional Austen novels in a
                    literature survey or a dedicated Austen course would help students identify
                    further connections between both sets of texts. Reading <title level="m">Persuasion</title> along with the Rosamond stories, for example, frames
                    Anne Elliot’s initial refusal to marry Captain Wentworth as the kind of choice
                    that Rosamond learns to make, one that values practical considerations over
                    ephemeral desires. Yet Anne’s unhappiness after the broken engagement points to
                    the problems with relying too closely on the advice of her mentor Lady Russell.
                    She even seems to unlearn some of the lessons Rosamond dutifully digests; Anne
                    “had been forced into prudence in her youth,” but “learned romance as she grew
                    older—the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning” (58). While <title level="m">Persuasion</title> seems to critique the model of development the Rosamond
                    stories advocate, the novel complicates rather than counters the message of
                    Edgeworth’s stories by disrupting a narrative of simple growth from youth to
                    maturity.</p>
               <p>Edgeworth’s tales provide an especially appealing introduction to Romantic
                    children’s literature and they pair well with most of Austen’s novels, but
                    reading other contemporary children’s texts can also help students grasp the
                    Romantic period’s conceptions of childhood and education. As I have described,
                    texts by Smith and Wollstonecraft help establish the importance of female
                    mentors in this literature, and other children’s texts help illuminate key ideas
                    about education in the Romantic era as well as nature and the Gothic. Simple
                    comparisons between an Austen novel and a children’s text reveal the broad
                    didactic structure of Austen’s work. When teaching <title level="m">Sense and
                        Sensibility</title> (1811), for example, I might ask students to compare the
                    novel to one of the many children’s texts that feature wise/foolish sister
                    pairs, from early folk tales to Harriet Martineau’s <title level="m">Five Years
                        of Youth; or, Sense and Sentiment</title> (1831), showing how Austen’s
                    account of the Dashwood sisters draws on childhood stories about the competing
                    demands of prudence and romance.</p>
               <p>Discussions of <title level="m">Mansfield Park </title>(1814), with its emphasis
                    on the far-reaching repercussions of early education, benefit even more from the
                    kinds of contextualization children’s texts offer, given that students may find
                    the novel’s relatively static plot even more challenging than <title level="m">Emma</title>. The contrast between the education of the Bertram sisters and
                    their cousin Fanny Price foreshadows the choices they will make as women. The
                    Bertrams can “[R]epeat the chronological order of the kings of England, with the
                    dates of their accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns … and
                    of the Roman emperors as low as Severus; besides a great deal of the Heathen
                    Mythology, and all the Metals, Semi-Metals, Planets, and distinguished
                    philosophers,” while Fanny “cannot put the map of Europe together … cannot tell
                    the principal rivers in Russia … she never heard of Asia Minor … she does not
                    know the difference between water-colours and crayons!” (54-5). Fanny, of
                    course, possesses “the less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity,
                    and humility” that the Bertrams lack, and her subsequent happiness is a reward
                    for exercising these qualities (55). In spite of these admirable attributes,
                    Fanny is often considered the least likeable of Austen’s heroines. In contrast
                    to the witty Elizabeth or the endearingly conceited Emma, she is something of a
                    cipher; children’s literature provides a helpful context for understanding her
                    character. </p>
               <p>In the early sections of the novel, Fanny is a mute witness of everyone else’s
                    folly. During the haphazard tour of Mr. Rushworth’s estate, she waits patiently
                    on a bench while the other characters pass before her in a kind of panorama of
                    petulance and selfishness. In this and similar scenes, Fanny resembles the
                    “spectator” figure that appears in many forms in the era’s literature. While
                    versions of the spectator figure vary, children’s texts like Ellenor Fenn’s
                        <title level="m">The Fairy Spectator, or, The Invisible Monitor</title>
                    (1789), in which a benevolent but severe judge observes and judges the actions
                    of children, offer a usefully succinct version of the spectator figure and
                    highlights Fanny’s function as the moral center of Mansfield Park. Fanny watches
                    the landscape as closely as she watches the people surrounding her, and
                    children’s texts can also help students understand organizing concepts of nature
                    that become important in Austen’s novels. Anne’s musings on poetry and nature in
                        <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, for example, recall children’s texts
                    like Charlotte Smith’s <title level="m">Rural Walks</title> (1795) and its
                    sequel <title level="m">Rambles Farther</title> (1796) that feature female
                    mentors who engage their students in encounters with nature that provide moral
                    instruction and solace for profound loss. Reading Austen and Smith together
                    gives students a wider context for Romantic notions of the beautiful and the
                    sublime or the idea of the picturesque, especially when paired with passages
                    from Edmund Burke and William Gilpin.</p>
               <p>Discussions of the Gothic and fears about female readership taking place in an
                    introductory Romanticism course are also enriched by engaging with children’s
                    literature. Reading <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> alongside Mary
                    Lamb’s children’s story “The Young Mahometan” or Charles Lamb’s “The Witch
                    Aunt,” both from the 1809 <title level="m">Mrs. Leicester’s School</title>, and
                    both featuring young girls whose unsupervised reading of frightening texts
                    causes them unbearable terrors, demonstrates how Gothic trappings are deployed
                    to underscore the dangers of indiscriminate reading for both child and adult
                    audiences.</p>
               <p>I encourage students to explore the connections between children’s texts and
                    Austen’s novels in more depth through a set of writing assignments that ask them
                    to place the fiction we study in context with non-fiction texts, make personal
                    connections to the literature, compare texts to one another, and rewrite one
                    text in the form of another. This set of writing practices helps draw out the
                    ways that Romantic children’s literature engages with the diverse concerns of
                    the era. As I discuss above, students gain valuable context for the fiction they
                    read by exploring non-fiction texts on child-rearing. They might write, for
                    example, about the ways a text like <title level="m">Practical Education</title>
                    illuminates the contrasting educations of Fanny and the Bertram sisters in
                        <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>. </p>
               <p>I also ask students to make personal connections to the texts by writing brief
                    essays that reflect on two pivotal decisions they made in their own lives, one
                    as a child and one as an adult. Writing about how they made these choices and
                    comparing them to the decision-making that happens in an Austen novel or a
                    children’s text helps students gain a more immediate understanding of the high
                    stakes of the seemingly simple choices in the Austen novels and children’s
                    texts. Creating assignments that make comparisons between texts supplements the
                    kinds of comparisons my students do in class by reading aloud parallel dialogues
                    from “The Purple Jar” and <title level="m">Emma</title>. One paper assignment
                    might ask them to identify an obvious didactic moment in a children’s text and
                    to find a similar moment in an Austen novel, describing what the lesson is and
                    how it gets learned. By requiring students to identify subtle didactic moments
                    in Austen’s texts, this assignment complicates assumptions that Romantic-era
                    children’s texts are merely dreary moral tales or that Austen’s novels are
                    simple love stories.</p>
               <p>Finally, students can make connections between Austen’s novels and children’s
                    texts by rewriting an incident from an Austen novel in imitation of the dialogue
                    and incidents of a children’s text. For example, asking students to reimagine
                    the climactic scene at Box Hill in <title level="m">Emma</title> as one of
                    Rosamond’s experiences leads to a discussion of how Emma’s rudeness to Miss
                    Bates would be corrected by Rosamond’s mother if her daughter had made a similar
                    misstep. Like the previous assignment, this rewriting task helps students first
                    recognize the didactic elements of Austen’s work and then consider its
                    relationship with children’s texts that are also concerned with how and what
                    girls and women learn. Students can reinforce such connections by engaging in a
                    “time travel” exercise in which they imagine a child character like Rosamond
                    grown up and faced with the choices of Emma, Elizabeth, or Anne. How would she
                    make decisions, given her past experiences? Contextualizing, connecting,
                    comparing, and rewriting exposes the process by which children’s texts teach
                    their young readers to acquire the social values and behaviors that can seem so
                    mysterious to a first-time reader of Austen. Engaging with this process helps
                    students discover, like many an Austen heroine, that both prudence and romance
                    can be learned.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay explores the challenges of teaching literature in the
               unique setting of higher education programs in correctional institutions.
               Based on the author's experience teaching a romantic-literature course in
               prison, it explores some of the cultural and logistical obstacles at play in
               prison education and possibilities for how these obstacles can be
               successfully negotiated. Finally, it suggests possible examples of how to
               adapt Austen for other nontraditional audiences.

               <p>There might seem to be few less auspicious settings for a discussion of Jane Austen
               than a classroom in a men’s penitentiary. In fact, when I mentioned to a colleague
               that I had taught <title level="m">Perusasion</title> behind bars, she related a
               telling anecdote: In describing a proposed prison higher education program to a
               university administrator, when asked to talk about course content, she used Austen as
               the paradigmatic example of what <emph>not</emph> to teach in prison. But in our age
               when her novels have found vast new audiences through films and even, unbelievably,
               popular mashup horror fiction, perhaps the notion of Austen in prison blues may be
               easier to entertain.</p>
               <p>In the spring of 2012 I had the opportunity to teach as a volunteer instructor at the
               Education Justice Project, a program based at the University of Illinois at
               Urbana-Champaign and serving Danville Correctional Center, a medium-high security
               men’s prison about 40 miles away from campus.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For more information on the Education Justice Project, see
                     <ref target="http://www.educationjustice.net">its website</ref>.</note> The brainchild of Rebecca
               Ginsburg, a UIUC professor of landscape architecture, EJP has one paid staffer and
               survives on donations of time, money, and labor, primarily by professors, graduate
               students, and community members who serve as administrators, teachers, tutors, and
               workshop leaders. Unlike the prison’s adult basic education, high school equivalency,
               and community college programs, EJP does not receive any funds from the state. Its
               exclusive focus is on upper-level college instruction. Only students who have
               completed the equivalent of an Associate’s Degree are accepted into the program, and
               although EJP itself grants no degrees, classes are fully transferable to
               degree-granting programs at UIUC and other four-year schools upon a student’s
               release. EJP students are often regarded both by prison staff and the general
               population as role models—not only for their academic achievement, but also for their
               discipline, fortitude, and work ethic.</p>
               <p> With only a small library and a handful of computers, the use of which by students
               is severely restricted, many traditional classroom expectations need to be trimmed.
               Papers cannot be expected to be typed, for instance, since most of the students have
               limited computer access and many do not have keyboarding proficiency. The lack of
               internet access and small library make traditional research papers difficult, so like
               many instructors I chose to emphasize reflective, critical papers. Perhaps most
               significantly, having to go through X-rays and several security doors, walk past snipers, and teach class with correctional officers standing outside creates its own
               psychological challenges, not to mention the 90-minute commute, drug test, finger
               printing, tuberculosis test, and thorough background screening required just to be
               able to get into the prison. All this made me distinctly less sympathetic to
               colleagues complaining about long photocopier lines and poorly worded student emails
               in their classes back on campus.</p>
               <p> And yet, like every EJP teacher I’ve talked to, it remains the single greatest
               teaching experience I’ve had. The students all come from different levels in terms of
               background knowledge, but all share a hunger for learning more. The class size (about
               16 students) promotes the feel of a large seminar, and I became used to students
               requesting extra reading and getting up during class to find more information from
               the library. There was technically a break in the midst of classes, but it never
               really felt like it, since most of the students would remain and continue the
               discussion with me until the correctional officer announced that class had “resumed.”
               A completely unique educational environment developed, with an optimal balance
               between the level of personal respect and decorum the students showed to me and each
               other, and the tenacity and passion of the intellectual arguments that arose.</p>
               <p> My class was specifically designed for EJP, and focused on methodological issues of
               literary history focusing on two discrete but connected eras—late Romantic England
               and the Harlem Renaissance. The overarching theme of the class was how writers
               engaged with their historical moment, how they articulated the role of literature in
               shaping historical change, and how they responded to and transformed the literary
               tradition they inherited. Teaching a class so heavily dependent upon historical
               context is difficult in a situation where external research beyond a very small
               library is impossible, and budget constraints forced me to use only major works in
               thrift editions. What we lacked in resources, however, was more than made up for
               through depth of engagement. Without much in the way of secondary materials, the
               class had fewer facts at their hands to provide contextualization for the novel, but
               they probed those facts more forcefully and thoroughly than a typical undergraduate
               class, often detecting lines of connection between the works that I had never thought
               of before.</p>
               <p> For the Romantic unit of the class, I chose two novels, <title level="m">Persuasion</title> (1818) and <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1816), and
               three major poets, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats. This fairly
               conventional syllabus was in part dictated by the necessity of using thrift editions,
               but also reflected my desire, in a class centered on questions of literary-historical
               influence, to choose especially influential writers and works. Despite having some
               initial reservations about the suitability of Austen for an all-male classroom, I
               soon felt she was indispensable to the course I was trying to create. In particular,
               her satiric voice, depth of characterization, and psychological realism formed an
               important counterpoint to the forms of Romantic subjectivity embodied in the male
               poets. <title level="m">Persuasion </title>also seemed the logical choice of Austen’s
               books for a class designed around questions of historicity, because of its
               connections to the Napoleonic Wars and other contemporary events, as well as the
               recursive quality of the narrative. What better way to explore questions of memory
               and historical imagination than with a novel obsessed with these concerns, a novel
               that is in many ways a “second-chance” story, commencing at a point in the heroine’s
               life years after the breakdown of a youthful romance. In effect, <title level="m">Persuasion</title> was an Austen novel taking place after the conventional Austen
               plot had already failed.</p>
               <p> It would be nice to report that the power of Austen’s prose won my students over
               immediately, and I suddenly had a room full of committed Janeites. It would be
               equally satisfying to report that the students approached the text with hostility and
               that I, through my own pedagogical skill and sensitivity, convinced them of the
               book’s merits. The reality, of course, was more complicated. <title level="m">Persuasion</title> faced more resistance than almost any other work we read over
               the course of the semester, and while most of the students left with a grudging
               respect for the novel and a sense of Austen’s importance, I still detected no great
               love for her, except for one or two students. How I reached even that point, however,
               is an interesting story.</p>
               <p> In later conversations with Austen teachers, I learned that male students’
               difficulty with Austen is a nearly universal phenomenon, and I had found that to be
               true in my own teaching of Austen on campus as well. Beyond the gender barrier, I
               found additional challenges in the prison context. The students viewed,
               understandably, all the works read through the prism of their own experiences.
               Austen’s satirical depictions of the social conventions of the landed classes in
               early 19<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>-century England, and the female-centered marriage
               plot, made <title level="m">Persuasion</title> seem as far removed as imaginable from
               the student’s lived experience. Other writers engendered a similar skepticism (the
               aestheticism of Keats evoked some particularly withering comments, while Byron and
               Shelley fared somewhat better), but <title level="m">Persuasion</title> had the
               additional difficulties of Austen’s narrative style. The very factors that make her
               so significant in the history of the English novel—the meticulously precise diction,
               verbose yet elegant prose, the psychological complexity of characterization, the use
               of free indirect discourse, and the levels of irony at work in her narrative
               voice—all create challenges for contemporary readers.</p>
               <p> Nonetheless, I did find one advantage in teaching Austen in this environment: the
               lack of familiarity with filmed Austen enabled the students to meet the novel on its
               own terms. Filmed versions, in my experience, often favor a lush romanticism at the
               expense of Austen’s social satire, and even the most effective film cannot fully
               capture the sense of a novel in which so much of the action takes place inside
               characters’ minds. In television and film adaptations, the narrator’s voice has often
               been “clumsily and inappropriately translated into dialogue” (Roger 194). Taking advantage
               of the students’ ability to read with open minds and asking them to think about
               Austen in historical relationship to other writers of the time helped yield some
               surprising insights. Even today, Austen is often taught at the undergraduate level as
               either the culmination of the eighteenth century novel or, as it was taught to me, as
               the progenitor of Victorian fiction. I wanted to make a case to my class for a
               Romantic Austen, as deeply enmeshed in the debates and events of her time as Byron,
               Shelley, Leigh Hunt, or William Hazlitt. Making available selections from secondary
               works by Jeffery Cox and James Chandler helped students make these historical
               connections.</p>
               <p> One choice I made early in structuring the course paid particular dividends when we
               got to Austen. I designated one student to be responsible for leading the class in
               discussing each of the works, something I had done often in my campus classes but
               never before to this extent. I appreciated the seminar feel that developed once I
               relinquished leadership of the class, and also liked enabling (or forcing) students
               to take more ownership. Giving each student a turn also helped to democratize the EJP
               class significantly. Because EJP students are largely self-taught, their knowledge
               base and skill sets differ widely, and some students were much more comfortable
               expressing their ideas either verbally or in writing. Giving each student an
               opportunity to lead discussion confirmed that everyone had something important to
               contribute to the class. Moreover, every student diligently and creatively discharged
               his responsibility, making the overall class much more dynamic and interesting than
               it would have been had I been leading discussion. The success of this system
               confirmed for me the truth of a key EJP axiom, that when you set extremely high
               expectations they are likely to be not just met but exceeded.</p>
               <p> When we reached <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, I was fortunate to have
               discussion led by an extremely energetic, thoughtful, and charismatic student.
               Equally fortuitously, he also happened to be the only student who expressed
               uncritical admiration for the novel. He broke down the residence of some other
               students to Austen’s prose style and the seeming lack of relatibility of her
               characters by suggesting that all enduring works of literature had something
               important to teach contemporary audiences across temporal bounds, and it was the
               reader’s job to make the imaginative and critical effort to transcend his historical
               experience. By repeatedly asking what Austen is trying to teach us today, he steered
               discussion in a direction that turned potentially disruptive resistance into a
               productive source of engagement. He preempted much of my plan for teaching the class
               by suggesting that our reasons for finding Austen difficult suggest the close
               relationship between literary works and their historical contexts, and that not
               merely had political and economic arrangements and language changed, but the
               fundamental ways people narrated and experienced their subjectivity in the world was
               different in Austen’s time than today. Moreover, his sheer energy helped transform
               what otherwise seemed likely to be an uncharacteristically sleepy EJP class.</p>
               <p>My students voiced many of the same difficulties that other modern readers, particularly
               male readers, are likely to encounter. They were not especially sympathetic to the
               romance plot, the lack of conventional “action,” or the intense fascination with the
               mores and manners of the social class Austen describes. Foregrounding Austen’s
               satirical voice helped overcome this objection to some extent, by showing the novels
               had more “bite” than they initially thought. I also found that bringing some of
               the other poems and prose texts we had read into the discussion helped them put together
               a picture of the intense social and economic changes going on at the time. Although I
               did not implement it in this iteration of the class, I think future writing
               assignments that focus on unpacking Austen’s complex narrative voice and language,
               and in particular her use of free indirect discourse, could help improve student
               comprehension for the novel. For instance, requiring students to paraphrase a
               paragraph of the novel in their own words, or conversely, describe a situation in
               their own lives by mimicking Austen’s prose style, could help penetrate some of the
               linguistic and narrative challenges presented by the novel.</p>
               <p> A second key move was in framing our discussion around historical events—not only
               on the macro-level (such as changing gender relationships and expectations for
               marriage, the rise of an urban commercial class, and the corresponding decline in the
               prestige of the gentry), but also more precise historical contexts, such as the final
               phase of the Napoleonic Wars after Napoleon’s escape from Elba. Without historical
               contextualization, the students would have had no way of knowing that “Austen makes
               the events of the novel coincide precisely” with Napoleon’s post-exile campaign, with
               Waterloo very much “at the forefront of Austen’s mind” (Deresiewicz 146).</p>
               <p> Here I followed Chandler’s argument for a model of literary-historical scholarship
               that emphasizes very tight windows of periodization. I also drew on the sense of
               Romantic-era war as reshaping the consciousness of temporality, based on the
               pioneering work of Mary Favret. Favret has pointed out that, perhaps somewhat
               counterintuitively, readership and discussion of Austen has spiked in periods of war.
               During the two world wars, Austen was foremost among the literary treasures cited as
               “fortification” against the “upheavals of wartime,” a possibility with striking
               resonance for the contemporary Austen boom in a period which, for Americans, is not
               exactly wartime, but not peacetime either (Favret).</p>
               <p> Reading through the lens of wartime helped the students understand the changing
               status of the navy. Austen, herself the sister of two naval officers, left the navy
               alone unscathed from her satiric pen among major British cultural institutions. This
               reverence for the navy, and the generally sympathetic treatment of Wentworth, became
               more readily apparent to the students once we examined how Britain’s continued
               independence—let alone its empire and commercial prospects—depended upon control of
               the seas. In turn, this also helped the class appreciate the larger social trends at
               work in the novel, as they saw how the professional status of a naval officer would
               be so important, and correspondingly, for a commercialized and industrial society, how the possession of a good family name meant less and less. The combination of the
               historical background and the energetic contributions of our discussion leader helped
               warm the class towards <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, which was reflected in
               their written work as well. Historicizing the work, and exploring it in terms of
               political, economic, and social relationships rather than just the marriage plot,
               improved the novel’s legibility and accessibility.</p>
               <p> One final analytical tool helped dramatically bring <title level="m">Persuasion</title> alive. Throughout the class we had explored the period’s
               foundational arguments about the acts of reading and writing, and what the ultimate
               goal of literary expression should be. Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence of
                  Poetry</title> and Keats’s letters had both generated intense and lively
               discussion about the promises and pitfalls of reading and writing. The morality and
               methods of reading are an enduring concern in Austen’s work, most notably in <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, but significantly in <title level="m">Persuasion</title> as well, which probes questions such as how one should read,
               what material should be read, and what ultimate purpose reading serves. We spent
               significant class time probing two of the major instances of reading in the text. Sir
               Walter Elliott’s obsessive reading and notetaking on the baronetage registry at the
               beginning of the novel suggested one model of reading, conservative and
               self-oriented. Sir Walter read in order confirm his own beliefs, assuage doubts about
               his own rapidly shrinking social status, and shore up his faith in a disappearing
               order. In contrast, Captain Benwick’s preferred reading matter, flowery Romantic
               poetry, marks him as highly sensitive and refined, but also more delicate and less
               practical than Wentworth, whom the novel regards as a more suitable masculine role
               model. We eventually suggested a third model of reading that Austen seems to be
               promoting though the demands she makes on her own readers: reading as an active
               exercise of critical intelligence, as opposed the escapist (in different ways)
               methods of reading favored by Benwick and Sir Walter. In the course of our time on
                  <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, we problematized the act of reading itself in
               ways that resonated throughout the remainder of the semester. We learned that the
               meaning of “good” or “effective” reading is not universal, but has been contested at
               different historical moments.</p>
               <p> Bringing out the theme of different approaches to the purpose and value of reading
               eventually proved the most productive way to generate engagement with the novel.
               Having read Wordsworth’s 1800 "Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>,"
               the students were already aware of the period’s anxieties about the effect of
               inappropriate or "low-quality" reading on the aesthetic taste and moral commitments
               of different segments of society. The students implicitly grasped this idea; as
               well-read autodidacts themselves, they already had a commitment to reading as a mode
               of intellectual and moral uplift that few of my undergraduates at my home institution
               shared. For them, the writers we studied were not an abstract intellectual exercise;
               rather, Keats, Shelley, Byron, etc. represented living ideas, with the power to teach
               lessons that could be applied to their daily experience. They also had the experience
               of expressing tastes in reading that might come across as effete to some of the other
               inmates. Furthermore, they had the experience of having their own reading, viewing,
               and listening habits relentlessly scrutinized by prison authorities. So, by
               emphasizing <title level="m">Persuasion</title> as a work in part about the promise
               and perils of reading, we situated the novel as an intervention to debates that they
               were already actively involved in.</p>
               <p> As my experience shows, Austen has the potential to reach all types of audiences,
               although different classrooms will demand different pedagogical approaches. We have
               seen film and television adaptations and pulp novelizations help to spread Austen’s
               appeal and create new generations of Janeites. But it is important not to
               underestimate the ability of the novels themselves to speak directly to even those
               contemporary readers without much experience reading literary fiction. At a time of
               shrinking enrollments in English classes and renewed fears about the health of the
               discipline, Austen is one of the field’s most reliable attractions to undergraduate
               students, standing perhaps second only to Shakespeare in possessing an equally high
               degree of cultural capital and popular appeal. My students at Danville Correctional
               Center taught me that her success endures not in spite of her difficulty, but rather
               directly because of the demands she places upon reading as an active exercise of
               critical intelligence. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay takes account of the author’s evolving approach to incorporating
                    popular culture materials and historic editions into her teaching of Austen.
                    It outlines a philosophy of teaching Austen to a broad undergraduate population
                    in liberal-arts colleges, as well as practical classroom strategies for
                    undergraduate courses on writing and literature at all levels.  Also included are
                    students’ responses to encounters with historic editions.

               <p>I offered an undergraduate seminar titled “Jane Austen and Popular Culture” in my
                    first semester as a full-time faculty member, in 2003. Since then, at two
                    liberal-arts colleges, I have taught versions of a course on Austen and popular
                    culture at every level of undergraduate education, from academic writing courses
                    for first-year students to upper-level research seminars. In both practical and
                    philosophical terms, these experiences have shaped me as a teacher, and they
                    have strongly influenced my research as well. The following account can, I hope,
                    be taken in many different ways: as a reflective, qualitative contribution to
                    the lively ongoing conversation about Austen pedagogy; as a source of ideas and
                    classroom strategies that may be applied more generally to the undergraduate
                    teaching of literature, especially in relation to archives; and as a narrative
                    of professional development that explores the interplay between teaching,
                    writing, and outreach in the relatively under-recognized realm of the
                    undergraduate liberal-arts college.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Among the
                        wide variety of published work on the teaching of Austen, I would especially
                        like to acknowledge appreciatively the innovative and creative approaches of
                        McMaster, Folsom, Easton, Duquette, and Gilroy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>My first course on Austen and popular culture came about because my new
                    colleagues at Manhattanville College—a small, private liberal-arts college in
                    the New York City suburbs—asked me to invent an upper-level literature course
                    that would appeal to their students, whom they described as having a wide range
                    of abilities. Thinking quickly through my almost-finished dissertation on
                    Austen, Charlotte Brontë, and George Eliot, I decided regretfully that now was
                    not the time to teach <title level="m">Middlemarch</title>. I guessed, however,
                    that even relatively indifferent students would know the 1990s Austen film
                        adaptations—<title level="m">Clueless</title>, at least. So I put together a
                    syllabus that juxtaposed novels and films, with plenty of time to discuss each
                    in depth: <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1811) and Ang Lee’s
                    film (1995); <title level="m">Emma</title> (1815) with Douglas McGrath’s film
                    (1996) and <title level="m">Clueless</title> (1995); and <title level="m">Persuasion</title> (1818) with Roger Michell’s film (1995).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I initially steered clear of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> in the hope that less well-known Austen
                        works would lead to more nuanced conversations about her popularity. I’ve
                        since made space for <title level="m">P&amp;P</title> by alternating between
                            <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> and <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> (paired with Patricia Rozema’s audacious film
                        version [1999]). I dropped <title level="m">Persuasion</title> because I
                        found that Michell’s adaptation was just too likeable to lead to substantial
                        discussion. </note> As a gesture towards the rest of “popular culture,” I
                    added Arielle Eckstut and Dennis Ashton’s <title level="m">Pride &amp;
                        Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen</title> (2001) and one of
                    Stephanie Barron’s Jane Austen mystery novels. A few essays from <title level="m">Jane Austen in Hollywood</title> contributed some dignity to the
                    proceedings. Each student wrote a short analytical essay about one novel and a
                    long research essay that was to reach through analysis of adaptation to address
                    what I called—and which, indeed, I still think of as—the “big question” of
                    Austen’s popularity today.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Two aspects of this
                        course were especially successful, given the academic level of
                        Manhattanville’s undergraduate students. First, students really rose to the
                        challenge of approaching a film adaptation as an interpretation of an Austen
                        novel for a cinema or television audience. Students who weren’t particularly
                        adept at analyzing Austen’s prose on its own found that they could much more
                        comfortably investigate the consequences of adaptation and appropriation.
                        Second, students engaged very well with criticism of the film versions both
                        in discussion and in their research essays. </note>
               </p>
               <p>At the time, I didn’t know of anyone else teaching Austen in this way, and I had
                    made no especial effort to consume—much less study—Austen-related popular
                    culture myself. While enrolled in a very traditional doctoral program in
                    literature, following equally traditional undergraduate studies, I learned of
                        <title level="m">Jane Austen in Hollywood</title> only by chance; it was a
                    revelation to find established scholars writing so animatedly about films I had
                        enjoyed.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Linda Troost and Sayre
                        Greenfield, the editors of <title level="m">Jane Austen in
                        Hollywood</title>, told me recently in conversation that they insisted that
                        their contributors write accessibly, for an imagined audience of high-school
                        English teachers who would want a fresh angle to share when teaching Austen.
                    </note> I had yet to read Claudia Johnson’s influential essay “Austen Cults and
                    Cultures” or Deidre Lynch’s wonderful collection <title level="m">Janeites:
                        Austen’s Disciples and Devotees</title>—which, in any case, would have
                    sailed over the heads of all but one of my Manhattanville students.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Especially useful in the undergraduate
                        classroom, I have since found, are the works of Benedict, Brodie, and
                        Halsey.</note> On the sole visit I had made to the annual meeting of the
                    Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA), in 2001, I had been impressed with
                    the fervor of these Austen fans but didn’t have the foresight to seek out fellow
                    academics.</p>
               <p>Nor did I know if I would offer an Austen and popular culture seminar again. Even
                    if the course worked well once, it seemed entirely possible to me that within a
                    year or so, Austen-mania would have receded far enough into history to be of
                    little interest to undergraduates. Of course, I was laughably wrong about that.
                    2004 brought Karen Joy Fowler’s novel <title level="m">The Jane Austen Book
                        Club</title>, which not only put the name “Jane Austen” on the New York
                    Times Bestseller list for months but also focused popular attention on why
                    ordinary people might want to read, or re-read, Austen’s novels. 2005 gave us
                        <title level="m">Pride &amp; Prejudice</title> with Keira Knightley, an
                    adaptation that strongly appealed to young viewers. Based on the wholly
                    unscientific testimony of my own students, audiences in their age group were
                    further diverted by 2007’s <title level="m">Becoming Jane</title> and the film
                    version of <title level="m">The Jane Austen Book Club</title>. <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</title> (2009) confirmed that the popular
                    Austen, far from being in decline, was in fact immortal (or perhaps just
                        undead).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Several of the 1990s film
                        adaptations of Austen have proved to have enduring appeal among young people
                        as well. My students continue to be reliably familiar with, and sometimes
                        outright memorizers of, <title level="m">Clueless</title>. While the BBC /
                        A&amp;E <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> miniseries was
                        broadcast before this year’s entering college students were born, some have
                        still seen it, largely thanks to mothers or aunts who are Austen fans.
                        Gwyneth Paltrow devotees can be expected to be familiar with the <title level="m">Emma</title> in which she starred (1996), while the truly
                        bookish tend to have found their way to Roger Michell’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> (1995).</note> And every year, one or two of my
                    students brought to class more samples of the plethora of fiction and nonfiction
                    “inspired” by Austen, from romance and vampire novels to dating guides. </p>
               <p> In addition to ensuring the continuation of my seminar, this flood of popular
                    Austen material changed my approach to teaching literature at the undergraduate
                    level in several ways. Philosophically, I’ve come to see the importance—I would
                    now say, even, the necessity—of connecting major works of literature to the
                    world that we and our students inhabit as readers, consumers, and creators. (I
                    should acknowledge that very few of my students will pursue graduate study in
                    English.) Considering up-to-the-minute popular works in relation to canonical
                    literature encourages students to move beyond envisioning “the literary
                    tradition” as the monolithic property of their professors, or of anthology
                    editors, and instead to conceive of it as an ongoing conversation in which they
                    themselves are taking part. Through asking how and why a particular
                    Austen-related work might appeal to a mass audience (or not), or by examining
                    the nature of a writer's or filmmaker’s credentials as fan or scholar, students
                    begin thinking in new ways about the significance of literature in the
                    marketplace, as well as about themselves as active participants in reception
                        history.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Austen-related books written by
                        professors, such as Cohen or Amy Elizabeth Smith, can be especially
                        thought-provoking for students to consider.</note> Not surprisingly, young
                    creative writers tend to especially appreciate these approaches. Illuminating
                    connections between traditional literary study and students’ wider lives as
                    readers is essential, I would contend, not only to the students’ own future as
                    lifelong learners, but also to the health of a future readership for literature
                    outside the academy—and perhaps for the study of literature within the academy
                    as well. </p>
               <p> Second, in more practical terms, the availability of a huge range of
                    Austen-related resources has allowed me to experiment with incorporating more
                    options and choices for my students, a tactic that has affected how I teach
                    beyond the Austen realm. As I mentioned, in 2003 I had everyone read <title level="m">Pride &amp; Promiscuity</title> and a Stephanie Barron mystery; in
                    the same spirit, I assigned Fowler’s <title level="m">The Jane Austen Book
                        Club</title> the next time I offered the seminar, in 2005. When students in
                    both iterations of the course responded that they didn’t really see the point of
                    devoting class time to those works, I decided to move towards a smorgasbord
                    approach. These days I bring in a few shopping bags full of Austen-inspired
                    books and let each student choose one to read, present, and recommend (or not).
                    To help with the decision-making, I offer a thumbnail description of each,
                    including mention of any particularly eye-opening content, whether gore or sex.
                    Any student who owns and wants to present on a different work is welcome to do
                    so. The ensuing presentations are invariably lively and often very creative,
                    especially when I ask for an accompanying poster. Because these efforts have
                    worked so well, I’ve incorporated both choices of readings and creative projects
                    in several of my other courses as well, to equally good effect.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The smorgasbord approach can also be used for
                        Austen biographies. An example of this approach from a non-Austen course is
                        to assign an anthology of short stories and ask each student to read one and
                        recommend it—or not—for the whole class to read, with an explanation of
                        her/his choice based on reasons beyond (but perhaps including) personal
                        liking. By justifying her/his selection, each student experiences, in a
                        small way, what we teachers do when putting together our syllabi, and
                        sharing those reasons adds depth to ensuing discussions. Creative projects,
                        I’ve found, are especially beneficial to include in required courses, as a
                        way of engaging students who didn’t choose to be there. In my British
                        literature survey course, for example, each student develops a “personal
                        canon project” that, in any medium, highlights and reflects on works from
                        the syllabus with which she/he takes a particular interest or feels a
                        particular connection. In any course, creative projects allow students to
                        combine literature with their other interests and expertise, which many
                        students tell me they appreciate.</note>
               </p>
               <p> I responded to the avalanche of <title level="m">Pride and
                    Prejudice</title>-related material in another way, too: by creating a first-year
                    seminar course for Manhattanville that was devoted to <title level="m">P&amp;P</title> and its adaptations. General-education standards required
                    that each seminar focus on principles of critical analysis, which turned out to
                    be very well suited to a novel that concentrates so much on mistaken judgments
                    and faulty reasoning. Austen’s themes of decision-making and self-discovery also
                    fit nicely with the students’ efforts to acclimate to their new college
                    environment. In accordance with my usual preference for depth over breadth, we
                    spent about half of each course reading and discussing the novel, which proved
                    especially advantageous with first-year students who were unlikely to be
                    prospective English majors. The course culminated with a research essay in which
                    each student developed a topic related to the novel and its adaptations in light
                    of scholarly criticism. At their best, these essays were as strong as the ones
                    produced in my upper-level seminar, thanks in part to the many stages of
                    preparation the first-year seminar made possible.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Some standout freshman essays from 2012 included the

               <p> In addition to affecting me as a teacher, all the time I was spending with
                    Austen-related popular culture in the classroom began to influence me
                    professionally as well. The great hope of the liberal arts college is that
                    faculty will find ways to bring their research interests into the classroom and
                    their teaching experiences into their research, and I’ve certainly done both to
                    a degree I couldn’t have dreamed of initially. I started by keeping up, for the
                    sake of my courses, with popular material on Austen as well as with the growing
                    body of relevant critical work. As I educated myself in this (to me) new area of
                    study, I found myself wanting to contribute to it, a desire that over time led
                    to the decision to write my book <title level="m">Everybody’s Jane: Austen in
                        the Popular Imagination</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I first
                        dipped my toe into writing about Austen and popular culture with a short
                        article on the 2005 <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> film for a
                        special issue of JASNA’s journal <title level="j">

                     </title>. I’ve subsequently assigned
                        upper-level seminar students to choose and present an article from that
                        special issue, which, like <title level="m">Persuasions</title> generally,

               <p> Presenting and writing on Austen and popular culture brought me into closer
                    contact with JASNA, which in turn opened up new opportunities to connect
                    students with the wider world of Austen’s readers and fans. I started small, by
                    taking individual students to regional meetings of the society and by
                    encouraging bolder ones to attend meetings by themselves and report back. After
                    several years’ involvement with the New York region of JASNA, I was invited to
                    coordinate a symposium at Manhattanville in March 2010, on a topic of my choice.
                    The theme “Inspired by Austen” allowed me to showcase a wide variety of people
                    whose professional and personal lives had been affected in some way by
                        Austen.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Our symposium speakers were Lori
                        Smith, author of the memoir <title level="m">A Walk with Jane Austen</title>
                        (who also, thanks to a grant from the local Episcopal diocese, spent a week
                        as writer in residence at Manhattanville); Sheila Solomon Klass and Perri
                        Klass, the mother-daughter authors of the memoir <title level="m">Every
                            Mother is a Daughter</title> (who are also, respectively, a retired
                        English professor turned young-adult novelist and a noted pediatrician,
                        author, and early literacy advocate); Andrew Honey, a book conservator at
                        the Bodleian Library; and Catherine Medeot, a librarian at
                        Manhattanville.</note> In addition to 80-odd JASNA members, students from
                    both my first-year and seminar courses on Austen were in attendance and
                    participated, respectively, in a poster session about popular Austen-related
                    works and in a structured conversation with the JASNA members, the majority of
                    whom were over sixty years old. Watching and listening to these authors and readers of all
                    ages talk about their shared appreciation of Austen was delightful, and I
                    consider the occasion a highlight of my career.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Another highlight of my teaching in spring 2010 was a field trip to the
                        Morgan Library &amp; Museum’s landmark exhibit of Austen manuscripts, <title level="m">A Woman’s Wit : Jane Austen’s Life and Legacy</title>.

               <p> My teaching of Austen took an exciting turn in 2012, when I moved from
                    Manhattanville to Goucher College in Baltimore, home of the Alberta H. and Henry
                    G. Burke Jane Austen Collection. Alberta Burke was a 1928 Goucher alumna who
                    dedicated her life to assembling and curating a uniquely wide-ranging collection
                    of Austeniana that includes everything from first editions and manuscript
                    letters, to Regency contextual sources, to translations, popular books, and
                    ephemera related to Austen.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> My chapter
                        “Alberta H. Burke, Austen Omnivore” in <title level="m">Everybody’s

                        classes where I make use of the Burke Collection, I offer students a copy of

                    Launched in fall 2013 was a seminar on “Jane Austen and Her Readers” that

               </p>
               <p> The proximity of the Burke Collection has made possible assignments and
                    activities that go well beyond conventional historical and contextual research.
                    Alberta Burke was passionate about reading from her historic editions; she did
                    so in order to share as closely as possible the experience of Austen’s original
                    readers. In that spirit, I have asked students to visit Special Collections and
                    Archives, to read from a first or early edition of one of the Austen novels
                    assigned for class, and to write about the experience. I asked students to
                    consider the following questions as they encountered Austen’s text through the
                    form of the historical edition: <list type="unordered">
                     <item>Do you find yourself reading differently—perhaps more quickly or more
                            slowly, or noticing different things—when handling this edition?</item>
                     <item>How does the physical form of the book—its size, shape, printing, and
                            quality of paper—affect your reading experience?</item>
                     <item>Does your knowledge of Alberta Burke as a Goucher alumna and collector
                            affect your appreciation of this Austen volume? If so, how?</item>
                  </list>Here are some of the students’ (unedited) responses: <quote> I felt,
                        however fleeting, connected to Austen’s time. … All of the sensory aspects
                        of the book—the yellowed, stained pages, the faded ink, the “old book
                        smell”—combined to put me into the world of Hartfield and Highbury and
                        Donwell Abbey. Physically however, the text startled me. I found myself
                        counting the words per line—as if I were reading a poem. </quote>
                  <quote>The reading experience definitely differed from the others I had with
                        this text [<title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>]. I felt almost as
                        if I read it for the first time again, and the very first sentence made me
                        wonder whether it would be taken seriously by the contemporary audience, at
                        least during first reading. </quote>
                  <quote>It is interesting to think that these volumes, which now have specific
                        rules for handling them and such, were just books to be read for pleasure by
                        people who, I am supposing, enjoyed reading them as much as I do.</quote>
                  <quote>Typically when I read, I curl up in a chair or in my bed. … Now I sat
                        with remarkably held posture and two hands on the book, which rested on foam
                        supports on the desk in front of me. I was forced to be a bit more civilized
                        due to the pricelessness of the historic book I sat studying. My stature was
                        in fact quite fitting of the novel’s time. I venture to say that my
                        imagination, prodded by the historical edition in my hands, allowed me to
                        more readily enter the world of Elizabeth Bennet.</quote>
                  <quote>I did notice small stains and marks on each page, presumably left by
                        previous readers. This made me consider the fact that readers before me have
                        left their presence behind, like a signature. I feel that part of the value
                        in an old book is that it has been used by so many different people, each of
                        whom likely had a slightly different experience while reading it.</quote>
                    Acute and thoroughly personal, these responses demonstrate that the experiment
                    achieved just what I had hoped for: focusing students’ attention on the way that
                    a book as historical, physical object affects both how we read and how we think
                    about ourselves as reading. </p>
               <p> Whole-class visits to the Burke Collection offer a different opportunity for
                    expanding students’ understanding of an Austen novel. After discussing <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, students in an intermediate-level
                    literature course spent a class session looking at and reading from first and
                    early editions of that novel, as well as contextual sources from the Regency
                    period. Below are some of the answers students submitted anonymously to my
                    request for feedback on the experience. (My questions are in italics.) <list type="unordered">
                     <head>
                        <emph>What did you find most interesting about the books on
                                display?</emph>
                     </head>
                     <item>They were well kept and smelled really nice.</item>
                     <item>I really liked looking at the first editions. It was really cool to
                            see and they smelled fabulous.</item>
                     <item>The size, the smell, and the delicacy.</item>
                     <item>It was a powerful experience to read and touch books that people from
                            the Regency period also read and touched.</item>
                  </list>
                  <list type="unordered">
                     <head>
                        <emph>How, if at all, did what you saw affect your appreciation or
                                understanding of Austen or </emph>Northanger

                     </head>
                     <item>I felt closer to the book by looking at the older versions of it. I
                            learned there were two separately published volumes which made me think
                            about how we publish books differently today.</item>
                     <item>It was a physical reminder of how long this book has been
                            around.</item>
                     <item>I liked looking at some of the other sources in the collection, like
                                <title level="m">The Mysteries of Udolpho</title> and the book about
                            Bath [Christopher Anstey, <title level="m">The New Bath Guide, or,
                                Useful Pocket Companion</title> (1799)], which helped me understand
                            the references Austen makes in <title level="m">Northanger
                            Abbey</title>. [This student subsequently incorporated Anstey’s <title level="m">Guide</title> into her research essay for the course,
                            certainly a desirable outcome.]</item>
                     <item>Seeing first editions of <title level="m">The Mysteries of
                                Udolpho</title> and other period novels helped me to connect with
                            Jane Austen and Catherine.</item>
                  </list> As I plan future teaching, I will continue to refine my approach to
                    introducing Burke Collection material to students, especially at the
                    introductory and intermediate levels, with the aim of creating a more
                    substantial pedagogical experience.</p>
               <p>Given the exceptional international popularity of Austen, as well as the growing
                    status of book history and reception studies within literary scholarship, my
                    librarian colleagues and I are working on a variety of endeavors to make the
                    Burke Collection more accessible to teachers, students, and readers outside the
                    Baltimore area.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Please see this <ref target="http://meyerhoff.goucher.edu/library/janeausten/emmainamerica/">Website</ref> for information about Goucher's digital-humanities project centering on the extremely rare first American edition of <title level="m">Emma</title> (Philadelphia, 1816).</note> In the meantime, if your institution owns first or rare editions
                    of Austen, you can try a version of my experiment by having students read from a
                    historic edition. If not, your local public library likely holds a variety of
                    Austen-inspired books that you and/or your students can sample. Your local JASNA
                    region may have a lending library as well. I’d strongly encourage you, if you
                    haven’t already done so, to contact the regional coordinators of that JASNA
                    group in order to explore how you and your students might connect with their
                    programs.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> From <ref target="http://www.jasna.org/regions/index.html">their webpage</ref>, you can find links to JASNA
                        regions in the U.S. and in Canada.</note> And, if and when a new Austen film
                    is released, by all means meet your students at the multiplex—and reconvene
                    around your seminar table.</p>
