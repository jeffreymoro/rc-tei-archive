            <p class="noCount">This essay describes a freshman seminar called “Advice about Love and the Literary
               Narrator.” After touching on <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>’s opening sentence and some consequences of the belief that one can take advice from
               a fiction or its narrator, I track a version of the course that moves from Ovid’s
               <em>Amores</em> to Capellanus’s courtly love treatise, Cervantes’s <em>Don Quixote</em>, and the proposal scenes of the eighteenth-century novel. I conclude by showing how
               a proposal scene in <em>Emma</em> illuminates earlier models of advising.</p>

               <p>Since January 2012, a dozen volumes that claim to purvey Jane Austen’s love counsel
                  have appeared in print. This explosion in the dating manual corner of the Austen market
                  is no boon for morale in college Austen classes. To those students who have absorbed
                  the lesson that literature ought not to serve any practical purpose, the visibility
                  of so many Austen guides to love suggests that Austen’s novels, useful as the book
                  trade proclaims them, must not be literature, or at least not literature of the highest
                  kind. And to any student, there is the embarrassing matter of what Austen is supposed
                  to be useful for. I have been told that in certain college-age circles, it has come
                  to seem widely acknowledged that a single man or woman in possession of Austen’s novels
                  must be in want of—and desperate to find—a romantic partner.

            </div>
            <p>Austen is, of course, one among legions of literary writers who have either claimed
               for themselves a love-advisor persona or had such a persona ascribed to them by readers.
               In a freshman seminar called “Advice about Love and the Literary Narrator,” my students
               and I examine some of the texts these writers produced. The topic of love advice serves
               in this course as an occasion for surveying the history of literary criticism, for
               investigating literary theoretical problems such as the nature of “belief” in fiction,
               for considering the ways speech acts can establish relations between narrators and
               readers, and for delving into the particulars of a wide variety of literary texts.
               The essay that follows will lay out some of the questions the course addresses, sketch
               the material we cover in the course’s first, pre-Austen half, and finally discuss
               how we bring that material to bear on one of Austen’s novels most explicitly concerned
               with love advice, <em>Emma </em>(1815). I will suggest that what makes literary love advice an especially fruitful
               topic for classroom study is the tension between what it <em>says</em> and what it <em>does</em>, the interplay—mobilized by Austen with special dexterity—between its constative
               and performative dimensions.</p>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">*</span></h2>
               <p>The topic of love advice has a certain automatic psychological interest quite apart
                  from its relations with literature. Students arrive in class already equipped with
                  a fund of extra-literary experience that informs their answers to such questions as:
                  Why do so many people seem to share the intuition that some elusive rule or piece
                  of information holds the key to love and happiness? Why would anyone ever accept advice
                  about something so private and individual as love? What, if anything, could qualify
                  one to give such counsel? What relations of power or erotic investment between a giver
                  and receiver of love counsel does a given scene of advising imply? </p>
               <p>Further questions arise when we turn from scenarios involving real persons or fictional
                  characters to ones taking place between narrators of fiction and their readers. Do
                  special constraints or opportunities come into play when the source of advice is a
                  piece of literature? When narrators present themselves as advice-givers to readers,
                  what other kinds of relationships with those readers do they thereby initiate or imply?
                  Can the mixed motives and hidden agendas that so often influence real-world advisors
                  and matchmakers still come into play when the advisor/advisee relation includes only
                  one embodied person? What, on the other hand, do readers mean when they say that they
                  are “in love” with a particular author, book, narrator, or literary character? What
                  does a literary work’s status as object of love contribute to its authority as advisor
                  about love? </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Is it even possible for a literary narrator or work of art to give a reader advice?
                     Students may be tempted to answer “no” to this last question from a sheer sense of
                     respect for the difference between fiction and fact. After all, if the poet “nothing
                     affirms, and therefore never lieth,” as Sir Philip Sidney claimed in his <em>Defense of Poesy </em>(1595),
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)

                     </div> then the poet would seem to abstain altogether from offering readers direction. Indeed,
                     to borrow formulations that first-year college students are more likely to have encountered
                     in their previous studies, if poetry makes “pseudo-statements” rather than verifiable
                     statements (I. A. Richards), if “A poem should not mean / But be” (Archibald Macleish),
                     if to focus on the propositional content of a literary fiction is to miss its (aesthetic)
                     point (Cleanth Brooks), then any reader who attempts to take guidance from a fiction
                     is already misguided.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

               <p>To be sure, the long chronological sweep of the course helps to deprive this skeptical
                  view of its air of inevitability. As we march through the centuries from Ovid to George
                  Saunders, we have many occasions to notice how dominant has been the Horacian duo
                  “<em>utile</em>” and “<em>dulce</em>.” Viewed in the context of the many Western commentators who take it for granted
                  that literature should and can be useful as well as sweet, instructive as well as
                  entertaining, the Sidneyan or New Critical insistence on the incommensurability between
                  the claims of fiction and the world of facts seems pedantic. There is also the difficulty
                  of imagining a work of literature that could offer no guidance to anybody. A geographically
                  ignorant reader of Balzac’s <em>Le Père Goriot</em> (1835) would learn from that novel that Paris is the capital of France even if she
                  were resolved not to accept as guidance any of the narrator’s discursive comments.</p>
               <p>Yet even those modern readers who agree that they can receive instruction from a work
                  of literature may balk at the idea that they can receive <em>advice </em>from it. When I ask students how “advice” differs from “instruction,” a speech-act
                  that can, after all, take exactly the same form, they usually decide that an “advisor”
                  guides someone she <em>knows</em>, while an “instructor” can guide acquaintances and strangers alike. Unlike “instruction,”
                  “advice” is custom-tailored to the specific circumstances of the addressee. Thus,
                  the distance of time or space separating authors from readers—the fact that authors
                  cannot be personally acquainted with all the readers whom their books may eventually
                  attract—would seem to rule out the transmission of advice from literary text to reader.</p>
               <p>The fact that readers do think of themselves as taking precisely <em>advice</em> from works of literature bears pondering. To examine that peculiar belief, as well
                  as some of the other illusions fiction can create, we draw on Robert Newsom’s book
                  <em>A Likely Story: Probability and Play in Fiction</em>, pursuing several lines of questioning. When I read <em>Pride and Prejudice </em>(1813), is my feeling that Austen’s narrator is my advisor like my feeling that there
                  was once a person called Elizabeth Bennet who talked with Mr. Darcy? Are both feelings,
                  in other words, phenomena deliberately orchestrated long ago by the writer Jane Austen
                  and unlikely ever to fool me into acting as if Austen’s creative product were part
                  of my own world of facts? Or is the credence I give to the notion that Austen’s narrator
                  can advise me more like the credence with which I greet the circumstances of daily
                  life? Perhaps my belief in the narrator’s ability to advise me is stronger than my
                  belief in Elizabeth Bennet’s existence. After all, I myself have supplied real-world
                  particulars to the sentences I take as Austen’s “advice.” Upon encountering, for example,
                  the first sentence of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good
                  fortune, must be in want of a wife,” I may think of a single man I know and imagine
                  that Austen’s narrator is offering me personal guidance concerning this man (3). My
                  real-world experience of the man I have in mind informs my sense of the narrator’s
                  advice. Then again, perhaps my experience of real-world women with “light and pleasing”
                  figures similarly informs my sense of Elizabeth Bennet (23). However one decides the
                  question of belief, it seems clear that one way a narrator can foster the illusion
                  that she offers readers custom-built guidance is by inviting their personal applications
                  to her general statements. The result looks like a reciprocal exchange: the narrator
                  sets the topic, the reader thinks of relevant material, and the narrator in turn gives
                  an interpretation of that material.</p>
               <p>The process does not end there: the novel’s incidents and characters further inflect
                  moments of advice-giving. In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, our sole Austen novel in some iterations of the course, we find it fruitful to compare
                  the narrator who speaks the novel’s famous opening sentence with Charlotte Lucas,
                  that cynical inventor of prescriptions for courtship (“In nine cases out of ten, a
                  woman had better shew <em>more</em> affection than she feels” [22]); with Mr. Collins, the plodding reciter of such prescriptions
                  (“I am not now to learn that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses
                  of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour”
                  [107]); and with Elizabeth Bennet, a disdainful observer of the calculations of each.
                  The opening sentence’s most immediate counterpoint comes, however, from Mrs. Bennet,
                  whose first-chapter airing of her wishes concerning Mr. Bingley’s marriageability
                  reflects back upon the narrator. Inviting us to recognize Mrs. Bennet as Austen’s
                  joking self-portrait, the novel’s opening statement, we find, has borrowed the universalizing
                  impulse of the matron of the Bennet household and dressed up in stately language her
                  wish concerning single men. The labors of Mrs. Bennet to find marriages for her daughters
                  become a facetious representation of Austen’s matchmaking efforts on behalf both of
                  her nubile female characters and of the readers whom her narrator addresses with advice.</p>
               <p>Thanks to the famous irony of the opening sentence, this alignment between Austen’s
                  narrator and the novel’s foolish would-be matchmaker is decidedly temporary. The first
                  sentence parrots not just Mrs. Bennet herself but Mr. Bennet’s disgruntled parroting
                  of Mrs. Bennet, we suddenly realize. Our double-take anticipates one of the plot’s
                  more unexpected rhymes with the opening sentence, which takes place when Elizabeth
                  catches herself giving voice to her mother’s opportunistic attitude toward Netherfield
                  Park’s occupants, then hastily backtracks with the remark that “perhaps Mr. Bingley
                  did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighborhood as for his
                  own” (178). This playing out in a speech by Elizabeth of two contrary impulses in
                  the opening sentence’s reader suggests one effect of the narrator’s fleeting adoption
                  of the love-advisor persona. In spellbinding cadences that initially seem to draw
                  the reader under the wing of an ideal mentor, then gradually reveal themselves to
                  be an unfriendly mimicry of Mrs. Bennet, the narrator gives the reader the same double
                  experience of unthinking complicity and compensatory revulsion that mark Elizabeth’s
                  response to her mother and to the very idea of courtship that proceeds “by design”
                  (22). The response is not unlike that with which an admirer of Austen’s novels might
                  encounter the love guides of modern Janeism. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I have found this kind of inquiry, in which the class compares a narrator’s discourse
                     with episodes in the diegetic realm, helpful throughout the many versions of the course
                     I have taught. In the case of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, such comparisons throw into relief the contrast between what the narrator begins
                     by saying about single men and what her words do, namely show us that if we believe
                     what she says, then we will deserve ridicule.

                     </div> Discussing <em>Persuasion </em>(1817), another Austen novel sometimes included in the course, we find many curious
                     points of contact between Anne Elliot’s relationship with books, her interactions
                     with the love-advisor characters—Lady Russell, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Musgrove, Mrs. Croft,
                     even Charles Musgrove—and the narrator’s dry comments about love. Sometimes we begin
                     the course with Ovid’s tale of Pygmalion, in which love crosses the border between
                     art and the real world. We follow this story of a statue that comes alive when kissed
                     with Molière’s play <em>The School for Wives </em>(1662), in which a would-be Pygmalion finds that the woman he has fashioned harbors
                     her own ideas about whom she will kiss; with Henry James’s novel <em>The Awkward Age </em>(1898-1899), in which adults contend for influence over a girl who may already be
                     shaped by books; and with Tommaso Landolfi’s comical story “Gogol’s Wife” (1963),
                     which imagines the Russian author as unhappy husband to an adjustable blow-up doll.
                     The alternative sequence of texts I lay out in the following section is just one of
                     innumerable possibilities.</p>

               <p>The seminar opens with two intensely entertaining, raunchy books by the Roman poet
                  Ovid: <em>The Amores</em> (c. 15 BCE) and <em>The Art of Love </em>(2-1 BCE). <em>The Art of Love </em>is the more explicit love guide, but <em>The Amores</em> is particularly interesting for the relationships it establishes between its speaker,
                  its reader, and Corinna, the woman whom the speaker professes to love. We begin the
                  class on Ovid by considering one of his obsessive topics, the go-between, whom <em>The Amores</em>’s speaker represents first as a witch-like procuress, then as a lady’s maid, a writing
                  tablet, and the verses of the speaker. Noting that <em>The Amores</em> returns repeatedly to scenarios in which a go-between displaces one of the principals
                  in a love affair, we examine this pattern at work in the opening poem of book 2, in
                  which the speaker declares his intention to act as facilitator of his readers’ love
                  affairs but ends up admitting that he is versifying on his own behalf, for his own
                  erotic benefit.</p>
               <p>This intimation of author/reader rivalry gets a comical twist near the end of <em>The Amores</em>, when the speaker discovers that he has shot himself in the foot, so to speak, by
                  writing about his beloved. As he laments, “That girl whom the town / Spoke of — till
                  lately — as <em>mine</em>, my solitary obsession, / I fear I must now share / With all comers” (160). In Peter
                  Green’s lively translation, Ovid’s speaker wonders, “Could my poems have made her
                  a public figure?” and concludes, “That’s it: <em>she </em>was prostituted by <em>my </em>art, / And serve me right for trumpeting her beauty abroad! If my darling’s / On the
                  market, it’s all my fault— / I’ve pimped her charms, I’ve marked up the route for
                  lovers, / It was I who let them in at her front door.” Some of the speakers’ readers
                  are now his erotic competitors because they have—with quixotism <span class="foreign">avant le lettre</span>—believed the speaker’s assertions about Corinna’s perfections instead of dismissing
                  the praise as “fiction” (161). In this preview of one of the most trumpeted of fiction-reading’s
                  putative dangers—the reader’s inability to distinguish fiction from reality—the figure
                  victimized is not the reader but the author.</p>
               <p>I enjoy moving from Ovid—so inflammatory yet familiar, who never fails to prompt students’
                  recollections of rap songs—to the medieval cleric Andreas Capellanus, who often alludes
                  to Ovid but whose treatise <em>The Art of Courtly Love </em>(1184-6) offers a glimpse of a world markedly unlike our own. In answer to the first
                  question I ask in the Capellanus class, “What surprised you in the reading?”, students
                  point to Capellanus’s regimented list of the “four stages of love”: “the giving of
                  hope,” “the granting of a kiss,” “the enjoyment of an embrace,” and “the yielding
                  of the whole person” (42). They note the contrast between Capellanus’s dry, scholastic
                  style and the carnal goal toward which he guides his readers. Pondering the strange
                  idea that by performing miscellaneous good deeds a man could be thought to earn and
                  be owed a woman’s love, students give an airing to the perennial question: does the
                  system of courtly love advance or impede women’s empowerment? By the time we get to
                  Capellanus’s series of dialogues demonstrating how men and women of various social
                  classes ought to debate and, it often seems, bicker with one another—the man seeking
                  to initiate a courtship, the woman refusing, and the man sometimes ending the exchange
                  by announcing in defiance that the woman’s words of rejection have given him hope
                  and thus enabled him to achieve the first stage of love—students are eager to discuss
                  whether and where the treatise writer might be joking. That anyone should refer to
                  a script concerning matters so personal often strikes students as uncanny, but Capellanus
                  presents love as a highly formal endeavor, elaborately codified, full of rules.</p>
               <p>With <em>Don Quixote</em> (1605, 1615), about a reader deranged in his attempt to follow the rules he has found
                  in literature, Cervantes launches the modern novel by asking whether readers are ever
                  justified in taking pointers from fiction. While <em>The Amores</em>’s speaker takes it for granted that his readers occupy the same space as himself
                  and can consequently steal his girlfriend and subject matter, <em>Don Quixote </em>notices how strange it can be when a figure crosses from the literary realm into the
                  reader’s. Cervantes’s novel questions the premise upon which the act of taking guidance
                  from any work of fiction seems to be predicated, namely that the literary world is
                  continuous and commensurable with the “real” one, that prescriptions found in one
                  can apply to the other. Don Quixote has in mind the rule that if he ever defeats a
                  giant, he ought to send that giant to his lady as a tribute, but he does not meet
                  any giants in his wanderings; he has to content himself with windmills. The disdain
                  so marked in some responses to Janeite advice-seeking starts here, in the wonder and
                  laughter with which we are invited to greet both the absurd content of the counsel
                  that Don Quixote takes from previous genres and his very assumption that a literary
                  source can accurately guide him.</p>
               <p><em>Don Quixote </em>also explores advice taken from non-textual sources, as we discover when we turn from
                  the novel’s first fourteen chapters to a later inset story called “The Tale of Inappropriate
                  Curiosity.” In this take-down of male sexual jealousy, Anselmo decides to test his
                  wife’s fidelity, asks his best friend Lothario to try her willingness with flattery
                  and gifts, and finds himself betrayed by his wife and friend, who run away together.
                  Before marrying, Anselmo courted his future spouse by using his advisor Lothario as
                  go-between, but after marriage Anselmo becomes the unwitting go-between connecting
                  his wife and friend. I ask students in what relation the tale stands to the surrounding
                  narrative, and we debate whether Anselmo’s skepticism of his wife’s fidelity might
                  be the counterpart to Don Quixote’s readerly credulity: insane, ruinous in its effects,
                  and apt to shape the world into the form it expects. We try to define Anselmo’s motives
                  for testing his wife and for engaging Lothario’s aid, and we conclude by examining
                  René Girard’s famous model of triangular or mediated desire, which we apply not just
                  to the characters in “The Tale” but to Don Quixote’s reading and to modern-day advertising.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The conclusions we have drawn in the first weeks of the course about go-betweens in
                     Ovid, the codification of courtship in Cappelanus, and mediated desire in Cervantes
                     all come into play when we arrive at the eighteenth-century novel. I introduce students
                     to the vehemence of anti-novel sentiment in this period through the handout included
                     in the Appendix to this essay. Examining the handout in class, we observe that some
                     anti-novel warnings, with their visions of female readers misled by novels and falling
                     victim to a kind of textual molestation, seem not just attacks on quixotism but expressions
                     of it. Detractors, we note, often imagined the novel as a pander whose prescriptions
                     for love would link the reader with a seductive fictional character, a corruptive
                     author, or another reader. At this point in the semester, we talk about the female
                     quixotes of the eighteenth-century, those heirs of Don Quixote and ancestors of contemporary
                     Janeites. We read a masterpiece of the French libertine novel, Choderlos de Laclos’s <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> (1782), with its multiple overlapping love triangles and letter writers who destroy
                     the advisees they claim to help. Finally, we consider some of the many scenes in the
                     British novel in which marriage proposals take the form of requests for advice, marriage
                     acceptances the form of counsel. Unlike most of the previous scenes of advising we
                     have encountered, these are dyadic exchanges, with no third-party go-between. Why,
                     we ask, do proposal scenes in Daniel Defoe’s <em>Moll Flanders </em>(1722), Samuel Richardson’s <em>Pamela </em>(1740), and Frances Burney’s <em>Cecelia</em> (1782) insist on this coincidence between declaring love and requesting or dispensing
                     advice?

               <h2><span class="head">*</span></h2>
               <p>In this scene, <em>Emma</em> brilliantly juxtaposes the dyadic advisory model of the eighteenth-century novel’s
                  proposal scenes with the triangular model we examined earlier in the semester. The
                  slipperiness of the triangular model has been causing trouble, of course, throughout
                  Austen’s novel, for Emma Woodhouse has reprised to unhappy effect some of Ovid’s favorite
                  scenarios in her attempts to make matches for friends and acquaintances. Where she
                  intends to preside over a union between two subordinates, she finds herself mistaken
                  for one of the principals, and where she expects to see a grateful advisee, she finds
                  herself saddled with an unexpected rival. Despite these bad precedents, Emma and Knightley’s
                  best chances for happiness appear to them to hinge, in the lead-up to their love scene,
                  upon further love-triangle rearrangements. Imagining that Emma loves Frank Churchill
                  and is heart-broken at the news of his secret engagement to Jane Fairfax, Knightley
                  visits Emma with the plan to “soothe or counsel” her concerning Frank. Emma, in turn,
                  believes that Knightley seeks her encouragement to proceed with a marriage proposal
                  to Harriet. Knightley and Emma would each gladly become the love guide who forms a
                  new couple with one of the original (putative) principals.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>However, although both would like to supplant in the affections of an advisee the
                     person concerning whom they plan to offer love counsel,

                     </div> no supplanting proves necessary, for Emma and Knightley love not Frank and Harriet
                     but one another. Knightley is the first to be released from his misunderstanding.
                     Once Emma has assured him that she does not love Frank, Knightley begins impulsively
                     to “tell you what you will not ask” only to be interrupted with the words “don’t speak
                     it, don’t speak it” from Emma, who, in her eagerness to avoid hearing about Knightley’s
                     love for Harriet, now wishes for the first time to avoid the role of confidante and
                     advisor (429). But Emma relents. She generously invites the man she loves “to ask
                     my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation,” and Knightley now submits
                     himself, uncharacteristically, to Emma’s advice. He agrees to “accept your offer”
                     and “refer myself to you as a friend.” The object of his question to Emma, however,
                     is not Harriet, who “was nothing,” but Emma herself: not three parties but two are
                     in question here (430). The erotic triumph of Emma the advisor comes about not because
                     she detaches her advisee’s affections from a third party but because she proves to
                     have monopolized those affections all along.</p>
               </div>
               <p><em>Emma</em>’s version of the advice-laden proposal scene contains a clue to its popularity among
                  Austen’s eighteenth-century predecessors. Knightley addresses Emma in the following
                  terms: “Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?” (429, 430) Wonderfully,
                  this question keeps the object of Knightley’s love unspecified as ever. It also neglects
                  to pin down the kind of success, namely success in <em>love</em>, that Knightley seeks. Although Knightley wants to know whether he will succeed in
                  winning Emma’s hand, his question seems to ask, “Have I no chance of ever succeeding
                  in life?” or “at anything?” and to demand in answer a prediction of similarly broad
                  scope. The vagueness of the query acknowledges that to Knightley’s sense, any resolution
                  of the pressing uncertainties concerning his fate and future will depend upon Emma’s
                  response. To be in love and in doubt of return is to make the beloved an oracle, the
                  keeper of the answer to the burning questions commonly posed to advisors: “Where shall
                  I look for happiness, where shall I live, and what kind of life shall I lead?”, “Will
                  I win the love of the one I love?”, “Will I ever marry at all?” Because practical
                  considerations of all kinds hang upon the success or failure of a given love relation,
                  requests for love—like requests for advice—get answered with implicit predictions.
                  The beloved becomes wrapped up not just in the desire to love and be loved, but in
                  the desire to know the future.</p>
               <p>The overlap <em>Emma </em>emphasizes between beloved and oracle bears upon the popular image of Austen the advisor.
                  For, of course, Emma does not get to speak her advice to Knightley in phrases the
                  reader can hear. Instead, the narrator summarizes these phrases in her own words.
                  These words appear to offer advice to the female reader about how to respond to a
                  marriage proposal: “What did she say?—Just what she ought, of course. A lady always
                  does.—She said enough to show there need not be despair—and to invite him to say more
                  himself” (431). Like the speaker of <em>The Amores</em>, Austen’s narrator becomes an advising lover to the reader, for her counsel occupies
                  the place of a speech by Emma to Knightley that accepts and declares love even as
                  it advises. The narrator’s Capellanus-like script for courtship brings to fulfillment
                  eighteenth-century fears about the novelist’s demand for the reader’s affection, for
                  even as it <em>says </em>how ladies respond to marriage proposals, it performs a love scene between the narrator
                  and the reader. Although Austen’s narrator advises the reader about how to respond
                  to a third party’s proposal, we gather that the third party will not remain in the
                  picture long. After all, the narrator has just shown us a scene in which triangular
                  advising gives way to dyadic advising: the match the advisor makes is her own. Austen’s
                  love-advisor persona is a lover persona as well. Far from desperate for some real-world
                  third-party lover, the Janeite who pauses over Austen’s love counsel may instead be
                  enjoying the solicitations of Austen’s seductive narrator herself.</p>
               <p>By tracing the literary history of love advice, by linking works of unquestioned excellence
                  and influence not just to Austen but to Austen’s scenes of advising <span class="foreign">per se</span>, students come to see that it need be no put-down of Austen to note that her authorial
                  persona often looks like a counsellor to the reader. Having encountered Austen in
                  the context of a didactic tradition marked by the assumption that, far from purpose-free,
                  novels ought to offer readers instruction in the momentous choices they may face,
                  among them whom to marry, students are well-equipped to track the modern permutations
                  of that tradition. Near the end of the semester, we read <em>Miss Lonelyhearts</em> (1933), the short novel by Nathanael West about an advice columnist driven to despair
                  by the intractability of the problems he is asked to address, and George Saunders’s
                  story “Winky” (2000), about a sad sack who attends a self-help convention and risks
                  losing his best feature, his charitable impulse. We think about the place of advice
                  in popular culture—television comedy, fortune cookies, YouTube videos—and appreciate
                  the sheer complexity of advice-giving as a speech act.</p>
               <p>Instead of attempting to convince students that Austen never sought the advising role
                  with her reader, I invite them to notice the complicated valences of her narrator’s
                  advice: its implicit commentary on established ideas about the role of the author
                  as well as its resonances among Austen’s own plots, the intricate dance by which Austen’s
                  characters develop patterns set in motion by the narrator. Austen’s ability to speak
                  as a bustling Mrs. Bennet at one moment and a sophisticated seducer the next; to give
                  a rule while taking it away, as in the first sentence of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>; to cast us as Elizabeth Bennets, scornfully brushing off counsel, as quixotes, who
                  would deny any boundary between the novel and the real world, and as Mr. Knightleys,
                  making petitions for guidance that seem like requests for love—all this, students
                  end up agreeing, helps make Austen great. Janeite guidebooks might still inflict a
                  social stigma on Austen-reading students, but the pleasures of Austen’s art deliver
                  abundant compensation.</p>
