               <p>I offered an undergraduate seminar titled “Jane Austen and Popular Culture” in my
                  first semester as a full-time faculty member, in 2003. Since then, at two liberal-arts
                  colleges, I have taught versions of a course on Austen and popular culture at every
                  level of undergraduate education, from academic writing courses for first-year students
                  to upper-level research seminars. In both practical and philosophical terms, these
                  experiences have shaped me as a teacher, and they have strongly influenced my research
                  as well. The following account can, I hope, be taken in many different ways: as a
                  reflective, qualitative contribution to the lively ongoing conversation about Austen
                  pedagogy; as a source of ideas and classroom strategies that may be applied more generally
                  to the undergraduate teaching of literature, especially in relation to archives; and
                  as a narrative of professional development that explores the interplay between teaching,
                  writing, and outreach in the relatively under-recognized realm of the undergraduate
                  liberal-arts college.

                           like to acknowledge appreciatively the innovative and creative approaches of McMaster,
                           Folsom, Easton, Duquette, and Gilroy.</span></div>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My first course on Austen and popular culture came about because my new colleagues
                  at Manhattanville College—a small, private liberal-arts college in the New York City
                  suburbs—asked me to invent an upper-level literature course that would appeal to their
                  students, whom they described as having a wide range of abilities. Thinking quickly
                  through my almost-finished dissertation on Austen, Charlotte Brontë, and George Eliot,
                  I decided regretfully that now was not the time to teach <em>Middlemarch</em>. I guessed, however, that even relatively indifferent students would know the 1990s
                  Austen film adaptations—<em>Clueless</em>, at least. So I put together a syllabus that juxtaposed novels and films, with plenty
                  of time to discuss each in depth: <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1811) and Ang Lee’s film (1995); <em>Emma</em> (1815) with Douglas McGrath’s film (1996) and <em>Clueless</em> (1995); and <em>Persuasion</em> (1818) with Roger Michell’s film (1995).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I initially steered clear of Pride and Prejudice in the hope that less well-known
                           Austen works would lead to more nuanced conversations about her popularity. I’ve since
                           made space for P&amp;P by alternating between Sense and Sensibility and Mansfield Park
                           (paired with Patricia Rozema’s audacious film version [1999]). I dropped Persuasion
                           because I found that Michell’s adaptation was just too likeable to lead to substantial
                           discussion.</span></div>
                  </div> As a gesture towards the rest of “popular culture,” I added Arielle Eckstut and Dennis
                  Ashton’s <em>Pride &amp; Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen</em> (2001) and one of Stephanie Barron’s Jane Austen mystery novels. A few essays from <em>Jane Austen in Hollywood</em> contributed some dignity to the proceedings. Each student wrote a short analytical
                  essay about one novel and a long research essay that was to reach through analysis
                  of adaptation to address what I called—and which, indeed, I still think of as—the
                  “big question” of Austen’s popularity today.

                           Manhattanville’s undergraduate students. First, students really rose to the challenge
                           of approaching a film adaptation as an interpretation of an Austen novel for a cinema
                           or television audience. Students who weren’t particularly adept at analyzing Austen’s
                           prose on its own found that they could much more comfortably investigate the consequences
                           of adaptation and appropriation. Second, students engaged very well with criticism
                           of the film versions both in discussion and in their research essays. </span></div>
                  </div>

            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At the time, I didn’t know of anyone else teaching Austen in this way, and I had made
                  no especial effort to consume—much less study—Austen-related popular culture myself.
                  While enrolled in a very traditional doctoral program in literature, following equally
                  traditional undergraduate studies, I learned of <em>Jane Austen in Hollywood</em> only by chance; it was a revelation to find established scholars writing so animatedly
                  about films I had enjoyed.

                           recently in conversation that they insisted that their contributors write accessibly,
                           for an imagined audience of high-school English teachers who would want a fresh angle
                           to share when teaching Austen.</span></div>
                  </div> I had yet to read Claudia Johnson’s influential essay “Austen Cults and Cultures”
                  or Deidre Lynch’s wonderful collection <em>Janeites: Austen’s Disciples and Devotees</em>—which, in any case, would have sailed over the heads of all but one of my Manhattanville
                  students.

                           of Benedict, Brodie, and Halsey.</span></div>
                  </div> On the sole visit I had made to the annual meeting of the Jane Austen Society of North
                  America (JASNA), in 2001, I had been impressed with the fervor of these Austen fans
                  but didn’t have the foresight to seek out fellow academics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Nor did I know if I would offer an Austen and popular culture seminar again. Even
                  if the course worked well once, it seemed entirely possible to me that within a year
                  or so, Austen-mania would have receded far enough into history to be of little interest
                  to undergraduates. Of course, I was laughably wrong about that. 2004 brought Karen
                  Joy Fowler’s novel <em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em>, which not only put the name “Jane Austen” on the New York Times Bestseller list
                  for months but also focused popular attention on why ordinary people might want to
                  read, or re-read, Austen’s novels. 2005 gave us <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em> with Keira Knightley, an adaptation that strongly appealed to young viewers. Based
                  on the wholly unscientific testimony of my own students, audiences in their age group
                  were further diverted by 2007’s <em>Becoming Jane</em> and the film version of <em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em>. <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> (2009) confirmed that the popular Austen, far from being in decline, was in fact immortal
                  (or perhaps just undead).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Several of the 1990s film adaptations of Austen have proved to have enduring appeal
                           among young people as well. My students continue to be reliably familiar with, and
                           sometimes outright memorizers of, Clueless. While the BBC / A&amp;E Pride and Prejudice
                           miniseries was broadcast before this year’s entering college students were born, some
                           have still seen it, largely thanks to mothers or aunts who are Austen fans. Gwyneth
                           Paltrow devotees can be expected to be familiar with the Emma in which she starred
                           (1996), while the truly bookish tend to have found their way to Roger Michell’s Persuasion
                           (1995…</span></div>
                  </div> And every year, one or two of my students brought to class more samples of the plethora
                  of fiction and nonfiction “inspired” by Austen, from romance and vampire novels to
                  dating guides.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In addition to ensuring the continuation of my seminar, this flood of popular Austen
                  material changed my approach to teaching literature at the undergraduate level in
                  several ways. Philosophically, I’ve come to see the importance—I would now say, even,
                  the necessity—of connecting major works of literature to the world that we and our
                  students inhabit as readers, consumers, and creators. (I should acknowledge that very
                  few of my students will pursue graduate study in English.) Considering up-to-the-minute
                  popular works in relation to canonical literature encourages students to move beyond
                  envisioning “the literary tradition” as the monolithic property of their professors,
                  or of anthology editors, and instead to conceive of it as an ongoing conversation
                  in which they themselves are taking part. Through asking how and why a particular
                  Austen-related work might appeal to a mass audience (or not), or by examining the
                  nature of a writer's or filmmaker’s credentials as fan or scholar, students begin
                  thinking in new ways about the significance of literature in the marketplace, as well
                  as about themselves as active participants in reception history.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                           (7)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Austen-related books written by professors, such as Cohen or Amy Elizabeth Smith,
                           can be especially thought-provoking for students to consider.</span></div>
                  </div> Not surprisingly, young creative writers tend to especially appreciate these approaches.
                  Illuminating connections between traditional literary study and students’ wider lives
                  as readers is essential, I would contend, not only to the students’ own future as
                  lifelong learners, but also to the health of a future readership for literature outside
                  the academy—and perhaps for the study of literature within the academy as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Second, in more practical terms, the availability of a huge range of Austen-related
                  resources has allowed me to experiment with incorporating more options and choices
                  for my students, a tactic that has affected how I teach beyond the Austen realm. As
                  I mentioned, in 2003 I had everyone read <em>Pride &amp; Promiscuity</em> and a Stephanie Barron mystery; in the same spirit, I assigned Fowler’s <em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em> the next time I offered the seminar, in 2005. When students in both iterations of
                  the course responded that they didn’t really see the point of devoting class time
                  to those works, I decided to move towards a smorgasbord approach. These days I bring
                  in a few shopping bags full of Austen-inspired books and let each student choose one
                  to read, present, and recommend (or not). To help with the decision-making, I offer
                  a thumbnail description of each, including mention of any particularly eye-opening
                  content, whether gore or sex. Any student who owns and wants to present on a different
                  work is welcome to do so. The ensuing presentations are invariably lively and often
                  very creative, especially when I ask for an accompanying poster. Because these efforts
                  have worked so well, I’ve incorporated both choices of readings and creative projects
                  in several of my other courses as well, to equally good effect.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The smorgasbord approach can also be used for Austen biographies. An example of this
                           approach from a non-Austen course is to assign an anthology of short stories and ask
                           each student to read one and recommend it—or not—for the whole class to read, with
                           an explanation of her/his choice based on reasons beyond (but perhaps including) personal
                           liking. By justifying her/his selection, each student experiences, in a small way,
                           what we teachers do when putting together our syllabi, and sharing those reasons adds
                           depth to ensuing discussions. Creative projects, I’ve found, are especially beneficial

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I responded to the avalanche of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>-related material in another way, too: by creating a first-year seminar course for
                  Manhattanville that was devoted to <em>P&amp;P</em> and its adaptations. General-education standards required that each seminar focus
                  on principles of critical analysis, which turned out to be very well suited to a novel
                  that concentrates so much on mistaken judgments and faulty reasoning. Austen’s themes
                  of decision-making and self-discovery also fit nicely with the students’ efforts to
                  acclimate to their new college environment. In accordance with my usual preference
                  for depth over breadth, we spent about half of each course reading and discussing
                  the novel, which proved especially advantageous with first-year students who were
                  unlikely to be prospective English majors. The course culminated with a research essay
                  in which each student developed a topic related to the novel and its adaptations in
                  light of scholarly criticism. At their best, these essays were as strong as the ones
                  produced in my upper-level seminar, thanks in part to the many stages of preparation
                  the first-year seminar made possible.

               <p>In addition to affecting me as a teacher, all the time I was spending with Austen-related
                  popular culture in the classroom began to influence me professionally as well. The
                  great hope of the liberal arts college is that faculty will find ways to bring their
                  research interests into the classroom and their teaching experiences into their research,
                  and I’ve certainly done both to a degree I couldn’t have dreamed of initially. I started
                  by keeping up, for the sake of my courses, with popular material on Austen as well
                  as with the growing body of relevant critical work. As I educated myself in this (to
                  me) new area of study, I found myself wanting to contribute to it, a desire that over
                  time led to the decision to write my book <em>Everybody’s Jane: Austen in the Popular Imagination</em>.

                           On-Line. I’ve subsequently assigned upper-level seminar students to choose and present
                           an article from that special issue, which, like Persuasions generally, features reliably

               <p>Presenting and writing on Austen and popular culture brought me into closer contact
                  with JASNA, which in turn opened up new opportunities to connect students with the
                  wider world of Austen’s readers and fans. I started small, by taking individual students
                  to regional meetings of the society and by encouraging bolder ones to attend meetings
                  by themselves and report back. After several years’ involvement with the New York
                  region of JASNA, I was invited to coordinate a symposium at Manhattanville in March
                  2010, on a topic of my choice. The theme “Inspired by Austen” allowed me to showcase
                  a wide variety of people whose professional and personal lives had been affected in
                  some way by Austen.

                  about popular Austen-related works and in a structured conversation with the JASNA
                  members, the majority of whom were over sixty years old. Watching and listening to
                  these authors and readers of all ages talk about their shared appreciation of Austen

                  Collection. Alberta Burke was a 1928 Goucher alumna who dedicated her life to assembling
                  and curating a uniquely wide-ranging collection of Austeniana that includes everything
                  from first editions and manuscript letters, to Regency contextual sources, to translations,

            <p>The proximity of the Burke Collection has made possible assignments and activities
               that go well beyond conventional historical and contextual research. Alberta Burke
               was passionate about reading from her historic editions; she did so in order to share
               as closely as possible the experience of Austen’s original readers. In that spirit,
               I have asked students to visit Special Collections and Archives, to read from a first
               or early edition of one of the Austen novels assigned for class, and to write about
               the experience. I asked students to consider the following questions as they encountered
               Austen’s text through the form of the historical edition: </p>
            <dl>
               <dt></dt>
               <dd>Do you find yourself reading differently—perhaps more quickly or more slowly, or noticing
                  different things—when handling this edition?</dd>
               <dt></dt>
               <dd>How does the physical form of the book—its size, shape, printing, and quality of paper—affect
                  your reading experience?</dd>
               <dt></dt>
               <dd>Does your knowledge of Alberta Burke as a Goucher alumna and collector affect your
                  appreciation of this Austen volume? If so, how?</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Here are some of the students’ (unedited) responses: <span class="quote">‘I felt, however fleeting, connected to Austen’s time. … All of the sensory aspects
                  of the book—the yellowed, stained pages, the faded ink, the “old book smell”—combined
                  to put me into the world of Hartfield and Highbury and Donwell Abbey. Physically however,
                  the text startled me. I found myself counting the words per line—as if I were reading
                  a poem. ’</span> <span class="quote">‘The reading experience definitely differed from the others I had with this text [<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>]. I felt almost as if I read it for the first time again, and the very first sentence
                  made me wonder whether it would be taken seriously by the contemporary audience, at
                  least during first reading.’</span> <span class="quote">‘It is interesting to think that these volumes, which now have specific rules for
                  handling them and such, were just books to be read for pleasure by people who, I am
                  supposing, enjoyed reading them as much as I do.’</span> <span class="quote">‘Typically when I read, I curl up in a chair or in my bed. … Now I sat with remarkably
                  held posture and two hands on the book, which rested on foam supports on the desk
                  in front of me. I was forced to be a bit more civilized due to the pricelessness of
                  the historic book I sat studying. My stature was in fact quite fitting of the novel’s
                  time. I venture to say that my imagination, prodded by the historical edition in my
                  hands, allowed me to more readily enter the world of Elizabeth Bennet.’</span> <span class="quote">‘I did notice small stains and marks on each page, presumably left by previous readers.
                  This made me consider the fact that readers before me have left their presence behind,
                  like a signature. I feel that part of the value in an old book is that it has been
                  used by so many different people, each of whom likely had a slightly different experience
                  while reading it.’</span> Acute and thoroughly personal, these responses demonstrate that the experiment achieved
               just what I had hoped for: focusing students’ attention on the way that a book as
               historical, physical object affects both how we read and how we think about ourselves
               as reading.</p>
            <p>Whole-class visits to the Burke Collection offer a different opportunity for expanding
               students’ understanding of an Austen novel. After discussing <em>Northanger Abbey</em>, students in an intermediate-level literature course spent a class session looking
               at and reading from first and early editions of that novel, as well as contextual
               sources from the Regency period. Below are some of the answers students submitted
               anonymously to my request for feedback on the experience. (My questions are in italics.)

               <dt></dt>
               <dd>I felt closer to the book by looking at the older versions of it. I learned there
                  were two separately published volumes which made me think about how we publish books
                  differently today.</dd>

               <dt></dt>
               <dd>I liked looking at some of the other sources in the collection, like <em>The Mysteries of Udolpho</em> and the book about Bath [Christopher Anstey, <em>The New Bath Guide, or, Useful Pocket Companion</em> (1799)], which helped me understand the references Austen makes in <em>Northanger Abbey</em>. [This student subsequently incorporated Anstey’s <em>Guide</em> into her research essay for the course, certainly a desirable outcome.]</dd>
               <dt></dt>
               <dd>Seeing first editions of <em>The Mysteries of Udolpho</em> and other period novels helped me to connect with Jane Austen and Catherine.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p> As I plan future teaching, I will continue to refine my approach to introducing Burke
               Collection material to students, especially at the introductory and intermediate levels,
               with the aim of creating a more substantial pedagogical experience.</p>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Among the wide variety of published work on the teaching of Austen, I would especially
               like to acknowledge appreciatively the innovative and creative approaches of McMaster,
               Folsom, Easton, Duquette, and Gilroy.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">I initially steered clear of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> in the hope that less well-known Austen works would lead to more nuanced conversations
               about her popularity. I’ve since made space for <em>P&amp;P</em> by alternating between <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> and <em>Mansfield Park</em> (paired with Patricia Rozema’s audacious film version [1999]). I dropped <em>Persuasion</em> because I found that Michell’s adaptation was just too likeable to lead to substantial
               discussion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Two aspects of this course were especially successful, given the academic level of
               Manhattanville’s undergraduate students. First, students really rose to the challenge
               of approaching a film adaptation as an interpretation of an Austen novel for a cinema
               or television audience. Students who weren’t particularly adept at analyzing Austen’s
               prose on its own found that they could much more comfortably investigate the consequences
               of adaptation and appropriation. Second, students engaged very well with criticism
               of the film versions both in discussion and in their research essays. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield, the editors of <em>Jane Austen in Hollywood</em>, told me recently in conversation that they insisted that their contributors write
               accessibly, for an imagined audience of high-school English teachers who would want
               a fresh angle to share when teaching Austen.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Especially useful in the undergraduate classroom, I have since found, are the works
               of Benedict, Brodie, and Halsey.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Several of the 1990s film adaptations of Austen have proved to have enduring appeal
               among young people as well. My students continue to be reliably familiar with, and
               sometimes outright memorizers of, <em>Clueless</em>. While the BBC / A&amp;E <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> miniseries was broadcast before this year’s entering college students were born,
               some have still seen it, largely thanks to mothers or aunts who are Austen fans. Gwyneth
               Paltrow devotees can be expected to be familiar with the <em>Emma</em> in which she starred (1996), while the truly bookish tend to have found their way
               to Roger Michell’s <em>Persuasion</em> (1995).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Austen-related books written by professors, such as Cohen or Amy Elizabeth Smith,
               can be especially thought-provoking for students to consider.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">The smorgasbord approach can also be used for Austen biographies. An example of this
               approach from a non-Austen course is to assign an anthology of short stories and ask
               each student to read one and recommend it—or not—for the whole class to read, with
               an explanation of her/his choice based on reasons beyond (but perhaps including) personal
               liking. By justifying her/his selection, each student experiences, in a small way,
               what we teachers do when putting together our syllabi, and sharing those reasons adds
               depth to ensuing discussions. Creative projects, I’ve found, are especially beneficial
               to include in required courses, as a way of engaging students who didn’t choose to
               be there. In my British literature survey course, for example, each student develops
               a “personal canon project” that, in any medium, highlights and reflects on works from
               the syllabus with which she/he takes a particular interest or feels a particular connection.
               In any course, creative projects allow students to combine literature with their other
               interests and expertise, which many students tell me they appreciate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">I first dipped my toe into writing about Austen and popular culture with a short article
               on the 2005 <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> film for a special issue of JASNA’s journal <em><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol27no2/wells.htm">Persuasions On-Line</a></em>.

               article from that special issue, which, like <em>Persuasions</em> generally, features reliably accessible, clear writing.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               authors of the memoir <em>Every Mother is a Daughter</em> (who are also, respectively, a retired English professor turned young-adult novelist
