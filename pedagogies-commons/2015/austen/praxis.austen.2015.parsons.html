            <p class="noCount">As part of a fall 2011 honors seminar on Jane and the Austenites, my students analyzed
               various cinematic adapations of Austen's novels. When they viewed a clip involving
               Alan Rickman, who played Colonel Brandon in Ang Lee's production of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1995), they immediately linked the actor to his role as Professor Severus Snape
               in the Harry Potter films. This essay examines how students utilized their knowledge
               of the Harry Potter series and films as a gateway for a close reading of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. Their understanding and affinity for Snape provided a blueprint for unlocking Colonel
               Brandon's emotions, motives, and the way he conducts himself in tension-filled situations.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Colonel Snape’s Veritaserum: Teaching Jane Austen in a Harry Potter World</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Jane Austen is one of those rare authors whose novels and life story transcends time
               and a multitude of boundaries. As a clergyman’s daughter, her literary prowess was
               influenced by the dynamics of family and village life. Because she published her novels
               anonymously, only her family and a few friends were aware of her accomplishments when
               she died in 1817. Yet, from the publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh’s <em>Memoir of Jane Austen</em> in 1870 to the release of the film <em>Becoming Jane</em> in 2007, interest in Jane Austen’s life and novels have grown unabatedly. As I was
               planning my fall 2011 honors seminar titled “Jane and the Austenites,” I was unsure
               how familiar my students would be with Austen’s life and work. Besides undertaking
               a close reading of the novels for the insights they provided on marriage, class, finance,
               genteel society and Regency culture, my goal was to examine the development of Austen’s
               popularity in American and British culture and how her life and work had been bifurcated
               between academic scholarship and popular culture. Because this generation of students
               has such a strong visual orientation, a major aspect of the seminar was to analyze
               the ways in which cinematic adaptations of Austen’s novels and life have driven her
               canonical and celebrity status.</p>
            <p>While many of my students had seen <em>Becoming Jane</em> and the Keira Knightley version of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (2005), they were unfamiliar with the contributions Colin Firth had made to our understanding
               of Mr. Darcy or with the fact that Emma Thompson had written the screenplay for the
               Ang Lee production of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1995). More shocking than the realization that several students had never read a
               single page of Austen’s novels was their reaction to seeing Colonel Brandon’s appearance
               in the cinematic version of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. When we first meet the Colonel, it is his undivided attention to Marianne’s performance,
               where she sings and accompanies herself at the pianoforte, that denotes him as a gentleman
               and a man of deep thought. Yet, my students saw nothing of Brandon’s intellect or
               penetrating reflection. They squealed “Professor Snape!” in delight as though they
               had been re-introduced to a beloved mentor from their childhood. At that moment, Austen’s
               novel had entered the <em>Harry Potter</em> paradigm, and we had to find a way to link the two characters’ personal histories
               and motives as a means to draw my students’ attention back to Colonel Brandon and
               <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. This essay will highlight the various ways in which we were able to connect these
               two disparate characters. It will show how utilizing students’ knowledge of Professor
               Snape and the <em>Harry Potter</em> series gave them easier access to understanding Colonel Brandon’s interactions with
               other characters, as well as his reactions to various events, and provided a gateway
               for close readings of Jane Austen’s novels.</p>
            <p>Students respond so enthusiastically to both Austen and J.K. Rowling’s novels for
               a variety of reasons. On a basic level, when they start reading they get lost in the
               story. They escape into another world which allows them to momentarily forget their
               problems or concerns. Students find themselves on the front line of the action with
               the knowledge that no harm will come their way. The circumstances Austen and Rowling’s
               characters encounter are similar in several ways to what many students today experience,
               as they too have well-meaning parents whose agendas for their careers may differ from
               their own interests. Their family dynamics are also comparable: their parents may
               have very contrasting personalities, they may be raised by a single parent, or their
               siblings may not share their altruistic goals. They mingle with the opposite sex at
               social events where casual conversation may occur over dessert, or they might listen
               to live music together. The threat of conflict—whether it be war in a foreign country
               or acts of terrorism at home—appears in both Austen and Rowling’s novels and in their
               own lives. Several students have noted that reading how fictional characters responded
               to a personal irritation such as a gossiping mother, immature siblings, or childhood
               bullies influenced their own reactions to similar situations.</p>
            <p>On an intensely personal level, students are attracted to Austen and Rowling’s novels
               because they identify with specific characters. My female students saw themselves
               in Elizabeth Bennet, Elinor Dashwood, and Anne Elliot. Many wanted to be Elizabeth
               Bennet, and not just because she married Fitzwilliam Darcy. For them, Elizabeth was
               snarky. They acknowledged her judgment errors, but were inspired by her determination
               to stand her ground as she turned down marriage proposals by Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy,
               or when she defended her integrity and principles to Lady Catherine de Bourgh. My
               male students tended to identify with Mr. Darcy. They admired how well he ran his
               estate, his good standing in Derbyshire, and his ability to see through scheming women.
               While students were inclined to view Mr. Darcy as the definition of a gentleman, they
               were also mesmerized by his and Elizabeth’s banter. Many students openly acknowledged
               that these lively exchanges were what they wanted in their own personal relationships.
               </p>
            <p>My students had grown up reading the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, and for them the books are cherished friends to whom they continually return.
               As we discussed their attachment to the series, many revealed how they identified
               with a particular character that then helped them deal with whatever issues they faced
               as they were maturing. It might be Harry Potter, whose miserable childhood at the
               Dursley’s taught him how to stand up to bullies, read people’s motives, and empathize
               with others who were facing difficult situations; Luna Lovegood, who always appeared
               to be comfortable in her own skin and reveled in genuine friendships; or Hermione
               Granger, who knew that her critical thinking skills were her greatest asset. After
               all, Viktor Krum, the seeker for the Bulgarian National Quidditch team, had a legion
               of female Hogwarts students following his every move during his participation in the
               Triwizard Tournament, yet he chose to spend his free time in the Hogwarts library
               so he could be near her.</p>
            <p>I understood their affinity for Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna, but Snape—head
               of Slytherin, a reformed Death Eater, and a bitter man who rarely uttered a positive
               word? What did he offer my students? How did his character provide consolation in
               times of need? What did he teach my students about themselves and their world? I was
               perplexed at how Severus Snape with his “greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow
               skin” (<em>Sorcerer’s Stone</em> 126) was synonymous with Colonel Brandon, who although being “on the wrong side of
               five and thirty” had an “appearance….[that] was not unpleasing” (<em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em> 27). Colonel Brandon was unassuming and had a tendency to blend into the environment.
               Although well-liked and respected by all who befriended him, he is defined by his
               gravity, reserve and, to Marianne Dashwood’s disapproval, a liking of “flannel waistcoats”
               (<em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em> 30). How could my students possibly see Professor Snape in him? Everything about
               Snape commands attention, whether it is his ability to hold his students’ attention
               in the palm of his hand by speaking “in barely more than a whisper,” (<em>Sorcerer’s Stone</em> 136), possessing eyes that “were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels”
               (<em>Sorcerer’s Stone</em> 136), or by alternating a “very cold voice” (<em>Chamber of Secrets</em> 78) with one that “snapped” (<em>Chamber of Secrets</em> 79), “roared” (<em>Chamber of Secrets</em> 187), and even “snarled” (<em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> 171). Severus is not a man to cross even in the best of times. But when we probed
               deeper at these two gentlemen’s countenances, we found much hidden beneath their exteriors.</p>
            <p>Alan Rickman has been celebrated for his masterful depiction of Professor Severus
               Snape in the <em>Harry Potter</em> films. He has also garnered critical attention in the Austen scholarship for his
               portrayal of Colonel Brandon in the Ang Lee production of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. In this particular role Rickman was noted for “convey[ing] particularly well the
               saturnine melancholy of a man who has been disappointed in love but takes a chance
               on loving again” (Sue Parrill 37). While Penny Gay’s critique of the film focuses
               on the ways in which Rickman’s costumes transform Colonel Brandon “into the image
               of the romantic Byronic hero” and as an ex-military man into something “splendidly
               virile in his red-coated colonel’s dress uniform” (Gay 98), she also concedes that
               it was Alan Rickman “who br[ought] to the role a brooding sexual presence” (106).
               Cheryl L. Nixon is more circumspect when she contrasts the Colonel Brandon that we
               find in Austen’s novel to the one in the Lee production and claims that “the film
               rema[de] Brandon into a standard-bearer of true emotion” (39) Since one of the goals
               of the seminar was to undertake a close reading of Austen’s novels, I wanted my students
               to focus on her command of language and the precision of her word choice. In looking
               for similarities between Colonel Brandon and Professor Snape, I expected them to rely
               on the respective narratives and provide textual evidence for their ideas.</p>
            <p>We began our study of Snape and Brandon by analyzing the factors that make Professor
               Snape’s character the most complex in the series, and the ways in which his conflicted
               emotions drive the narrative at key moments. We talked about his never-ending love
               for his childhood friend Lily Potter, how he was unable to protect her from Lord Voldemort,
               and the grief he suffered at her death. I challenged my students to find similar constructions
               in Colonel Brandon. I asked them to consider how the Colonel’s past is similar to
               Snape’s, and the ways in which Marianne Dashwood’s life and actions are similar to
               that of Harry Potter. My goal was to get them to see that the Colonel is also a man
               of complexity–to make them question what was hidden behind his mask. My students needed
               to probe beyond his veil of silence and gravity to understand <em>why</em> he is so well-liked and respected by those who call him friend and what he has to
               offer Marianne as a life partner.</p>
            <p>It is the complexity of the two characters—their concern for the well-being of others,
               the passion that hides behind their impenetrable masks, and overall their capacity
               to love—that connects them. Both epitomize the definition of gentlemen in their respective
               worlds, and both suffered a tragic loss that is the defining moment in their lives.
               Snape and Brandon are private men who keep their personal feelings to themselves.
               They teach us to dive deep beneath the surface before we pass judgment on their motives
               and integrity. As Harry continues to doubt Snape’s allegiance to the Order of the
               Phoenix during the second war with Voldemort, Remus Lupin reminds him that “Dumbledore
               trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us” (<em>Half-Blood Prince</em> 332). In the Order’s discussion of Snape’s involvement in Dumbledore’s death and
               their disbelief that he could be capable of such a heinous act, Professor McGonagall
               reveals that “[Dumbledore] always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting
               Snape…” (<em>Half-Blood Prince</em> 616). That reason—the protection of Harry Potter as he grows from infant to adult—was
               not revealed outside the Order until Harry’s final duel with Voldemort. I asked students
               where they found similar instances of daring and bravery in Colonel Brandon.</p>
            <p>Students discussed Colonel Brandon’s reaction to Marianne Dashwood’s musical performance
               where “[h]e paid her only the compliment of attention” (<em>Sense and Sensibility</em> 27) and which set his response against the over-the-top ones by Sir John and Lady
               Middleton. His silence was their first clue that there is more to Brandon that what
               meets the eye. Their second clue came during Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, and Marianne’s
               subsequent discussion of the Colonel. Although Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor are impressed
               by him, Marianne complains “[b]ut he talked of flannel waistcoats…and with me a flannel
               waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species
               of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble” (<em>Sense and Sensibility</em> 30). Eileen Sutherland reminds us that when Marianne complains about the waistcoat
               she is actually revealing “her naiveté and ignorance of the world” (58). Growing up
               in a sheltered environment, she does not realize that she “should have connected it
               with danger, endurance, and courage…” (Sutherland 58). The disconnect between the
               clothing accessory and what it actually symbolizes leads to further discussion on
               Colonel Brandon and his time in the East Indies. Elinor tells Marianne and Willoughby
               that the Colonel “has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad; has read, and
               has a thinking mind” (<em>Sense and Sensibility</em> 39). Yet, Marianne only recalls his complaints that “the climate is hot, and the
               mosquitoes are troublesome” (<em>Sense and Sensibility</em> 39). Marianne (and Willoughby) displays no understanding of the British government’s
               concern over a “revival of French power” (Roberts 96) or the possibly of a French
               invasion on English soil. Because the Colonel does not talk in detail about his time
               abroad, we do not know what he experienced. Did he perform heroically on the battlefield?
               Did he watch one of his close friends die? Did his experiences abroad lead to his
               promotion to Colonel? Tim Fulford persuasively argues that Austen was more focused
               on “the contexts of those battles and [parliamentary] bills, away from the public
               arena, in the country as a whole” (163). We needed to stop and consider how the Napoleonic
               wars and the English militia’s foreign postings affected village life and those who
               had valiantly served their country. While Willoughby has youth and a certain amount
               of swagger on his side, Brandon is the more formidable man when we consider his credentials
               and experiences. Marianne has to experience her own close encounter with death before
               she can see past Willoughby’s façade.</p>
            <p>Colonel Brandon’s military experiences then led to a comparison of his and Professor
               Snape’s personal integrity. Students recalled that Snape had never been popular when
               he was a student at Hogwarts. He loathed James Potter and his friends Sirius Black
               and Remus Lupin. Even though Potter and Black taunted and publicly humiliated him,
               Snape did not turn his back on Lupin when he truly needed his help. Snape successfully
               concocts the Wolfsbane potion for Remus Lupin every month so that when the full moon
               causes his transformation into a werewolf, he can retain his mental faculties and
               position as teacher of the Defense Against the Dark Arts course—a position that Snape
               openly coveted. As for Colonel Brandon, we considered his sensitivity to others in
               embarrassing or distressing situations. For instance, when Mrs. Jennings attempts
               to discover the identity of the young man who has captured Elinor’s heart, the Colonel
               follows Lady Middleton’s lead in the discussion on the weather by adding commentary
               on the rain and thereby shutting down the enquiry. When he hears that Edward Ferrars
               has been disinherited by his mother because of his engagement to Lucy Steele, Brandon
               attempts to rectify Edward’s financial destitution by offering him the modest living
               at Delaford. Due to the delicacy of the situation and his unease at disclosing the
               reasons why he wants to make this offer, he asks that Elinor approach Edward for him.
               The Colonel tells her that “[t]he cruelty…of dividing, or attempting to divide, two
               young people long attached to each other, is terrible—Mrs. Ferrars does not know what
               she may be doing—what she may drive her son to” (<em>Sense and Sensibility</em> 213). The Colonel does not want to see another good man endure pain and misery just
               because his vocational endeavors or romantic liaisons do not meet a parent’s expectations
               or financial needs. Furthermore, Colonel Brandon watches Marianne and Willoughby’s
               interactions and believes, as do others, that they are secretly engaged. After Willoughby
               coldly ends their friendship, and while Colonel Brandon never believes there is a
               sliver of hope of Marianne looking favorably toward him, he visits the Miss Dashwoods
               regularly while they are in London. He tries to ascertain Marianne’s mental and emotional
               states either by watching her demeanor or talking with Elinor. The Colonel shows concern
               for Marianne’s well-being even when he has nothing to gain.</p>
            <p>I want to go back for a moment to my earlier questions regarding my students’ affinity
               for Professor Snape. What he offered or taught them about themselves and their world
               involved the ability to love, the luck of finding one’s soul mate as a young adult,
               and the need to honor and respect that love when tragedy strikes. Only when it is
               absolutely necessary do he and Colonel Brandon reveal the reason for their silence,
               gravity, and disconnect. Indeed, the over-arching theme that connects Colonel Brandon
               to Professor Snape is the love and companionship the two men found with Eliza and
               Lily Evans during their childhoods. These two girls were more than just their best
               friends. They were the loves of their lives. Different circumstances led both to lose
               their loves at an early age. At 17, Eliza entered a loveless marriage with Colonel
               Brandon’s older brother as a means to secure financially his father’s estate. Severus
               Snape’s loss of Lily Evans was much more gradual. At age 11, both entered Hogwarts
               School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Although the sorting hat placed them in rival houses,
               Lily tried to maintain her friendship with Severus. This was made more difficult by
               his friendships with soon-to-be Death Eaters and his fascination with the Dark Arts.
               Even though Lily attempted to come to Snape’s aid while he was being taunted by James
               Potter, his calling her a “<span class="foreign">Mudblood</span>” was the catalyst for her terminating the friendship (<em>Deathly Hallows</em> 675). Snape tried to apologize later, but Lily told him in no uncertain terms that
               “[y]ou’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine” (<em>Deathly Hallows</em> 676). Snape never stops loving Lily.</p>
            <p>After Lily Potter’s death, it was Albus Dumbledore who showed Snape the “way forward”
               (<em>Deathly Hallows</em> 678). Lily’s one-year-old son, Harry, was the only known wizard to have survived
               the killing curse. Dumbledore realized that when Voldemort returned to power, Harry’s
               life would be in danger. To ensure that Lily had not died in vain, he wanted Snape’s
               help in protecting the child. He secured Snape’s alliance after revealing that Harry
               “has her eyes, precisely her eyes” (<em>Deathly Hallows</em> 678). Every time Snape looks Harry in the eye he sees Lily. To conceal his concern
               for Harry’s well-being, he uses his loathing of James Potter to create the veneer
               of contempt and the taunts that follow Harry’s every move at Hogwarts. As Snape is
               dying from the wounds inflicted by Nagini, Voldemort’s snake, memories “gushed from
               his mouth and his ears and his eyes…” (<em>Deathly Hallows</em> 657). Snape gives Harry 18 different memories that involve his mother and which reveal
               his close friendship with her, his attempts to protect her and Harry, his loyalty
               to Dumbledore, and the role he played as a double agent in trying to secure Harry’s
               safety and the destruction of the Dark Lord. It is only in the face of death that
               Harry discovered the real man and uncovered his acts of bravery.</p>
            <p>When we turned our attention to <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, we examined the scene between Elinor and Brandon at Mrs. Jennings’s home in London.
               When Marianne is suffering from Willoughby’s rejection, Colonel Brandon tries to ease
               her pain by revealing to Elinor his knowledge of Willoughby’s relationships with other
               women. It is at this point we learn about the Eliza whom he loved and lost, his actions
               in ensuring that she did not die alone or in squalor, her daughter Eliza Williams
               to whom he acts as a dutiful guardian, and how this young woman’s downfall came at
               the hands of Willoughby. Colonel Brandon tells Elinor he reveals this information
               in hopes of providing “lasting conviction to your sister’s mind” (152). Yet, Colonel
               Brandon also concedes that he sees “a very strong resemblance between [Eliza and Marianne],
               as well in mind and person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy
               and spirits” (153). He lays bare the intense pain he and his guardian have suffered
               as a means to contextualize Willoughby’s perfidy and Marianne’s escape. When my students
               started questioning whether the Colonel saw Marianne as Marianne or as a substitute
               Eliza, I knew we were discussing Austen’s characters based on their own identity and
               unique qualities rather than a cinematic casting of actors, and that Professor Snape
               was now allowed to remain off-stage.</p>
            <p>Due to my Jane Austen students’ enthusiasm for the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, I created a new honors seminar on “Harry Potter and the Quest for Enlightenment”
               which debuted in spring 2012. Now that I possess deeper knowledge of the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, I know <em>how</em> I could have incorporated my Austen students’ enthusiasm for <em>Harry Potter</em> better into Jane Austen’s novels.</p>
            <p>When we read Austen and Rowling’s texts, we find many instances where characters are
               obsessed with their status in their community. In fearing that her nephew has proposed
               to a woman “of no importance in the world” (<em>Pride and Prejudice</em> 271) Lady Catherine de Bourgh haughtily informs Elizabeth Bennet of the irrevocable
               harm her marriage to Mr. Darcy will bring him and his family. She is so focused on
               their differing stations in life that she does not consider the emotional maturation
               or fortitude that Elizabeth possesses which will allow her to act as Mr. Darcy’s partner
               and not as his trophy wife. On his initial train ride to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
               and Wizardry, Draco Malfoy tells Harry Potter that “[y]ou’ll soon find out some wizarding
               families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends
               with the wrong sort” (<em>Sorcerer’s Stone</em> 108). Harry had just met Ron Weasley, who comes from a close-knit, pure-blood wizarding
               family and who does not judge others by their blood status. If we had focused our
               discussions more closely on status and class, we could have critiqued how misguided
               ideals adversely affect specific characters’ actions and the community as a whole.
               We could have related the Black family’s ownership of <em>Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy</em> (<em>Order of the Phoenix</em> 116) to Sir Walter’s constant perusal of “the Baronetage” (<em>Persuasion</em> 9). What does their preoccupation reveal about their own fears regarding an evolving
               society? Finally, I would have asked my students to analyze women’s lives in Austen
               and Rowling’s novels. What opportunities do Austen’s heroines have to pursue their
               interests? How does this compare to Amelia Bones, who is the Head of the Department
               of Magical Law Enforcement; Poppy Pomfrey, who is the Hogwarts school nurse; or Nymphadora
               Tonks, who is an Auror? How do Austen’s female characters make valuable contributions
               to their families and their communities? What do both authors have to say about the
               importance of motherhood? We could have judged Mrs. Dashwood’s attempts to advance
               Elinor and Edward’s courtship and her growing regard for Colonel Brandon to Molly
               Weasley’s affections for her seven children and her ability to kill Bellatrix Lestrange
               during the Battle of Hogwarts after a deadly curse nearly missed striking her only
               daughter. In Austen and Rowling’s novels we find several demonstrations of the extreme
               lengths mothers will go to protect the opportunities and lives of their children.
               We could have charted these actions throughout the <em>Harry Potter</em> series and in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> and <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.</p>
            <p>Utilizing Professor Snape as the lens through which to view Colonel Brandon allowed
               my students to build a foundation upon which to critique characters motives and interactions
               with their peers more succinctly. As they became more familiar with Austen’s novels,
               they were able to offer detailed analyses of specific scenes and explain how what
               was left unsaid may have been more revealing than what was divulged. Through their
               perusal of first-edition Austen novels in our university library’s special collections
               department, several students discussed the thrill of holding volume one and reading
               the opening paragraphs as Austen’s readers had once done. They were momentarily transported
               back into the eighteenth century. Austen’s readers were as excited to read her novels
               as my students were to read the latest installment in the <em>Harry Potter</em> series. As teachers we can channel this excitement and emphasize the ways in which
               popular culture holds clues to the canon of the future. In 1811, who would have thought
               that the anonymous author of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> would develop such a strong, devout following of fans? In making connections between
               Austen’s characters, settings, and language to that of J.K. Rowling's, we help students
               understand why novels of earlier centuries can retain their appeal in a post-modern
               world.</p>
