                <p>I offered an undergraduate seminar titled “Jane Austen and Popular Culture” in my
                    first semester as a full-time faculty member, in 2003. Since then, at two
                    liberal-arts colleges, I have taught versions of a course on Austen and popular
                    culture at every level of undergraduate education, from academic writing courses
                    for first-year students to upper-level research seminars. In both practical and
                    philosophical terms, these experiences have shaped me as a teacher, and they
                    have strongly influenced my research as well. The following account can, I hope,
                    be taken in many different ways: as a reflective, qualitative contribution to
                    the lively ongoing conversation about Austen pedagogy; as a source of ideas and
                    classroom strategies that may be applied more generally to the undergraduate
                    teaching of literature, especially in relation to archives; and as a narrative
                    of professional development that explores the interplay between teaching,
                    writing, and outreach in the relatively under-recognized realm of the
                    undergraduate liberal-arts college.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Among the
                        wide variety of published work on the teaching of Austen, I would especially
                        like to acknowledge appreciatively the innovative and creative approaches of
                        McMaster, Folsom, Easton, Duquette, and Gilroy.</note>
                </p>
                <p>My first course on Austen and popular culture came about because my new
                    colleagues at Manhattanville College—a small, private liberal-arts college in
                    the New York City suburbs—asked me to invent an upper-level literature course
                    that would appeal to their students, whom they described as having a wide range
                    of abilities. Thinking quickly through my almost-finished dissertation on
                    Austen, Charlotte Brontë, and George Eliot, I decided regretfully that now was
                    not the time to teach <title level="m">Middlemarch</title>. I guessed, however,
                    that even relatively indifferent students would know the 1990s Austen film
                        adaptations—<title level="m">Clueless</title>, at least. So I put together a
                    syllabus that juxtaposed novels and films, with plenty of time to discuss each
                    in depth: <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1811) and Ang Lee’s
                    film (1995); <title level="m">Emma</title> (1815) with Douglas McGrath’s film
                    (1996) and <title level="m">Clueless</title> (1995); and <title level="m"
                        >Persuasion</title> (1818) with Roger Michell’s film (1995).<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> I initially steered clear of <title level="m"
                            >Pride and Prejudice</title> in the hope that less well-known Austen
                        works would lead to more nuanced conversations about her popularity. I’ve
                        since made space for <title level="m">P&amp;P</title> by alternating between
                            <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> and <title level="m"
                            >Mansfield Park</title> (paired with Patricia Rozema’s audacious film
                        version [1999]). I dropped <title level="m">Persuasion</title> because I
                        found that Michell’s adaptation was just too likeable to lead to substantial
                        discussion. </note> As a gesture towards the rest of “popular culture,” I
                    added Arielle Eckstut and Dennis Ashton’s <title level="m">Pride &amp;
                        Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen</title> (2001) and one of
                    Stephanie Barron’s Jane Austen mystery novels. A few essays from <title
                        level="m">Jane Austen in Hollywood</title> contributed some dignity to the
                    proceedings. Each student wrote a short analytical essay about one novel and a
                    long research essay that was to reach through analysis of adaptation to address
                    what I called—and which, indeed, I still think of as—the “big question” of
                    Austen’s popularity today.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Two aspects of this
                        course were especially successful, given the academic level of
                        Manhattanville’s undergraduate students. First, students really rose to the
                        challenge of approaching a film adaptation as an interpretation of an Austen
                        novel for a cinema or television audience. Students who weren’t particularly
                        adept at analyzing Austen’s prose on its own found that they could much more
                        comfortably investigate the consequences of adaptation and appropriation.
                        Second, students engaged very well with criticism of the film versions both
                        in discussion and in their research essays. </note></p>
                <p>At the time, I didn’t know of anyone else teaching Austen in this way, and I had
                    made no especial effort to consume—much less study—Austen-related popular
                    culture myself. While enrolled in a very traditional doctoral program in
                    literature, following equally traditional undergraduate studies, I learned of
                        <title level="m">Jane Austen in Hollywood</title> only by chance; it was a
                    revelation to find established scholars writing so animatedly about films I had
                        enjoyed.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Linda Troost and Sayre
                        Greenfield, the editors of <title level="m">Jane Austen in
                        Hollywood</title>, told me recently in conversation that they insisted that
                        their contributors write accessibly, for an imagined audience of high-school
                        English teachers who would want a fresh angle to share when teaching Austen.
                    </note> I had yet to read Claudia Johnson’s influential essay “Austen Cults and
                    Cultures” or Deidre Lynch’s wonderful collection <title level="m">Janeites:
                        Austen’s Disciples and Devotees</title>—which, in any case, would have
                    sailed over the heads of all but one of my Manhattanville students.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> Especially useful in the undergraduate
                        classroom, I have since found, are the works of Benedict, Brodie, and
                        Halsey.</note> On the sole visit I had made to the annual meeting of the
                    Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA), in 2001, I had been impressed with
                    the fervor of these Austen fans but didn’t have the foresight to seek out fellow
                    academics.</p>
                <p>Nor did I know if I would offer an Austen and popular culture seminar again. Even
                    if the course worked well once, it seemed entirely possible to me that within a
                    year or so, Austen-mania would have receded far enough into history to be of
                    little interest to undergraduates. Of course, I was laughably wrong about that.
                    2004 brought Karen Joy Fowler’s novel <title level="m">The Jane Austen Book
                        Club</title>, which not only put the name “Jane Austen” on the New York
                    Times Bestseller list for months but also focused popular attention on why
                    ordinary people might want to read, or re-read, Austen’s novels. 2005 gave us
                        <title level="m">Pride &amp; Prejudice</title> with Keira Knightley, an
                    adaptation that strongly appealed to young viewers. Based on the wholly
                    unscientific testimony of my own students, audiences in their age group were
                    further diverted by 2007’s <title level="m">Becoming Jane</title> and the film
                    version of <title level="m">The Jane Austen Book Club</title>. <title level="m"
                        >Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</title> (2009) confirmed that the popular
                    Austen, far from being in decline, was in fact immortal (or perhaps just
                        undead).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Several of the 1990s film
                        adaptations of Austen have proved to have enduring appeal among young people
                        as well. My students continue to be reliably familiar with, and sometimes
                        outright memorizers of, <title level="m">Clueless</title>. While the BBC /
                        A&amp;E <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> miniseries was
                        broadcast before this year’s entering college students were born, some have
                        still seen it, largely thanks to mothers or aunts who are Austen fans.
                        Gwyneth Paltrow devotees can be expected to be familiar with the <title
                            level="m">Emma</title> in which she starred (1996), while the truly
                        bookish tend to have found their way to Roger Michell’s <title level="m"
                            >Persuasion</title> (1995).</note> And every year, one or two of my
                    students brought to class more samples of the plethora of fiction and nonfiction
                    “inspired” by Austen, from romance and vampire novels to dating guides. </p>
                <p> In addition to ensuring the continuation of my seminar, this flood of popular
                    Austen material changed my approach to teaching literature at the undergraduate
                    level in several ways. Philosophically, I’ve come to see the importance—I would
                    now say, even, the necessity—of connecting major works of literature to the
                    world that we and our students inhabit as readers, consumers, and creators. (I
                    should acknowledge that very few of my students will pursue graduate study in
                    English.) Considering up-to-the-minute popular works in relation to canonical
                    literature encourages students to move beyond envisioning “the literary
                    tradition” as the monolithic property of their professors, or of anthology
                    editors, and instead to conceive of it as an ongoing conversation in which they
                    themselves are taking part. Through asking how and why a particular
                    Austen-related work might appeal to a mass audience (or not), or by examining
                    the nature of a writer's or filmmaker’s credentials as fan or scholar, students
                    begin thinking in new ways about the significance of literature in the
                    marketplace, as well as about themselves as active participants in reception
                        history.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Austen-related books written by
                        professors, such as Cohen or Amy Elizabeth Smith, can be especially
                        thought-provoking for students to consider.</note> Not surprisingly, young
                    creative writers tend to especially appreciate these approaches. Illuminating
                    connections between traditional literary study and students’ wider lives as
                    readers is essential, I would contend, not only to the students’ own future as
                    lifelong learners, but also to the health of a future readership for literature
                    outside the academy—and perhaps for the study of literature within the academy
                    as well. </p>
                <p> Second, in more practical terms, the availability of a huge range of
                    Austen-related resources has allowed me to experiment with incorporating more
                    options and choices for my students, a tactic that has affected how I teach
                    beyond the Austen realm. As I mentioned, in 2003 I had everyone read <title
                        level="m">Pride &amp; Promiscuity</title> and a Stephanie Barron mystery; in
                    the same spirit, I assigned Fowler’s <title level="m">The Jane Austen Book
                        Club</title> the next time I offered the seminar, in 2005. When students in
                    both iterations of the course responded that they didn’t really see the point of
                    devoting class time to those works, I decided to move towards a smorgasbord
                    approach. These days I bring in a few shopping bags full of Austen-inspired
                    books and let each student choose one to read, present, and recommend (or not).
                    To help with the decision-making, I offer a thumbnail description of each,
                    including mention of any particularly eye-opening content, whether gore or sex.
                    Any student who owns and wants to present on a different work is welcome to do
                    so. The ensuing presentations are invariably lively and often very creative,
                    especially when I ask for an accompanying poster. Because these efforts have
                    worked so well, I’ve incorporated both choices of readings and creative projects
                    in several of my other courses as well, to equally good effect.<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> The smorgasbord approach can also be used for
                        Austen biographies. An example of this approach from a non-Austen course is
                        to assign an anthology of short stories and ask each student to read one and
                        recommend it—or not—for the whole class to read, with an explanation of
                        her/his choice based on reasons beyond (but perhaps including) personal
                        liking. By justifying her/his selection, each student experiences, in a
                        small way, what we teachers do when putting together our syllabi, and
                        sharing those reasons adds depth to ensuing discussions. Creative projects,
                        I’ve found, are especially beneficial to include in required courses, as a
                        way of engaging students who didn’t choose to be there. In my British
                        literature survey course, for example, each student develops a “personal
                        canon project” that, in any medium, highlights and reflects on works from
                        the syllabus with which she/he takes a particular interest or feels a
                        particular connection. In any course, creative projects allow students to
                        combine literature with their other interests and expertise, which many
                        students tell me they appreciate.</note></p>
                <p> I responded to the avalanche of <title level="m">Pride and
                    Prejudice</title>-related material in another way, too: by creating a first-year
                    seminar course for Manhattanville that was devoted to <title level="m"
                        >P&amp;P</title> and its adaptations. General-education standards required
                    that each seminar focus on principles of critical analysis, which turned out to
                    be very well suited to a novel that concentrates so much on mistaken judgments
                    and faulty reasoning. Austen’s themes of decision-making and self-discovery also
                    fit nicely with the students’ efforts to acclimate to their new college
                    environment. In accordance with my usual preference for depth over breadth, we
                    spent about half of each course reading and discussing the novel, which proved
                    especially advantageous with first-year students who were unlikely to be
                    prospective English majors. The course culminated with a research essay in which
                    each student developed a topic related to the novel and its adaptations in light
                    of scholarly criticism. At their best, these essays were as strong as the ones
                    produced in my upper-level seminar, thanks in part to the many stages of
                    preparation the first-year seminar made possible.<note place="foot"

                <p> In addition to affecting me as a teacher, all the time I was spending with
                    Austen-related popular culture in the classroom began to influence me
                    professionally as well. The great hope of the liberal arts college is that
                    faculty will find ways to bring their research interests into the classroom and
                    their teaching experiences into their research, and I’ve certainly done both to
                    a degree I couldn’t have dreamed of initially. I started by keeping up, for the
                    sake of my courses, with popular material on Austen as well as with the growing
                    body of relevant critical work. As I educated myself in this (to me) new area of
                    study, I found myself wanting to contribute to it, a desire that over time led
                    to the decision to write my book <title level="m">Everybody’s Jane: Austen in
                        the Popular Imagination</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I first
                        dipped my toe into writing about Austen and popular culture with a short
                        article on the 2005 <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> film for a
                        special issue of JASNA’s journal <title level="j"><ref
                                target="http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol27no2/wells.htm"
                                >Persuasions On-Line</ref></title>. I’ve subsequently assigned
                        upper-level seminar students to choose and present an article from that
                        special issue, which, like <title level="m">Persuasions</title> generally,
                        features reliably accessible, clear writing. </note></p>
                <p> Presenting and writing on Austen and popular culture brought me into closer
                    contact with JASNA, which in turn opened up new opportunities to connect
                    students with the wider world of Austen’s readers and fans. I started small, by
                    taking individual students to regional meetings of the society and by
                    encouraging bolder ones to attend meetings by themselves and report back. After
                    several years’ involvement with the New York region of JASNA, I was invited to
                    coordinate a symposium at Manhattanville in March 2010, on a topic of my choice.
                    The theme “Inspired by Austen” allowed me to showcase a wide variety of people
                    whose professional and personal lives had been affected in some way by
                        Austen.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Our symposium speakers were Lori

                        as writer in residence at Manhattanville); Sheila Solomon Klass and Perri

                        author, and early literacy advocate); Andrew Honey, a book conservator at
                        the Bodleian Library; and Catherine Medeot, a librarian at
                        Manhattanville.</note> In addition to 80-odd JASNA members, students from
                    both my first-year and seminar courses on Austen were in attendance and
                    participated, respectively, in a poster session about popular Austen-related
                    works and in a structured conversation with the JASNA members, the majority of
                    whom were over sixty years old. Watching and listening to these authors and readers of all
                    ages talk about their shared appreciation of Austen was delightful, and I
                    consider the occasion a highlight of my career.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

                <p> My teaching of Austen took an exciting turn in 2012, when I moved from

                    G. Burke Jane Austen Collection. Alberta Burke was a 1928 Goucher alumna who
                    dedicated her life to assembling and curating a uniquely wide-ranging collection
                    of Austeniana that includes everything from first editions and manuscript
                    letters, to Regency contextual sources, to translations, popular books, and

                <p> The proximity of the Burke Collection has made possible assignments and
                    activities that go well beyond conventional historical and contextual research.
                    Alberta Burke was passionate about reading from her historic editions; she did
                    so in order to share as closely as possible the experience of Austen’s original
                    readers. In that spirit, I have asked students to visit Special Collections and
                    Archives, to read from a first or early edition of one of the Austen novels
                    assigned for class, and to write about the experience. I asked students to
                    consider the following questions as they encountered Austen’s text through the
                    form of the historical edition: <list type="unordered">
                        <item>Do you find yourself reading differently—perhaps more quickly or more
                            slowly, or noticing different things—when handling this edition?</item>
                        <item>How does the physical form of the book—its size, shape, printing, and
                            quality of paper—affect your reading experience?</item>
                        <item>Does your knowledge of Alberta Burke as a Goucher alumna and collector
                            affect your appreciation of this Austen volume? If so, how?</item>
                    </list>Here are some of the students’ (unedited) responses: <quote> I felt,
                        however fleeting, connected to Austen’s time. … All of the sensory aspects
                        of the book—the yellowed, stained pages, the faded ink, the “old book
                        smell”—combined to put me into the world of Hartfield and Highbury and
                        Donwell Abbey. Physically however, the text startled me. I found myself
                        counting the words per line—as if I were reading a poem. </quote>
                    <quote>The reading experience definitely differed from the others I had with
                        this text [<title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>]. I felt almost as
                        if I read it for the first time again, and the very first sentence made me
                        wonder whether it would be taken seriously by the contemporary audience, at
                        least during first reading. </quote>
                    <quote>It is interesting to think that these volumes, which now have specific
                        rules for handling them and such, were just books to be read for pleasure by
                        people who, I am supposing, enjoyed reading them as much as I do.</quote>
                    <quote>Typically when I read, I curl up in a chair or in my bed. … Now I sat
                        with remarkably held posture and two hands on the book, which rested on foam
                        supports on the desk in front of me. I was forced to be a bit more civilized
                        due to the pricelessness of the historic book I sat studying. My stature was
                        in fact quite fitting of the novel’s time. I venture to say that my
                        imagination, prodded by the historical edition in my hands, allowed me to
                        more readily enter the world of Elizabeth Bennet.</quote>
                    <quote>I did notice small stains and marks on each page, presumably left by
                        previous readers. This made me consider the fact that readers before me have
                        left their presence behind, like a signature. I feel that part of the value
                        in an old book is that it has been used by so many different people, each of
                        whom likely had a slightly different experience while reading it.</quote>
                    Acute and thoroughly personal, these responses demonstrate that the experiment
                    achieved just what I had hoped for: focusing students’ attention on the way that
                    a book as historical, physical object affects both how we read and how we think
                    about ourselves as reading. </p>
                <p> Whole-class visits to the Burke Collection offer a different opportunity for
                    expanding students’ understanding of an Austen novel. After discussing <title
                        level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>, students in an intermediate-level
                    literature course spent a class session looking at and reading from first and
                    early editions of that novel, as well as contextual sources from the Regency
                    period. Below are some of the answers students submitted anonymously to my
                    request for feedback on the experience. (My questions are in italics.) <list
                        type="unordered">
                        <head><emph>What did you find most interesting about the books on

                        <item>They were well kept and smelled really nice.</item>
                        <item>I really liked looking at the first editions. It was really cool to
                            see and they smelled fabulous.</item>
                        <item>The size, the smell, and the delicacy.</item>
                        <item>It was a powerful experience to read and touch books that people from
                            the Regency period also read and touched.</item>
                    </list>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <head><emph>How, if at all, did what you saw affect your appreciation or
                                understanding of Austen or </emph>Northanger

                        <item>I felt closer to the book by looking at the older versions of it. I
                            learned there were two separately published volumes which made me think
                            about how we publish books differently today.</item>
                        <item>It was a physical reminder of how long this book has been
                            around.</item>
                        <item>I liked looking at some of the other sources in the collection, like
                                <title level="m">The Mysteries of Udolpho</title> and the book about
                            Bath [Christopher Anstey, <title level="m">The New Bath Guide, or,
                                Useful Pocket Companion</title> (1799)], which helped me understand
                            the references Austen makes in <title level="m">Northanger
                            Abbey</title>. [This student subsequently incorporated Anstey’s <title
                                level="m">Guide</title> into her research essay for the course,
                            certainly a desirable outcome.]</item>
                        <item>Seeing first editions of <title level="m">The Mysteries of
                                Udolpho</title> and other period novels helped me to connect with
                            Jane Austen and Catherine.</item>
                    </list> As I plan future teaching, I will continue to refine my approach to
                    introducing Burke Collection material to students, especially at the
                    introductory and intermediate levels, with the aim of creating a more
                    substantial pedagogical experience.</p>
                <p>Given the exceptional international popularity of Austen, as well as the growing
                    status of book history and reception studies within literary scholarship, my
                    librarian colleagues and I are working on a variety of endeavors to make the
                    Burke Collection more accessible to teachers, students, and readers outside the
                    Baltimore area.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Please see this <ref target="http://meyerhoff.goucher.edu/library/janeausten/emmainamerica/">Website</ref> for information about Goucher's digital-humanities project centering on the extremely rare first American edition of <title level="m">Emma</title> (Philadelphia, 1816).</note> In the meantime, if your institution owns first or rare editions
                    of Austen, you can try a version of my experiment by having students read from a
                    historic edition. If not, your local public library likely holds a variety of
                    Austen-inspired books that you and/or your students can sample. Your local JASNA
                    region may have a lending library as well. I’d strongly encourage you, if you
                    haven’t already done so, to contact the regional coordinators of that JASNA
                    group in order to explore how you and your students might connect with their
                    programs.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> From <ref target="http://www.jasna.org/regions/index.html">their webpage</ref>, you can find links to JASNA
                        regions in the U.S. and in Canada.</note> And, if and when a new Austen film
                    is released, by all means meet your students at the multiplex—and reconvene
                    around your seminar table.</p>
