            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This essay describes a freshman seminar called “Advice about Love
                    and the Literary Narrator.” After touching on <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>’s
                    opening sentence and some consequences of the belief that one can take advice
                    from a fiction or its narrator, I track a version of the course that moves
                    from Ovid’s <title level="m">Amores</title> to Capellanus’s courtly love treatise, Cervantes’s
                    <title level="m">Don Quixote</title>, and the proposal scenes of the eighteenth-century novel. I
                    conclude by showing how a proposal scene in <title level="m">Emma</title> illuminates earlier models
                    of advising.

                <p> Since January 2012, a dozen volumes that claim to purvey Jane Austen’s love
                    counsel have appeared in print. This explosion in the dating manual corner of
                    the Austen market is no boon for morale in college Austen classes. To those
                    students who have absorbed the lesson that literature ought not to serve any
                    practical purpose, the visibility of so many Austen guides to love suggests that
                    Austen’s novels, useful as the book trade proclaims them, must not be
                    literature, or at least not literature of the highest kind. And to any student,
                    there is the embarrassing matter of what Austen is supposed to be useful for. I
                    have been told that in certain college-age circles, it has come to seem widely
                    acknowledged that a single man or woman in possession of Austen’s novels must be
                    in want of—and desperate to find—a romantic partner.<note place="foot"
                        resp="editors"> That this wished-for partner is often assumed to be male
                        whether the reader be woman or man is perhaps connected to Austen’s
                        association with love advice. On the social circumscriptions awaiting the
                        boy who loves Austen, see D. A. Miller, <title level="m">Jane Austen, or the
                            Secret of Style</title>, 1-9. I thank my former student Erin Reeves for
                        alerting me to the alleged desperation of the woman Austen reader. </note>
                </p>
                <p> Austen is, of course, one among legions of literary writers who have either
                    claimed for themselves a love-advisor persona or had such a persona ascribed to
                    them by readers. In a freshman seminar called “Advice about Love and the
                    Literary Narrator,” my students and I examine some of the texts these writers
                    produced. The topic of love advice serves in this course as an occasion for
                    surveying the history of literary criticism, for investigating literary
                    theoretical problems such as the nature of “belief” in fiction, for considering
                    the ways speech acts can establish relations between narrators and readers, and
                    for delving into the particulars of a wide variety of literary texts. The essay
                    that follows will lay out some of the questions the course addresses, sketch the
                    material we cover in the course’s first, pre-Austen half, and finally discuss
                    how we bring that material to bear on one of Austen’s novels most explicitly
                    concerned with love advice, <title level="m">Emma </title>(1815). I will suggest
                    that what makes literary love advice an especially fruitful topic for classroom
                    study is the tension between what it <emph>says</emph> and what it
                        <emph>does</emph>, the interplay—mobilized by Austen with special
                    dexterity—between its constative and performative dimensions.</p>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>*</head>
                    <p> The topic of love advice has a certain automatic psychological interest
                        quite apart from its relations with literature. Students arrive in class
                        already equipped with a fund of extra-literary experience that informs their
                        answers to such questions as: Why do so many people seem to share the
                        intuition that some elusive rule or piece of information holds the key to
                        love and happiness? Why would anyone ever accept advice about something so
                        private and individual as love? What, if anything, could qualify one to give
                        such counsel? What relations of power or erotic investment between a giver
                        and receiver of love counsel does a given scene of advising imply? </p>
                    <p> Further questions arise when we turn from scenarios involving real persons
                        or fictional characters to ones taking place between narrators of fiction
                        and their readers. Do special constraints or opportunities come into play
                        when the source of advice is a piece of literature? When narrators present
                        themselves as advice-givers to readers, what other kinds of relationships
                        with those readers do they thereby initiate or imply? Can the mixed motives
                        and hidden agendas that so often influence real-world advisors and
                        matchmakers still come into play when the advisor/advisee relation includes
                        only one embodied person? What, on the other hand, do readers mean when they
                        say that they are “in love” with a particular author, book, narrator, or
                        literary character? What does a literary work’s status as object of love
                        contribute to its authority as advisor about love? </p>
                    <p>Is it even possible for a literary narrator or work of art to give a reader
                        advice? Students may be tempted to answer “no” to this last question from a
                        sheer sense of respect for the difference between fiction and fact. After
                        all, if the poet “nothing affirms, and therefore never lieth,” as Sir Philip
                        Sidney claimed in his <title level="m">Defense of Poesy </title>(1595),<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> Katherine Duncan-Jones, ed., <title
                                level="m">Sir Philip Sidney</title>, 235.</note> then the poet would
                        seem to abstain altogether from offering readers direction. Indeed, to
                        borrow formulations that first-year college students are more likely to have
                        encountered in their previous studies, if poetry makes “pseudo-statements”
                        rather than verifiable statements (I. A. Richards), if “A poem should not
                        mean / But be” (Archibald Macleish), if to focus on the propositional
                        content of a literary fiction is to miss its (aesthetic) point (Cleanth
                        Brooks), then any reader who attempts to take guidance from a fiction is
                        already misguided.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I. A. Richards, <title
                                level="m">Poetries and Sciences,</title> 59; Archibald Macleish,
                            “Ars Poetica”; Cleanth Brooks, “The Heresy of Paraphrase.”</note></p>
                    <p> To be sure, the long chronological sweep of the course helps to deprive this
                        skeptical view of its air of inevitability. As we march through the
                        centuries from Ovid to George Saunders, we have many occasions to notice how
                        dominant has been the Horacian duo “<emph>utile</emph>” and
                            “<emph>dulce</emph>.” Viewed in the context of the many Western
                        commentators who take it for granted that literature should and can be
                        useful as well as sweet, instructive as well as entertaining, the Sidneyan
                        or New Critical insistence on the incommensurability between the claims of
                        fiction and the world of facts seems pedantic. There is also the difficulty
                        of imagining a work of literature that could offer no guidance to anybody. A
                        geographically ignorant reader of Balzac’s <title level="m">Le Père
                            Goriot</title> (1835) would learn from that novel that Paris is the
                        capital of France even if she were resolved not to accept as guidance any of
                        the narrator’s discursive comments. </p>
                    <p> Yet even those modern readers who agree that they can receive instruction
                        from a work of literature may balk at the idea that they can receive
                            <emph>advice </emph>from it. When I ask students how “advice” differs
                        from “instruction,” a speech-act that can, after all, take exactly the same
                        form, they usually decide that an “advisor” guides someone she
                            <emph>knows</emph>, while an “instructor” can guide acquaintances and
                        strangers alike. Unlike “instruction,” “advice” is custom-tailored to the
                        specific circumstances of the addressee. Thus, the distance of time or space
                        separating authors from readers—the fact that authors cannot be personally
                        acquainted with all the readers whom their books may eventually
                        attract—would seem to rule out the transmission of advice from literary text
                        to reader.</p>
                    <p>The fact that readers do think of themselves as taking precisely <emph>advice</emph> from
                        works of literature bears pondering. To examine that peculiar belief, as
                        well as some of the other illusions fiction can create, we draw on Robert
                        Newsom’s book <title level="m">A Likely Story: Probability and Play in
                            Fiction</title>, pursuing several lines of questioning. When I read
                            <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice </title>(1813), is my feeling that
                        Austen’s narrator is my advisor like my feeling that there was once a person
                        called Elizabeth Bennet who talked with Mr. Darcy? Are both feelings, in
                        other words, phenomena deliberately orchestrated long ago by the writer Jane
                        Austen and unlikely ever to fool me into acting as if Austen’s creative
                        product were part of my own world of facts? Or is the credence I give to the
                        notion that Austen’s narrator can advise me more like the credence with
                        which I greet the circumstances of daily life? Perhaps my belief in the
                        narrator’s ability to advise me is stronger than my belief in Elizabeth
                        Bennet’s existence. After all, I myself have supplied real-world particulars
                        to the sentences I take as Austen’s “advice.” Upon encountering, for
                        example, the first sentence of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>,
                        “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
                        a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,” I may think of a single man I
                        know and imagine that Austen’s narrator is offering me personal guidance
                        concerning this man (3). My real-world experience of the man I have in mind
                        informs my sense of the narrator’s advice. Then again, perhaps my experience
                        of real-world women with “light and pleasing” figures similarly informs my
                        sense of Elizabeth Bennet (23). However one decides the question of belief,
                        it seems clear that one way a narrator can foster the illusion that she
                        offers readers custom-built guidance is by inviting their personal
                        applications to her general statements. The result looks like a reciprocal
                        exchange: the narrator sets the topic, the reader thinks of relevant
                        material, and the narrator in turn gives an interpretation of that material. </p>
                    <p>The process does not end there: the novel’s incidents and characters further
                        inflect moments of advice-giving. In <title level="m">Pride and
                            Prejudice</title>, our sole Austen novel in some iterations of the
                        course, we find it fruitful to compare the narrator who speaks the novel’s
                        famous opening sentence with Charlotte Lucas, that cynical inventor of
                        prescriptions for courtship (“In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better
                        shew <emph>more</emph> affection than she feels” [22]); with Mr. Collins,
                        the plodding reciter of such prescriptions (“I am not now to learn that it
                        is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they
                        secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour” [107]); and
                        with Elizabeth Bennet, a disdainful observer of the calculations of each.
                        The opening sentence’s most immediate counterpoint comes, however, from Mrs.
                        Bennet, whose first-chapter airing of her wishes concerning Mr. Bingley’s
                        marriageability reflects back upon the narrator. Inviting us to recognize
                        Mrs. Bennet as Austen’s joking self-portrait, the novel’s opening statement,
                        we find, has borrowed the universalizing impulse of the matron of the Bennet
                        household and dressed up in stately language her wish concerning single men.
                        The labors of Mrs. Bennet to find marriages for her daughters become a
                        facetious representation of Austen’s matchmaking efforts on behalf both of
                        her nubile female characters and of the readers whom her narrator addresses
                        with advice. </p>
                    <p>Thanks to the famous irony of the opening sentence, this alignment between
                        Austen’s narrator and the novel’s foolish would-be matchmaker is decidedly
                        temporary. The first sentence parrots not just Mrs. Bennet herself but Mr.
                        Bennet’s disgruntled parroting of Mrs. Bennet, we suddenly realize. Our
                        double-take anticipates one of the plot’s more unexpected rhymes with the
                        opening sentence, which takes place when Elizabeth catches herself giving
                        voice to her mother’s opportunistic attitude toward Netherfield Park’s
                        occupants, then hastily backtracks with the remark that “perhaps Mr. Bingley
                        did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighborhood as
                        for his own” (178). This playing out in a speech by Elizabeth of two
                        contrary impulses in the opening sentence’s reader suggests one effect of
                        the narrator’s fleeting adoption of the love-advisor persona. In
                        spellbinding cadences that initially seem to draw the reader under the wing
                        of an ideal mentor, then gradually reveal themselves to be an unfriendly
                        mimicry of Mrs. Bennet, the narrator gives the reader the same double
                        experience of unthinking complicity and compensatory revulsion that mark
                        Elizabeth’s response to her mother and to the very idea of courtship that
                        proceeds “by design” (22). The response is not unlike that with which an
                        admirer of Austen’s novels might encounter the love guides of modern
                        Janeism. </p>
                    <p>I have found this kind of inquiry, in which the class compares a narrator’s
                        discourse with episodes in the diegetic realm, helpful throughout the many
                        versions of the course I have taught. In the case of <title level="m">Pride
                            and Prejudice</title>, such comparisons throw into relief the contrast
                        between what the narrator begins by saying about single men and what her
                        words do, namely show us that if we believe what she says, then we will
                        deserve ridicule.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a fuller explanation

                        Discussing <title level="m">Persuasion </title>(1817), another Austen novel
                        sometimes included in the course, we find many curious points of contact
                        between Anne Elliot’s relationship with books, her interactions with the
                        love-advisor characters—Lady Russell, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Musgrove, Mrs. Croft,
                        even Charles Musgrove—and the narrator’s dry comments about love. Sometimes
                        we begin the course with Ovid’s tale of Pygmalion, in which love crosses the
                        border between art and the real world. We follow this story of a statue that
                        comes alive when kissed with Molière’s play <title level="m">The School for
                            Wives </title>(1662), in which a would-be Pygmalion finds that the woman
                        he has fashioned harbors her own ideas about whom she will kiss; with Henry
                        James’s novel <title level="m">The Awkward Age </title>(1898-1899), in which
                        adults contend for influence over a girl who may already be shaped by books;
                        and with Tommaso Landolfi’s comical story “Gogol’s Wife” (1963), which
                        imagines the Russian author as unhappy husband to an adjustable blow-up
                        doll. The alternative sequence of texts I lay out in the following section
                        is just one of innumerable possibilities. </p>

                    <head>*</head>
                    <p>The seminar opens with two intensely entertaining, raunchy books by the Roman
                        poet Ovid: <title level="m">The Amores</title> (c. 15 BCE) and <title
                            level="m">The Art of Love </title>(2-1 BCE). <title level="m">The Art of
                            Love </title>is the more explicit love guide, but <title level="m">The
                            Amores</title> is particularly interesting for the relationships it
                        establishes between its speaker, its reader, and Corinna, the woman whom the
                        speaker professes to love. We begin the class on Ovid by considering one of
                        his obsessive topics, the go-between, whom <title level="m">The
                            Amores</title>’s speaker represents first as a witch-like procuress,
                        then as a lady’s maid, a writing tablet, and the verses of the speaker.
                        Noting that <title level="m">The Amores</title> returns repeatedly to
                        scenarios in which a go-between displaces one of the principals in a love
                        affair, we examine this pattern at work in the opening poem of book 2, in
                        which the speaker declares his intention to act as facilitator of his
                        readers’ love affairs but ends up admitting that he is versifying on his own
                        behalf, for his own erotic benefit. </p>
                    <p>This intimation of author/reader rivalry gets a comical twist near the end of
                            <title level="m">The Amores</title>, when the speaker discovers that he
                        has shot himself in the foot, so to speak, by writing about his beloved. As
                        he laments, “That girl whom the town / Spoke of — till lately — as
                            <emph>mine</emph>, my solitary obsession, / I fear I must now share /
                        With all comers” (160). In Peter Green’s lively translation, Ovid’s speaker
                        wonders, “Could my poems have made her a public figure?” and concludes,
                        “That’s it: <emph>she </emph>was prostituted by <emph>my </emph>art, / And
                        serve me right for trumpeting her beauty abroad! If my darling’s / On the
                        market, it’s all my fault— / I’ve pimped her charms, I’ve marked up the
                        route for lovers, / It was I who let them in at her front door.” Some of the
                        speakers’ readers are now his erotic competitors because they have—with
                        quixotism <foreign>avant le lettre</foreign>—believed the speaker’s
                        assertions about Corinna’s perfections instead of dismissing the praise as
                        “fiction” (161). In this preview of one of the most trumpeted of
                        fiction-reading’s putative dangers—the reader’s inability to distinguish
                        fiction from reality—the figure victimized is not the reader but the author. </p>
                    <p>I enjoy moving from Ovid—so inflammatory yet familiar, who never fails to
                        prompt students’ recollections of rap songs—to the medieval cleric Andreas
                        Capellanus, who often alludes to Ovid but whose treatise <title level="m"
                            >The Art of Courtly Love </title>(1184-6) offers a glimpse of a world
                        markedly unlike our own. In answer to the first question I ask in the
                        Capellanus class, “What surprised you in the reading?”, students point to
                        Capellanus’s regimented list of the “four stages of love”: “the giving of
                        hope,” “the granting of a kiss,” “the enjoyment of an embrace,” and “the
                        yielding of the whole person” (42). They note the contrast between
                        Capellanus’s dry, scholastic style and the carnal goal toward which he
                        guides his readers. Pondering the strange idea that by performing
                        miscellaneous good deeds a man could be thought to earn and be owed a
                        woman’s love, students give an airing to the perennial question: does the
                        system of courtly love advance or impede women’s empowerment? By the time we
                        get to Capellanus’s series of dialogues demonstrating how men and women of
                        various social classes ought to debate and, it often seems, bicker with one
                        another—the man seeking to initiate a courtship, the woman refusing, and the
                        man sometimes ending the exchange by announcing in defiance that the woman’s
                        words of rejection have given him hope and thus enabled him to achieve the
                        first stage of love—students are eager to discuss whether and where the
                        treatise writer might be joking. That anyone should refer to a script
                        concerning matters so personal often strikes students as uncanny, but
                        Capellanus presents love as a highly formal endeavor, elaborately codified,
                        full of rules. </p>
                    <p>With <title level="m">Don Quixote</title> (1605, 1615), about a reader
                        deranged in his attempt to follow the rules he has found in literature,
                        Cervantes launches the modern novel by asking whether readers are
                        ever justified in taking pointers from fiction. While <title level="m">The
                            Amores</title>’s speaker takes it for granted that his readers occupy
                        the same space as himself and can consequently steal his girlfriend and
                        subject matter, <title level="m">Don Quixote </title>notices how strange it
                        can be when a figure crosses from the literary realm into the reader’s.
                        Cervantes’s novel questions the premise upon which the act of taking
                        guidance from any work of fiction seems to be predicated, namely that the
                        literary world is continuous and commensurable with the “real” one, that
                        prescriptions found in one can apply to the other. Don Quixote has in mind
                        the rule that if he ever defeats a giant, he ought to send that giant to his
                        lady as a tribute, but he does not meet any giants in his wanderings; he has
                        to content himself with windmills. The disdain so marked in some responses
                        to Janeite advice-seeking starts here, in the wonder and laughter with which
                        we are invited to greet both the absurd content of the counsel that Don
                        Quixote takes from previous genres and his very assumption that a literary
                        source can accurately guide him.</p>
                    <p><title level="m">Don Quixote </title>also explores advice taken from
                        non-textual sources, as we discover when we turn from the novel’s first
                        fourteen chapters to a later inset story called “The Tale of Inappropriate
                        Curiosity.” In this take-down of male sexual jealousy, Anselmo decides to
                        test his wife’s fidelity, asks his best friend Lothario to try her
                        willingness with flattery and gifts, and finds himself betrayed by his wife
                        and friend, who run away together. Before marrying, Anselmo courted his
                        future spouse by using his advisor Lothario as go-between, but after
                        marriage Anselmo becomes the unwitting go-between connecting his wife and
                        friend. I ask students in what relation the tale stands to the surrounding
                        narrative, and we debate whether Anselmo’s skepticism of his wife’s fidelity
                        might be the counterpart to Don Quixote’s readerly credulity: insane,
                        ruinous in its effects, and apt to shape the world into the form it expects.
                        We try to define Anselmo’s motives for testing his wife and for engaging
                        Lothario’s aid, and we conclude by examining René Girard’s famous model of
                        triangular or mediated desire, which we apply not just to the characters in
                        “The Tale” but to Don Quixote’s reading and to modern-day advertising. </p>
                    <p>The conclusions we have drawn in the first weeks of the course about
                        go-betweens in Ovid, the codification of courtship in Cappelanus, and
                        mediated desire in Cervantes all come into play when we arrive at the
                        eighteenth-century novel. I introduce students to the vehemence of
                        anti-novel sentiment in this period through the handout included in the
                        Appendix to this essay. Examining the handout in class, we observe that some
                        anti-novel warnings, with their visions of female readers misled by novels
                        and falling victim to a kind of textual molestation, seem not just attacks
                        on quixotism but expressions of it. Detractors, we note, often imagined the
                        novel as a pander whose prescriptions for love would link the reader with a
                        seductive fictional character, a corruptive author, or another reader. At
                        this point in the semester, we talk about the female quixotes of the
                        eighteenth-century, those heirs of Don Quixote and ancestors of contemporary
                        Janeites. We read a masterpiece of the French libertine novel, Choderlos de
                        Laclos’s <title level="m">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</title> (1782), with its
                        multiple overlapping love triangles and letter writers who destroy the
                        advisees they claim to help. Finally, we consider some of the many scenes in
                        the British novel in which marriage proposals take the form of requests for
                        advice, marriage acceptances the form of counsel. Unlike most of the
                        previous scenes of advising we have encountered, these are dyadic exchanges,
                        with no third-party go-between. Why, we ask, do proposal scenes in Daniel
                        Defoe’s <title level="m">Moll Flanders </title>(1722), Samuel Richardson’s
                            <title level="m">Pamela </title>(1740), and Frances Burney’s <title

                    <p> In this scene, <title level="m">Emma</title> brilliantly juxtaposes the
                        dyadic advisory model of the eighteenth-century novel’s proposal scenes with
                        the triangular model we examined earlier in the semester. The slipperiness
                        of the triangular model has been causing trouble, of course, throughout
                        Austen’s novel, for Emma Woodhouse has reprised to unhappy effect some of
                        Ovid’s favorite scenarios in her attempts to make matches for friends and
                        acquaintances. Where she intends to preside over a union between two
                        subordinates, she finds herself mistaken for one of the principals, and
                        where she expects to see a grateful advisee, she finds herself saddled with
                        an unexpected rival. Despite these bad precedents, Emma and Knightley’s best
                        chances for happiness appear to them to hinge, in the lead-up to their love
                        scene, upon further love-triangle rearrangements. Imagining that Emma loves
                        Frank Churchill and is heart-broken at the news of his secret engagement to
                        Jane Fairfax, Knightley visits Emma with the plan to “soothe or counsel” her
                        concerning Frank. Emma, in turn, believes that Knightley seeks her
                        encouragement to proceed with a marriage proposal to Harriet. Knightley and
                        Emma would each gladly become the love guide who forms a new couple with one
                        of the original (putative) principals. </p>

                        proves necessary, for Emma and Knightley love not Frank and Harriet but one
                        another. Knightley is the first to be released from his misunderstanding.
                        Once Emma has assured him that she does not love Frank, Knightley begins
                        impulsively to “tell you what you will not ask” only to be interrupted with
                        the words “don’t speak it, don’t speak it” from Emma, who, in her eagerness
                        to avoid hearing about Knightley’s love for Harriet, now wishes for the
                        first time to avoid the role of confidante and advisor (429). But Emma
                        relents. She generously invites the man she loves “to ask my opinion of any
                        thing that you may have in contemplation,” and Knightley now submits
                        himself, uncharacteristically, to Emma’s advice. He agrees to “accept your
                        offer” and “refer myself to you as a friend.” The object of his question to
                        Emma, however, is not Harriet, who “was nothing,” but Emma herself: not
                        three parties but two are in question here (430). The erotic triumph of Emma
                        the advisor comes about not because she detaches her advisee’s affections
                        from a third party but because she proves to have monopolized those
                        affections all along. </p>
                    <p><title level="m">Emma</title>’s version of the advice-laden proposal scene
                        contains a clue to its popularity among Austen’s eighteenth-century
                        predecessors. Knightley addresses Emma in the following terms: “Tell me,
                        then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?” (429, 430) Wonderfully, this
                        question keeps the object of Knightley’s love unspecified as ever. It also
                        neglects to pin down the kind of success, namely success in
                            <emph>love</emph>, that Knightley seeks. Although Knightley wants to
                        know whether he will succeed in winning Emma’s hand, his question seems to
                        ask, “Have I no chance of ever succeeding in life?” or “at anything?” and to
                        demand in answer a prediction of similarly broad scope. The vagueness of the
                        query acknowledges that to Knightley’s sense, any resolution of the pressing
                        uncertainties concerning his fate and future will depend upon Emma’s
                        response. To be in love and in doubt of return is to make the beloved an
                        oracle, the keeper of the answer to the burning questions commonly posed to
                        advisors: “Where shall I look for happiness, where shall I live, and what
                        kind of life shall I lead?”, “Will I win the love of the one I love?”, “Will
                        I ever marry at all?” Because practical considerations of all kinds hang
                        upon the success or failure of a given love relation, requests for love—like
                        requests for advice—get answered with implicit predictions. The beloved
                        becomes wrapped up not just in the desire to love and be loved, but in the
                        desire to know the future. </p>
                    <p>The overlap <title level="m">Emma </title>emphasizes between beloved and
                        oracle bears upon the popular image of Austen the advisor. For, of course,
                        Emma does not get to speak her advice to Knightley in phrases the reader can
                        hear. Instead, the narrator summarizes these phrases in her own words. These
                        words appear to offer advice to the female reader about how to respond to a
                        marriage proposal: “What did she say?—Just what she ought, of course. A lady
                        always does.—She said enough to show there need not be despair—and to invite
                        him to say more himself” (431). Like the speaker of <title level="m">The
                            Amores</title>, Austen’s narrator becomes an advising lover to the
                        reader, for her counsel occupies the place of a speech by Emma to Knightley
                        that accepts and declares love even as it advises. The narrator’s
                        Capellanus-like script for courtship brings to fulfillment
                        eighteenth-century fears about the novelist’s demand for the reader’s
                        affection, for even as it <emph>says </emph>how ladies respond to marriage
                        proposals, it performs a love scene between the narrator and the reader.
                        Although Austen’s narrator advises the reader about how to respond to a
                        third party’s proposal, we gather that the third party will not remain in
                        the picture long. After all, the narrator has just shown us a scene in which
                        triangular advising gives way to dyadic advising: the match the advisor
                        makes is her own. Austen’s love-advisor persona is a lover persona as well.
                        Far from desperate for some real-world third-party lover, the Janeite who
                        pauses over Austen’s love counsel may instead be enjoying the solicitations
                        of Austen’s seductive narrator herself.</p>
                    <p>By tracing the literary history of love advice, by linking works of
                        unquestioned excellence and influence not just to Austen but to Austen’s
                        scenes of advising <foreign>per se</foreign>, students come to see that it
                        need be no put-down of Austen to note that her authorial persona often looks
                        like a counsellor to the reader. Having encountered Austen in the context of
                        a didactic tradition marked by the assumption that, far from purpose-free,
                        novels ought to offer readers instruction in the momentous choices they may
                        face, among them whom to marry, students are well-equipped to track the
                        modern permutations of that tradition. Near the end of the semester, we read
                            <title level="m">Miss Lonelyhearts</title> (1933), the short novel by
                        Nathanael West about an advice columnist driven to despair by the
                        intractability of the problems he is asked to address, and George Saunders’s
                        story “Winky” (2000), about a sad sack who attends a self-help convention
                        and risks losing his best feature, his charitable impulse. We think about
                        the place of advice in popular culture—television comedy, fortune cookies,
                        YouTube videos—and appreciate the sheer complexity of advice-giving as a
                        speech act. </p>
                    <p>Instead of attempting to convince students that Austen never sought the
                        advising role with her reader, I invite them to notice the complicated
                        valences of her narrator’s advice: its implicit commentary on established
                        ideas about the role of the author as well as its resonances among Austen’s
                        own plots, the intricate dance by which Austen’s characters develop patterns
                        set in motion by the narrator. Austen’s ability to speak as a bustling Mrs.
                        Bennet at one moment and a sophisticated seducer the next; to give a rule
                        while taking it away, as in the first sentence of <title level="m">Pride and
                            Prejudice</title>; to cast us as Elizabeth Bennets, scornfully brushing
                        off counsel, as quixotes, who would deny any boundary between the novel and
                        the real world, and as Mr. Knightleys, making petitions for guidance that
                        seem like requests for love—all this, students end up agreeing, helps make
                        Austen great. Janeite guidebooks might still inflict a social stigma on
                        Austen-reading students, but the pleasures of Austen’s art deliver abundant
                        compensation.</p>
