                  <p class="noCount">This article was inspired by the author’s identification of a common problem in the
                     literary classroom: how to allow for subjective reading along with the objective meaning
                     of a work. Alexander engages in a few brief close readings to show how the perception
                     of certain characters in the novel controls a reader’s response to the whole. She
                     argues that teachers must direct their students to certain conclusions from Austen’s
                     text or they will otherwise misguidedly misinterpret them. The article advocates for
                     the importance of teachers showing students <em>how</em> to read.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">Starting from the global popularity of Austen inside and outside of the classroom,
                     this article argues that her work should be approached cross-culturally, in order
                     to help undergraduates better understand British culture and inspire a greater interest
                     in literature. Amano developed this approach to teaching Austen’s novels with students
                     in Japan who struggled with the text in its original English. In order to help them
                     better understand the text, Amano developed two thematic teaching devices, explored
                     in detail in the article: the picturesque in <em>Northanger Abbey </em>and humor in <em>Emma</em>.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">This essay looks at film adaptations of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> and <em>Emma</em> (including <em>Clueless</em> [1995]), placing Austen in historical context and the films in the context of the
                     New Post-Classical Hollywood. Arriola suggests that the classroom could serve to break
                     down the divide between Austen the canonical author and Austen the pop icon of romantic
                     film comedy.</p>

                     are aimed at teaching reading skills and vocabulary, designed for students to carry

                  <p class="noCount">One chapter of this book deals with contexts and the novel, using Austen’s <em>Emma</em> and <em>Persuasion </em>to demonstrate the gendered perspective of the texts and how they represent the larger
                     theme of individual perception. The word “handsome” is explored as an example of a
                     word that must be defined in is historical context (“good looking and tall”) in order
                     for Austen’s meaning to become clear. The narrator of such characters’ descriptions
                     is also mentioned as a topic worthy of study, because in those two novels, they often
                     “Photoshop” others, to better serve their own appearance. As a result, they are unreliable.
                     Barlow author argues that this is an intentional narrative style that forces the reader
                     to look more closely at the text, both in its immediate location and in relation to
                     the novel as a whole.</p>

Ed. Deborah Holdstein and David Bleich. Logan, UT: Utah State P, 2001. 220–31. Print.</span></span> 
                  <p class="noCount">Brownstein argues that the phenomenon of developing a personal relationship with Austen
                     and her texts is indicative of how there is more at stake in reading literature than
                     textual interpretation. Austen has been considered the epitome of taste, an identity
                     she consciously constructed and one that is evocative of the personal interpretations
                     many readers bring to her works. This article "examines how taste operates” in both
                     Austen’s narratives and in the personal opinions and lives of her readers: as part
                     of a shared social world that literature invites us to participate in, as told through
                     anecdotes about Brownstein’s class. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">This book opens with a brief summary of Austen’s contested place in feminist theory
                     across its history, combining literary and cultural analysis with personal accounts
                     in order to probe the interconnectedness of readers of Austen. The chapter “Why We
                     Read Jane Austen” details student reactions to various Austen novels, as observed
                     over the course of Brownstein’s teaching career. It details questions she used in
                     her own class to address the themes of Austen’s novels.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">This article questions why Austen’s novels (particularly <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>), but not the film adaptations, are considered appropriate reading for men and women.
                     Demory proposes examining this 21<span class="sup">st</span>-century phenomenon and how it functions as part of a larger intertextual canon, rather
                     than seeking to measure how faithful the adaptations are to the novels. Breaking <em>Pride and Prejudice </em>adaptations into three strands of a "tapestry," she sets out to determine why the
                     films are gendered as “chick flicks” and what this says about women’s roles today.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">This essay opens with a personal account of the author’s introduction to Austen with
                     <em>Emma</em>, and describes the passionate and devoted professor who fostered his relationship
                     to her, and to literature in general. Later, when Deresiewicz became a teacher himself,
                     <em>Northanger Abbey </em>became a guide on how to instruct. This involved being quirky, foolish and sly, in
                     order to inspire serious independent thought in others, as hero Henry Tilney does
                     in that novel and Austen did in her fiction.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">This essay debates the pros and cons of showing film clips of Austen’s work in conjunction
                     with the texts, either before or reading the novel itself. Diana tested this by teaching
                     her introductory English course in two groups, one of which viewed the Academy Award-winning
                     version of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> in its entirety, and the other which only read Austen’s novel. The groups were then
                     reversed. She gathered results from comprehension quizzes, an essay, and a questionnaire,
                     which revealed that those who viewed the film first followed the novel’s plot more
                     closely, were more involved in the story and its characters, and recalled more plot
                     details. Appreciation for Austen’s novel was greater after viewing the movie, and
                     Diana believes that better engagement can be gained from a screening of the film before
                     the text itself is read.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">The argument of this article is that Austen’s novels are valuable for their historical
                     context as well as for their contributions to literature. Dryden argues that Austen’s
                     middle class characters often challenge the more wealthy and established families
                     in ways that mirror real life in post–French Revolution England. He documents a new
                     historically based course he taught, “Jane Austen’s Great Britain,” in which students
                     investigated the connections between her works and the history of the period, as well
                     as examined closely the allusions to the Napoleonic War, Industrial Revolution and
                     age of Revolution hidden beneath the marriage plot.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">This article details the author’s decision to host a garden tea at her home during
                     an Austen summer course, in order to better introduce students to the types of interactions
                     that would have occurred at such an event in Austen’s time and to the preparation
                     and consumption of a Georgian or Regency tea. Over time, this became a tradition with
                     an expanded guest list, and further promoted the goals of the event: to give a more
                     tangible sensory experience to Austen and early nineteenth-century England. Other
                     themes, such as domesticity and hospitality, gender, masculine privilege, social class,
                     and feminism, were brought up in reflections on these events. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">Easton presents her own experience of learning English country dance in order to better
                     understand Austen’s dance scenes as metaphors and social markers. She sees them more
                     broadly as a method of learning in which readers must use their entire bodies to experience
                     literature. One method of this teaching process involved volunteer students literally
                     standing in for Austen’s heroines in the novels and walking the classroom in a physical
                     representation of how the characters moved around in physical space in the narrative.
                     Easton looked at how those movements could be compared to those in other Austen novels
                     and in the construction of prose in general. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">This essay introduces <em>Emma</em>’<em>s</em> film adaptations as an example of how recent film and TV versions hinder students’
                     abilities to engage with the printed text fully, as well as prompting confusion between
                     the plots of the original text and the movie versions. Eggleston’s students ultimately
                     disliked <em>Emma </em>as a novel because they did not want to put in the effort required in reading. He
                     argues that they expected the text to be more entertaining, leading the author to
                     have a viewing of A&amp;E version of <em>Emma</em> in class. Although the film version did not reinvigorate the class as he hoped, it
                     did cause some students to reconsider the written text. Still, it made little overall
                     impact, leaving Eggleston to assert that Austen has become a collaborator, not a novelist.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">This essay argues that although Austen never took readers to a battlefield in her

                     question of why we often choose to sit home and read during times of crisis. Favret
                     offers evidence in support of Austen as wartime novelist who helped form modern opinions
                     of war as more than just dates of battles fought and explains how this insight can
                     be taught in the classroom. She also gives attention to how Austen demonstrates that
                     the lasting effects of past events can influence current lives. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">Folsom address the prevalence of Austen in modern culture and how invoking Austen’s

                     dry. In order to combat this, Folsom focuses her teaching on the more inventive and

                     in the South through a feminist unit on <em>Emma</em>, a text largely considered heterosexual “safe reading.” Using close reading in conjunction
                     with theories by Adrienne Rich and Mary Louise Pratt, Fulk aimed to keep students’
                     repulsed reactions to Emma and Harriet in check and to invite queer readings of the
                     text, although he did not identify them as such. More specific details on how this
                     can be accomplished are examined using chapters one and two of Austen’s novel as a
                     guide. Fulk demonstrates how discussions of power and gender in <em>Emma</em> can address sexuality in the text without risking reprisals from conservative audiences.</p>

                     whose novels may be used to introduce the lesser-known works of Scott. For teachers,
                     the pairing is useful for drawing historical, stylistic and theoretical parallels.

                     as studies of persuasion. In doing so, Hansen defends a common critique of the author—that
                     she is too vague and distant in her proposal scenes—by separating her novels into
                     two categories based on how the proposals are framed and reported. The article contains

                     <em>Mansfield Park</em> (1814). Krueger addresses the private theatrical episode in <em>Mansfield Park</em> and the ways her students created their own “little theatre”—quoting Austen's character,
                     Tom Bertram—at her university. She describes how they became their own version of
                     "The Mansfield Players," ending the piece with conclusions about what students stand

                  <p class="noCount">This essay acknowledges the common contemporary criticism of <em>Pride and Prejudice—</em>that it features stereotypical female characters obsessed with marriage—arguing that
                     this was a historically accurate representation by Austen. Those characters of greater
                     moral worth, Jane and Elizabeth, marry the best husbands, while those of lesser merit
                     are united accordingly. Kubitschek asserts that individual fault, rather than a larger
                     system, dictates the fortune of the characters. It is the teacher’s job to show students
                     how this system of values functions before they give generic negative labels to the
                     text. She offers strategies for accomplishing this, including examining female/female
                     relationships, identifying stereotypes, and examining those characters who pretend
                     to have desirable feminine characteristics in order to gain power.</p>

                     experience, where history and fictional narrative can be better experienced and taught

                     as a precursor to Austen’s later work. A helpful addition to the study of this text
                     is a family and relationship tree of all the characters in the narrative.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">This essay identifies Austen’s novels as falling into one of two categories: those
                     containing grave, less obvious humor (<em>Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park, Persuasion</em>) and those with witty but imperfect heroines (<em>Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice, Emma</em>). However, in the latter group, <em>Emma</em> stands out for its significantly less likeable heroine and titular character. Meihuizen
                     argues that it should be taught for its valuable lesson on perceptions of marriage
                     during the period. Other topics of importance to be emphasized are interference/intervention
                     and deception, which, when joined with the topic of marriage, create a reflective,
                     dense text that is ultimately about Emma’s journey to self-discovery, a journey that
                     the author argues is worthy of study by readers of all genders.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">Morgan recounts the difficulties she faced in teaching this novel to a freshman English
                     class, who largely found the text repulsive. They criticized the characters as snobbish
                     and hypocritical, ignored the still-relevant problem of social status, and found trouble
                     with the plot in general, due to ignorance of the period in which it is set, the author
                     argues. In an attempt to remedy these problems, Morgan engaged the class in defining
                     terms and recognizing how modern society deals with things like wealth and background,
                     although she reports that the best discussion came not from the examination of the
                     novel itself, but rather from the issues it highlights. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">This essay offers a personal reflection on teaching Austen to female students at an
                     Orthodox Jewish university, describing how the author’s assumptions about teaching
                     gender were challenged and altered by the experience. Initially, the students were
                     nervous to voice their true opinions about <em>Pride and Prejudice, </em>but journal and paper assignments gave Nachumi an insight into their thoughts. She
                     found that many women students identified with Austen’s heroines, because their own
                     culture placed significant importance on courtship and marrying at a young age. The
                     students expressed admiration for Elizabeth Bennet’s ability to remain mentally independent
                     and live within societal norms, proving that literature can inspire readers to examine
                     their own lives more closely.</p>

                     the nineties where women met each week to discuss Western literature. Austen was included
                     in the reading list for this book club, where the readers related to the tension and
                     the longings of desire in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, as well as to the pressures of making a proper marriage. The book describes more
                     generally how Nafisi created a sense of bonding and fun within in the club.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">The essay promotes teaching irony for its ability to develop “independent moral agents”
                     capable of recognizing complexities in a literary text. Phiddian believes students
                     today have read less than previous generations and that what little is read differs
                     from person to person, unlike the shared reading experiences of previous decades.
                     The author uses a popular book for young readers, <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,</em> alongside a once popular book, <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, to teach playful comedy and irony. He compares J. K. Rowling’s character Rita Skeeter
                     and Austen’s narrator, with both portrayed as unreliable, sarcastic commentators,
                     in order to show how modern and historical texts can exist in one syllabus.</p>

                     still remaining relevant and intriguing to younger readers.</p>

                     ways to engage students in literary study. The book is divided into four parts, each
                     of which offers a site of “reading” that considers one issue in the representation

                  <p class="noCount">Salusinszky uses Austen’s <em>Persuasion </em>as an example of how feminist, Marxist and historicist theories can be united into

                     a literary theory but also shows how <em>Persuasion</em> serves as an exemplary text to utilize this new theory in the classroom, as a way
                     to critique the ways ideologies are learned.</p>

                     students to approach all writing as worthy of analysis. Part of this method of teaching
                     requires the instructor not to label one as more difficult or important than the other,
                     instead moving from old to new in order to demonstrate how presentation of a work

                  <p class="noCount">Spacks attempts to offer a solution to the common reader response of disliking Emma
                     as a character by promoting the novel as a study of happiness and the pursuit of it.
                     She emphasizes to her students that Emma is not a real person but a carefully constructed
                     character who misreads the situations in the plot much in the same way the reader
                     might misinterpret <em>Emma. </em>Close examination of various passages of the novel examine the shifting definitions
                     of “happiness,” and why those moments of contention are important to understand it
                     as ironic commentary on the importance—and often confusion—of intention and interpretation.
                     Spacks argues that the novel can be read as an exploration on the importance of imagination
                     to happiness, and how fragile that construction can be.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">Stewart utilizes <em>Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre, </em>and <em>Great Expectations </em>to teach students about a difficult topic—prose style—for their authors’ mastery of
                     innovative techniques of narration. Students are asked to complete a series of assignments,
                     beginning with identifying the meaning of one word as it occurs throughout the text,
                     then in an extended passage or paragraph, and finally in comparing two passages from
                     different parts of a novel. Austen functions as the “sensitivity training” introduction
                     to the first part of this sequence, offering a clear example of a text where words
                     and phrases hold meanings of their own. In Stewart’s experience, students quickly
                     identify Austen’s prose style as confident and calm, capable of carrying hidden meanings.
                     The “recognition scenes” in this novel examined for such moments are those that mirror
                     a “sketch” or “portrait,” a theme carried throughout the story and that helps unite
                     it as a whole.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">Sullivan argues that teaching styles must be modified over time in relation to the
                     historical and cultural atmosphere of that moment, meaning that novels must be reread
                     constantly. Doing so will promote the discovery of new interpretations and stimulate
                     innovative techniques with which to view the world. By using feminist and Marxist
                     theorists to explain the ending of <em>Pride and Prejudice, </em>the modern reader can better make sense of how an ironic text on romance ends with
                     that very thing. Sullivan therefore moved from teaching Austen’s novel as an education
                     to a deconstructive historical text where money marries love in a reflection of real
                     life relationships at the time where “propriety and property” reign.</p>

                     the importance of wealth and position, as they guided society during the period. It
                     serves to educate students how Austen herself viewed the society in which she lived
                     and the practices and etiquette that shaped her life and others. Materials include
                     The Navy List, draft copies of Austen’s manuscript, and manner guides. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">This collection of resources is meant to illuminate the students' understanding of
                     how Austen managed to comment on and critique her world while remaining morally respectable.
                     It places emphasis on her portrayal of class in the nineteenth century and is complimented
                     by excerpts from Sir Walter Scott’s praise for Austen’s originality. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">This essay details the motivation behind the author’s decision to teach Austen in
                     a small, seminar-type class setting, rather than a lecture format. Students showed
                     such a high interest in the class that the author had to handpick its members. Trilling
                     believes that Austen was appealing to so many young people because she offers a repose
                     from a modern world they feel out of place in, with her genteel visual-based world,
                     and construction of characters to whom they can relate. He draws the conclusion that,
                     despite all of the unfamiliar aspects of the Romantic period and Austen’s world, humanism
                     is what ultimately creates the bond between the modern reader and Austen, an idea
                     expanded upon in this article to include other authors and texts. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">Wallace promotes teaching the artistic shift from classical to Romantic in both music
                     and literature through the work of Emily Brontë, Jane Austen, Beethoven and Mozart
                     using concepts of tempo, melody, and rhythm. Wallace discusses his decision to include
                     these artists instead of others, and explains what resources he used to complete the
                     class goals. He also details assignments and reading suggestions garnered from the
                     experience of teaching the course multiple times. </p>

                  <p class="noCount">Watkins suggests that the best way to teach complex characters in a moral philosophy
                     course is through the study of novels, and particularly of <em>Persuasion, </em>for its detailed and complex descriptions. Doing so emphasizes philosophical examples,
                     revealing the text to be one of interdisciplinary ethical engagement. To overcome
                     students' tendency to focus on plot only, Watkins introduced the novel at the end
                     of the class, in order to ensure that the students have had a solid philosophical
                     background from which to draw their analysis, in addition to short readings that accompany
                     the various chapters of Austen’s work. <em>Persuasion </em>serves the ethics class more readily than other Austen novels because of its accessible
                     heroine, lack of distortion of the story by a Hollywood movie version, and emphasis
                     on pride and virtue.</p>

                        in J. K. Rowling's <em>Harry Potter</em>.” <em>Children's Literature</em> 35 (2007): 145-65. Print.</span></span> 
                  <p class="noCount">Comparing <em>Harry Potter </em>to one of J. K. Rowling’s self-proclaimed favorite authors, Austen, makes parallels
                     between the two authors' narrative style and the journey of learning and self-discovery
                     in moral education become visible. Teaching Austen and Rowling together reveals how
                     both authors focused their plots around one character’s perspective and encourage
                     imagination, and this article demonstrates how <em>Emma </em>and <em>Mansfield Park </em>in particular are useful to this method.</p>

                  <p class="noCount">Zaal begins with analysis of the sophisticated strategies Austen employs in the main
                     movements of the novel and the character construction of Emma. The essay suggests
                     ways to introduce the text to a modern audience through two key questions: should
                     marriage partners be chosen based on social status, and is it ever okay to conceal
                     one relationship by hiding behind false feelings for someone else? Teachers can gain
                     additional benefits by using the Socratic method, engaging in close reading of the
                     text, and having prepared questions. Zaal also says that Austen’s humor is so intertwined
                     with other subjects in the book that it should not be given separate treatment. </p>
