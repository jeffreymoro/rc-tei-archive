                <p rend="noCount">This article offers fresh and detailed information about how the
                    elite schools and colleges of Oxford and Cambridge educated many of the
                    canonical writers and public men of the Romantic Period. While these schools
                    excluded women and non-Anglicans, they offered their students&#8212;among whom
                    numbered Percy, Cowper, Darwin, Crabbe Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Byron,
                    Shelley, Sidney Smith, Canning, and most of the clergymen and men of state&#8212;a
                    remarkable program of linguistic, mathematical, and theological training.
                    Students began composing metrical verse in Latin and Greek from boyhood, studied
                    logic and read Euclid’s geometry in Greek, did copious amounts of memory work,
                    wrote “themes” several times a week in three languages, and declaimed and argued
                    publicly at least once a year. Understanding how these writers were educated
                    offers scholars of the period several new ways to think about and teach the
                    works of those writers and the movement they inspired. It also allows students
                    of the period to have greater appreciation of Romantic writers’ craft and their
                    own experiences of learning about language, literature, and composition.</p>

            <p>Understanding how writers of the English Romantic Period were educated offers modern
                professors studying the period several new ways to think about and teach the works
                of those writers and the movement they inspired. It also allows students studying
                the period to have greater appreciation for Romantic writers’ craft and their own
                experiences of learning about language, literature, and composition. Formal
                education between the years 1770 and 1850 was neither well organized nor widely
                available in England. Working class children might have had the benefit of no more
                than a few years of instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic; they were
                considered “literate” even if they could do nothing more than write their names. The
                daughters of the middle and upper classes might be taught at home by their fathers,
                public-school educated brothers, or governesses, and later sent away to ladies’
                seminaries to improve their reading and writing skills and to learn French, music,
                drawing, dancing, and fine stitchery. University education was out of the question
                for English girls until late in the Victorian Period, though some studied ancient
                Greek privately and used it to publish translations of Greek tragedies.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Even then, young women could attend lectures, but
                    were not permitted to earn the BA from Oxford or Cambridge until the 20th
                    century. Some colleges at both universities did not become fully co-educational
                    until the 1980s.</note> The sons of these families—many of whom are among the
                canonized poets of the period—were more fortunate. They were sent away to one of the
                great public schools, such as Eton or Harrow, or to one of the endowed grammar
                schools, such as Hawkshead or Chesterfield Grammar, which prepared them for study at
                Oxford or Cambridge. Boys were packed off to these schools no later than age
                thirteen; some boys were enrolled as young as age eight. Wordsworth was nine when
                his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School; he boarded nearby with Ann Tyson
                for eight years. Samuel Taylor Coleridge was ten when he was sent to Christ’s
                Hospital. Horace Walpole boarded at Eton for seven years; Shelley was there for six;
                Byron was at Harrow for five. With the exception of Shelley, all of these students
                subsequently attended Oxford or Cambridge for at least three years.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Among the other poets who were educated at what
                    might be called the “Anglo-classical academy” were poets such as Thomas Warton
                    (1728–1790), Thomas Percy (1729–1811), William Cowper (1731–1800), Erasmus
                    Darwin (1731–1802), George Crabbe (1754–1832), George Dyer (1755–1841), William
                    Lisle Bowles (1762–1850), William Wordsworth (1770–1850), Samuel Taylor
                    Coleridge (1772–1834), Robert Southey (1774–1843), Lord Byron (1788–1824), Percy
                    Shelley (1792–1822), and Thomas Dale (1797–1870). Others writers and important
                    intellectuals of the period were similarly educated as well: This group includes
                    John Wesley (1703–1791), David Hartley (1705–1757), Samuel Johnson (1709–1784),
                    Horace Walpole (1717–1797), Adam Smith (1723–1790), William Gilpin (1724–1804),
                    Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), John Horne Took (1734–1812), Thomas Haweis (c.
                    1734–1820), Edward Gibbon (1737–1794), Joseph Banks (1743–1820), William Paley
                    (1743–1805), Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), Vicesimus Knox (1752–1821),Thomas
                    Gisborne (1758–1846), William Wilberforce (1759–1833), Thomas Malthus
                    (1766–1834), Francis Wrangham (1769–1843), Matthew “Monk” Lewis (1775–1818),
                    Charles Lamb (1775–1834) Henry Hallam (1777–1859), Mark Peter Roget (1779–1869),
                    William Buckland (1784–1856), Leigh Hunt (1784–1859), Thomas De Quincey
                    (1785–1859), Richard Whateley (1787–1863), William Hamilton (1788–1856), Charles
                    Babbage (1791–1871), George Peacock (1791–1858), John Herschel (1792–1871),
                    Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), Macaulay (1800–1859), and Thomas Beddoes
                    (1803–1849).</note> These institutions taught these writers and many other
                middle- and upper-class boys in their audience most of what they knew about the
                meanings, sounds, and use of language in texts. These schools and university colleges 
                were where many poets became remarkably
                well-acquainted with literary forms, the art of writing, and the Western literary
                canon. </p>
            <p>Instruction at these elite schools focused on language. Youngsters began building a
                rich classical vocabulary, first in Latin, later in Greek, through guided reading,
                translation, memory work, recitation, and conversation. Students read verse in these
                languages every day, and at least three days a week they were required to compose
                verse and prose in them as well. Schoolmasters typically chose classical verse or
                discourses that were intentionally didactic, such as Cicero’s epistles to his son
                and Quintilian’s lessons on how to be “a good man . . . speaking well” (Bizell and
                Herzberg 323–24). In addition to these circumstances, it is important to note that
                all the teachers at these elite institutions were Oxford- or Cambridge-educated
                Anglican clergymen and that every day school and college began and ended with
                communal celebration of the Morning and Evening Prayer services. Moreover, teaching
                and learning at these institutions were quite personal: schoolmasters lived, ate,
                and worshiped with their students. Tutors at the two ancient English universities,
                which had a combined enrollment of only 1250 students in 1800, also resided, shared
                commons, and worshiped in college with their students. Romantic-era tutors were
                college fellows, and each worked individually with a small group of students from
                the day they entered as freshmen. Tutors designed and guided students’ reading,
                according to each one’s personal aspirations, in readiness for the college exams. If
                a student was clever and ambitious, his tutor’s job included helping him prepare for
                the much more competitive university exams that typically lead to fellowships and a
                career in academia or the church. Tutors were responsible as well for students’
                behavior, belongings, and personal financial affairs. Added to these circumstances,
                it was not unusual for students to be in the presence of members of the royal
                family, bishops, and other statesmen, for these individuals were often guests of
                honor at festivities held at the schools. University Chancellors were statesmen or
                high-ranking men of court, and both universities elected their own Members of
                Parliament. This collection of academic, religious, and social practices at the
                schools and universities helps clarify why Coleridge thought of poets and other
                learned people as members of a <emph>clerisy</emph> and why Shelley claimed that
                poets are the legislators of the world. It also explains why Wordsworth asserted in
                the Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> that that poets are
                translators and why he wrote his friend George Beaumont that “Every great Poet is a
                Teacher: I wish either to be considered as a Teacher, or as nothing” (De Selincourt
                    <title level="m">Letters</title>, 195).</p>
            <p>I have recently completed a book, tentatively titled <title level="m">Training for the 
            Writer's Life in Anglo-classical Academy, 1770–1850</title>. From a pedagogical
                perspective, the two most notable findings of my research are how the Romantics were
                taught Latin and Greek “grammar,” which included not only vocabulary building and
                syntax, but also memory work and explicit daily instruction about the sound and
                rhythms of language, and how much writing students were required to do each week.
                With regard to the possible influences this education may have had upon the
                Romantics’ formal or thematic choices, one of the most interesting findings was how
                familiar students became with a wide range of verse forms—from heroic couplets to
                epics. Daily reading and instruction using scripture and the elegantly ordinary
                language of the <title level="m">Book of Common Prayer</title> was also an important
                aspect of this education thanks to the Lectionary of the <title level="m"
                    >BCP</title>; every month students read all 150 psalms, and in a year’s time,
                they read through the entire New Testament.<note place="foot" resp="author">Even
                    though an avowed atheist, Shelley demonstrated the effects of his early biblical
                    training right up to the month of his death, when, according to Holmes, he kept

                <head>Classical “Grammar”</head>
                <p>Educators in the Romantic Period believed along with the Scottish poet James
                    Beattie that a person must be “something of a grammarian to be able thoroughly
                    to understand a well-written book . . . [for] the complicated inflexions and
                    syntax of these elegant tongues [give] rise to innumerable subtleties of
                    connection, and minute varieties of meaning, whereof the superficial reader, who
                    thinks grammar below his notice can have no idea” (508–9). Hence, the focus of
                    the first years at school in the Romantic Period was Latin “grammar,” which
                    began with boys learning words in Latin along with instruction in how to use
                    them. These included “the art of spelling; . . . parts of speech, with their
                    accidents and formations; . . . the construction of words into sentences,
                    according to their several relations to each other . . .; and . . . the quantity
                    of syllables and their arrangement in versification” (<title level="m">The Eton
                        Latin Grammar</title> 3). The methods schoolmasters used to build students’
                    grammar skills began with explaining and demonstrating the meanings of clusters
                    of Latin words that appeared in simple verse texts by writers such as Ovid and
                    Terence. Teachers attended not only to the meanings and proper grammatical use
                    of words, but also, significantly, to the accents and the quantities (the longs
                    and shorts) of each syllable. Every night for homework boys memorized the
                    verses, vocabulary, and grammar rules covered in class. The next day, they
                    recited and reviewed the previous lesson, read more lines of verse, and learned
                    new words and grammar rules. This sequence would be repeated every day, with
                    review on Fridays and Saturdays.<note place="foot" resp="author">Dr. Vincent,
                        the headmaster of Westminster when Southey was there, cautioned
                        schoolmasters not to go faster in teaching than boys could learn.</note></p>
                <p>The most common texts used in the lower forms were Ovid’s <title level="m"
                        >Metamorphoses</title>, composed entirely in dactylic hexameter; Terence’s
                    verse comedies; and Phaedrus’s Latin verse translations of Aesop’s fables.
                    Beattie noted that reading these “harmonious” and “amusive” stories as a
                    youngster both awakened and soothed his “human passions” (497). After a few
                    weeks, boys were asked to compose their first <emph>themes</emph>, which were
                    nonsense verses, comprised of strings of Latin words that fit simple metrical
                    patterns. The lines of words did not have to make sense; they simply had to
                    demonstrate the boys’ knowledge of the pronunciation of the words and the metrical
                    patterns they were learning. Pupils might be asked to compose these themes several
                    times a week. Once boys had large enough vocabularies, their teachers required
                    them to write verse themes that made sense. As mentioned above and also detailed
                    below, by the time a boy was thirteen or fourteen, he was composing verse and
                    prose themes every week.</p>
                <p>Usually by their second or third year at school, students were reading much more
                    complicated Latin verse and had begun studying Greek in the same fashion.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> We know that by the time he was fourteen,
                        Wordsworth had advanced to Greek studies at Hawkshead, where he used
                        Hendricks’ Greek lexicon and owned his own copy of Demosthenes. In 1785 his
                        father also bought him a copy of <title level="m">Euclid</title> in Greek
                        and a Greek exercise book. Wordsworth’s brother Christopher was similarly
                        taught as a boy and both continued their classical reading at Cambridge.
                        Years later, when he became Master of Trinity, Christopher Wordsworth
                        encouraged Greek studies in English schools, and, despite the dominance of
                        Newtonian mathematics at the university, he encouraged interest in classical
                        studies at Trinity. As Bruce Graver has reminded us, it was through his
                        brother at Trinity that Wordsworth “kept in touch with many of the leading
                        Hellenists of the day” (42).</note> A fifth-form student at any of these
                    schools might be asked in one week’s time to read, parse, memorize, and write
                    translations of approximately 150 lines of Homer, sixty lines of Horace, seventy
                    lines of Virgil, and assorted passages from writers such as Aeschylus,
                    Euripides, Pindar, Sappho, and Cicero, as well as the Book of Psalms and the Old
                    and New Testaments. The standard text at virtually all the public schools,
                    grammar schools, and the universities was Virgil’s <title level="m"
                        >Aeneid</title>. This text gave students the occasion to study some of the
                    classical world’s finest examples of dactylic hexameter and to consider themes
                    that became important in public discourse when the young Romantics were adults,
                    such as national pride, free will, the different forms of power, and love of
                    home and family. Students at both levels also read the four books of Virgil's
                    <title level="m">Georgics</title>, which are long didactic poems about country life. Written in an
                    unsettled time, not unlike that of the Romantics, these texts praise natural
                    beauty, the virtues of country life, and rural labor. As Kenneth Johnson has
                    aptly noted, they also rehearse the notion of “rural republican virtue checking
                    urban imperial excess” (72).</p>
                <p>Along with Virgil, students in the Romantic period read almost all of Horace’s
                    verse epistles and odes.<note place="foot" resp="author">Charles James Fox, who
                        attended Eton and Oxford, is reputed to have carried a volume of Horace with

                    poems, which most often focus upon topics such as love, friendship, and poetry,

                    word choice. Additionally, many of Horace’s works represent a culturally
                    significant figure that mattered to the parents of schoolboys and college
                    students: the ideal gentleman, whom the classical scholar Ogilvie characterizes
                    as a wise and humane man who endeavors to see the world with humor rather than
                    bitterness and who advocates for moderation and the moral health of the state
                    (49–50). Students in the Romantic Period also studied Hesiod’s <title level="m"
                        >Works and Days</title>, Epictetus’s serious and Lucian’s comic dialogues,
                    Theocritus’s bucolic poetry, Callimachus’s epigrams and elegies, and Longinus’s
                    literary criticism. These readings acquainted Romantic-era students with the
                    Greeks’ characteristic exaltation of honor, heroism, and loyalty; their love of
                    freedom, beauty, and the countryside; and Longinus’s dictum that sublime
                    discourse should transport as well as persuade by using “great conceptions, . .
                    . inspired passion, . . . noble diction, . . . and dignified and elevated
                    composition” (Longinus, quoted in Richter 84).</p>
                <p>By the time a boy graduated from one of these schools, he had learned to
                    recognize and use a variety of metrical feet, not just iambs, trochees,
                    spondees, anapests, and dactyls, but also trisyllables such as amphibrachs (˘–˘) 
                    and molossi (–––) and tetrasyllables such as the four paeons and the
                    choriamb (–˘˘–).<note place="foot" resp="author">An indication of how
                        well-acquainted boys were with the purposes and conventions of prosody can
                        be discerned in the questions appearing in the grammar textbook used at the
                        Bath Grammar School in 1794. These included “What is the use of Prosody,”
                        “What are the Feet most commonly made Use of?”, “Of how many Syllables does
                        a Dactyl consist?”, and “What is Synalaepha?” (Morgan 9, 10, 15, 20).</note>
                    Teachers also, no doubt, explained three metrical conventions that are standard
                    in classical Latin&#8212;the accentuation of the final foot, an extrametrical final
                    syllable, and the common use of moraic trochees.<note place="foot" resp="author"
                        > A mora is a lingering or “long” syllable. A moraic trochee is a foot in
                        which the first syllable is a “long” syllable, which, therefore, carries
                        more stress than the first syllable of a simple trochee.</note>The schools’
                    regimen of vocabulary building, parsing, translating and memorizing acquainted
                    students quite intimately not only with these metrical tools, but also with an
                    array of verse forms including pastoral verse such as georgics, idylls, and
                    eclogues; lyrics such as odes, hymns, psalms, and paeans; narratives such as
                    epics, <emph>epyllia</emph> (mini-epics), comedies, tragedies, and
                    tragi-comedies; verse epistles, satire, allegories, elegies, encomia,
                    invectives, and epigrams. The Cambridge classicist, Richard Rutherford, asserts
                    that the ancient writers whom Romantic-era school boys studied so closely were
                    “always conscious of what they [were] writing, and what kind of work it [was]”;
                    both “the artists and the critics [of the ancient world] regularly [referred] to
                    generic rules and expectations” (11). Hence, from an early age, English students
                    understood that good writing was systematic and that an educated person should
                    be able to recognize and appreciate literary forms and conventions.</p>

                    <p>Underlying most of the Georgian schools’ work with younger boys was the
                        notion that “the instruction of childhood depends more on memory than
                        intellect” (Sergeaunt 30).<note place="foot" resp="author">The emphasis
                            upon memory work is founded on the classical rhetorical tradition, in
                            which memory is one of the five canons. The Pythagoreans were especially
                            dedicated to using memory training, for they considered the possession
                            of a powerful memory as necessary to their endeavors to recollect the
                            immortal soul. Memory was, therefore, a necessary pre-condition of moral
                            and spiritual excellence. In later Christian times, cultivating the
                            memory became a part of salvation theology. The importance of memory is
                            not unprecedented in other cultures. From at least the time of the
                            Middle Ages, Chinese students were expected to memorize the Five
                            Classics and the Four Books of Confucian teaching along with the
                            commentaries by Zhu Xi (1130–1200). The Brahmin tradition of India even
                            today depends upon students having highly trained memories. The Vedas
                            and commentaries are memorized using elaborate methods, including
                            memorizing syllables of passages in reverse to the end that all rituals
                            will be correctly chanted.</note>The lessons described above were
                        designed to capitalize on children’s remarkable memories, imitative skills,
                        and their ability to pick up language quickly. Knox asserted that a boy
                        “habituated to the task [of memory work] will learn thirty or forty lines,
                        as an evening exercise, with great ease, and with apparent pleasure. This is
                        really done,” he said, “three or four nights in a week, in our best schools”
                        (99). Assisted by their natural sense of rhythm and the patterns of verse
                        that they were learning, many students easily memorized hundreds of lines of
                        Latin and Greek verse. Schoolmasters also appealed to youngsters’ natural
                        competitiveness when assigning memory work. Boy battles over who could
                        memorize the most lines were not uncommon. When Arnold studied at
                        Winchester, he was reputed to have memorized three thousand lines of Homer
                        (Clarke 54).<note place="foot" resp="author">The <title level="m"

                        and <title level="m">Georgics</title> and most of Catullus, Juvenal, and

                    <p>Thomas Arnold, who was no friend of meaningless busy work, marveled at the
                        vigor of youthful memory and defended the schools’ use of memorization
                        exercises. George Chapman, the headmaster of the grammar school at Dumfries,
                        Scotland, commented that memorized texts make a deeper and more lasting
                        impression on students’ minds than texts that students simply read and put
                        aside. Knox said a boy is benefited by having a great number of words and
                        phrases “enforced upon the sensorium” and “laid up in the storehouse of his
                        memory” (101).<note place="foot" resp="author">So great was Knox’s
                            appreciation of memory work that he asserted rather dramatically that

                            memory the thoughts and words of heroes, and of worthies, who eminently
                            shone in every species of excellence” (102).</note>Coleridge comments
                        in the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> on the wisdom of
                        “storing the memory, during the period when the memory is the predominant
                        faculty, with facts for the after exercise of the judgment” (Halmi 383). He
                        also credited memory exercises at school with awakening in him “the fond and
                        unmixed LOVE and ADMIRATION” of literature (Halmi 383). While a student at
                        Eton, Winthrop Mackworth Praed (1802–1839)<note place="foot" resp="author"
                            >Praed, who had a career in politics that was cut short by his early

                        in the student magazine that the effect of reading and memorizing classical
                        poetry, drama, and satire gave him a “copious and splendid command of
                        language” and an “ear tuned up . . . to the ‘noiseless music of the
                        spheres’” (<title level="m">The Etonian</title> 102). He also maintained
                        that the experience of memorizing great literature gave poets “prototypes”
                        to “impregnate with the living soul and breath of [their own] Imagination”
                        (102). Critics and, indeed, writers themselves may never be entirely sure of
                        the degree to which the content, language, or rhythms of any text are
                        original, recalled, or a mix of both; but understanding the degree to which
                        memory work was a part of the Romantics’ education should be useful to
                        scholars, particularly those interested in the composition process,
                        influence studies, or the trajectory of certain writer’s careers. For

                        things” might be assessed in new ways in the light of this information.</p>
                    <p>As noted above, Romantic-era schoolboys were assigned compositions several
                        times every week. Along with their nonsense verses, students’ earliest
                        writing assignments were translations: first of the easy verses of Ovid, but
                        later of much more complicated classical and/or biblical texts in Latin and
                        Greek. Students were instructed to avoid word-for-word translations and,
                        instead, to express the sense, verbal register, and style of the original
                        text in idiomatic English. As a Rugby student explained, this was excellent
                        writing practice because it excused boys from having to come up with
                        original ideas but gave them practice constructing sentences or lines of
                        verse that demonstrated careful word choice, that were grammatically
                        correct, and that adhered to accepted literary conventions. Boys called upon
                        these translation exercises and their memory work as well as their fulsome
                        experience reading a variety of literary forms to complete their many
                        writing assignments.</p>
                    <p>In the 1790s a typical week of compositions for the fifth form at Rugby
                        included four themes, at least two of which would be Latin or Greek verses;
                        a translation in English from a text in one of these languages; and a piece
                        of verse or prose in English. Examples of the verse topics Thomas Arnold
                        assigned include: <title level="m">Porcia, Catonis Filia, Bruti Uxor</title>
                        (Portia, the daughter of Cato and wife of Brutus) and <title level="m"
                            >Africa, bonarum atrium nutrix, nunc barbarie premitur</title> (Africa,
                        once the nurse of benign skills, is now barbarically oppressed). His prose
                        theme assignments ranged from essays on miracles to realistic descriptions
                        of the state of affairs for residents of the continent in the summer of
                        1815. A typical week at Tonbridge Grammar School included assignments to
                        write a short ode in Greek, twenty lines of iambic pentameter, a letter home
                        in English, and a collection of Latin verse epigrams, each with a different
                        topic. The amount of daily and weekly practice Romantic period schoolboys
                        had using words, thinking about the meanings and sounds of words, and
                        composing various verse and prose forms is remarkable. By one calculation, a
                        boy who spent six years in boarding school might have translated as many as
                        six thousand lines of Latin or Greek prose and 4800 lines of Latin or Greek
                        verse. This youngster would have also written ninety prose essays and as
                        many as 4200 lines of verse (the equivalent of 300 sonnets).</p>
                    <p>Romantic-era educators’ defense of requiring so much verse composition took
                        several forms. Themes were assigned not only to ensure boys appreciated
                        quantities of Latin words “without knowledge of which [they] will not be
                        able to read Latin with propriety” (Knox 60), but also to make sure boys
                        learned to be precise and to waste no words. Edward Copleston, the Professor
                        of Poetry at Oxford, asserted in 1810 that educators did not give verse
                        assignments because they expected students to produce original verse, but
                        because “the poetic faculty exists to a certain degree in all minds and
                        should not lie uncultivated in any” (129). Moreover, writing verse teaches
                        the “habit of compression without obscurity, . . . of selecting the fittest
                        materials . . . setting them in the nicest order . . . and a command of
                        pure, terse, polished diction” (Copleston 131). Producing lines of
                        meaningful Latin in specified meters, teachers explained, helped to tune
                        students’ “ears to harmony” and to afford them “greater pleasure in reading
                        poetry” (Sergeant 31). In the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>,
                        Coleridge remarks that his contemporaries’ admirable ability to “translate .
                        . . prose thoughts into poetic language had been kept up by, if it did not
                        wholly arise from, the custom of writing Latin verses, and [by] the great
                        importance attached to these exercises in our public schools” (388).</p>
                    <p>Not a few public and grammar school students, including Wordsworth, Byron,
                        and Percy Shelley, began writing and publishing English verse while in
                        school, and several recognized their calling as poets at school. In the
                            <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>, Coleridge says that he
                        learned from his headmaster, James Boyer, that no word, “phrase, metaphor,
                        or image [in a poem should be] unsupported by a sound sense,” and that
                        “plainer words,” which can impart the same sense with “force and dignity,” are
                        to be preferred (381).<note place="foot" resp="author">Coleridge recalls
                            his headmaster exclaiming “Harp? Harp? Lyre? Pen and ink, boy, you mean!
                            Muse, boy, Muse? Your nurses’ daughter, you mean!” (381).</note>In Book
                        Fifth of the 1805 <title level="m">Prelude</title>, Wordsworth describes the
                        “deep joy” he received while a student at Hawkshead when he encountered “the
                        mystery of words” in the works of the “mighty [classical] poets” and how
                        they worked “their changes” (V.617, 621, 619, 623). Wordsworth notes as
                        well that he came to understand then how poetry works, and that “forms and
                        substances are circumfused” not only by “light divine,” but also “through
                        the turnings intricate of verse” (V.625–27).</p>
                    <p>Among the books used to help Romantic period students with their study and
                        writing of poetry was John Newbery’s <title level="m">Poetry Made Familiar
                            and Easy</title> (1776). Newbery asserts that “Poetry’s task, since the
                        earliest Ages of the World,” is to “celebrate the Praises of the GREAT
                        AUTHOR of the Universe” (ii). Its whole aim and intention are “to
                            <emph>please</emph> and to instruct” by borrowing from “Nature every
                        thing that is gay and delightful” and adorning its “Diction with Number and
                        Harmony,” and by employing “the <emph>Marvellous</emph> and
                            <emph>Pathetic</emph> in their proper Places” (v–vi). Newbery defines
                        the “true Poet” as one who is 
                        
                        <quote> distinguished by a fruitfulness of
                            Invention, a lively Imagination tempered by solid judgment, and
                            Nobleness of Sentiments and Ideas, and bold, lofty, and figurative
                            Manner of Expression. He thoroughly understands the Nature of his
                            Subject; and [regardless of the length of his poem], he forms a Design
                            or Plan, by which every Verse is directed to a certain End, and each has
                            a just Dependance on the other. (8)

                        Examples of instruction
                        such as this suggest that some of the Romantics’ most famous statements
                        about poetry, the poet, his imagination, and his embrace of the natural
                        world were not as original to them as scholars have assumed.</p>
                    <p>So how might modern teaching scholars use this information about how the
                        Romantics’ classical education endeavored to raise young men with “A copious
                        and splendid command of language and an ear tuned to the ‘noiseless music of
                        the spheres’” (<title level="m">The Etonian</title> 102)? For starters, we
                        would do well to redouble our efforts to train students in close reading, to
                        remind them to attend to word choice (including the etymology of key words),
                        and to metrical matters in Romantic verse. New source and influence studies,
                        particularly ones that examine Greek and Latin pastoral verse and the
                        religious texts students read, including the <title level="m">Book of Common
                            Prayer</title>, are also indicated. In the spirit of this issue of
                            <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Pedagogies Editions</title>, I offer
                        the following categories and proposed class assignments or research
                        projects, which range from close reading to thematic studies. When I assign
                        the projects suggested below, I begin with a lecture on how the Romantics
                        were trained, using the information explained above, and discussion on the
                        importance of understanding the contexts and constraints under which writers
                        labored. I also remind students that many in the Romantic audience possessed
                        similar literary and linguistic knowledge. These assignments will, of
                        course, require some revision based upon local curricula and individual
                        professors’ teaching plans and their style of assignment-writing. </p>

                        <p>I suggest that professors begin by explaining that educated Romantics were
                            trained in the classical languages from which English evolved. Students
                            could recognize if a word were derived from Latin, Greek, German, Old or
                            Middle English, then follow this plan:</p>
                        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1"><hi rend="bold">Step 1:</hi> Working in pairs, ask students to select a
                            passage from an early poem by Wordsworth, such as the first ten lines of
                                <title level="a">An Evening Walk,</title> which describe the
                            countryside of the English Lake District. Then ask them to look up the
                            etymology of the key words in these lines in the <title level="m">Oxford
                                English Dictionary</title>. (They are almost all from Old or Middle
                            English, not Latin. In my view, this is no accident.) Ask each pair of
                            students to discuss these word choices and then to present their
                            findings to the class.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1"><hi rend="bold">Step 2:</hi> Ask students to do the same etymological
                            work with a much later work that focuses upon another place, such as one
                            of the poems about Rome in <title level="a">Memorials of A Tour in
                                Italy, 1837.</title> The question for discussion might be, What

                            emerge. </p>

                            <p>A lesson on Romantic prosody should begin with an explanation of how
                                students were trained to recognize the music of language, the
                                quantities of syllables, and conventional metrical requirements of
                                particular verse forms. Then students should be reminded that
                                students wrote verse every week, and this exercise ensured that they
                                both understood meter and had learned to use it skillfully. Ask your
                                students, out of respect for this tradition, to start paying more
                                attention to the Romantics’ metrical efforts. Then I suggest the
                                following series of assignments:</p>
                            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1"><hi rend="bold">Step 1.</hi> Begin this series of exercises with a
                                lesson about prosody that reviews the different feet, the line
                                lengths, the notion of metrical contracts, and the purposes of
                                metrical variation. Some of this will be quite foreign and confusing
                                to students. If this goes well, add a brief survey of the metrical
                                conventions of the genres that the Romantics knew well, such as the
                                epic, the pastoral, the ode, and the heroic couplet. Good sources

                                metrical analysis of an easy, regular poem, such as Wordsworth’s
                                    <title level="a">I wandered lonely as a cloud</title>; it is
                                very regular iambic tetrameter until line 6, where the first
                                significant variation occurs: “<emph>Flut</emph>’ring and
                                    <emph>danc</emph>ing in the breeze,”  a move that emphasizes 
                                the liveliness of the daffodils (De Selincourt 149).</p>
                            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1"><hi rend="bold">Step 3.</hi> Next try the same exercise on
                                Wordsworth’s <title level="a">We Are Seven</title>; it uses
                                alternating lines of tetrameter and trimeter, but the pattern is not
                                clear until stanza three. I suggest that you acknowledge this and
                                then ask students to start their scanning practice with stanza
                                three, noting where and how Wordsworth varies the meter elsewhere in
                                the poem. Then ask students why Wordsworth might have chosen to
                                    <emph>begin</emph> the poem with stanzas that vary the metrical
                                pattern that he later uses throughout most of the rest of his
                                poem.</p>
                            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1"><hi rend="bold">Step 4.</hi> If this exercise goes well, challenge
                                students to have a go at a passage from <title level="a">Tintern

                                    Works</title>. I suggest starting in stanza four in the middle
                                of line 88 at “For I have learned / To look on nature, not as in the
                                hour / Of thoughtless youth,” and stopping at the end of the stanza
                                with these words: “the nurse / The guide, the guardian of my
                                heart, and soul / Of all my moral being” (De Selincourt, lines
                                109–10). I ask them to look for the lines that are pure iambic
                                pentameter versus the ones where Wordsworth varies the accents. The
                                question, again, is as follows: What is accomplished by the metrical
                                variations? </p>

                                focuses upon is later, her discussion of how meter offers insight
                                into issues such as class, identity (both personal and national),
                                and patriotism is compelling.</p>

                                    reviewed classical forms such as the ode or georgics and the
                                    English sonnet tradition, challenges students to examine the
                                    Romantics’ management of literary forms and conventions. Even
                                    though sonnets are not a classical form, I include them because
                                    trying to do this exercise with longer poems is
                                    hard for some undergraduates. Any of the odes by Wordsworth,
                                    Coleridge, and Keats as well as well-known pastoral verses or
                                    georgics of the period that students might select themselves are
                                    good for such work. I also suggest asking students to compare
                                    sonnets by several Romantics, at least two of whom were not
                                    classically trained. Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Prefatory
                                        Sonnet</title> (it serves a double purpose of introducing

                                    Wordsworth’s style), Coleridge’s <title level="a">Work Without

                                        >To Night</title> all work well. I invite the class to
                                    compare each poet’s handling of structure and metrics and to
                                    discuss how these contribute to the impact and fluidity of the
                                    lines. The question for discussion is as follows: Are the poems
                                    by classically trained poets noticeably different? When students
                                    find differences, I challenge them to rank the effectiveness of
                                    each poet’s aesthetic and formal choices and to explain their
                                    rationale for their ranking.</p>

                                        this yet, but I yearn to challenge graduate students to
                                        select examples of one of the victory odes (<foreign
                                            xml:lang="la">epinikia</foreign>) of Pindar, which, as
                                        Rutherford aptly notes, are “highly poetic, full of
                                        compounds, unusual words, and florid metaphors” and which
                                        discourse on the theme of “ambition for fame in spite of
                                        risk” (178–79). The tasks would be for students to map
                                        those compounds, odd words, and metaphors, and then to
                                        compare Byron’s use of compounds, odd words, and metaphors

                                                  disrupt your usual method of studying Romantic

                                                  insights into the lives and work of the Romantics
                                                  and into their own learning and writing
                                                  experiences. Asking our students to write as often
                                                  for class as the Romantic schoolboys did will
                                                  teach them what a difference practice and revision
                                                  can make in their own compositions. Knowing what
                                                  Romantic schoolboys and college students were
                                                  trained to do with words and literary forms and
                                                  how central linguistic and metrical issues were to
                                                  those students’ early experience with literature
                                                  will support modern professors’ requests that
                                                  their students pay greater attention to close
                                                  reading, word choice, and meter. This information
                                                  also underscores how important it is, in general,
                                                  to consider texts in their historical context.
                                                  Knowing how intensively and carefully many of the
                                                  Romantic writers worked on poetry as schoolboys
                                                  helps modern students to appreciate why Wordsworth
                                                  claimed to have “acquired a greater readiness and
                                                  power in expressing what he thinks and feels”
                                                  because he had learned that the situation of an
                                                  accomplished poet “is altogether slavish and
                                                  mechanical” (Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical
                                                  Ballads</title> in De Selincourt 734–41). These
                                                  circumstances also explain why Wordsworth claimed
                                                  to have a “sublime notion of poetry” (738).
                                                  Finally, the story of the Anglo-classical
                                                  tradition in Romantic-era schools and colleges may
                                                  even make some modern students jealous of the
                                                  Romantics’ richly stocked memories and sensoria
                                                  and inspire them to study classical languages. </p>
