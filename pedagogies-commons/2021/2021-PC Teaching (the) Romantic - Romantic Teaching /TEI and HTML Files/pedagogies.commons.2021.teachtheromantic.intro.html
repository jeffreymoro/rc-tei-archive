                    <p class=" "><strong>1</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean-Francois Lyotard argues that true learning can only occur once we begin
                        to &ldquo;learn to unlearn&rdquo; our various expertises (101). Each time we return to a
                        text or a question we must &ldquo;recommence . . . [and] always begin in the middle&rdquo;
                        (100&ndash;101). This collection of essays, <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Teaching (the)
                            Romantic / Romantic Teaching</span>, would seem to bear witness to this
                        fact; it might easily be retitled <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Pictures from the Scene
                            of Unlearning</span>. When Kate Singer and I first issued the call for
                        this volume, we were interested in collecting essays that might have slipped
                        through the cracks of our many themed volumes (<span xmlns="" class="titlem">Teaching
                            Romanticism and Technology</span>, <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Teaching Global
                            Romanticism</span>, etc.). The types of essays we were hoping for would
                        examine new collective and individual intuitions of pedagogy, reimaginings
                        of the concerns of cognition, language sensitivity, and world-making; in
                        other words, we were looking for reports of pedagogical practice that shared
                        certain premises about the world with the Romantic-era writers we write
                        about and teach. If the kinds of &ldquo;soul making&rdquo; that Keats and Charlotte
                        Smith engaged in was in a certain sense uncategorizable, then perhaps it
                        should not surprise us that the ideas, techniques, and teachings through
                        which its pedagogy is constituted might also defy categorization.<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#1">&nbsp;[1]</a><a name="1back">&nbsp;</a> In any case, we were overwhelmed by the response to our
                        call. We received far more excellent proposals than could ever fit into a
                        single volume. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many folks
                        are doing such amazing work, we decided we wanted to create a more robust
                        platform from which teachers of Romanticism could articulate and share their
                        experience and intellectual labor. As a result, what you are now reading is
                        volume one of a two-volume set. </p>
                    <p class=" "><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why all of this interest in pedagogy at this particular moment? One answer
                        may be that when we are in the classroom, however that may look (my current
                        classroom during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is virtual and distanced), we
                        are best positioned to see the text from a new perspective and to discover
                        a new relation of text to world. The inherent multiplicity of the
                        classroom situation, and its ever-varying constituencies, makes this
                        possible. As such, teaching holds open the possibility of seeing in new
                        ways; it socializes the text by requiring that we continually &ldquo;recommence&rdquo;
                        (Lyotard 105).</p>
                    <p class=" "><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essays collected here are keen examples of this revisionary and processual
                        pedagogy. They ask us to reconsider our relationship to the two key moments
                        of any pedagogical &ldquo;project,&rdquo; what was and what is yet to be (Sartre 91). As
                        such, the essays in this collection move beyond mere contextualization.
                        Sarah Maitland&rsquo;s "Teaching <em xmlns="">Frankenstein</em> in the
                            Post-Columbine Classroom" narrates the efforts of her class to
                        understand the social and psychic underpinnings of the Creature&rsquo;s action by
                        contrasting his narrative to fragments from the journals of the Columbine
                        High School shooters. Catherine Ross&rsquo;s examination of the curriculums of
                        eighteenth- and nineteenth-century elite English schools not only enlightens
                        readers of Romanticism by situating canonical poets in their own pedagogical
                        milieu, but also suggests exercises designed to reproduce the effects and
                        experience for our twenty-first-century students. One senses in these essays
                        a profound commitment to the living history of a Romanticism that is
                        constantly being learned and unlearned, sketched out, erased, complicated,
                        and rewritten according to the ever-shifting exigencies of the political and
                        pedagogical field. Also included in this collection are two excellent essays
                        focused on poetry and poetics, each addressing a different aspect of verse
                        practice or lyric theory. Elizabeth Walker&rsquo;s essay, "&lsquo;Brown
                            Study&rsquo; Aesthetics in Romantic Literature," describes her attempts
                        to reframe, with her students, Romantic-era practices of reverie and lyric
                        production in terms of William Cowper&rsquo;s poetic reflection as described in
                            <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span>. Carrie Busby&rsquo;s essay, using
                        Wordsworth as a model, focuses on the &ldquo;acoustic ecologies&rdquo; of Romanticism,
                        past and present, suggesting that the reverberative effects of sounded-out
                        poetic environments and subjectivities are perceptible on several levels in
                        poetry, and, importantly, achievable in the classroom. Finally, we present
                        two mixed-genre essays. Rachel Feder&rsquo;s collaborative &ldquo;field study&rdquo; is a
                        speculative essay composed with her students. It asks and addresses the
                        question, what if, in Jane Austen&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Sense and
                            Sensibility</span>, Marianne becomes pregnant when she and Willoughby
                        visit Allenham House? Kathryn H. Warren&rsquo;s contribution closes our volume. A
                        full-throated defense of Romanticism as a living force, Warren&rsquo;s essay asks
                        us to bring all of ourselves into the classroom and to model for our
                        students what it means to &ldquo;take things personally.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p class=" "><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are so grateful to all these writers for their originality, perspicacity,
                        and courage, and are happy to be able to provide their essays with, if not a
                        fixed and stable home, then at least a space that they can shelter in
                        place.</p>
