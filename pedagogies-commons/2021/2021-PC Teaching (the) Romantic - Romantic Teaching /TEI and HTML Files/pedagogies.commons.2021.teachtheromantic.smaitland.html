                <p class=" ">While we now know that much of the early reporting after the mass
                    shooting at Columbine High School was incorrect, including the portrayal of the
                    shooters as social outcasts and victims of chronic bullying, the effects of
                    explaining that violence as retaliatory against a culture of elitism and cruelty
                    remain. Students reading <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span>
                    today&mdash;steeped in narratives of mass shootings&mdash;are influenced by
                    parallels between how we characterize the motivations of mass shooters and
                    Shelley&rsquo;s creature. But Shelley&rsquo;s text offers students more than these
                    parallels. While the Creature explains his acts of violence as reactionary and
                    justified, the novel thinks carefully and critically about his justification and
                    about the rights and responsibilities of men. In this paper I outline a method
                    for teaching the novel, paired with readings that narrate mass shootings as a
                    reaction to societal rejection, that invites students to analyze the way the
                    novel is thinking about acceptance, rejection, violence, and the rights of men.
                    Reading, thinking, and writing about the texts together allows students to more
                    richly examine the beautiful complexity of Shelley&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> as well as their own preconceived notions of
                    retaliatory violence.</p>

                <p class=" "><strong>1</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first taught <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> in an Introduction to
                    Literature class at a large state university. The student population was
                    socioeconomically and racially diverse, and included a large number of
                    first-generation college students. I was a graduate student at the time, and I
                    was deeply concerned that my lack of teaching experience would negatively impact
                    my students. I wanted more than anything for them to love the literature I loved
                    and to find in it a way of thinking more carefully and critically about all the
                    many things literature is particularly good at helping us think about like
                    identity, responsibility, education, social structures, and gender roles. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> I was half successful. My students
                    loved the novel. They came to class ready to talk about the characters, the
                    plot, the setting and&mdash;most especially&mdash;what they thought it all
                    meant. They were fascinated by questions of identity formation in the form of
                    nature vs. nurture, the guilt that Victor bears for the Creature&rsquo;s actions, and
                    Victor&rsquo;s oscillation between claiming and abdicating responsibility. The
                    conversation was interesting but my students returned again and again to one
                    question: who&rsquo;s to blame for the Creature&rsquo;s pain and&mdash;without any
                    differentiation between impetus and choice&mdash;his actions? I struggled,
                    though they did not, with some of the conclusions they drew. Many of my students
                    read <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> as a didactic text. The central
                    lesson: beware of how you treat others or they might just kill you. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially I was disturbed by what seemed to me an absence of nuance in their
                    readings of the text. I tried to push them to think more rigorously but found
                    most often that I was simply engaging them in debate, with them on one side and
                    me on the other. Didn&rsquo;t they see that the text struggled with issues of identity
                    formation without providing definitive answers? Didn&rsquo;t they see the difference
                    between condemning Victor&rsquo;s actions and excusing the Creature&rsquo;s choices because
                    of Victor&rsquo;s bad behavior? They definitely didn&rsquo;t. They didn&rsquo;t necessarily hold
                    the Creature up as a hero, but they placed the blame for his actions, even his
                    framing of Justine, on others. They didn&rsquo;t see any problem with the Creature&rsquo;s
                    belief that he has a right to be loved and that anyone denying him their love
                    was committing violence against him. My students read a clear and logical cause
                    and effect in the novel: Victor&mdash;and the world he lived in&mdash;denied the
                    Creature love and the Creature reacted with retaliatory violence. I attributed
                    the dissonance between my expectation and their interpretation to my own
                    inexperience. I thought perhaps if I&rsquo;d included historical material to ground
                    their reading the experience would have been richer. In many ways I looked at
                    the class as a failure because, although they had loved the text, I felt that
                    their didactic reading was at odds with the complexity of Shelley&rsquo;s novel.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next time I taught <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> was at a small,
                    private university. The student population was not socioeconomically or racially
                    diverse and the majority of the students were not first generation. Many of the
                    students came from elite private-school backgrounds. They couldn&rsquo;t be more
                    different from the students I taught in my previous attempt. I, no longer a
                    graduate student, armed myself with a context version of <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> that I thought would better prepare my students for
                    the complexities of the text. You can imagine my surprise when the outcome was
                    much the same. While my students enjoyed the novel, they saw it as a warning: be
                    nice or else. They attributed a disturbing logic to Shelley&rsquo;s work. They argued
                    that the Creature, bereft of love and persecuted by mankind, does exactly what
                    any reasonable person would expect and should have anticipated: he lashes out.
                    The Creature&rsquo;s behavior, to them, made complete sense and was even predictable.
                    While they acknowledged that what he did was wrong, it was in no way shocking
                    and, for many of them, was even somewhat justifiable. For my students the novel
                    explained violence on the part of the Creature through the actions of those
                    around him, expunged him from personal responsibility, and accepted retaliatory
                    violence as inevitable. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After my second experience teaching <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> I tried
                    several different approaches. I tried providing more history and context,
                    including drawing more heavily from Shelley&rsquo;s own life and the philosophical
                    conversations in which the novel takes part. I found that the additional context
                    helped my students expand the complexity of their readings but, no matter who
                    and where they were, many of them still argued that the novel posed retaliatory
                    violence as the natural and inevitable consequence of being unloved.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>6</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ubiquity of this didactic reading&mdash;let this be a lesson to you: be nice
                    or else&mdash;worried me. I began to consider that, at least for my students,
                    Shelley&rsquo;s work <em xmlns="">had</em> become didactic, and I wanted to know why. While
                    Shelley&rsquo;s text certainly hadn&rsquo;t changed, my students were coming at it from a
                    different cultural moment. As I sifted through student responses to the
                    readings, I noticed a recurring word across many different student responses:
                    bullying. Students characterized the fear, revulsion, and rejection the Creature
                    encountered as bullying&mdash;a word far more loaded for them than it was for
                    me. My own acquaintance with the anti-bullying movement was passing at best,
                    having attended elementary and high school at a time when it was most often used
                    in the context of after-school specials. My students, however, had spent their
                    elementary and high school years being taught and trained about bullies and
                    bullying. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>7</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-bullying movement began in response to the Columbine High School
                    shootings in April of 1999 (Stuart-Cassel, Bell, and Springer 1). By the end of
                    that year Georgia would pass the first anti-bullying legislation and, over the
                    next ten years, most states would follow. Between 1999 and 2010 state
                    legislatures passed over 120 bills addressing bullying (Stuart-Cassel, Bell, and
                    Springer x). In many cases, the legislation mandated that school districts
                    require all students to participate in educational programs intended to decrease
                    bullying. Anti-bullying became the watchword of education across the nation, all
                    in response to Columbine. But Columbine wasn&rsquo;t the first school
                    shooting&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t even the first school shooting of the 90s. There was
                    one in 1991 (Iowa), one in 1994 (Washington), two in 1996 (Washington and
                    California), four in 1997 (Alaska, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Arkansas), and
                    five in 1998 (Virginia, Oregon, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Arkansas) ("Timeline of School Shootings"). However, all of these
                    school shootings had low body counts and were over before the media arrived on
                    the scene (Cullen 14). In contrast, Columbine lasted for over five hours,
                    including what the police then believed was a standoff with the shooters<a href="#1">&nbsp;[1]</a><a name="1back">&nbsp;</a>and culminating in an extensive search of the school.<a href="#2">&nbsp;[2]</a><a name="2back">&nbsp;</a>It was more than enough time for the media to
                    congregate and for the story to quickly go viral. People watched the Columbine
                    tragedy unfold in real time and, as is frequently the case when information is
                    conveyed before it can be verified, much of what was reported was untrue. It was
                    these misconceptions that created and fed the anti-bullying movement that has
                    shaped so many students.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>8</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days and months after Columbine, the nation looked for answers. It was, at
                    the time, the deadliest school shooting in history.<a href="#3">&nbsp;[3]</a><a name="3back">&nbsp;</a> Many people, including school
                    administrators, parents, and legislators, found those answers in the media
                    descriptions of the shooters&mdash;Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Both Harris
                    and Klebold were seniors at Columbine High School. They were described as
                    loners, goths, and outcasts. There were reports that the shooters had been
                    bullied. The day after the shooting, <span xmlns="" class="titlej">The Washington Post</span>
                    published an article stating that students at Columbine described Harris and
                    Klebold as &ldquo;constant target[s] of derision for at least four years&rdquo; and said
                    they were &ldquo;constantly being ribbed by the school's athletes and other, more
                    popular cliques&rdquo; (Fisher, "Gunmen Recalled as Outcast").
                    There was some speculation that, in addition to being goths, the shooters were
                    bullied because they were gay&mdash;another report that turned out to be
                    unsubstantiated (Cullen 155). Multiple media outlets reported that the shooters
                    were members of a group of outcasts who called themselves the Trench Coat
                        Mafia.<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#4">&nbsp;[4]</a><a name="4back">&nbsp;</a> Of course, none of this was true. The two shooters were not part of the
                    Trench Coat Mafia. They weren&rsquo;t goths, both had friends, participated in school
                    activities, and Klebold even attended prom with a date the weekend before the
                    shooting. Most of the students interviewed, at least initially, didn&rsquo;t know Eric
                    Harris and Dylan Klebold at all and there&rsquo;s some indication that the students
                    were led in their descriptions by the questions posed to them by interviewers
                    (Cullen 74).</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>9</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, the picture the American public received was of two bullied, lonely
                    kids who snapped, lashed out and killed. Days after the shooting, Andrew
                    Mitchell, a high school student who lived near Columbine and participated in the
                    goth aesthetic, said, &ldquo;picture these kids, for years being thrown around,
                    treated horribly. After a while you can&rsquo;t stand it anymore. They were completely
                    wrong. But there are reasons for why they did it&rdquo; (Cullen 157). This belief
                    that Harris and Klebold were driven to violence by the cruelty of their peers
                    came to shape public policy and private opinion. Even now, 20 years after
                    Columbine, many people still believe that bullying is the driving force behind
                    violence in schools. We know that wasn&rsquo;t the case for Harris, who left behind a
                    journal, videos, and a website detailing his plans and motivations (Cullen
                    169&ndash;70). In his journal Harris discusses the things and people he hates (pages
                    and pages of them) and the things he loves (such as natural selection) (Cullen
                    183&ndash;84). He articulates his wish to kill multiple times. Only months after
                    Columbine, at an FBI-organized summit on school shooters, psychologists who had
                    been studying the case agreed that all indications pointed to Harris having been
                    a textbook psychopath (Cullen 247). Klebold left a journal as well, but although
                    it reveals his self-hatred and depression, it doesn&rsquo;t offer many clues about
                    what led him to murder his classmates. Most experts agree that he was led by
                    Harris and likely wouldn&rsquo;t have committed violence on his own (Cullen 188).</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>10</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the myth that Harris and Klebold resorted to violence as retaliation
                    against their peers because of bullying has been debunked for over a decade, we
                    still resort to that myth to explain violence in schools. Non-profits like
                    Rachel&rsquo;s Challenge,<a href="#5">&nbsp;[5]</a><a name="5back">&nbsp;</a>Operation 
                    Respect,<a href="#6">&nbsp;[6]</a><a name="6back">&nbsp;</a>and Sandy Hook Promise, and
                    campaigns like "Walk Up Not Out," teach students that
                    there&rsquo;s a direct connection between bullying and violence. "Walk
                        Up Not Out" was a countermovement to the walkout in response to the
                    Parkland shooting in 2018. It was inspired by several online posts including a
                    February 2018 Facebook post by David Blair in which he claimed that the solution
                    to school shootings was kindness (Seelinger, "What Does 'Walk
                        Up, Not Out' Mean?"). Blair writes: <div class="blockquote">Look around you at your classmates. Do
                        you see the kid over in the corner, alone? He could likely be our next
                        shooter. He needs a friend. He needs you. Go and talk to him, befriend him.
                        Chances are, he won&rsquo;t be easy to like, but it&rsquo;s mainly because no one has
                        tried to like him. Ask him about him. Get to know him. He&rsquo;s just like you in
                        that respect; he wants someone to recognize him as a fellow human being but
                        few people have ever given him the chance. You can.&nbsp;. . . Gun control or

                        greeting, your smile, your gentle human touch is the only thing that can
                        change the world of a desperate classmate who may be contemplating something
                        as horrendous as a school shooting.</div>The message is clear:
                    the kids are the problem, and not the ones killing people. School shooters are
                    the natural result of loneliness and bullying. Kids who exclude others, kids who
                    are mean, kids who don&rsquo;t spend every moment reaching out to their peers create
                    school shooters. While researchers, psychologists, and every well-informed adult
                    knows this isn&rsquo;t true, the kids subject to the anti-bullying programs don&rsquo;t know
                    it. And given that all states now have some kind of anti-bullying legislation,
                    we can expect that almost every student in our classrooms who has attended public
                    school (and some who attended private school) will have been influenced by the
                    myth of Columbine<a href="#7">&nbsp;[7]</a><a name="7back">&nbsp;</a>: be nice or else chances are good those you may have
                    ignored or mistreated will kill you.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>11</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was exactly this belief that murder was a natural human reaction to
                    rejection, isolation, and cruelty that influenced my students&rsquo; readings of
                        <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span>. For them the Creature&rsquo;s violence was
                    inevitable and understandable, even if they didn&rsquo;t think what he did was right.
                        <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span>, like the anti-bullying programs in
                    elementary and high school, seemed to them to be at best a warning and at worst
                    a justification. I had thought that perhaps my students struggled with <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> because they were unprepared to grapple with
                    the complex questions it poses about how we become who we are and what we owe to
                    each other. In actuality, they struggled because they&rsquo;d been trained to believe
                    they already knew the answers to those questions and could only see <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> as an affirmation of those answers.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>12</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help them really engage with the text and move past reading <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> as a didactic affirmation of their belief that murder
                    was an unfortunate but understandable reaction to rejection, I structured the
                    assignments so that they could challenge the anti-bullying rhetoric that shaped
                    their reading by putting it into direct conversation with <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span>. My hope was that in pairing <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> with texts like Elliot Rodger&rsquo;s manifesto and Eric
                    Harris&rsquo;s journal my students would find a way to think about not only <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> but also their own experiences as members of
                    the post-Columbine generation. With anxiety and depression on the rise in
                    college-aged students, I believe that it&rsquo;s essential for us to cultivate spaces
                    where our students can think critically about the world as it is now. I believe
                    in the power of literature to teach us to do that. If our students can learn to
                    think critically about the Creature&rsquo;s claims that his actions are entirely the
                    fault of those who treat him cruelly, they can use those same skills to think
                    critically about the ways we&rsquo;ve attached anti-bullying rhetoric to school
                    shooting prevention in order to shift the blame onto the victims. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>13</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Harris&rsquo;s and Rodger&rsquo;s writing, I also show them the 2016 Sandy
                    Hook Promise Public Service Announcement (PSA), sometimes called "Evan." In it we watch two students, Evan and an unnamed
                    young woman, flirt through graffiti they exchange on a library table. They
                    finally meet face-to-face at the end of the year, realizing each other&rsquo;s
                    identity through their handwriting. As they talk, we see another student in the
                    background throw open the gym door. He has a gun. As the students start to
                    notice him, we see them run and hear them scream. The screen fades to black and
                    the following message appears in white lettering, &ldquo;As you were watching Evan
                    another student was planning a school shooting. But no one noticed&rdquo; ("Evan" 00:01:43). The PSA moves through the same frames we
                    saw before, now highlighting the student in the background. We see the student
                    looking at, drawing, and gesticulating guns. We see him sitting alone at a table
                    and being bullied by a group of larger boys. At the end another message appears
                    in white on the black background, &ldquo;Gun violence is preventable when you know the
                    signs&rdquo; ("Evan" 00:02:18). It&rsquo;s unclear who is being held
                    accountable for not seeing these signs. The PSA is addressed to viewers, but in
                    many of the scenes only other students are present and so logically they&rsquo;re the
                    ones who could have seen these signs. In essence, the PSA holds those students
                    flirting, blithely self-absorbed in their teen romance, responsible for the
                    actions of their classmate.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>14</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my students watch this PSA in conversation with <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span>, it makes them angry. They see that they are being
                    told they must suspend their own feelings and desires on threat of violence and
                    possibly death. Like the Creature, the PSA seems to say that we must give those
                    who threaten us with violence what they want or suffer the consequences. I&rsquo;ve
                    now taught <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> in conversation with school
                    shootings and bullying rhetoric in three separate courses. Unfortunately,
                    because of the increase in mass shootings, the resources available multiplied
                    between each course. The sequence I describe below is a hybrid; it includes the
                    materials from the most recent course along with edits I&rsquo;ve made for the next
                    iteration of the sequence.</p>

                    <p class=" "><strong>15</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because creating dialogue between texts was essential to the aim of the
                        class, I embedded dialogue into the structure of the class. I&rsquo;ve done this
                        in a number of ways, depending on the resources available but the essential
                        feature is that students write regular responses to the assigned readings.
                        They read and reply to each other&rsquo;s responses, and all of these responses
                        remain visible to them throughout the course. Most recently I used the
                        discussion feature of our LMS, Canvas. Students were required to post their
                        own thoughts in response to the readings at least once per week and were
                        also required to comment on their peers&rsquo; posts. The discussion posts created
                        dialogue between students prior to class, and often our in-class discussions
                        picked up and pushed that dialogue further. </p>

                    <p class=" "><strong>16</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I begin the sequence fairly conventionally by assigning sections from
                        Wollstonecraft. I have students read chapters two and four of <span xmlns="" class="titlem">A Vindication of the Rights of Women</span> along with
                        chapter one of <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span>. The Wollstonecraft
                        reading positions students to discuss the language Victor uses when talking
                        about Elizabeth. With Wollstonecraft as a resource, they notice that
                        Elizabeth is presented as a &ldquo;gift&rdquo; to Victor and that Victor thinks of her
                        as a possession (Shelley 41). This groundwork is important because it
                        provides the conditions for an in-depth conversation about autonomy and
                        gender&mdash;one of the ideas the novel investigates. In their posts my
                        students discussed Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s argument that social expectations and
                        conventions shape identity by limiting freedom.</p>

                        provide my students with selections from Elliot Rodger&rsquo;s manifesto that
                        reflect similar isolation, anger, and desire for violence. I&rsquo;ve included
                        them below with corresponding sections from <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span>. My students make the connections between the
                        readings without prompting outside of my assigning them together. Below each

                            humanity, particularly women. It has made me realize just how brutal and
                            twisted humanity is as a species. All I ever wanted was to fit in and
                            live a happy life amongst humanity, but I was cast out and rejected,
                            forced to endure an existence of loneliness and insignificance, all
                            because the females of the human species were incapable of seeing the
                            value in me. This is the story of how I, Elliot Rodger, came to be. This
                            is the story of my entire life. It is a dark story of sadness, anger,
                            and hatred. It is a story of a war against cruel injustice. In this

                            every single significant experience that I have pulled from my superior
                            memory, as well as how those experiences have shaped my views of the
                            world. This tragedy did not have to happen. I didn&rsquo;t want things to turn
                            out this way, but humanity forced my hand, and this story will explain
                            why. My life didn&rsquo;t start out dark and twisted. I started out as a happy
                            and blissful child, living my life to the fullest in a world I thought
                            was good and pure. (Rodger 1)</p></blockquote>

                        <p class=" "><strong>18</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pair these sections to draw attention to two aspects of Shelley&rsquo;s text.
                            First, that the Creature&rsquo;s argument is transactional in a very specific
                            way. He expects that Victor will supply him with his desires, but he
                            also expects that the people he encounters in the world will supply him
                            with happiness and love. In the absence of the fulfillment of that
                            expectation, the Creature and Rodger threaten violence. The feelings of
                            others are, in a sense, held hostage. When my students read these
                            passages together, they think about the implications of the conditions
                            the Creature and Rodger place on the feelings of others. They ask what
                            it means to offer kindness, friendship, or love out of fear of violence.
                            In doing so, they start to question the anti-bullying rhetoric that asks
                            exactly that of children and teenagers.</p>
                        <p class=" "><strong>19</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My students also begin to question culpability. If Victor won&rsquo;t cede to
                            the demands of the Creature, is he responsible for the Creature&rsquo;s
                            actions? If the people he encounters don&rsquo;t love him, are they
                            responsible for the murders he commits? Set side-by-side with Rodger&rsquo;s
                            claim that others are responsible for his actions, they think more
                            critically about how the text is questioning what is owed to us and what
                            is not. </p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I was completely and utterly alone. No one knew me or extended a hand
                            to help me. I was an innocent, scared little boy trapped in a jungle
                            full of malicious predators, and I was shown no mercy. Some boys
                            randomly pushed me against the lockers as they walked past me in the
                            hall. One boy who was tall and had blonde hair called me a &ldquo;loser&rdquo;,
                            right in front of his girlfriends. Yes, he had girls with him. Pretty
                            girls. And they didn&rsquo;t seem to mind that he was such an evil bastard. In
                            fact, I bet they liked him for it. This is how girls are, and I was
                            starting to realize it. This was what truly opened my eyes to how brutal
                            the world is. The most meanest and depraved of men come out on top, and
                            women flock to these men. Their evil acts are rewarded by women; while
                            the good, decent men are laughed at. It is sick, twisted, and wrong in
                            every way. I hated the girls even more than the bullies because of this.
                            The sheer cruelty of the world around me was so intense that I will
                            never recover from the mental scars. Any experience I ever had before
                            never traumatized me as much as this. (Rodger 48)</p></blockquote>

                                even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.</p>
                            <p class=" ">I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the
                                trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I
                                allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of
                                Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures
                                sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic
                                countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream:
                                no Eve soothed my sorrows, nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I
                                remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator; but where was mine?
                                He had abandoned me; and, in the bitterness of my heart, I cursed
                                him. (Shelley 114)</p></blockquote>
                        <p class=" "><strong>20</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sections highlight how the possession of women factors into our
                            ideas about masculinity and male happiness. Rejection by a woman, or
                            women in general, is frequently cited as catalyst for violence by mass
                            shooters; Eric Harris kept a hit list of young women he felt had
                            rejected or spurned him, and Elliot Rodger claimed rejection was his
                            primary motivation. Similarly, the Creature tells Victor that the one
                            thing that will stop him from killing mankind is the creation of a woman
                            specifically for him. When my students read these sections together,
                            they want to talk about the responsibility being placed on women for
                            men&rsquo;s happiness and for the safety of others at the expense of their own
                            happiness and safety. They begin to see parallels between this aspect of
                                <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> and our own culture and
                            critique what they&rsquo;ve been trained to believe. </p>
                        <p class=" "><strong>21</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, this is a moment when my students bring Wollstonecraft back into
                            play. Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s argument that women have the same divine
                            potential and expectations as men helps them think critically about how
                                <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Frankenstein</span> comments on the roles of women
                            in society. In fact, my students this past semester pointed out that
                            Victor&rsquo;s fear that a female he created might not love the Creature is
                            the first and only time in the novel that he recognizes the autonomy of
                            a woman. </p>

                            destiny in life is to rise to power so I can impose my ideology on the
                            world and set everything right. I was only seventeen, I have plenty of
                            time. I thought to myself. I spent all of my time studying in my room,
                            reading books about history, politics, and sociology, trying to learn as
                            much as I can. I became a new person, furiously driven by a goal. My

                            direct odds to their claims of inferiority in other places. These
                            passages position my students to think of violence in the novel and in
                            our world as an expression of power, not of frustration, fear, or
                            helplessness, as the anti-bullying movement often claims. This is the
                            moment in the class when they most clearly critique the
                            shooter-as-victim narrative. I also give them Gillian Brockell&rsquo;s article
                                "Bullies and Black Trench Coats: The Columbine
                                Shooting&rsquo;s Most Dangerous Myths." The article clearly lays
                            out the misinformation that shaped the myth.</p>

                                had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place,
                                I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was
                                sleeping on some straw; she was young: not indeed so beautiful as
                                her whose portrait I held; but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming
                                in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of
                                those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And
                                then I bent over her, and whispered "Awake, fairest, thy lover is
                                near&mdash;he who would give his life but to obtain one look of
                                affection from thine eyes: my beloved, awake!"</p>
                            <p class=" ">The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she
                                indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?
                                Thus would she assuredly act, if her darkened eyes opened, and she
                                beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me
                                not I, but she shall suffer: the murder I have committed because I
                                am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.
                                The crime had its source in her: be hers the punishment! Thanks to
                                the lessons of Felix, and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned
                                now to work mischief. I bent over her, and placed the portrait
                                securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I
                                fled. (Shelley 123)</p></blockquote>

                            the issues of responsibility and autonomy. Students want to discuss who
                            is responsible for emotions, the person who experiences them or the one
                            who may elicit them. The aim is not for my students to condone bullying
                            or become callus to the suffering of others, but to help them question
                            any rhetoric&mdash;individual or institutional&mdash;that holds them
                            responsible for the feelings and actions of another person. </p>

                        standoff, the two shooters committed suicide inside the school just over
                        40 minutes after the beginning of the attack. The police didn&rsquo;t realize
                        that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were dead until they found their bodies
                        hours later. In fact, at least one of Klebold and Harris&rsquo;s victims bled to
                        death after the shooters committed suicide while the police were securing
                        the school (Cullen 83).  <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#1back">BACK</a></p><p xmlns="" class="note"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="2">[2] </a>In addition to shooting classmates, Klebold and
                        Harris planted bombs in and around the school. The bombs didn&rsquo;t inflict the
                        damage they had hoped&mdash;some of them didn&rsquo;t even explode&mdash;but they still had to be
                        carefully secured.  <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#2back">BACK</a></p><p xmlns="" class="note"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="3">[3] </a>The actual body count&mdash;thirteen, including twelve
                        students and one teacher&mdash;was significantly lower than the originally
                        reported twenty-five (Brockell).  <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#3back">BACK</a></p><p xmlns="" class="note"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="4">[4] </a> Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris weren&rsquo;t
                        part of the Trench Coat Mafia (TCM) but it did exist. The boys knew students
                        who were part of the TCM&mdash;so dubbed because the members of the group
                        all wore trench coats&mdash;but none of the members were involved in the
                        shooting. Prior to the shooting on April 20, most members of the TCM had
                        either graduated or stopped wearing trench coats to school. The confusion
                        seems to have arisen from Dylan and Eric using trench coats on the day of
                        the shootings at least in part to hide their weapons (Cullen 147&ndash;48).
