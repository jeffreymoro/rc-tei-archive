                <p class=" "><strong>1</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Wordsworth knew the association of sound, language, and affect was
                    poetically valuable and used it to his advantage in the creation of acoustic
                    ecologies. He showcases acoustic aesthetics in his poetry through the speech
                    acts of characters, dialogic interaction with audiences, and recitations,
                    creating acoustic ecologies of Romanticism while advancing future ones. Because
                    acoustic ecologies occupy a central presence in his narrative poems, I call for
                    consideration of the power of speech and sound in the teaching of Romantic
                    poetry and insist that students learn the task of close listening, becoming
                    readers&ndash;listeners&ndash;performers in their literary study.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I value speech acts and sound in poetry and suggest that students of Romanticism
                    be taught to listen closely to the acoustic ecology of Wordsworth as embedded in
                    theirs. In so doing, they will find that poetry exists as innumerable, layered
                    soundscapes in and beyond textual spaces. If students are taught to understand
                    poetry as synthetic and sounded, they will interact with poetry to comprehend
                    how poets move readers between and across patterns of organization and
                    perception to showcase many aspects of their works as sound art. Wordsworth&rsquo;s
                    poetics is at the core of my theory, but I propose the practice of my theory
                    more broadly as a pedagogical method. I encourage a consideration of the
                    possibilities of sound in Romantic poetry and what technologies past and present
                    might offer in terms of reciting, analyzing, translating, remixing, performing,
                    and preserving Romantic poetry in and for the future.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching students the value of speech acts and importance of recitation begins
                    with an introduction to the history of thinking about language that existed
                    before Romantics were composing and reciting, a history that widely contributed
                    to Romantic poetics. According to the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher Henry
                    Home, Lord Kames, &ldquo;speech is the most . . . powerful of all the means by which
                    one human being can display itself to another&rdquo; (1: 43). Teaching Romantic poetry
                    with a focus on the important influence of rational beings stirring emotions
                    through speech means engaging with theories and practices of audition and
                    recitation. In the seventeenth century, linguistic theories and practices in
                    England were concerned with connections of speech to thought. According to
                    Murray Cohen, language at this time could be studied as an object, and &ldquo;the
                    relationship between language and reality . . . [was] sought in the physical
                    parts of writing and speech&mdash;letters and sounds&rdquo; (7). Seventeenth-century
                    treatises on the physicality of speech reinforced the importance of sound in
                    making meaning. Owen Price&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Vocal Organ</span> was one of
                    many texts that &ldquo;provided a scheme visualizing the physiology of sounds . . .
                    [to] propose an articulatory phonetics based on an ordered, elemented, and
                    evident arrangement of the speech organs&rdquo; (Cohen 11). These speech organs are in
                    part how the body produces language sounds. Language exists through the
                    complexities of one&rsquo;s speech organs, and these organs make articulations audible
                    in distinct ways. While a conceivably obvious point, acknowledging the body&rsquo;s
                    critical role in linguistics illumines the relationship between live Romantic
                    articulations, the imagination, and transformation. Connecting acts of the
                    mouth&mdash;the body, past and present&mdash;to the intellectual quickness of
                    the mind and to broader assemblages of mouths-bodies-minds is necessary to move
                    Romantic poetry through and beyond individual, private notions toward
                    understanding that acknowledges not only isolated incidents of human
                    transformation in nature but conversion of the collective consciousness through
                    public sphere revolution, a sphere just as natural to humanity. Christopher
                    Cooper&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The English Teacher</span> is another text increasing
                    awareness to this possibility. A schoolmaster, Cooper sought to impose rules
                    through his &ldquo;detailed descriptions of physical sounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;alphabetized lists&rdquo;
                    concerning phonology and phonetics: &ldquo;he finds the possibilities of language in
                    the &lsquo;powers&rsquo; of characters&rdquo; (Cohen 13). Cooper&rsquo;s work, as with Price&rsquo;s, pulls
                    language away from its intangible status into a more tangible reality&mdash;one
                    more sounded, heard, felt, and participatory. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with most treatises during this time, these texts were concerned with
                    linguistic inquiry as a site for knowledge making. Including excerpts from these
                    treatises on a course syllabus could be quite useful, not only for
                    contextualizing the period prior to Romanticism which would help students
                    understand the era&rsquo;s engagement with linguistic inquiry, but also for vivifying
                    soundscapes of the Romantic imagination. These treatises can be used for
                    dislocating the silent practice of reading Romantic poetry and creating physical
                    articulations through recitation and mouth movements vocalizing the powers of
                    characters. Making students aware of the embodiment of language can help us
                    understand diversity historically. Not everyone will articulate the same, and
                    different sounds produce diverse aesthetic responses and shifts in meaning. We
                    could study patterns that appear across the student body, note variances and
                    illuminate problems, blind spots, and exclusive markers that led to further
                    linguistic thought that Romantic poets were working through, with, and
                    against.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such background, students will better understand that seventeenth-century
                    linguists&rsquo; interests in the materiality of language and its association with
                    thought led to eighteenth-century interests in the rhetorical and affective
                    possibilities associated with language and communication. During the eighteenth
                    century, oral emphasis became the dominant concern in linguistics, and conveying
                    understanding through recitation was key. John Rice&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">An
                        Introduction to the Art of Reading</span> represents the view that
                    recitation could &ldquo;evoke the relationship between thought and speech&rdquo; and
                    transfer sentiment from speaker to interlocutor (Cohen 105). According to Cohen,
                    the linguistic ability to transfer sentiment depended on the &ldquo;competence of the
                    speaker rather than on qualities embedded in the language,&rdquo; but it was accepted
                    that individuals could use their &ldquo;distinctive linguistic features&rdquo; to this end
                    (106). The &ldquo;arrangement of voice inflexions and pauses&rdquo; could &ldquo;express each
                    sentence with appropriate &lsquo;passion or emotion&rsquo;&rdquo; and shifted the study of
                    language as object to the study of the mind (Cohen 106&ndash;7). This lean toward
                    psychology signaled a change in how the affective function of language could
                    materialize&mdash;and articulatory phonetics emerged. Articulatory phonetics was
                    concerned with sounds, including &ldquo;discussions of basic sounds, emphasis, pause,
                    modulation, articulation, accent, pronunciation, quantity, and tone&rdquo; (Cohen
                    110). During this shift, lecturer Benjamin Martin, important for his role in
                    advancing knowledge about the ear and auditory processing, published <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Institutions of Language</span>, which contains his "Physico&ndash;Grammatical Essay on the Propriety and Rationale of the
                        English Tongue" and includes a section wherein he &ldquo;discusses each
                    letter in terms of the physiology of its pronunciation&rdquo; (Cohen 112). Texts, such
                    as Martin&rsquo;s, are evidence of theories of language that perceived speech as
                    social and affective. Additional publications proliferated and emphasized
                    pleasure&rsquo;s role in communication, as elocutionist Thomas Sheridan&rsquo;s 
                        oeuvre reveals (Cohen 112&ndash;14). The importance of linguistic sounds in
                    the eighteenth century led some to instruct speech pronunciation by graphically
                    specifying sounds using a system of notation modeled on musical notation which
                    could, in addition to marking speech emphasis, confront &ldquo;defects by comparing
                    the voice to a musical instrument&rdquo; (Cohen 116). This system was also used to
                    record printed information. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>6</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the auditory imagination functions differently for each reader, teaching
                    historical attention to articulatory phonetics would allow for more concrete yet
                    diverse engagement with the sounds of printed texts. Students could produce
                    their creative renderings, or auditory translations, of texts and recorded pieces
                    using notation systems created in the past. Noelle Chao discusses the sonic
                    qualities of printed words in her work, which focuses on the British plantation
                    owner Joshua Steele who, in his 1775 <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Essay Towards
                        Establishing the Melody and Measure of Speech</span>, outlined &ldquo;a complex
                    system for recording the voice in print, involving, among other things, a
                    modified musical staff with extra divisions of pitch and rhythm, and a range of
                    additional markings to indicate emphasis and force&rdquo; (245). Chao&rsquo;s work addresses
                    a gap in research on recording technology and claims that while the historical
                    narrative depends on the nineteenth century and its technological advancements
                    as the point of origin for recording, in fact, the &ldquo;eighteenth-century writings
                    on music and elocution developed their . . . logic of recording through the
                    medium of print&rdquo; (258). Students could devise systems like Steele&rsquo;s, whose
                    methods, deemed implausible by some critics, were embraced by a select few who
                    supported &ldquo;conveying sound through the medium of print&rdquo; using &ldquo;written markings
                    that could reliably and accurately communicate specific sounds&rdquo; (Chao 247). Chao
                    argues that &ldquo;for scholars today, . . . [Steele&rsquo;s] technology for recording has
                    the potential to amplify eighteenth-century practices of reading and listening,
                    practices made nearly impossible to hear or imagine by modern advances in sound
                    preservation&rdquo; (247). Therefore, we should be encouraging students to design
                    similar methods of capturing poetic sounds, speech sounds, and soundscapes
                    embedded in Romantic poetry. In this way, students participate in what Julia S.
                    Carlson calls &ldquo;the voicing of print&rdquo; to &ldquo;discover their measure&rdquo; (2). This
                    &ldquo;democratic access to . . . measures,&rdquo; which John Thelwall supported for blank
                    verse at the time of <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Excursion</span>, according to
                    Carlson, would teach students to initiate or participate in sound preservation
                    (3). With today&rsquo;s technological apparatuses, students could reinvent the process
                    to create imaginative multimodal recordings and translations of Romantic texts,
                    take elocution into consideration, and synthesize past recording technologies
                    with those of the present.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>7</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romantic poetry should be examined through the lens of elocutionary theory as it
                    relates to the sound of speech acts and their effects. This lens offers
                    innovative approaches to understanding Romanticism and results in students not
                    only understanding the language of texts but also the rhetorical acts of
                    original recitations and future possible performance translations. Judith
                    Thompson insists that while &ldquo;much remains to be done to recover and re-evaluate
                    elocutionary history and theory in relation to Romanticism,&rdquo; attention has begun
                    to shift toward &ldquo;actual circumstances and active effects of particular speech
                    acts, utterances, genres, and performances&rdquo; (23). Instead of approaching
                    Romantic poetry only by linking the linguistic to the thematic, I suggest that
                    we teach students of Romantic poetry to examine the linguistic using Romantic
                    theories of hearing and philosophies of sound. Roman Jakobson in &ldquo;Linguistics
                    and Poetics&rdquo; &ldquo;distinguished the context (circumstances described in the message)
                    from the code (the language system that lets the message be put into words),&rdquo;
                    and Andrew Elfenbein writes that &ldquo;most literary scholarship on language absorbs
                    code into context, rather than recognizing its potential autonomy&rdquo; (4).
                    Examining code on its merits forces close engagement with the language system
                    (i.e., speech sounds), influences the context, and vivifies poetic soundscapes. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>8</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To consider Romantic poetry on these terms, I envision a reader who advances what
                    Elfenbein calls the &ldquo;impression of style&rdquo; (41). Consideration must be given to
                    the kind of reader Wordsworth visualized as he apprised his &ldquo;Reader&rdquo; of his
                    style and intent to &ldquo;look steadily&rdquo; at his &ldquo;subject&rdquo; in the preface to <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Lyrical Ballads</span> (600). Wordsworth unlikely chose &ldquo;subject&rdquo;
                    for only its connotations of topic. Rather, he was thinking about the whole of
                    his work in relation to its parts by considering the &ldquo;subject&rdquo; position of his
                    &ldquo;Reader.&rdquo; His preface and other paratext serve a similar function to produce
                    readers who know their parts but who also submit to poetic authority. Subject in
                    every sense is recognized, and Wordsworth anticipates readers who accommodate
                    him and realize the score in conjunction with their contributions. As Noelle Chao informs us, Steele writes
                    of such a reader in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Essay</span> and <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Prosodia
                        Rationalis</span>: <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote">The reader of such printed symbols is understood
                        to be not only a reader who processes printed text in a silent, sonic

                        communicated in print within . . . [the] mind&rsquo;s eye. This reader&ndash;listener is
                        often cast as a reader&ndash;listener&ndash;performer, whom the writer anticipates will

                    term reader&ndash;listener&ndash;performer for students of Romanticism makes sense.
                    Wordsworth was himself a reader&ndash;listener&ndash;performer, well known to have composed
                    lines of verse orally while walking in nature where public and/or private
                    audiences were attending and listening, leaving behind a methodology for his
                    words to be conveyed by his readers&ndash;listeners&ndash;performers through an
                    understanding of audition and the affective force of sound. Of course, I do not
                    suggest that we teach students to become Wordsworth in their
                    auditory/performance translations, but I do suggest the importance of
                    understanding Romantic poetry in terms of accepting the importance of readers&rsquo;
                    subject positions as they express the whole of poems in auditory/performance
                    translations.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>9</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, readers should balance self-perception of their sonic environments,
                    both created and actual, as well as the acoustic ecologies created in the lines
                    of Romantic poems. With this layered sense of perception, sonic environments of
                    the poets&rsquo; created audible worlds become less textual, more active soundscapes.
                    Stressing imaginative interaction, Noel Jackson writes about Wordsworth and his
                    &ldquo;claim for the sensuous vitality of imaginative narration,&rdquo; noting that Lord
                    Kames&rsquo;s term &ldquo;ideal presence&rdquo; delineated &ldquo;the active status of imaginative
                    things in the mind&rdquo; (85). Wordsworth and Kames share the belief in the mind&rsquo;s
                    ability to activate sensation. Jackson explains that &ldquo;ideal presence at once
                    simulates and substitutes for physical sense-perception; this literary effect
                    reproduces the potent effects of sensation without sharing in the limitations
                    that bind it to one body, thereby preventing its communication to others&rdquo;
                    (85&ndash;86). Created acoustic ecologies, considered through Kames&rsquo;s ideal presence,
                    would function as sonic environments wherein one could have &ldquo;an embodied
                    experience wholly independent of external stimuli&rdquo; (Jackson 86). This account
                    theorizes &ldquo;the signature effect of powerful imaginative representation&rdquo; and
                    &ldquo;render[s] . . . the sensuous presence of the past&rdquo; (Jackson 86). Adding the
                    representation and rendering of the past with the present renderings complicates
                    the sonic landscape, or soundscape, of the poetry, but accepting Kames&rsquo;s ideal
                    presence along with students&rsquo; auditory translations of the texts opens up the
                    poetry to fresh conceptions of poetic sound. This exploration allows for an
                    understanding of acoustic ecologies that reinforces embodiment and direct
                    perception and permits the unbinding of poetry from not only one body but also
                    one imaginative representation. It lets students participate more creatively in
                    poetry and thus participate more fully in the expressive utterance of the poem,
                    by embodying speech, thought, and feeling together through words on their
                    tongues. This participation allows them to experience Romantic poetry as an
                    embodied force always agitating others through utterance. The method teaches
                    that acoustic codes are not stable but subjective, and that such a reality
                    should not negatively affect analytical import. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>10</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These systems reproduced in a classroom allow for critical engagement with
                    student recordings. We could make comparisons, notice like patterns in marking,
                    and begin quite possibly to hear Wordsworth&rsquo;s voice through graphical
                    specifications. Studying linguistic structures by focusing on the sounds of
                    language and affect reveals compelling information about articulation, accent,
                    vocal variations, euphony, stress, cadence, pauses, respiration, punctuation,
                    attention, stimulation, artificiality, force, and more. Romantic poetry emerged
                    in this linguistic environment, so acknowledging these systems in classroom
                    settings better equips students for understanding this environment. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>11</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linguistic structures shift now as they did then as rhetorical situations vary.
                    Sounds of language and affect for exigencies differ, so Romantic articulations
                    should be understood through the complexity of performance or recitation
                    contexts. An introduction to both seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
                    linguistics and articulatory phonetics reinforces the importance of the
                    sonification of language that alphabetic text might obscure for readers; it
                    reifies the attention to social linguistic structures so important in Romantic
                    recitation and readers&ndash;listeners&ndash;performers&rsquo; auditory imaginations. The social
                    origins, intellectual culture, and outcomes of the French Revolution and its
                    ideological birthing shaped Wordsworth&rsquo;s imagination and concern for his
                    community and thus shaped Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetics and its emphasis on words and
                    passion. Words in the mouths of revolutionaries elicited substantial
                    consequences, and &ldquo;unmasking&rdquo; such penetrating use of political language for
                    Wordsworth likely reinforced his poetic use of words and the force of their
                    passion to affect his audience (Hunt 20&ndash;21). Revolutionary speakers were
                    passionate, affective, and &ldquo;concerned with authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;audience,&rdquo; and
                    Wordsworth recognized that language shaped perception with positive and negative
                    implications (Hunt 25). Language shaped political interests and ideologies and
                    was &ldquo;a way of reconstituting the social and political world,&rdquo; in both France and
                    England (Hunt 24&ndash;25). Wordsworth knew language served as an &ldquo;expression of
                    power, and power . . . [was] expressed by the right to speak for the people&rdquo;
                    (Hunt 23). His concern for man&rsquo;s nature fueled his sense of preservation and
                    need to speak on behalf of others, to use language to foster political and
                    social change, preserving his experiences and revolutionary sense of language
                    through poetry that could indeed bring authority or sense of liberty to those
                    lacking privilege and agency. Wordsworth experienced that in times of revolution
                    some voices were heard above others, and those silenced by an oppressive
                    majority needed others to help them be heard. Wordsworth poeticizes selfhood
                    that serves broader humanity, whose liberty could be found in conversing with
                    their souls, which his poetics teach and taught even while his explicit
                    political actions waned. At times hiding explicit political intent in verse,
                    Wordsworth spoke for those who could not, for reasons social, political, or
                    otherwise, and emboldened others who listened to participate in society as was
                    possible in spaces where the overlooked were silenced. Taking this voicing into
                    consideration, we can and should problematize and complicate notions of
                    Wordsworthian &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; and critique imperialist political and educational aims
                    and realities aurality brings to mind. Attention to aurality always makes
                    audible historically unheard voices that have been enslaved by the English
                    tongue&mdash;voices of those silenced, colonized, appropriated, forced into
                    assimilation, and ignored. There are always consequences. In other words, we can
                    critique why Wordsworth felt compelled to speak for others and discuss the
                    implications and ethics of that. Fortified with seventeenth- and
                    eighteenth-century linguistic theory, Wordsworth aligned his thinking about
                    language with the values inherent in political language esteemed during the
                    French Revolution: values of passion, authority, audience, perception, and
                    persuasion that served social and political purposes, expressed power and
                    agency, and ensured Wordsworthian liberty. Teaching values inherent in political
                    language is crucial, and students can understand such thinking through our
                    historical moment, especially in terms of modern audible movements serving
                    social and political justice purposes. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>12</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foregrounding sound as the vessel for the &ldquo;Visionary Power&rdquo; (<span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Prelude</span> 619) of which Wordsworth wrote challenges the thread
                    of research in Romantic studies that fails to articulate such sonic emphasis to
                    instead maintain that sight was more important to the Wordsworthian imagination.
                    I dislocate Wordsworthian &ldquo;Visionary Power&rdquo; that &ldquo;Attends upon the motions of
                    the winds / Embodied in the mystery of words&rdquo; (<span xmlns="" class="titlem">The
                        Prelude</span> 619&ndash;21) from assumptions of sight. Sound studies demand
                    close listening and conceptualizing aurality through unorthodox means, and a
                    study of sound implies physicality and psychophysicality beyond sensation and
                    new critical regulation. In my classrooms, I seek to supplement traditional
                    close reading with scientifically and historically informed close listening,
                    which makes engaging with not only the physical but also the psychophysical
                    sonic properties of poetry worthwhile. I teach Wordsworth in this way to show
                    through acoustics and psychoacoustics frameworks that he reimagined refined
                    sensibility and anticipated inclusive interpretive communities for poetry; he
                    is, in part, a vessel for a wider social, cultural, discursive logic of the
                    poetics of the Romantic period. If we teach others a similar understanding of
                    Wordsworth, we propel his poetics forward into aural and semantic spaces
                    informed by diverse historical moments, political perspectives, scientific
                    engagements, technological advancements, and physical and psychophysical
                    acoustic ecologies. These spaces inform our thinking; we cannot approach poetics
                    sans current consciousness. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>13</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dialogic quality of Wordsworth&rsquo;s writing and focus on the interactivity
                    between self, sound, and motion&mdash;what I term
                    <em xmlns="">psychosonicmotion</em>, presents opportunities for students to reimagine
                    Wordsworth&rsquo;s craft, his thinking, and the pleasure he derived, gave, and gives
                    with his work. Consumed by his sense of true personal liberty, Wordsworth chose
                    close listening to self in motion in the interest of preserving ideas in writing
                    for future recollection and pleasure. Wordsworth does not abandon his civic
                    project and exile himself from the world; his work draws in others and others&rsquo;
                    voices in the service of broader humanity, engaging civically continually.
                    Concerned with not only articulating others&rsquo; voices to be heard by others but
                    also hearing his voice speak itself out, Wordsworth arguably privileged close
                    listening and thus positioned sound at the forefront of his poetics as <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote">

                <p class=" "><strong>14</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetics connect not only early linguistic thought to later political
                    language but also the debates regarding thought, language, experience, ideas,
                    and things that existed before and as his poetics took shape. Wordsworth&rsquo;s
                    position can be traced from John Locke&rsquo;s first articulation in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> (see "Of
                        Words") to Leibniz to Berkeley to James Burnet, Lord Monboddo to
                    Locke&rsquo;s French follower &Eacute;tienne Bonnot de Condillac to John Horne Tooke to
                    Destutt de Tracy to the <em xmlns="">id&eacute;ologues</em>, and my argument for sound as
                    fundamental in Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetics follows from a synthesis of such conceptions
                    (Keach 95&ndash;110). William Keach surveys this theoretical terrain, which can be
                    valuable information to include in a course tracing points of thought to
                    Wordsworth&rsquo;s ideas about language and thought. Keach asserts that Wordsworth&rsquo;s
                    use of words &ldquo;gives us a profound sense of the pressure and action of the
                    material world and of the physical significance of writing itself&rdquo; (109). His
                    tracing of Romantic verbal representation suggests Wordsworth&rsquo;s intention to
                    produce poetry with sound poetics in mind and must be present in a study of
                    Romantic poetry. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>15</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my ear, the beauty of Wordsworth is that he was able to capture his immersed
                    nature&mdash;personally, socially, politically, and naturally. That quality
                    inherent in his writing still remains. We hear even today the sounds of
                    Wordsworth&rsquo;s verse blending with the voices of the poets before and after him,
                    with the waters and birds around him, with the soundscape we presently occupy.
                    We hear it if we practice close listening. He captured his sonic moment through
                    poeticizing its auditory scenes, documenting an acoustic ecology by layering
                    sonic environments of which he was a part&mdash;physically, psychophysically,
                    and imaginatively. By relocating these auditory scenes into verse, he preserved
                    auditory perception in reality and ideality and for futurity, reifying his
                    immersive tendencies to attend to sound through his Romantic ear and prompting
                    our attention to do the same by reading his work&mdash;and reading it aloud.
                    Through Wordsworth, by dislocating ourselves from our sonic environments to join
                    his auditory scenes, we become aware of unique sonic environments that
                    inform&mdash;even enhance and disrupt&mdash;the acoustic ecology of listening to
                    Wordsworth. Through his verbal representation, Wordsworth mediates aurality by
                    pulling his auditory scenes into our sonic worlds to intervene in our present
                    and future systems of aurality. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>16</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diverse approaches let us reconsider, reimagine, and diversify social contexts,
                    past and present, in which Romantic-era poetry is highly valued and appreciated.
                    We learn to understand the value of these aesthetic encounters and how they can
                    be not only preserved but also renewed in our contexts through attention to how
                    past technologies reshape or become reshaped through present technological
                    capabilities. Adam J. Banks writes about the &ldquo;repositioning&rdquo; that composition
                    theory and teaching are undergoing &ldquo;that values cultural diversity and
                    interrogates more deeply the social contexts in which writing occurs,&rdquo; noting
                    that in the field of composition, &ldquo;more importance [has been placed] on
                    multiliteracies and multimedia writing&rdquo; (10). What might the possibilities be
                    if, in teaching literature, we placed such importance on multiliteracies and
                    multimedia writing and how, together, the two could preserve Romantic recitation
                    using digital platforms that allowed for the immersive engagement with sound
                    and/or performance and linguistic variation through the marking systems of the
                    past? These are innovative considerations for literary studies. While Banks
                    clarifies that &ldquo;digital writing and our immersion in multiple media forms and
                    spaces demands a return to performance as an important area in writing
                    instruction,&rdquo; reimagining Romantic poetry through diverse performances is also
                    an important area in literature instruction, and this area can be enhanced
                    through explicit attention to the possibilities of digital humanities and our
                    immersion in multiple media forms (11). We can and should interrogate and
                    diversify Romantic recitation and its sonic possibilities by recreating social
                    contexts where reading&ndash;listening&ndash;performing occurred in the Romantic period,
                    reimagining those moments in new physical locations and electronic
                    spaces&mdash;with assorted voices. These contexts are not only textual but also
                    actual and electronic, not only recitative but also performative.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>17</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering multimedia possibilities for Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry is one way we might
                    reimagine the social contexts of present recitation in juxtaposition to
                    Romantic-era recitation. For instance, an audio version of the text might change
                    or enhance the reading of sound figures, and Wordsworth&rsquo;s work, and all poetry
                    in general, could be examined in this way. Sound figures have acoustic or
                    psychoacoustic resonances, and the textual representations of linguistic
                    utterances are sound figures. Multimedia possibilities for representing sound
                    figures abound through remix, pastiche, sampling, and hybridity. Both language
                    and music have metaphorical capability, and I hear sound figures as the fusion
                    of linguistic and nonlinguistic sonic resonances in the service of metaphor.
                    Hearing and listening to these utterances ignites thought if audiences listen
                    closely. Adrian Curtin writes about examining audio recordings of readings
                    through the concept of close listening (270). He quotes from Charles Bernstein
                    to suggest that &ldquo;&lsquo;close listening . . . may contradict &lsquo;readings&rsquo; of poems . . .
                    based exclusively on the printed text . . . that ignore the poet&rsquo;s own
                    performances, the &lsquo;total&rsquo; sound of the work, and the relation of sound to
                    semantics&rsquo;&rdquo; (qtd. in Curtin 270). Curtin writes that audiotexts emphasize and
                    reinforce the acoustics of the written text (271). Audiotexts provide &ldquo;a dense
                    semantic field of linguistic activity and sound shapes that re-stages the
                    printed poem&rsquo;s ostensible meanings&rdquo; (271). As we listen to a poem&rsquo;s
                    dynamic sound registers and begin to notice its layered sonic environments, we
                    can access how technological re-conception of a work might, through newly
                    imagined multimedia forms, bring about audio representations of multiple
                    consciousnesses, which might offer semantic and post-semantic enrichment worth
                    curating. Electronic aural stimuli authorizes the marking of poetry as
                    technologically advanced and quite post-postmodern, insofar as it simultaneously
                    represents communicative voices through messages it transmits through polyphonic
                    figures.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>18</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry already exists as hybrid and &ldquo;multi discursive,&rdquo; but through
                    innovative platforms we have access to today, it could become even more so. The 
                    &ldquo;hybrid genre embraces works of art which transgress genre
                    boundaries by combining characteristic traits and elements of diverse literary
                    and non-literary genres&rdquo; (Karako&ccedil; 70&ndash;71). Wordsworth reveals such possibilities
                    through diverse narrative and sonic elements through language and forms; he
                    draws attention to physical and psychophysical sounds through his poetic
                    utterances, which themselves house others&rsquo; utterances. Bakhtin defines the
                    hybrid genre as &ldquo;&lsquo;the mixture, within a single concrete utterance, of two or
                    more different linguistic consciousness[es], often widely separated in time and
                    social space&rsquo;&rdquo; (qtd. in Karako&ccedil; 71). Nonlinguistic acoustic data cutting into
                    language in the text performs this hybridity because it reveals Wordsworth&rsquo;s
                    consciousness as a poet producing the consciousness of the text that the
                    reader&ndash;listener&ndash;performer experiences through the works and perpetually renews
                    through future recitations and/or auditory translations that may or may not be
                    electronic.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>19</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poems and the reader&ndash;listener&ndash;performer become an assemblage of past and present,
                    lyrical and narrative, literary and real, and thus Wordsworth and individual. If
                    &ldquo;collective life is constituted by a multiplicity of circulating entities that
                    are mutually influencing each other and bending space as a consequence of their
                    divergent activities,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;power of rhetorical actancy as a concept&rdquo;
                    suggests, according to Laurie E. Gries, then Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry is a part of
                    that collective, and his readers&ndash;listeners&ndash;performers are too (75). Both the
                    poem, as technology, and the reader&ndash;listener&ndash;performer have agency and act in
                    the world. In this sense, Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry exists as &ldquo;distributed cognition .
                    . . dispersed across various, heterogeneous components of an assemblage or
                    assemblages as well as space and time&rdquo; in a collective that includes nonhumans
                    and humanity in their entirety&mdash;past, present, and future (Gries 68).
                    Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry exists in hybridity in conjunction with its
                    readership&mdash;at any time, and the work maintains a certain kind of living
                    power in readers&rsquo; hands or on readers&ndash;listeners&ndash;performers&rsquo; tongues (Gries
                    73).</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>20</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage students to envision the sonic environments of poems not as
                    fixed interpretive territories but as interactive acoustic ecologies, allowing
                    them to experience personal circumambient versions of the &ldquo;&lsquo;world around&rsquo;&rdquo; or
                        <span xmlns="" class="foreign">Umwelt</span> (Chion and Steintrager 11). Chion and
                    Steintrager maintain that one could argue that &ldquo;there was a sound and a
                    person&rdquo;&mdash;a system of synthesized surround sound&mdash;sound and subject as
                    entity (11). This Romantic understanding of the sonic environment positions the
                    subject to feel &ldquo;at the center of sound&rdquo; and builds up sound &ldquo;as a revelatory
                    fantasy&rdquo; that can &ldquo;emphasize by a sort of mirroring effect, as it were, the
                    individuality of the one listening to them&rdquo; (Chion and Steintrager 11). Keeping
                    this egocentric nature of audition in mind, students can understand that a
                    poem&rsquo;s sonic environment, soundscape, or acoustic ecology inspires options for
                    discovering meaning. The auditory environment is not static but always
                    fluctuating, perceptually founded. According to Albert Bregman, &ldquo;auditory scene
                    analysis&rdquo; functions as a model for auditory perception, and using it, we can
                    listen closely to continuous streams of sound in a sonic environment and analyze
                    the sound mixture by segmenting the streams. It is difficult for a &ldquo;listener to
                    hear the entire sequence as a single stream of sound,&rdquo; and differences in
                    effects of the auditory stream vary (Bregman 643). While some active perceivers
                    explore the sonic environment through an ecological model with attention to
                    physical sound, others have powers, as William Noble writes, &ldquo;to move around, to
                    handle things, to bring objects into full view, to sweep the horizon, to get
                    close to a faint sound&rdquo; in other ways; instead of physically hearing the
                    acoustic world, they perceptively attend to it (330). Noble suggests that
                    hearing &ldquo;is not necessarily an <em xmlns="">action</em> that a person takes, but is 
                    rather more like the imposition of an audible object on one&rsquo;s attention&rdquo; (332).
                    Such attention can be the result of perceiver choice or due to differences in
                    hearing ability, but the analysis of the features of the audible world heard and
                    attended to are meaningful and complex all the same.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>21</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poetry, for Wordsworth, creates defining realities and distinctive natures and
                    allows for an apprehension and perception of various natures. I suggest that we
                    situate nature according to Peter H. Khost&rsquo;s definition of the literary
                    affordance and maintain an understanding of nature as an object in relation to
                    its usefulness in the textual environment by all involved actors, which include
                    not only poet and auditors but also intertextual and intratextual voices.
                    According to Khost, a forerunner of ecological psychology James J. Gibson
                    introduced the concept of affordance: &ldquo;Affordances are uses individuals
                        make of objects, events, concepts, or environments through relation to their
                        discoverable features. . . its basic principle being that experiential,
                        environment-bound relations are central to psychological experience . . .
                        [Affordances involve] situational emphasis&rdquo; (19&ndash;20). Situational
                    emphasis is important to understanding Romantic recitation and
                    should be explored practically and theoretically. Immersive environments are
                    critical to poetry once readers note perceptual offerings environments hold.
                    Khost maintains that &ldquo;a reader&rsquo;s needs (and abilities, interests, situation, and
                    so forth) contribute to . . . [their] making of literary affordances&rdquo; (21).
                    Readers, therefore, give to and take what they need from the sonic environment
                    they find themselves a part of, both in and beyond the text, in order to
                    experience the work more fully. Khost writes that &ldquo;affordances are not only
                    phenomenal (i.e., experiential), but they are also at the same time substantial
                    (i.e., physical),&rdquo; and experiential and physical readings offer more
                    interpretive possibilities for the poetry as the literary affordances become
                    more varied based on the variants of nature made possible by due consideration
                    of, attention to, creation of&mdash;and re-creation of&mdash;multiple sonic
                    environments by diverse readers&ndash;listeners&ndash;performers (21). That &ldquo;an affordance
                    is not a property of an environment [literary text] or of a person [reader] but
                    rather a person&rsquo;s [reader&rsquo;s] ability to make uses of objects or environments
                    [literary texts] by placing (i.e., identifying) and activating useful features
                    in them&rdquo; should be something we are teaching students of Romanticism because it
                    allows for reconsiderations of engagement that would be much like the engagement
                    of the poets during their time (Khost 24). It materializes the period to show
                    that these poems were indeed penned by living, breathing bodies who were
                    absorbing their actualities to push beyond them. Experiencing poetry in this way
                    makes it not only perceptual and experiential (i.e., direct) but also both
                    conceptual and referential (i.e., indirect) (Khost 27). The ecosystem of the
                    poem, then, while a complex construction and representation of the poet&rsquo;s
                    transcendence from material circumstances, becomes rooted in a reader&rsquo;s material
                    circumstances to substantialize the very materiality the poet captured through
                    the poetic form to begin with. The work then always exists in synthesis beyond
                    the individual poem in its material collectivity, past, present, and future.</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>22</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wordsworth&rsquo;s recitations prompt conjecture regarding the sonification of poetry
                    in our context and how we close listen today as audiences of Romantic poetry as
                    sound art, ourselves reciting, hearing, and listening from positions of present
                    soundscapes and circumstances. It situates perpetual recitation and the need for
                    performance/auditory translations from audiences contextually defined by
                    idiosyncratic and distinct natures. Poetry creates sonic possibilities both
                    referential and nonreferential, and through the experiencing of the poem or the
                    experience the poem concretizes and figurativizes&mdash;through its creation,
                    recitation, participation, and perpetuation&mdash;these sonic possibilities
                    supply variable resources for knowing, which we should examine. Steven Feld
                    examines what he calls &ldquo;acoustemology,&rdquo; which &ldquo;conjoins &lsquo;acoustics&rsquo; and
                    &lsquo;epistemology&rsquo; to theorize sound as a way of knowing&rdquo;; this theorizing &ldquo;inquires
                    into what is knowable, and how it becomes known, through sounding and listening&rdquo;
                    and &ldquo;asks how the physicality of sound is so instantly and forcefully present to
                    experience and experiencers, to interpreters and interpretations&rdquo; in order to
                    understand &ldquo;sonic sensation&rdquo; as &ldquo;experiential&rdquo; (qtd. in Novak and Sakakeeny 12).
                    Feld informs our understanding of poetic sound and what we can know from poetic
                    sonification. Realizing sound possibilities by analyzing poetry as audio
                    reshapes our theoretical understanding of poets and poetics and reinforces
                    poetry as a modern somesthetic&ndash;affective object. If we conceptualize literary
                    sound in this way, we provide students with unlimited possibilities for
                    encountering poetic acoustic ecologies as three-dimensional and interactive. </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>23</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diverse study of sound presents uncountable opportunities for students.
                    Technologies of the past and the present offer ample methods for experimenting
                    with Romantic texts and auditory translations in terms of reciting, analyzing,
                    translating, remixing, performing, and preserving Romantic poetry in and for the
                    future. Sound studies using not only the linguistic treatises and recording
                    methodologies of the past but also present-day digital tools provide us with the
                    means to further experience and preserve literature. We should present students
                    with the opportunity not only to experience these memorable works using their
                    tongues and in new mediums but also to analyze them as originals and translations,
                    synthesizing the imaginative renderings of the Romantic period with our present
                    imaginative possibilities and technological capabilities. Students, as
                    readers&ndash;listeners&ndash;performers, will experiment with the affective force of sound
                    as we perceive its function, modernizing expressions of language&rsquo;s materiality and
                    its association with thought while curating diverse renderings, compositions, and
                    analyses under the direction of poets. </p>
