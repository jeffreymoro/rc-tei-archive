               <h2><span class="head">Preface</span></h2>
               <p>After hearing a recent conference presentation in which I discussed my interest in
                  the connections between Jane Austen and questions of what we might now call reproductive
                  justice, a senior scholar in the field shared with me an interesting piece of gossip:
                  that there exists, or once existed, a family that claims to be descended from the
                  illegitimate child of Jane Austen’s sister and best friend, Cassandra. As the story
                  goes, Cassandra Austen conceived this child with her fiancé, who died. Of course,
                  the scholar impressed upon me, there would be no way to prove or disprove the efficacy
                  of this claim. But so what? In recent years, I have become interested in the critical
                  and pedagogical potentials of speculation, indeed, in speculation as a form of feminist
                  praxis. In my book <em>Harvester of Hearts: Motherhood under the Sign of <em>Frankenstein</em></em>, I consider some of the things that an adherence to argument as the gold standard
                  of literary criticism keeps us from saying—about the connections between life and
                  work, for example, or the entanglements of intellectual and bodily history, or things
                  that might have happened, but we cannot know for sure. In the classroom, I offer my
                  students low-stakes, hybrid, creative, and other non-thesis-driven writing assignments
                  that encourage them to move beyond what they can prove to uncover truly experimental
                  interpretations. I do this because I am interested in what Romantic era literature
                  can help students understand about their own lives and worlds, and because these kinds
                  of trans-historical applications often derive from provocations and possibilities,
                  not only from thesis-driven, close reading–supported analyses (of course, we learn
                  to craft those, too).</p>
               <p>During a question and answer session at the 2018 meeting of the North American Society
                  for the Study of Romanticism, Deidre Lynch claimed that “Austen is way more gothic
                  than we have been told,” to which Sonia Hofkosh replied, “It’s fantasy fiction!” In
                  the popular imagination, Austen’s novels are not just fantasy fiction in the sense
                  of the augmented, perhaps idealized, reality they describe, but also in the extent
                  to which Austen’s texts inspire personal and communal fantasies. If speculative, fan-fictional
                  reading is a common mode of engagement with the novels, then what is its place in
                  the literary studies classroom? Put another way, what might the modes and methods
                  of literary criticism keep us from saying about Jane Austen’s novels, and what might
                  we gain by saying those things—both in class, and in print?</p>
               <p>What follows is a collaborative, speculative close reading of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> that interprets Marianne’s illness as an illegitimate pregnancy that terminates in
                  either a premeditated abortion (sense) or a somatic miscarriage (sensibility). This
                  reading emerges from a free-flowing class discussion among eight undergraduate students—students
                  that I encouraged, from go, to get to know one another as full people and to bring
                  their own lives, concerns, histories, and preoccupations to bear on course materials—and
                  me. By tracing this provocative possibility through the novel, our group demonstrates
                  the pedagogical potentials of speculation. We cannot assert that this is the <em>true</em> or <em>right</em> reading of the text, just like we can never know whether Cassandra Austen bore a
                  child out of wedlock. But by lingering on the possibility of secrecy and coded meaning
                  and by thinking through the social, political, and trans-historical implications of
                  this fantasy, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of Marianne’s universe,
                  a universe in which the stakes of sexuality are higher for her than for her male counterparts
                  and in which her choices—and lack of choices—may be, in Lynch’s words, “way more Gothic
                  than we have been told.” Indeed, our experimental reading—the kind of reading that
                  can emerge in the low-stakes environment of the student-centered, discussion-based
                  classroom—reveals the darker potentialities hidden within the folds of Marianne’s
                  dress, a fragile relationship to maternity haunting our lovesick heroine. For the
                  eight undergraduate students in my seminar—and for me—this possibility acted as a
                  sort of time machine transporting <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> into our contemporary sociopolitical moment.</p>

                  <p>What if we read Marianne’s despair following Willoughby’s desertion not as naïve passion
                     but as a physical experience of loss? This collaborative essay grew out of an undergraduate
                     seminar in which we discussed the darker shadows and edges of Jane Austen’s fiction:
                     realism that is really gothic; sex scenes that are not sex scenes; resolutions that
                     are really condemnations. Our in-class discussion of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> led us to develop a shared, speculative reading of the novel in which Marianne becomes
                     pregnant by Willoughby and miscarries his child, whether this miscarriage represents
                     a spontaneous abortion, a deliberately induced abortion, and/or a psychosomatic response
                     in miscarriage to the emotional trauma of losing her first love.

                              “sometimes conflated contraception, miscarriage, and abortion because they were ignorant
                              about the physiological processes in question, or because they wished to avoid the
                              dissemination of dangerously potent information. Since abortion in the nineteenth
                              century was neither widely debated nor circulated in the press before the very end
                              of the period, its presence remains dubious and its principles nebulous” (480).</span></div>

               <p>Read in light of a potential miscarriage, Marianne presents a young woman experiencing
                  intense trauma. Her claim, at the novel’s end, that “My illness . . . had been entirely
                  brought on by myself, by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the
                  time to be wrong” can be read as remorse following a physical, rather than emotional,
                  transgression (Austen 350). When Marianne goes on to admit, “Had I died—, it would
                  have been self-destruction,” her claim resonates with eighteenth-century fictional
                  treatments of abortion such as Jemima’s experience in Wollstonecraft’s <em>The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</em> (Austen 350). In that unfinished text, Jemima first regards an offered “phial” of
                  abortifacient with the thought that “it was killing myself,” a description that encapsulates
                  both her youthful confusion and the extent to which she identifies with her fetus
                  as “ever called a bastard, a bastard appeared to me an object of the greatest compassion
                  in creation.” When she finally decides to “procure abortion,” Jemima “swallow[s] it,
                  with a wish that it might destroy me, at the same time” (Wollstonecraft 194–95). What
                  might we learn if, for the duration of this essay, we let go of our attachments to
                  standard readings of Marianne Dashwood and instead give Austen credit for the darkness
                  that we have come to expect from Wollstonecraft? What if we add to that binary—sense
                  vs. sensibility—the question of embodiment? In this article, we will hazard this provocative
                  interpretation in order to rethink the lessons implied by Marianne’s marriage plot.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">I. Marginal Intimacy</span></h2>
               <p>The whirlwind romance between Marianne and Willoughby, celebrated by her mother and
                  judged indiscreet by her sister, culminates in an unchaperoned visit to the estate
                  of Willoughby’s aunt. There, Marianne and Willoughby consummate their relationship.
                  Austen does not describe the sexual nature of their short-lived relationship beyond
                  winks and euphemisms. “Bound by pre-Victorian limitations of subject matter which
                  had already turned sex into a topic for covert implication rather than overt description,”
                  Austen asks readers to draw on clues such as the courtship narrative, the language
                  surrounding that clandestine meeting, and the comparison to fallen Eliza in order
                  to confirm the sexual nature of the excursion (Chandler 89). Marianne embodies unbridled
                  and rebellious teenage sexuality, while Willoughby is all too willing to play into
                  her love fantasy. </p>
               <p>Just prior to Marianne’s fateful carriage ride, she gifts Willoughby a lock of her
                  hair, and he promises her a horse. Marianne’s sister, Margaret, recounts the gift-giving
                  scene, describing it to Elinor as follows: <span class="quote">‘[Willoughby] seemed to be begging something of [Marianne], and presently he took
                     up her scissars and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her
                     back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper, and put it into
                     his pocket-book. (Austen 94)’</span> Margaret’s recounting of the scene portrays it as a moment of loaded negotiation.
                  Marianne is enamored with Willoughby; yet, he still has to plead with her to give
                  him a piece of her hair. The words that Austen intertwines within this scene—“whispering,”
                  “begging,” “kissed”—indicate that the gifting of hair is more than a sentimental gesture
                  (94). These words imply a vow of silence or secrecy surrounding the act. There is
                  also a forceful nature to the scene—Willoughby literally <em>takes</em> a piece of Marianne’s body for his own. Jill Heydt-Stevenson argues that the “exchange
                  of hair between Willoughby and Marianne also doubles as physical colloquy between
                  bodies” and points out that Austen uses the word “tumbling . . . to denote sexual
                  intercourse” (Heydt-Stevenson 36, 15). Marianne’s hair tumbles down her back with
                  abandon; Willoughby presses the cutting to his lips before folding it in a piece of
                  pure, white paper and taking it for himself. Later in the novel, after Willoughby
                  has informed Marianne that his affections had “been long engaged elsewhere,” Marianne
                  demands the hair back (Austen 205). But the hair has already been cut, and Austen
                  coyly suggests that Marianne has given Willoughby something she cannot take back.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While Willoughby procures hair from Marianne, he also offers to give her something:
                     a horse named Queen Mab, which Marianne accepts and then must refuse for the sake
                     of prudence. This seems on the surface to be just another example of her impulsiveness
                     and propensity to say yes when it comes to Willoughby. However, this horse is not
                     just a horse. As Elinor and Marianne walk alongside each other, Marianne describes
                     Willoughby’s gift as “a horse, one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire,
                     and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman” (Austen 93). Confer Shakespeare’s <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>: “This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, / That presses them and learns
                     them first to bear” (1.4.93–94). Queen Mab can be understood as a fabled being that
                     teaches women to bear both penetrative sex and the children that result from it. Queen
                     Mab is the gift that hangs between Marianne and Willoughby, foreshadowing that although
                     Marianne is open to sex with Willoughby, she will ultimately be unable, or unwilling,
                     to bear her pregnancy.

                              argue that “the nexus of associations, erotic and ideological, surrounding both the
                              Shakespearean and the colloquial ‘Mab,’ coalesce in this moment as Willoughby’s covert
                              marriage proposal doubles as a prophesy of her ruined terminus: like the first Eliza,
                              dead from suffering and illness and like the second Eliza (or Maria in Mansfield Park,
                              for that matter), who spins out her life isolated in a country cottage” (58–60).</span></div>

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Sexual excitement surrounds the pair. The immediate agreeability between them stems
                  from their mutual openness of thought and speech. They giggle about everyone and everything
                  around them. When Elinor begins to suspect Willoughby’s outright desertion of Marianne,
                  Mrs. Dashwood counters, “Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no
                  secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved” (Austen 113).
                  Except there has been secrecy, whether or not Mrs. Dashwood chooses to see it. When
                  the family left in one carriage, and Marianne and Willoughby in another, “nothing
                  more of them was seen till their return.” At Mrs. Jennings’s smug insistence that
                  she knows where they have been, Marianne feigns ignorance, asking, “Where, pray?”
                  while Willoughby jumps to say that they have been in his carriage, obviously (110).
                  Their deception, albeit a weak attempt, does more to suggest sexual impropriety than
                  anything else. Though doing so may not be her intention, Mrs. Dashwood confirms the
                  seriousness of the incident by condemning secrecy. </p>
               <p>After giving up the lie, Marianne confides in Elinor about her visit to Willoughby’s
                  prospective estate. She exclaims, “I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life”;
                  this is the closest she comes to describing their sexual encounter (Austen 102). Her
                  official story is that Willoughby, without even the attendance of his aunt, showed
                  her all the rooms of the house. Of course, “the implication is clear that the couple
                  had been examining the bedrooms also” (Cornog and Perper 162). Marianne’s unbridled
                  passion and proud contrarianism toward courtship etiquette at the outset of the novel
                  make plausible an implied sex scene. </p>
               <p>At this point in the novel, Willoughby has already had a tryst with Colonel Brandon’s
                  ward, Eliza. People speculate that she has fallen ill, much like Marianne will; she
                  gives birth to an illegitimate child in secrecy and shame. Willoughby, finally attempting
                  to explain this indiscretion to Elinor, describes “the violence of her passions, the
                  weakness of her understanding,” oscillating between hollow self-chastisement and blaming
                  Eliza (Austen 329). He convinces skeptical Elinor to feel pity for him, though it
                  is he who had sex out of wedlock, conceived with Eliza, and refused to marry her.
                  (If, at this point, he has indeed lost a child by Marianne, and if Elinor somehow
                  knows about this, then this might help explain Elinor’s feeling of pity, as well.)
                  Even as he attempts to distance the two women intellectually, he draws exacting similarities.
                  Marianne acts on him while his only fault is letting her. Willoughby reflects on “giving
                  way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging” with Marianne
                  (327). This language, in combination with his remarks about Marianne’s own “deep regret,”
                  suggests cause for remorse that goes beyond leading her on in words alone (Austen
                  331). Eliza’s demise alerts the reader to an alternate potentiality for Marianne in
                  her imprudent interactions with Willoughby. Mrs. Jennings compares Marianne’s particular
                  suffering with the youthful crushes that came and went among her own daughters: “as
                  for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature,” unable to recover with adolescent
                  resiliency (205). She is altered; having lost her virginity and having been impregnated
                  by the obviously virile Willoughby, Marianne’s future could look a lot like Eliza’s.

                  <p>Pregnancy out of wedlock, in the world of the novel, is a direct route to social rejection
                     and a defiled reputation. Eliza, daughter of Colonel Brandon’s first love, Elizabeth
                     Williams, is seduced by Willoughby’s flirtations and promises of marriage, and impregnated
                     by him at the age of 15. “[Willoughby] had left the girl whose youth and innocence
                     he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no
                     help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He had left her promising to return; he
                     neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her” (Austen 228). Marianne and Willoughby’s
                     relationship directly parallels Eliza’s case. Colonel Brandon himself compares the
                     two, saying, “your sister, I hope, cannot be offended . . . by the resemblance I have
                     fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation” (227). Given the potential social
                     consequences, it comes as no surprise that Marianne, an impressionable embodiment
                     of “sensibility,” keeps her precarious situation a secret from everyone, including
                     her family. In keeping this secret, she sometimes appears to be hysterical, a historically
                     diagnosable illness that, Carroll Smith-Rosenberg contends, “can be seen as an alternate
                     role option for particular women incapable of accepting their life situation” (655).

                     and potentially damning experience. Marianne’s desperation to get in touch with Willoughby
                     after he avoids and rejects her in public is divulged in her frenzied appeal to Elinor
                     to force Willoughby to talk to her. Her language in this passage is not that of a
                     scorned lover, but rather of someone whose entire future is on the line. She pleads
                     that she “must see him again—must speak to him instantly.—I cannot rest—I shall not

                     weeks on end, walking through the rain, running away and hiding herself from the people
                     she is closest with—can be understood as hysteria or as a radical act of social self-preservation.

               <p>Although Marianne and Elinor have a close, sisterly relationship, there are several
                  moments in the novel when Elinor is seen discussing her sister’s secrets with those
                  who are known to gossip, such as Mrs. Jennings. Perhaps most striking is the moment
                  when Elinor defends Willoughby, saying, “he has broken no positive engagement with
                  my sister.” Mrs. Jennings is shocked by this and goes on to discuss the evidence that
                  Marianne and Willoughby were engaged, saying, “No positive engagement indeed! after
                  taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they were to live
                  in hereafter!” (Austen 217). While this evidence points to a potential engagement
                  between Marianne and Willoughby, it also reinforces the possibility that something
                  improper, something that could only be rectified through marriage, happened in Allenham
                  house.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. Removing the Infant </span></h2>
               <p>After leaving London with her sister and Mrs. Jennings, Marianne arrives at the Palmers’
                  house at Cleveland feeling partly renewed but mostly devastated at the incurred distance
                  between herself and Willoughby, the father of her secret, unborn child. Here, she
                  isolates herself from any company and only takes solace in walking alone around the
                  property, despite the dangers of the temperamental climate. A short time into her
                  stay, Marianne becomes dangerously ill, which leads to the sublimated denouement of
                  the miscarriage as her illness here is used to mask the scene of her failed delivery.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>After Marianne’s health worsens despite the household’s initial expectations, an apothecary
                     is called in to consult. The Palmers’ apothecary, Mr. Harris, who does not believe
                     that Marianne is gravely ill, allows the word “infection” to pass his lips, which
                     “g[ives] instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer, on her baby’s account,” and causes Mrs. Jennings
                     to then urge the “immediate removal” of the infant (Austen 316). By positioning concern
                     for infant safety and mortality so close to the discussion of Marianne’s ailment,
                     Austen insinuates a direct connection between the two. The mortal threat in question
                     is not to Mrs. Palmer’s baby, but to Marianne’s fetus. The explicit departure of a
                     baby from the house stands in as a socially acceptable substitution, a plot device
                     that mirrors the parallel departure of an unborn child behind closed doors.

                              Dashwood, John Wiltshire points out that Marianne’s illness is characterized by “identification
                              with the mother” whose safe arrival at her daughter’s side signals the end of the
                              episode (
                              “Jane Austen and the Body”

               </div>
               <p>Mr. Harris’s incongruent evaluation of the gravity of Marianne’s illness to the rest
                  of the party also suggests that he may have some understanding of the true nature
                  of the situation. The use of the term “infection” within the context of Marianne’s
                  misery is interesting, because it positions the fetus as an unwanted, reviled threat
                  to both Marianne’s physical wellbeing and her standing in society. John Wiltshire
                  argues: “Austen is interested in illnesses’ cultural aspects, in the patient’s use
                  of the body for social advantage. . . . At the same time, the novels also understand
                  how social conditions register themselves in the body, especially in the bodies of
                  women” (
                  “Medicine, illness and disease”
                  306). In this case, Marianne is an example of how social conditions registered in
                  the body can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Premarital sex threatens not
                  only the social body, but also the body proper. Austen, when writing <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, was cognizant of the idea of somatization, which suggests that the miscarriage could
                  have been reactionary to Marianne’s devastation. Furthermore, in her thesis on Austen
                  and illness, Pamela Kirkpatrick argues that “Austen shows, through many of her female
                  characters, that the concept of somatic illness . . . is much more complicated than
                  the naïve idea of ailments which are ‘all in the head’” (4).</p>
               <p>In addition to the evidence that her loss could be somatic, there is also the suggestion
                  that Marianne actively induces fetal abortion. When she first falls ill after roaming
                  the property in the pouring rain, the narrator notes that the development of her sickness
                  was “assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings”
                  (Austen 314). This suggests that Marianne might have acted, at least in part, in a
                  way that contributed to her miscarriage. Furthermore, it is possible to read Mr. Harris
                  as complicit in an abortion. From the onset of Marianne’s illness, “prescriptions
                  poured in from all quarters” (315). Kirkpatrick explains that, during the period,
                  apothecaries provided most routine health care to citizens and that “apothecaries
                  often supplied diagnostic services in addition to prescriptions, and many of them
                  recognized the importance of addressing the patient’s emotional and social needs as
                  well as the physical” (2). It would be impossible for Mr. Harris to be unaware of
                  the massive social ramifications of an unwanted pregnancy, and so helping Marianne
                  both induce and conceal a miscarriage might align with this consideration for patients’
                  social and physical needs, despite the fact that it was illegal in England, after
                  1803, to give a woman any substance that might procure an abortion. We must thus decide
                  whether to read Mr. Harris as a stock character or as a radical activist.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III. Miscarrying the Marriage Plot</span></h2>
               <p>If we read Marianne as conceiving Willoughby’s child and then losing or terminating
                  the pregnancy, what does this mean for the marriage plot? We commonly read Jane Austen’s
                  novels as reinforcing social mores through optimistic endings centered on marriage.
                  In these happy endings, the novels reaffirm the reader’s “hope of a personal reward
                  for good social behavior and their faith that public progress promise[s] the stability
                  and continuity of their way of life” (Magee 198). In <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, the sisters share the goal of being safely conducted into the arms of respectable
                  and wealthy gentlemen and then marrying them. Within this framework, on a surface
                  level, Austen uses her two heroines to discuss passion and romance by contrasting
                  each heroine’s expression of sensibility. In contrast to her reserved, sensible sister,
                  Marianne is consumed by passion and desire for the romance of marriage, which carries
                  her directly into Willoughby’s arms. After this dalliance with a rake and the ambiguous
                  sorrow and sickness that follows, Marianne is redeemed through the proposal of Colonel
                  Brandon, an older man, of a good reputation, financially stable, and, above all, pure
                  in his love for Marianne, which endures even the problems caused by Willoughby.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Beyond forsaking Willoughby in favor of the better match, Marianne undergoes a miraculous
                     conversion as she “discover[s] the falsehood of her own opinions” and grows in fondness
                     toward Colonel Brandon, whom she originally thought was too old for her to marry (Austen
                     379). She chooses a man that has very little sex appeal, a move that stands in stark
                     contrast to previous choices she has made, and embarks on a relationship that is not
                     first love. This change is celebrated as an innate part of Marianne’s intrinsic purity
                     and moral goodness, which lies even below the “sins” of her actions with Willoughby.
                     Marianne can only accomplish this change because she “was born to an extraordinary
                     fate” which blessed her with the ability to “counteract, by her conduct, her most
                     favorite maxims” of the value of passionate sensibility; in turn, she stands against
                     “falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly flattered
                     herself with expecting” (380).

                              added). Marianne has borne her own redemption, rather than a child.</span></div>
                     </div> Marianne, through this redemption, becomes a woman who never fell a sacrifice at all.
                     Her indiscretions are absolved. As compensation for this moral restoration, Marianne
                     is rewarded through the marriage plot with marriage, love, fiscal stability, and power,
                     as she “found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new
                     duties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness
                     of a village” (380). Marianne goes from a damaged woman to a woman superior in life
                     station, power, and wealth in comparison to her contemporaries.</p>
               </div>
               <p>But when we introduce a lost or terminated pregnancy into this equation, we see that
                  this happy ending depends, not only on sense and sensibility, but also, and perhaps
                  more foundationally, on the body. Should Marianne have carried Willoughby’s baby to
                  term, she would have been as doomed as Eliza. Colonel Brandon acknowledges the sharp
                  distinction: <span class="quote">‘Whatever they may have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless <em>will</em> turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with that of
                     my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor
                     girl, and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him as strong, still as strong
                     as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through
                     life. Surely this comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her own sufferings
                     to be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. (Austen
                     229)’</span> While on the surface “they may have been” refers to the emotional connection past
                  between Marianne and Willoughby, it modifies Marianne’s “condition,” thereby both
                  multiplying and pluralizing it. Marianne will feel her own “sufferings” to be “nothing”
                  as opposed to Eliza’s sufferings, which resulted in something, specifically, an illegitimate
                  child. Read in light of a potential pregnancy and miscarriage, Brandon’s speech is
                  deeply ironic. Miscarriage negates “misconduct.” Whether spontaneous or induced, whether
                  the result of a logical calculation or the overflow of emotion, the abortion of Marianne’s
                  fetus has reasserted her virtue and, with it, reaffirmed the marriage plot. The novel’s
                  structuring system, which governs female fate, depends, in the end, on a young girl’s
                  body. Whether that body has been restored to its singular, viable status through sense
                  or sensibility, we can only speculate.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Focusing on the Victorian period, Doreen Theiruf argues that medical professionals
               “sometimes conflated contraception, miscarriage, and abortion because they were ignorant
               about the physiological processes in question, or because they wished to avoid the
               dissemination of dangerously potent information. Since abortion in the nineteenth
               century was neither widely debated nor circulated in the press before the very end
               of the period, its presence remains dubious and its principles nebulous” (480).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Jill Heydt-Stevenson surveys different interpretations of this allusion in order to
               argue that “the nexus of associations, erotic and ideological, surrounding both the
               Shakespearean and the colloquial ‘Mab,’ coalesce in this moment as Willoughby’s covert
               marriage proposal doubles as a prophesy of her ruined terminus: like the first Eliza,
               dead from suffering and illness and like the second Eliza (or Maria in <em>Mansfield Park</em>, for that matter), who spins out her life isolated in a country cottage” (58–60).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">While Smith-Rosenberg writes about the nineteenth-century American context, her pithy
               description of hysteria resonates with Marianne’s impossible position. See also Eve
               Kosofky Sedgwick’s famous essay 
               “Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl,”
               in <em>Tendencies.</em></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">For example, upon guests’ arrival, “Marianne had left the room…”; Elinor claims that
               Marianne “has been very much plagued lately with nervous headaches, which make her
               unfit for company or conversation” (Austen 186, 237).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Furthermore, in his reading of Marianne as harboring an infantile attachment to Mrs.
               Dashwood, John Wiltshire points out that Marianne’s illness is characterized by “identification
               with the mother” whose safe arrival at her daughter’s side signals the end of the
               episode (
               “Jane Austen and the Body”
               49).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">There might be coded irony in the repetition of the word born, here: “Marianne Dashwood
               was born to an extraordinary fate. She was <em>born</em> to discover” (Austen 379, emphasis added). Marianne has borne her own redemption,
               rather than a child.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
