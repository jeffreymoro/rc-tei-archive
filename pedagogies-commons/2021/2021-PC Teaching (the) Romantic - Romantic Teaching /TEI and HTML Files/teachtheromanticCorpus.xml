<head>About this Volume</head>
<p rend="noCount">For the past several years Romantic Circles Pedagogies Commons has
                    published special volumes that speak to specific issues within romanticist
                    pedagogy, such as <title level="m">Romanticism and Technology,</title>
<title level="m">Teaching Global Romanticism,</title>
                    or <title level="m">Teaching the Romantic with the Contemporary.</title> For this 2-part volume,
                    assembled during the COVID-19 crisis, we purposely stepped back and focused more
                    broadly on essays that offer innovative approaches to teaching Romanticism. By focusing 
                    on innovative pedagogies that seek to redefine “the Romantic” in various ways and 
                    consider Romanticism as a place of engagement rather than administration, we hope to 
                    rethink rather than recapture some of the more universalist claims for our discipline. 
                    The essays collected are keen examples of this revisionary and
                    processual pedagogy. They ask us to reconsider our relationship to the two key
                    moments of any pedagogical project, what was and what is yet to be. </p>

<head>About the Design and Markup</head>
<p rend="noCount"> This volume was encoded at the University of
                        Maryland, College Park by Technical Interns Dominique Joe and Dana Maller with
                        guidance from Technical Editors Cayla Eagon and T. J. McLemore at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. The initial transformation from WORD
                        Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with
                        further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders
                        text in archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura
                        Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT
                        transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. </p>

<head>About the Romantic Circles Pedagogies Commons Series</head>
<p rend="noCount">The Romantic Circles Pedagogy Commons is a peer-reviewed

<div type="section">
<p>Jean-Francois Lyotard argues that true learning can only occur once we begin
                        to “learn to unlearn” our various expertises (101). Each time we return to a
                        text or a question we must “recommence . . . [and] always begin in the middle”
                        (100–101). This collection of essays, <title level="m">Teaching (the)
                            Romantic / Romantic Teaching</title>, would seem to bear witness to this
                        fact; it might easily be retitled <title level="m">Pictures from the Scene
                            of Unlearning</title>. When Kate Singer and I first issued the call for
                        this volume, we were interested in collecting essays that might have slipped
                        through the cracks of our many themed volumes (<title level="m">Teaching
                            Romanticism and Technology</title>, <title level="m">Teaching Global
                            Romanticism</title>, etc.). The types of essays we were hoping for would
                        examine new collective and individual intuitions of pedagogy, reimaginings
                        of the concerns of cognition, language sensitivity, and world-making; in
                        other words, we were looking for reports of pedagogical practice that shared
                        certain premises about the world with the Romantic-era writers we write
                        about and teach. If the kinds of “soul making” that Keats and Charlotte
                        Smith engaged in was in a certain sense uncategorizable, then perhaps it
                        should not surprise us that the ideas, techniques, and teachings through
                        which its pedagogy is constituted might also defy categorization.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Keats’ letters for his theory of soul
                            making, and how soul should be differentiated from intellect
                            (232).</note> In any case, we were overwhelmed by the response to our
                        call. We received far more excellent proposals than could ever fit into a
                        single volume. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many folks
                        are doing such amazing work, we decided we wanted to create a more robust
                        platform from which teachers of Romanticism could articulate and share their
                        experience and intellectual labor. As a result, what you are now reading is
                        volume one of a two-volume set. </p>
<p>Why all of this interest in pedagogy at this particular moment? One answer
                        may be that when we are in the classroom, however that may look (my current
                        classroom during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is virtual and distanced), we
                        are best positioned to see the text from a new perspective and to discover
                        a new relation of text to world. The inherent multiplicity of the
                        classroom situation, and its ever-varying constituencies, makes this
                        possible. As such, teaching holds open the possibility of seeing in new
                        ways; it socializes the text by requiring that we continually “recommence”
                        (Lyotard 105).</p>
<p>The essays collected here are keen examples of this revisionary and processual
                        pedagogy. They ask us to reconsider our relationship to the two key moments
                        of any pedagogical “project,” what was and what is yet to be (Sartre 91). As
                        such, the essays in this collection move beyond mere contextualization.
                        Sarah Maitland’s <title level="a">Teaching <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> in the
                            Post-Columbine Classroom</title> narrates the efforts of her class to
                        understand the social and psychic underpinnings of the Creature’s action by
                        contrasting his narrative to fragments from the journals of the Columbine
                        High School shooters. Catherine Ross’s examination of the curriculums of
                        eighteenth- and nineteenth-century elite English schools not only enlightens
                        readers of Romanticism by situating canonical poets in their own pedagogical
                        milieu, but also suggests exercises designed to reproduce the effects and
                        experience for our twenty-first-century students. One senses in these essays
                        a profound commitment to the living history of a Romanticism that is
                        constantly being learned and unlearned, sketched out, erased, complicated,
                        and rewritten according to the ever-shifting exigencies of the political and
                        pedagogical field. Also included in this collection are two excellent essays
                        focused on poetry and poetics, each addressing a different aspect of verse
                        practice or lyric theory. Elizabeth Walker’s essay, <title level="a">‘Brown
                            Study’ Aesthetics in Romantic Literature,</title> describes her attempts
                        to reframe, with her students, Romantic-era practices of reverie and lyric
                        production in terms of William Cowper’s poetic reflection as described in
                            <title level="m">The Task</title>. Carrie Busby’s essay, using
                        Wordsworth as a model, focuses on the “acoustic ecologies” of Romanticism,
                        past and present, suggesting that the reverberative effects of sounded-out
                        poetic environments and subjectivities are perceptible on several levels in
                        poetry, and, importantly, achievable in the classroom. Finally, we present
                        two mixed-genre essays. Rachel Feder’s collaborative “field study” is a
                        speculative essay composed with her students. It asks and addresses the
                        question, what if, in Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Sense and
                            Sensibility</title>, Marianne becomes pregnant when she and Willoughby
                        visit Allenham House? Kathryn H. Warren’s contribution closes our volume. A
                        full-throated defense of Romanticism as a living force, Warren’s essay asks
                        us to bring all of ourselves into the classroom and to model for our
                        students what it means to “take things personally.”</p>
<p>We are so grateful to all these writers for their originality, perspicacity,
                        and courage, and are happy to be able to provide their essays with, if not a
                        fixed and stable home, then at least a space that they can shelter in
                        place.</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">This article offers fresh and detailed information about how the
                    elite schools and colleges of Oxford and Cambridge educated many of the
                    canonical writers and public men of the Romantic Period. While these schools
                    excluded women and non-Anglicans, they offered their students—among whom
                    numbered Percy, Cowper, Darwin, Crabbe Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Byron,
                    Shelley, Sidney Smith, Canning, and most of the clergymen and men of state—a
                    remarkable program of linguistic, mathematical, and theological training.
                    Students began composing metrical verse in Latin and Greek from boyhood, studied
                    logic and read Euclid’s geometry in Greek, did copious amounts of memory work,
                    wrote “themes” several times a week in three languages, and declaimed and argued
                    publicly at least once a year. Understanding how these writers were educated
                    offers scholars of the period several new ways to think about and teach the
                    works of those writers and the movement they inspired. It also allows students
                    of the period to have greater appreciation of Romantic writers’ craft and their
                    own experiences of learning about language, literature, and composition.</p>

<p>Understanding how writers of the English Romantic Period were educated offers modern
                professors studying the period several new ways to think about and teach the works
                of those writers and the movement they inspired. It also allows students studying
                the period to have greater appreciation for Romantic writers’ craft and their own
                experiences of learning about language, literature, and composition. Formal
                education between the years 1770 and 1850 was neither well organized nor widely
                available in England. Working class children might have had the benefit of no more
                than a few years of instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic; they were
                considered “literate” even if they could do nothing more than write their names. The
                daughters of the middle and upper classes might be taught at home by their fathers,
                public-school educated brothers, or governesses, and later sent away to ladies’
                seminaries to improve their reading and writing skills and to learn French, music,
                drawing, dancing, and fine stitchery. University education was out of the question
                for English girls until late in the Victorian Period, though some studied ancient
                Greek privately and used it to publish translations of Greek tragedies.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Even then, young women could attend lectures, but
                    were not permitted to earn the BA from Oxford or Cambridge until the 20th
                    century. Some colleges at both universities did not become fully co-educational
                    until the 1980s.</note> The sons of these families—many of whom are among the
                canonized poets of the period—were more fortunate. They were sent away to one of the
                great public schools, such as Eton or Harrow, or to one of the endowed grammar
                schools, such as Hawkshead or Chesterfield Grammar, which prepared them for study at
                Oxford or Cambridge. Boys were packed off to these schools no later than age
                thirteen; some boys were enrolled as young as age eight. Wordsworth was nine when
                his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School; he boarded nearby with Ann Tyson
                for eight years. Samuel Taylor Coleridge was ten when he was sent to Christ’s
                Hospital. Horace Walpole boarded at Eton for seven years; Shelley was there for six;
                Byron was at Harrow for five. With the exception of Shelley, all of these students
                subsequently attended Oxford or Cambridge for at least three years.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Among the other poets who were educated at what
                    might be called the “Anglo-classical academy” were poets such as Thomas Warton
                    (1728–1790), Thomas Percy (1729–1811), William Cowper (1731–1800), Erasmus
                    Darwin (1731–1802), George Crabbe (1754–1832), George Dyer (1755–1841), William
                    Lisle Bowles (1762–1850), William Wordsworth (1770–1850), Samuel Taylor
                    Coleridge (1772–1834), Robert Southey (1774–1843), Lord Byron (1788–1824), Percy
                    Shelley (1792–1822), and Thomas Dale (1797–1870). Others writers and important
                    intellectuals of the period were similarly educated as well: This group includes
                    John Wesley (1703–1791), David Hartley (1705–1757), Samuel Johnson (1709–1784),
                    Horace Walpole (1717–1797), Adam Smith (1723–1790), William Gilpin (1724–1804),
                    Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), John Horne Took (1734–1812), Thomas Haweis (c.
                    1734–1820), Edward Gibbon (1737–1794), Joseph Banks (1743–1820), William Paley
                    (1743–1805), Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), Vicesimus Knox (1752–1821),Thomas

                    Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), Macaulay (1800–1859), and Thomas Beddoes
                    (1803–1849).</note> These institutions taught these writers and many other
                middle- and upper-class boys in their audience most of what they knew about the
                meanings, sounds, and use of language in texts. These schools and university colleges 
                were where many poets became remarkably
                well-acquainted with literary forms, the art of writing, and the Western literary
                canon. </p>
<p>Instruction at these elite schools focused on language. Youngsters began building a
                rich classical vocabulary, first in Latin, later in Greek, through guided reading,
                translation, memory work, recitation, and conversation. Students read verse in these
                languages every day, and at least three days a week they were required to compose
                verse and prose in them as well. Schoolmasters typically chose classical verse or
                discourses that were intentionally didactic, such as Cicero’s epistles to his son
                and Quintilian’s lessons on how to be “a good man . . . speaking well” (Bizell and
                Herzberg 323–24). In addition to these circumstances, it is important to note that
                all the teachers at these elite institutions were Oxford- or Cambridge-educated
                Anglican clergymen and that every day school and college began and ended with
                communal celebration of the Morning and Evening Prayer services. Moreover, teaching
                and learning at these institutions were quite personal: schoolmasters lived, ate,
                and worshiped with their students. Tutors at the two ancient English universities,
                which had a combined enrollment of only 1250 students in 1800, also resided, shared
                commons, and worshiped in college with their students. Romantic-era tutors were
                college fellows, and each worked individually with a small group of students from
                the day they entered as freshmen. Tutors designed and guided students’ reading,
                according to each one’s personal aspirations, in readiness for the college exams. If
                a student was clever and ambitious, his tutor’s job included helping him prepare for
                the much more competitive university exams that typically lead to fellowships and a
                career in academia or the church. Tutors were responsible as well for students’
                behavior, belongings, and personal financial affairs. Added to these circumstances,
                it was not unusual for students to be in the presence of members of the royal
                family, bishops, and other statesmen, for these individuals were often guests of
                honor at festivities held at the schools. University Chancellors were statesmen or
                high-ranking men of court, and both universities elected their own Members of
                Parliament. This collection of academic, religious, and social practices at the
                schools and universities helps clarify why Coleridge thought of poets and other
                learned people as members of a <emph>clerisy</emph> and why Shelley claimed that
                poets are the legislators of the world. It also explains why Wordsworth asserted in
                the Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> that that poets are
                translators and why he wrote his friend George Beaumont that “Every great Poet is a
                Teacher: I wish either to be considered as a Teacher, or as nothing” (De Selincourt
                    <title level="m">Letters</title>, 195).</p>
<p>I have recently completed a book, tentatively titled <title level="m">Training for the 
            Writer's Life in Anglo-classical Academy, 1770–1850</title>. From a pedagogical
                perspective, the two most notable findings of my research are how the Romantics were
                taught Latin and Greek “grammar,” which included not only vocabulary building and
                syntax, but also memory work and explicit daily instruction about the sound and
                rhythms of language, and how much writing students were required to do each week.
                With regard to the possible influences this education may have had upon the
                Romantics’ formal or thematic choices, one of the most interesting findings was how
                familiar students became with a wide range of verse forms—from heroic couplets to
                epics. Daily reading and instruction using scripture and the elegantly ordinary
                language of the <title level="m">Book of Common Prayer</title> was also an important
                aspect of this education thanks to the Lectionary of the <title level="m">BCP</title>; every month students read all 150 psalms, and in a year’s time,
                they read through the entire New Testament.<note place="foot" resp="author">Even
                    though an avowed atheist, Shelley demonstrated the effects of his early biblical
                    training right up to the month of his death, when, according to Holmes, he kept
                    a small vellum notebook in which he recorded bits of verse and Biblical
                    fragments (726).</note>In this essay, after briefly explaining typical
                Romantic-period pedagogies and curricula, I will suggest a number of assignments
                modern professors of the Romantic Period might use to help their students have a
                richer appreciation of the word choice, linguistic register, music, formal choices,
                and attitudes or themes that appear in poems written by poets who had the privilege
                of this elite classical education.</p>

<head>Classical “Grammar”</head>
<p>Educators in the Romantic Period believed along with the Scottish poet James
                    Beattie that a person must be “something of a grammarian to be able thoroughly
                    to understand a well-written book . . . [for] the complicated inflexions and
                    syntax of these elegant tongues [give] rise to innumerable subtleties of
                    connection, and minute varieties of meaning, whereof the superficial reader, who
                    thinks grammar below his notice can have no idea” (508–9). Hence, the focus of
                    the first years at school in the Romantic Period was Latin “grammar,” which
                    began with boys learning words in Latin along with instruction in how to use
                    them. These included “the art of spelling; . . . parts of speech, with their
                    accidents and formations; . . . the construction of words into sentences,
                    according to their several relations to each other . . .; and . . . the quantity
                    of syllables and their arrangement in versification” (<title level="m">The Eton
                        Latin Grammar</title> 3). The methods schoolmasters used to build students’
                    grammar skills began with explaining and demonstrating the meanings of clusters
                    of Latin words that appeared in simple verse texts by writers such as Ovid and
                    Terence. Teachers attended not only to the meanings and proper grammatical use
                    of words, but also, significantly, to the accents and the quantities (the longs
                    and shorts) of each syllable. Every night for homework boys memorized the
                    verses, vocabulary, and grammar rules covered in class. The next day, they
                    recited and reviewed the previous lesson, read more lines of verse, and learned
                    new words and grammar rules. This sequence would be repeated every day, with
                    review on Fridays and Saturdays.<note place="foot" resp="author">Dr. Vincent,
                        the headmaster of Westminster when Southey was there, cautioned
                        schoolmasters not to go faster in teaching than boys could learn.</note>
</p>
<p>The most common texts used in the lower forms were Ovid’s <title level="m">Metamorphoses</title>, composed entirely in dactylic hexameter; Terence’s
                    verse comedies; and Phaedrus’s Latin verse translations of Aesop’s fables.
                    Beattie noted that reading these “harmonious” and “amusive” stories as a
                    youngster both awakened and soothed his “human passions” (497). After a few
                    weeks, boys were asked to compose their first <emph>themes</emph>, which were
                    nonsense verses, comprised of strings of Latin words that fit simple metrical
                    patterns. The lines of words did not have to make sense; they simply had to
                    demonstrate the boys’ knowledge of the pronunciation of the words and the metrical
                    patterns they were learning. Pupils might be asked to compose these themes several
                    times a week. Once boys had large enough vocabularies, their teachers required
                    them to write verse themes that made sense. As mentioned above and also detailed
                    below, by the time a boy was thirteen or fourteen, he was composing verse and
                    prose themes every week.</p>
<p>Usually by their second or third year at school, students were reading much more
                    complicated Latin verse and had begun studying Greek in the same fashion.<note place="foot" resp="author"> We know that by the time he was fourteen,
                        Wordsworth had advanced to Greek studies at Hawkshead, where he used
                        Hendricks’ Greek lexicon and owned his own copy of Demosthenes. In 1785 his
                        father also bought him a copy of <title level="m">Euclid</title> in Greek
                        and a Greek exercise book. Wordsworth’s brother Christopher was similarly
                        taught as a boy and both continued their classical reading at Cambridge.
                        Years later, when he became Master of Trinity, Christopher Wordsworth
                        encouraged Greek studies in English schools, and, despite the dominance of
                        Newtonian mathematics at the university, he encouraged interest in classical
                        studies at Trinity. As Bruce Graver has reminded us, it was through his
                        brother at Trinity that Wordsworth “kept in touch with many of the leading
                        Hellenists of the day” (42).</note> A fifth-form student at any of these
                    schools might be asked in one week’s time to read, parse, memorize, and write
                    translations of approximately 150 lines of Homer, sixty lines of Horace, seventy
                    lines of Virgil, and assorted passages from writers such as Aeschylus,
                    Euripides, Pindar, Sappho, and Cicero, as well as the Book of Psalms and the Old
                    and New Testaments. The standard text at virtually all the public schools,
                    grammar schools, and the universities was Virgil’s <title level="m">Aeneid</title>. This text gave students the occasion to study some of the
                    classical world’s finest examples of dactylic hexameter and to consider themes
                    that became important in public discourse when the young Romantics were adults,
                    such as national pride, free will, the different forms of power, and love of
                    home and family. Students at both levels also read the four books of Virgil's
                    <title level="m">Georgics</title>, which are long didactic poems about country life. Written in an
                    unsettled time, not unlike that of the Romantics, these texts praise natural
                    beauty, the virtues of country life, and rural labor. As Kenneth Johnson has
                    aptly noted, they also rehearse the notion of “rural republican virtue checking
                    urban imperial excess” (72).</p>
<p>Along with Virgil, students in the Romantic period read almost all of Horace’s
                    verse epistles and odes.<note place="foot" resp="author">Charles James Fox, who
                        attended Eton and Oxford, is reputed to have carried a volume of Horace with
                        him at all times. See Clancy’s work on Wordsworth and Horace.</note>These
                    poems, which most often focus upon topics such as love, friendship, and poetry,
                    accustomed students to the tempo of heroic couplets, well-turned alcaics and
                        sapphics,<note place="foot" resp="author">Alcaics are strophes of three or
                        four lines, which usually consist of eleven, ten, and/or nine syllables.

                        and/or sixteen syllables.</note>rhythmically smooth hexameter, and precise
                    word choice. Additionally, many of Horace’s works represent a culturally
                    significant figure that mattered to the parents of schoolboys and college
                    students: the ideal gentleman, whom the classical scholar Ogilvie characterizes
                    as a wise and humane man who endeavors to see the world with humor rather than
                    bitterness and who advocates for moderation and the moral health of the state
                    (49–50). Students in the Romantic Period also studied Hesiod’s <title level="m">Works and Days</title>, Epictetus’s serious and Lucian’s comic dialogues,
                    Theocritus’s bucolic poetry, Callimachus’s epigrams and elegies, and Longinus’s
                    literary criticism. These readings acquainted Romantic-era students with the
                    Greeks’ characteristic exaltation of honor, heroism, and loyalty; their love of
                    freedom, beauty, and the countryside; and Longinus’s dictum that sublime
                    discourse should transport as well as persuade by using “great conceptions, . .
                    . inspired passion, . . . noble diction, . . . and dignified and elevated
                    composition” (Longinus, quoted in Richter 84).</p>
<p>By the time a boy graduated from one of these schools, he had learned to
                    recognize and use a variety of metrical feet, not just iambs, trochees,
                    spondees, anapests, and dactyls, but also trisyllables such as amphibrachs (˘–˘) 
                    and molossi (–––) and tetrasyllables such as the four paeons and the
                    choriamb (–˘˘–).<note place="foot" resp="author">An indication of how
                        well-acquainted boys were with the purposes and conventions of prosody can
                        be discerned in the questions appearing in the grammar textbook used at the
                        Bath Grammar School in 1794. These included “What is the use of Prosody,”
                        “What are the Feet most commonly made Use of?”, “Of how many Syllables does
                        a Dactyl consist?”, and “What is Synalaepha?” (Morgan 9, 10, 15, 20).</note>
                    Teachers also, no doubt, explained three metrical conventions that are standard
                    in classical Latin—the accentuation of the final foot, an extrametrical final
                    syllable, and the common use of moraic trochees.<note place="foot" resp="author"> A mora is a lingering or “long” syllable. A moraic trochee is a foot in
                        which the first syllable is a “long” syllable, which, therefore, carries
                        more stress than the first syllable of a simple trochee.</note>The schools’
                    regimen of vocabulary building, parsing, translating and memorizing acquainted
                    students quite intimately not only with these metrical tools, but also with an
                    array of verse forms including pastoral verse such as georgics, idylls, and
                    eclogues; lyrics such as odes, hymns, psalms, and paeans; narratives such as
                    epics, <emph>epyllia</emph> (mini-epics), comedies, tragedies, and
                    tragi-comedies; verse epistles, satire, allegories, elegies, encomia,
                    invectives, and epigrams. The Cambridge classicist, Richard Rutherford, asserts
                    that the ancient writers whom Romantic-era school boys studied so closely were
                    “always conscious of what they [were] writing, and what kind of work it [was]”;
                    both “the artists and the critics [of the ancient world] regularly [referred] to
                    generic rules and expectations” (11). Hence, from an early age, English students
                    understood that good writing was systematic and that an educated person should
                    be able to recognize and appreciate literary forms and conventions.</p>

<head>Memory Work, Translation, and Themes</head>
<p>Underlying most of the Georgian schools’ work with younger boys was the
                        notion that “the instruction of childhood depends more on memory than
                        intellect” (Sergeaunt 30).<note place="foot" resp="author">The emphasis
                            upon memory work is founded on the classical rhetorical tradition, in
                            which memory is one of the five canons. The Pythagoreans were especially
                            dedicated to using memory training, for they considered the possession
                            of a powerful memory as necessary to their endeavors to recollect the
                            immortal soul. Memory was, therefore, a necessary pre-condition of moral
                            and spiritual excellence. In later Christian times, cultivating the
                            memory became a part of salvation theology. The importance of memory is
                            not unprecedented in other cultures. From at least the time of the
                            Middle Ages, Chinese students were expected to memorize the Five
                            Classics and the Four Books of Confucian teaching along with the
                            commentaries by Zhu Xi (1130–1200). The Brahmin tradition of India even
                            today depends upon students having highly trained memories. The Vedas
                            and commentaries are memorized using elaborate methods, including
                            memorizing syllables of passages in reverse to the end that all rituals
                            will be correctly chanted.</note>The lessons described above were
                        designed to capitalize on children’s remarkable memories, imitative skills,
                        and their ability to pick up language quickly. Knox asserted that a boy
                        “habituated to the task [of memory work] will learn thirty or forty lines,
                        as an evening exercise, with great ease, and with apparent pleasure. This is
                        really done,” he said, “three or four nights in a week, in our best schools”
                        (99). Assisted by their natural sense of rhythm and the patterns of verse
                        that they were learning, many students easily memorized hundreds of lines of
                        Latin and Greek verse. Schoolmasters also appealed to youngsters’ natural
                        competitiveness when assigning memory work. Boy battles over who could
                        memorize the most lines were not uncommon. When Arnold studied at
                        Winchester, he was reputed to have memorized three thousand lines of Homer
                        (Clarke 54).<note place="foot" resp="author">The <title level="m">Iliad</title> is approximately 15,500 lines.</note>Coleridge’s
                        nephew Edward reports that when he was at Eton, he memorized and recited
                        nearly all of the satires of Juvenal, the whole of Euripides’ <title level="m">Alcestis</title>, and Aeschylus’s <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Vinctus</title> by heart. Charles Merivale, the grandson of Byron’s
                        headmaster at Harrow, memorized Virgil’s <title level="m">Eclogues</title>
                        and <title level="m">Georgics</title> and most of Catullus, Juvenal, and
                        Lucan.</p>
<p>Thomas Arnold, who was no friend of meaningless busy work, marveled at the
                        vigor of youthful memory and defended the schools’ use of memorization
                        exercises. George Chapman, the headmaster of the grammar school at Dumfries,
                        Scotland, commented that memorized texts make a deeper and more lasting
                        impression on students’ minds than texts that students simply read and put
                        aside. Knox said a boy is benefited by having a great number of words and
                        phrases “enforced upon the sensorium” and “laid up in the storehouse of his
                        memory” (101).<note place="foot" resp="author">So great was Knox’s
                            appreciation of memory work that he asserted rather dramatically that
                            “honour, spirit, [and] liberality, will be acquired, by committing to
                            memory the thoughts and words of heroes, and of worthies, who eminently
                            shone in every species of excellence” (102).</note>Coleridge comments
                        in the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title> on the wisdom of
                        “storing the memory, during the period when the memory is the predominant
                        faculty, with facts for the after exercise of the judgment” (Halmi 383). He
                        also credited memory exercises at school with awakening in him “the fond and
                        unmixed LOVE and ADMIRATION” of literature (Halmi 383). While a student at
                        Eton, Winthrop Mackworth Praed (1802–1839)<note place="foot" resp="author">Praed, who had a career in politics that was cut short by his early
                            death from tuberculosis, was one of the student founders of <title level="m">The Etonian</title>. At Trinity College, Cambridge, he was
                            the winner of multiple Greek and English poetry medals.</note>commented
                        in the student magazine that the effect of reading and memorizing classical
                        poetry, drama, and satire gave him a “copious and splendid command of
                        language” and an “ear tuned up . . . to the ‘noiseless music of the
                        spheres’” (<title level="m">The Etonian</title> 102). He also maintained
                        that the experience of memorizing great literature gave poets “prototypes”
                        to “impregnate with the living soul and breath of [their own] Imagination”
                        (102). Critics and, indeed, writers themselves may never be entirely sure of
                        the degree to which the content, language, or rhythms of any text are
                        original, recalled, or a mix of both; but understanding the degree to which
                        memory work was a part of the Romantics’ education should be useful to
                        scholars, particularly those interested in the composition process,
                        influence studies, or the trajectory of certain writer’s careers. For
                        example, Coleridge’s issues with plagiarism or Wordsworth’s valorization of
                        those “sublime” moments when memory helps a person “see into the life of
                        things” might be assessed in new ways in the light of this information.</p>
<p>As noted above, Romantic-era schoolboys were assigned compositions several
                        times every week. Along with their nonsense verses, students’ earliest
                        writing assignments were translations: first of the easy verses of Ovid, but
                        later of much more complicated classical and/or biblical texts in Latin and
                        Greek. Students were instructed to avoid word-for-word translations and,
                        instead, to express the sense, verbal register, and style of the original
                        text in idiomatic English. As a Rugby student explained, this was excellent
                        writing practice because it excused boys from having to come up with
                        original ideas but gave them practice constructing sentences or lines of
                        verse that demonstrated careful word choice, that were grammatically
                        correct, and that adhered to accepted literary conventions. Boys called upon
                        these translation exercises and their memory work as well as their fulsome
                        experience reading a variety of literary forms to complete their many
                        writing assignments.</p>
<p>In the 1790s a typical week of compositions for the fifth form at Rugby
                        included four themes, at least two of which would be Latin or Greek verses;
                        a translation in English from a text in one of these languages; and a piece
                        of verse or prose in English. Examples of the verse topics Thomas Arnold
                        assigned include: <title level="m">Porcia, Catonis Filia, Bruti Uxor</title>
                        (Portia, the daughter of Cato and wife of Brutus) and <title level="m">Africa, bonarum atrium nutrix, nunc barbarie premitur</title> (Africa,
                        once the nurse of benign skills, is now barbarically oppressed). His prose
                        theme assignments ranged from essays on miracles to realistic descriptions
                        of the state of affairs for residents of the continent in the summer of
                        1815. A typical week at Tonbridge Grammar School included assignments to
                        write a short ode in Greek, twenty lines of iambic pentameter, a letter home
                        in English, and a collection of Latin verse epigrams, each with a different
                        topic. The amount of daily and weekly practice Romantic period schoolboys
                        had using words, thinking about the meanings and sounds of words, and
                        composing various verse and prose forms is remarkable. By one calculation, a
                        boy who spent six years in boarding school might have translated as many as
                        six thousand lines of Latin or Greek prose and 4800 lines of Latin or Greek
                        verse. This youngster would have also written ninety prose essays and as
                        many as 4200 lines of verse (the equivalent of 300 sonnets).</p>
<p>Romantic-era educators’ defense of requiring so much verse composition took
                        several forms. Themes were assigned not only to ensure boys appreciated
                        quantities of Latin words “without knowledge of which [they] will not be
                        able to read Latin with propriety” (Knox 60), but also to make sure boys
                        learned to be precise and to waste no words. Edward Copleston, the Professor
                        of Poetry at Oxford, asserted in 1810 that educators did not give verse
                        assignments because they expected students to produce original verse, but
                        because “the poetic faculty exists to a certain degree in all minds and
                        should not lie uncultivated in any” (129). Moreover, writing verse teaches
                        the “habit of compression without obscurity, . . . of selecting the fittest
                        materials . . . setting them in the nicest order . . . and a command of
                        pure, terse, polished diction” (Copleston 131). Producing lines of
                        meaningful Latin in specified meters, teachers explained, helped to tune
                        students’ “ears to harmony” and to afford them “greater pleasure in reading
                        poetry” (Sergeant 31). In the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>,
                        Coleridge remarks that his contemporaries’ admirable ability to “translate .
                        . . prose thoughts into poetic language had been kept up by, if it did not
                        wholly arise from, the custom of writing Latin verses, and [by] the great
                        importance attached to these exercises in our public schools” (388).</p>
<p>Not a few public and grammar school students, including Wordsworth, Byron,
                        and Percy Shelley, began writing and publishing English verse while in
                        school, and several recognized their calling as poets at school. In the
                            <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>, Coleridge says that he
                        learned from his headmaster, James Boyer, that no word, “phrase, metaphor,
                        or image [in a poem should be] unsupported by a sound sense,” and that
                        “plainer words,” which can impart the same sense with “force and dignity,” are
                        to be preferred (381).<note place="foot" resp="author">Coleridge recalls
                            his headmaster exclaiming “Harp? Harp? Lyre? Pen and ink, boy, you mean!
                            Muse, boy, Muse? Your nurses’ daughter, you mean!” (381).</note>In Book
                        Fifth of the 1805 <title level="m">Prelude</title>, Wordsworth describes the
                        “deep joy” he received while a student at Hawkshead when he encountered “the
                        mystery of words” in the works of the “mighty [classical] poets” and how
                        they worked “their changes” (V.617, 621, 619, 623). Wordsworth notes as
                        well that he came to understand then how poetry works, and that “forms and
                        substances are circumfused” not only by “light divine,” but also “through
                        the turnings intricate of verse” (V.625–27).</p>
<p>Among the books used to help Romantic period students with their study and
                        writing of poetry was John Newbery’s <title level="m">Poetry Made Familiar
                            and Easy</title> (1776). Newbery asserts that “Poetry’s task, since the
                        earliest Ages of the World,” is to “celebrate the Praises of the GREAT
                        AUTHOR of the Universe” (ii). Its whole aim and intention are “to
                            <emph>please</emph> and to instruct” by borrowing from “Nature every
                        thing that is gay and delightful” and adorning its “Diction with Number and
                        Harmony,” and by employing “the <emph>Marvellous</emph> and
                            <emph>Pathetic</emph> in their proper Places” (v–vi). Newbery defines
                        the “true Poet” as one who is 
                        
                        <quote> distinguished by a fruitfulness of
                            Invention, a lively Imagination tempered by solid judgment, and
                            Nobleness of Sentiments and Ideas, and bold, lofty, and figurative
                            Manner of Expression. He thoroughly understands the Nature of his
                            Subject; and [regardless of the length of his poem], he forms a Design
                            or Plan, by which every Verse is directed to a certain End, and each has
                            a just Dependance on the other. (8) 
                        </quote> 
                        Examples of instruction
                        such as this suggest that some of the Romantics’ most famous statements
                        about poetry, the poet, his imagination, and his embrace of the natural
                        world were not as original to them as scholars have assumed.</p>
<p>So how might modern teaching scholars use this information about how the
                        Romantics’ classical education endeavored to raise young men with “A copious
                        and splendid command of language and an ear tuned to the ‘noiseless music of
                        the spheres’” (<title level="m">The Etonian</title> 102)? For starters, we
                        would do well to redouble our efforts to train students in close reading, to
                        remind them to attend to word choice (including the etymology of key words),
                        and to metrical matters in Romantic verse. New source and influence studies,
                        particularly ones that examine Greek and Latin pastoral verse and the
                        religious texts students read, including the <title level="m">Book of Common
                            Prayer</title>, are also indicated. In the spirit of this issue of
                            <title level="j">Romantic Circles Pedagogies Commons</title>, I offer
                        the following categories and proposed class assignments or research
                        projects, which range from close reading to thematic studies. When I assign
                        the projects suggested below, I begin with a lecture on how the Romantics
                        were trained, using the information explained above, and discussion on the
                        importance of understanding the contexts and constraints under which writers
                        labored. I also remind students that many in the Romantic audience possessed
                        similar literary and linguistic knowledge. These assignments will, of
                        course, require some revision based upon local curricula and individual
                        professors’ teaching plans and their style of assignment-writing. </p>

<head>Etymology Exercises</head>
<p>I suggest that professors begin by explaining that educated Romantics were
                            trained in the classical languages from which English evolved. Students
                            could recognize if a word were derived from Latin, Greek, German, Old or
                            Middle English, then follow this plan:</p>
<p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">
<hi rend="bold">Step 1:</hi> Working in pairs, ask students to select a
                            passage from an early poem by Wordsworth, such as the first ten lines of
                                <title level="a">An Evening Walk,</title> which describe the
                            countryside of the English Lake District. Then ask them to look up the
                            etymology of the key words in these lines in the <title level="m">Oxford
                                English Dictionary</title>. (They are almost all from Old or Middle
                            English, not Latin. In my view, this is no accident.) Ask each pair of
                            students to discuss these word choices and then to present their
                            findings to the class.</p>
<p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">
<hi rend="bold">Step 2:</hi> Ask students to do the same etymological
                            work with a much later work that focuses upon another place, such as one
                            of the poems about Rome in <title level="a">Memorials of A Tour in
                                Italy, 1837.</title> The question for discussion might be, What
                            differences in word choice do you notice?</p>
<p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">
<hi rend="bold">Step 3:</hi> Ask students to compare word choice in a
                            series of lyrics by classically educated poets and those who were not,
                            such as Charlotte Smith and John Clare, to see what meaningful patterns
                            emerge. </p>

<head>Prosody Exercises</head>
<p>A lesson on Romantic prosody should begin with an explanation of how
                                students were trained to recognize the music of language, the
                                quantities of syllables, and conventional metrical requirements of
                                particular verse forms. Then students should be reminded that
                                students wrote verse every week, and this exercise ensured that they
                                both understood meter and had learned to use it skillfully. Ask your
                                students, out of respect for this tradition, to start paying more
                                attention to the Romantics’ metrical efforts. Then I suggest the
                                following series of assignments:</p>
<p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">
<hi rend="bold">Step 1.</hi> Begin this series of exercises with a
                                lesson about prosody that reviews the different feet, the line
                                lengths, the notion of metrical contracts, and the purposes of
                                metrical variation. Some of this will be quite foreign and confusing
                                to students. If this goes well, add a brief survey of the metrical
                                conventions of the genres that the Romantics knew well, such as the
                                epic, the pastoral, the ode, and the heroic couplet. Good sources
                                for these matters are Paul Fussell’s <title level="m">Poetic Meter

<hi rend="bold">Step 2.</hi> Follow these lessons with a close
                                metrical analysis of an easy, regular poem, such as Wordsworth’s
                                    <title level="a">I wandered lonely as a cloud</title>; it is
                                very regular iambic tetrameter until line 6, where the first
                                significant variation occurs: “<emph>Flut</emph>’ring and
                                    <emph>danc</emph>ing in the breeze,”  a move that emphasizes 
                                the liveliness of the daffodils (De Selincourt 149).</p>
<p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">
<hi rend="bold">Step 3.</hi> Next try the same exercise on
                                Wordsworth’s <title level="a">We Are Seven</title>; it uses
                                alternating lines of tetrameter and trimeter, but the pattern is not
                                clear until stanza three. I suggest that you acknowledge this and
                                then ask students to start their scanning practice with stanza
                                three, noting where and how Wordsworth varies the meter elsewhere in
                                the poem. Then ask students why Wordsworth might have chosen to
                                    <emph>begin</emph> the poem with stanzas that vary the metrical
                                pattern that he later uses throughout most of the rest of his
                                poem.</p>
<p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">
<hi rend="bold">Step 4.</hi> If this exercise goes well, challenge
                                students to have a go at a passage from <title level="a">Tintern
                                    Abbey</title> in De Selincourt’s <title level="m">Poeticial
                                    Works</title>. I suggest starting in stanza four in the middle
                                of line 88 at “For I have learned / To look on nature, not as in the
                                hour / Of thoughtless youth,” and stopping at the end of the stanza
                                with these words: “the nurse / The guide, the guardian of my
                                heart, and soul / Of all my moral being” (De Selincourt, lines
                                109–10). I ask them to look for the lines that are pure iambic
                                pentameter versus the ones where Wordsworth varies the accents. The
                                question, again, is as follows: What is accomplished by the metrical
                                variations? </p>
<p rend="noCount">For students wishing to pursue the subject of meter in English poetry
                                further, you might suggest that they read Meredith Martin’s <title level="m">The Rise and Fall of Meter: Poetry and English
                                    National Culture, 1860–1930</title>. Though the period she
                                focuses upon is later, her discussion of how meter offers insight
                                into issues such as class, identity (both personal and national),
                                and patriotism is compelling.</p>

<div type="section">
<head>Form Study</head>
<p>A third possible close reading exercise, once students have
                                    reviewed classical forms such as the ode or georgics and the
                                    English sonnet tradition, challenges students to examine the
                                    Romantics’ management of literary forms and conventions. Even
                                    though sonnets are not a classical form, I include them because
                                    trying to do this exercise with longer poems is
                                    hard for some undergraduates. Any of the odes by Wordsworth,
                                    Coleridge, and Keats as well as well-known pastoral verses or
                                    georgics of the period that students might select themselves are
                                    good for such work. I also suggest asking students to compare
                                    sonnets by several Romantics, at least two of whom were not
                                    classically trained. Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Prefatory
                                        Sonnet</title> (it serves a double purpose of introducing
                                    the form with its tight structure and of representing
                                    Wordsworth’s style), Coleridge’s <title level="a">Work Without
                                        Hope,</title> Keats’ <title level="a">On First Looking into
                                        Chapman’s Homer,</title> Byron’s <title level="a">Sonnet on
                                        Chillon,</title> Shelley’s <title level="a">Lift not the
                                        painted veil,</title> and Charlotte Smith’s <title level="a">To Night</title> all work well. I invite the class to
                                    compare each poet’s handling of structure and metrics and to
                                    discuss how these contribute to the impact and fluidity of the
                                    lines. The question for discussion is as follows: Are the poems
                                    by classically trained poets noticeably different? When students
                                    find differences, I challenge them to rank the effectiveness of
                                    each poet’s aesthetic and formal choices and to explain their
                                    rationale for their ranking.</p>

<head>More Advanced Formal Study for Graduate Students or Those
                                        with a Background in Latin or Greek</head>
<p>A graduate student with a classical background might be
                                        encouraged to undertake comparative study of odes by Pindar
                                        and Coleridge for an article or thesis. I have not tried
                                        this yet, but I yearn to challenge graduate students to
                                        select examples of one of the victory odes (<foreign xml:lang="la">epinikia</foreign>) of Pindar, which, as
                                        Rutherford aptly notes, are “highly poetic, full of
                                        compounds, unusual words, and florid metaphors” and which
                                        discourse on the theme of “ambition for fame in spite of
                                        risk” (178–79). The tasks would be for students to map
                                        those compounds, odd words, and metaphors, and then to
                                        compare Byron’s use of compounds, odd words, and metaphors
                                        in one of the cantos of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s
                                            Pilgrimage</title>. A similarly classic-focused exercise
                                        would be to introduce senior majors in a Wordsworth seminar
                                        to Clancey’s book about Wordsworth’s classical training,
                                            <title level="m">Wordsworth's Classical Undersong:

                                        students to compare one of the passages from Horace (in

                                        the work, have students read Clancey’s discussion of the
                                        same texts and see if they have been able to replicate any

<head>Rehearsals of Romantic Pedagogy</head>
<p>After reviewing the information about the Romantics’
                                            education above, it could be particularly eye-opening
                                            for modern students to be invited to study texts the way
                                            the Romantics did. This project might involve the
                                            following sequence:</p>
<p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">
<hi rend="bold">Step 1.</hi> Remind the class what the Rugby student, quoted
                                            above, said about the value of translation work and then
                                            ask them to “translate” several short verse texts by the
                                            Romantics into prose. This would work well with
                                            Coleridge’s <title level="a">Kubla Khan</title> or with
                                            some of the confusing stanzas in <title level="a">The
                                                Rime of the Ancient Mariner.</title> Shelley’s and
                                            Keats’s sonnets, because they are shorter, would work for
                                            this exercise as well.</p>
<p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">
<hi rend="bold">Step 2.</hi> Have students select a Romantic poet they admire and
                                            three or four of his or her poems. Ask them to read each
                                            text closely—checking the etymology of key words,
                                            parsing the grammar, translating the poems into prose,
                                            memorizing at least one of the poems, and drawing
                                            conclusions about the poet, the poems, and the
                                            experience of studying them this way. This exercise
                                            could be expanded into a term project, in which students
                                            select more poems and prepare a class presentation,
                                            starting with a recitation of a representative poem. </p>

                                            compose lines of verse for two classes each week; on the
                                            third day of the week discuss the experience and what it

                                                  to find at least three Romantic poems that discuss
                                                  themes such as sin and/or forgiveness. Challenge
                                                  them to find the psalms and gospel texts that
                                                  treat these themes and then compare language and

                                                  texts, but all can help modern students gain fresh
                                                  insights into the lives and work of the Romantics
                                                  and into their own learning and writing
                                                  experiences. Asking our students to write as often
                                                  for class as the Romantic schoolboys did will
                                                  teach them what a difference practice and revision
                                                  can make in their own compositions. Knowing what
                                                  Romantic schoolboys and college students were
                                                  trained to do with words and literary forms and
                                                  how central linguistic and metrical issues were to
                                                  those students’ early experience with literature
                                                  will support modern professors’ requests that
                                                  their students pay greater attention to close
                                                  reading, word choice, and meter. This information
                                                  also underscores how important it is, in general,
                                                  to consider texts in their historical context.
                                                  Knowing how intensively and carefully many of the
                                                  Romantic writers worked on poetry as schoolboys
                                                  helps modern students to appreciate why Wordsworth
                                                  claimed to have “acquired a greater readiness and
                                                  power in expressing what he thinks and feels”
                                                  because he had learned that the situation of an
                                                  accomplished poet “is altogether slavish and
                                                  mechanical” (Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical
                                                  Ballads</title> in De Selincourt 734–41). These
                                                  circumstances also explain why Wordsworth claimed
                                                  to have a “sublime notion of poetry” (738).
                                                  Finally, the story of the Anglo-classical
                                                  tradition in Romantic-era schools and colleges may
                                                  even make some modern students jealous of the
                                                  Romantics’ richly stocked memories and sensoria
                                                  and inspire them to study classical languages. </p>

<p rend="noCount">This essay is the result of a collaboration between Rachel Feder and eight 
                    undergraduate students as part of a senior seminar on Jane Austen taught by Feder at the 
                    University of Denver.</p>
<div type="section">
<head>Preface</head>
<p>After hearing a recent conference presentation in which I discussed my
                        interest in the connections between Jane Austen and questions of what we
                        might now call reproductive justice, a senior scholar in the field shared
                        with me an interesting piece of gossip: that there exists, or once existed,
                        a family that claims to be descended from the illegitimate child of Jane
                        Austen’s sister and best friend, Cassandra. As the story goes, Cassandra
                        Austen conceived this child with her fiancé, who died. Of course, the
                        scholar impressed upon me, there would be no way to prove or disprove the
                        efficacy of this claim. But so what? In recent years, I have become
                        interested in the critical and pedagogical potentials of speculation,
                        indeed, in speculation as a form of feminist praxis. In my book <title level="m">Harvester of Hearts: Motherhood under the Sign of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
</title>, I consider some of the
                        things that an adherence to argument as the gold standard of literary
                        criticism keeps us from saying—about the connections between life and work,
                        for example, or the entanglements of intellectual and bodily history, or
                        things that might have happened, but we cannot know for sure. In the
                        classroom, I offer my students low-stakes, hybrid, creative, and other
                        non-thesis-driven writing assignments that encourage them to move beyond
                        what they can prove to uncover truly experimental interpretations. I do this
                        because I am interested in what Romantic era literature can help students
                        understand about their own lives and worlds, and because these kinds of
                        trans-historical applications often derive from provocations and
                        possibilities, not only from thesis-driven, close reading–supported analyses
                        (of course, we learn to craft those, too).</p>
<p>During a question and answer session at the 2018 meeting of the North
                        American Society for the Study of Romanticism, Deidre Lynch claimed that
                        “Austen is way more gothic than we have been told,” to which Sonia Hofkosh
                        replied, “It’s fantasy fiction!” In the popular imagination, Austen’s novels
                        are not just fantasy fiction in the sense of the augmented, perhaps
                        idealized, reality they describe, but also in the extent to which Austen’s
                        texts inspire personal and communal fantasies. If speculative, fan-fictional
                        reading is a common mode of engagement with the novels, then what is its
                        place in the literary studies classroom? Put another way, what might the
                        modes and methods of literary criticism keep us from saying about Jane
                        Austen’s novels, and what might we gain by saying those things—both in
                        class, and in print?</p>
<p>What follows is a collaborative, speculative close reading of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> that interprets Marianne’s
                        illness as an illegitimate pregnancy that terminates in either a
                        premeditated abortion (sense) or a somatic miscarriage (sensibility). This
                        reading emerges from a free-flowing class discussion among eight
                        undergraduate students—students that I encouraged, from go, to get to know
                        one another as full people and to bring their own lives, concerns,
                        histories, and preoccupations to bear on course materials—and me. By tracing
                        this provocative possibility through the novel, our group demonstrates the
                        pedagogical potentials of speculation. We cannot assert that this is the
                            <emph>true</emph> or <emph>right</emph> reading of the text, just like
                        we can never know whether Cassandra Austen bore a child out of wedlock. But
                        by lingering on the possibility of secrecy and coded meaning and by thinking
                        through the social, political, and trans-historical implications of this
                        fantasy, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of Marianne’s universe,
                        a universe in which the stakes of sexuality are higher for her than for her
                        male counterparts and in which her choices—and lack of choices—may be, in
                        Lynch’s words, “way more Gothic than we have been told.” Indeed, our
                        experimental reading—the kind of reading that can emerge in the low-stakes
                        environment of the student-centered, discussion-based classroom—reveals the
                        darker potentialities hidden within the folds of Marianne’s dress, a fragile
                        relationship to maternity haunting our lovesick heroine. For the eight
                        undergraduate students in my seminar—and for me—this possibility acted as a
                        sort of time machine transporting <title level="m">Sense and
                            Sensibility</title> into our contemporary sociopolitical moment. </p>

<head>Miscarrying the Marriage Plot</head>
<p>What if we read Marianne’s despair following Willoughby’s desertion not as
                        naïve passion but as a physical experience of loss? This collaborative essay
                        grew out of an undergraduate seminar in which we discussed the darker
                        shadows and edges of Jane Austen’s fiction: realism that is really gothic;
                        sex scenes that are not sex scenes; resolutions that are really
                        condemnations. Our in-class discussion of <title level="m">Sense and
                            Sensibility</title> led us to develop a shared, speculative reading of
                        the novel in which Marianne becomes pregnant by Willoughby and miscarries
                        his child, whether this miscarriage represents a spontaneous abortion, a
                        deliberately induced abortion, and/or a psychosomatic response in
                        miscarriage to the emotional trauma of losing her first love.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Focusing on the Victorian period, Doreen
                            Theiruf argues that medical professionals “sometimes conflated
                            contraception, miscarriage, and abortion because they were ignorant
                            about the physiological processes in question, or because they wished to
                            avoid the dissemination of dangerously potent information. Since
                            abortion in the nineteenth century was neither widely debated nor
                            circulated in the press before the very end of the period, its presence
                            remains dubious and its principles nebulous” (480).</note>
</p>
<p>Read in light of a potential miscarriage, Marianne presents a young woman
                        experiencing intense trauma. Her claim, at the novel’s end, that “My
                        illness . . . had been entirely brought on by myself, by such negligence of my
                        own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong” can be read as
                        remorse following a physical, rather than emotional, transgression (Austen
                        350). When Marianne goes on to admit, “Had I died—, it would have been
                        self-destruction,” her claim resonates with eighteenth-century fictional
                        treatments of abortion such as Jemima’s experience in Wollstonecraft’s
                            <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</title> (Austen 350). In
                        that unfinished text, Jemima first regards an offered “phial” of
                        abortifacient with the thought that “it was killing myself,” a description
                        that encapsulates both her youthful confusion and the extent to which she
                        identifies with her fetus as “ever called a bastard, a bastard appeared to
                        me an object of the greatest compassion in creation.” When she
                        finally decides to “procure abortion,” Jemima “swallow[s] it, with a wish
                        that it might destroy me, at the same time” (Wollstonecraft 194–95). What might we learn
                        if, for the duration of this essay, we let go of our attachments to standard
                        readings of Marianne Dashwood and instead give Austen credit for the
                        darkness that we have come to expect from Wollstonecraft? What if we add to
                        that binary—sense vs. sensibility—the question of embodiment? In this
                        article, we will hazard this provocative interpretation in order to rethink
                        the lessons implied by Marianne’s marriage plot. </p>

<head>I. Marginal Intimacy</head>
<p>The whirlwind romance between Marianne and Willoughby, celebrated by her
                        mother and judged indiscreet by her sister, culminates in an unchaperoned
                        visit to the estate of Willoughby’s aunt. There, Marianne and Willoughby
                        consummate their relationship. Austen does not describe the sexual nature of
                        their short-lived relationship beyond winks and euphemisms. “Bound by
                        pre-Victorian limitations of subject matter which had already turned sex
                        into a topic for covert implication rather than overt description,” Austen
                        asks readers to draw on clues such as the courtship narrative, the language
                        surrounding that clandestine meeting, and the comparison to fallen Eliza in
                        order to confirm the sexual nature of the excursion (Chandler 89). Marianne
                        embodies unbridled and rebellious teenage sexuality, while Willoughby is all
                        too willing to play into her love fantasy. </p>
<p>Just prior to Marianne’s fateful carriage ride, she gifts Willoughby a lock
                        of her hair, and he promises her a horse. Marianne’s sister, Margaret,
                        recounts the gift-giving scene, describing it to Elinor as follows:
                            <quote>[Willoughby] seemed to be begging something of [Marianne], and
                            presently he took up her scissars and cut off a long lock of her hair,
                            for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up
                            in a piece of white paper, and put it into his pocket-book. (Austen 94)</quote>
                        Margaret’s recounting of the scene portrays it as a moment of loaded
                        negotiation. Marianne is enamored with Willoughby; yet, he still has to
                        plead with her to give him a piece of her hair. The words that Austen
                        intertwines within this scene—“whispering,” “begging,” “kissed”—indicate
                        that the gifting of hair is more than a sentimental gesture (94). These
                        words imply a vow of silence or secrecy surrounding the act. There is also a
                        forceful nature to the scene—Willoughby literally <emph>takes</emph> a piece
                        of Marianne’s body for his own. Jill Heydt-Stevenson argues that the
                        “exchange of hair between Willoughby and Marianne also doubles as physical
                        colloquy between bodies” and points out that Austen uses the word
                        “tumbling . . . to denote sexual intercourse” (Heydt-Stevenson 36, 15). Marianne’s
                        hair tumbles down her back with abandon; Willoughby presses the cutting to
                        his lips before folding it in a piece of pure, white paper and taking it for
                        himself. Later in the novel, after Willoughby has informed Marianne that his
                        affections had “been long engaged elsewhere,” Marianne demands the hair back
                        (Austen 205). But the hair has already been cut, and Austen coyly suggests
                        that Marianne has given Willoughby something she cannot take back. </p>

<p>While Willoughby procures hair from Marianne, he also offers to give her
                        something: a horse named Queen Mab, which Marianne accepts and then must
                        refuse for the sake of prudence. This seems on the surface to be just another
                        example of her impulsiveness and propensity to say yes when it comes to
                        Willoughby. However, this horse is not just a horse. As Elinor and Marianne
                        walk alongside each other, Marianne describes Willoughby’s gift as “a horse,
                        one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was
                        exactly calculated to carry a woman” (Austen 93). Confer Shakespeare’s
                            <title level="m">Romeo and Juliet</title>: “This is the hag, when maids
                        lie on their backs, / That presses them and learns them first to bear”
                        (1.4.93–94). Queen Mab can be understood as a fabled being that teaches
                        women to bear both penetrative sex and the children that result from it.
                        Queen Mab is the gift that hangs between Marianne and Willoughby,
                        foreshadowing that although Marianne is open to sex with Willoughby, she
                        will ultimately be unable, or unwilling, to bear her pregnancy.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Jill Heydt-Stevenson surveys different
                            interpretations of this allusion in order to argue that “the nexus of
                            associations, erotic and ideological, surrounding both the Shakespearean
                            and the colloquial ‘Mab,’ coalesce in this moment as Willoughby’s covert
                            marriage proposal doubles as a prophesy of her ruined terminus: like the
                            first Eliza, dead from suffering and illness and like the second Eliza
                            (or Maria in <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, for that matter),
                            who spins out her life isolated in a country cottage”
                        (58–60).</note>
</p>
<p>Sexual excitement surrounds the pair. The immediate agreeability between them
                        stems from their mutual openness of thought and speech. They giggle about
                        everyone and everything around them. When Elinor begins to suspect
                        Willoughby’s outright desertion of Marianne, Mrs. Dashwood counters,
                        “Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been
                        attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved” (Austen 113). Except
                        there has been secrecy, whether or not Mrs. Dashwood chooses to see it. When
                        the family left in one carriage, and Marianne and Willoughby in another,
                        “nothing more of them was seen till their return.” At Mrs.
                        Jennings’s smug insistence that she knows where they have been, Marianne
                        feigns ignorance, asking, “Where, pray?” while Willoughby jumps to say that
                        they have been in his carriage, obviously (110). Their deception,
                        albeit a weak attempt, does more to suggest sexual impropriety than anything
                        else. Though doing so may not be her intention, Mrs. Dashwood confirms the
                        seriousness of the incident by condemning secrecy. </p>
<p>After giving up the lie, Marianne confides in Elinor about her visit to
                        Willoughby’s prospective estate. She exclaims, “I never spent a pleasanter
                        morning in my life”; this is the closest she comes to describing their
                        sexual encounter (Austen 102). Her official story is that Willoughby,
                        without even the attendance of his aunt, showed her all the rooms of the
                        house. Of course, “the implication is clear that the couple had been
                        examining the bedrooms also” (Cornog and Perper 162). Marianne’s unbridled
                        passion and proud contrarianism toward courtship etiquette at the outset of
                        the novel make plausible an implied sex scene. </p>
<p>At this point in the novel, Willoughby has already had a tryst with Colonel
                        Brandon’s ward, Eliza. People speculate that she has fallen ill, much like
                        Marianne will; she gives birth to an illegitimate child in secrecy and
                        shame. Willoughby, finally attempting to explain this indiscretion to
                        Elinor, describes “the violence of her passions, the weakness of her
                        understanding,” oscillating between hollow self-chastisement and blaming
                        Eliza (Austen 329). He convinces skeptical Elinor to feel pity for him,
                        though it is he who had sex out of wedlock, conceived with Eliza, and
                        refused to marry her. (If, at this point, he has indeed lost a child by
                        Marianne, and if Elinor somehow knows about this, then this might help
                        explain Elinor’s feeling of pity, as well.) Even as he attempts to distance
                        the two women intellectually, he draws exacting similarities. Marianne acts
                        on him while his only fault is letting her. Willoughby reflects on “giving
                        way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging”
                        with Marianne (327). This language, in combination with his remarks
                        about Marianne’s own “deep regret,” suggests cause for remorse that goes
                        beyond leading her on in words alone (Austen 331). Eliza’s demise alerts the
                        reader to an alternate potentiality for Marianne in her imprudent
                        interactions with Willoughby. Mrs. Jennings compares Marianne’s particular
                        suffering with the youthful crushes that came and went among her own
                        daughters: “as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature,” unable
                        to recover with adolescent resiliency (205). She is altered; having
                        lost her virginity and having been impregnated by the obviously virile
                        Willoughby, Marianne’s future could look a lot like Eliza’s. </p>
<p> Pregnancy out of wedlock, in the world of the novel, is a direct route to
                        social rejection and a defiled reputation. Eliza, daughter of Colonel
                        Brandon’s first love, Elizabeth Williams, is seduced by Willoughby’s
                        flirtations and promises of marriage, and impregnated by him at the age of
                        15. “[Willoughby] had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had
                        seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no
                        help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He had left her promising to
                        return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her” (Austen 228).
                        Marianne and Willoughby’s relationship directly parallels Eliza’s case.
                        Colonel Brandon himself compares the two, saying, “your sister, I hope,
                        cannot be offended . . . by the resemblance I have fancied between her and
                        my poor disgraced relation” (227). Given the potential social
                        consequences, it comes as no surprise that Marianne, an impressionable
                        embodiment of “sensibility,” keeps her precarious situation a secret from
                        everyone, including her family. In keeping this secret, she sometimes
                        appears to be hysterical, a historically diagnosable illness that, Carroll
                        Smith-Rosenberg contends, “can be seen as an alternate role option for
                        particular women incapable of accepting their life situation” (655).<note place="foot" resp="author"> While Smith-Rosenberg writes about the
                            nineteenth-century American context, her pithy description of hysteria
                            resonates with Marianne’s impossible position. See also Eve Kosofky

</p>
<p>Read through the lens of a possible pregnancy, what the other characters in
                        the novel may understand to be young love, heartbreak, and hysteria emerges
                        as a much more complicated and potentially damning experience. Marianne’s
                        desperation to get in touch with Willoughby after he avoids and rejects her
                        in public is divulged in her frenzied appeal to Elinor to force Willoughby
                        to talk to her. Her language in this passage is not that of a scorned lover,
                        but rather of someone whose entire future is on the line. She pleads that
                        she “must see him again—must speak to him instantly.—I cannot rest—I shall
                        not have a moment’s peace till this is explained—some dreadful
                        misapprehension or other.—Oh go to him this moment” (Austen 200). The
                        chapter ends with Marianne leaving a party because of her grief. Her actions
                        in the time that follows—hiding in her room for weeks on end, walking
                        through the rain, running away and hiding herself from the people she is
                        closest with—can be understood as hysteria or as a radical act of social
                            self-preservation.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For example, upon
                            guests’ arrival, “Marianne had left the room…”; Elinor claims that
                            Marianne “has been very much plagued lately with nervous headaches,
                            which make her unfit for company or conversation” (Austen 186,
                            237).</note>
</p>
<p>Although Marianne and Elinor have a close, sisterly relationship, there are
                        several moments in the novel when Elinor is seen discussing her sister’s
                        secrets with those who are known to gossip, such as Mrs. Jennings. Perhaps
                        most striking is the moment when Elinor defends Willoughby, saying, “he has
                        broken no positive engagement with my sister.” Mrs. Jennings is
                        shocked by this and goes on to discuss the evidence that Marianne and
                        Willoughby were engaged, saying, “No positive engagement indeed! after
                        taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they were
                        to live in hereafter!” (Austen 217). While this evidence points to a
                        potential engagement between Marianne and Willoughby, it also reinforces the
                        possibility that something improper, something that could only be rectified
                        through marriage, happened in Allenham house.</p>

<head>II. Removing the Infant </head>
<p>After leaving London with her sister and Mrs. Jennings, Marianne arrives at
                        the Palmers’ house at Cleveland feeling partly renewed but mostly devastated
                        at the incurred distance between herself and Willoughby, the father of her
                        secret, unborn child. Here, she isolates herself from any company and only
                        takes solace in walking alone around the property, despite the dangers of
                        the temperamental climate. A short time into her stay, Marianne becomes
                        dangerously ill, which leads to the sublimated denouement of the miscarriage
                        as her illness here is used to mask the scene of her failed delivery. </p>
<p>After Marianne’s health worsens despite the household’s initial expectations,
                        an apothecary is called in to consult. The Palmers’ apothecary, Mr. Harris,
                        who does not believe that Marianne is gravely ill, allows the word
                        “infection” to pass his lips, which “g[ives] instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,
                        on her baby’s account,” and causes Mrs. Jennings to then urge the “immediate
                        removal” of the infant (Austen 316). By positioning concern for infant
                        safety and mortality so close to the discussion of Marianne’s ailment,
                        Austen insinuates a direct connection between the two. The mortal threat in
                        question is not to Mrs. Palmer’s baby, but to Marianne’s fetus. The explicit
                        departure of a baby from the house stands in as a socially acceptable
                        substitution, a plot device that mirrors the parallel departure of an unborn
                        child behind closed doors.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Furthermore, in
                            his reading of Marianne as harboring an infantile attachment to Mrs.
                            Dashwood, John Wiltshire points out that Marianne’s illness is
                            characterized by “identification with the mother” whose safe arrival at
                            her daughter’s side signals the end of the episode (<title level="a">Jane Austen and the Body</title> 49).</note>
</p>
<p>Mr. Harris’s incongruent evaluation of the gravity of Marianne’s illness to
                        the rest of the party also suggests that he may have some understanding of
                        the true nature of the situation. The use of the term “infection” within the
                        context of Marianne’s misery is interesting, because it positions the fetus
                        as an unwanted, reviled threat to both Marianne’s physical wellbeing and her
                        standing in society. John Wiltshire argues: “Austen is interested in
                        illnesses’ cultural aspects, in the patient’s use of the body for social
                        advantage. . . . At the same time, the novels also understand how social
                        conditions register themselves in the body, especially in the bodies of
                        women” (<title level="a">Medicine, illness and disease</title> 306). In this
                        case, Marianne is an example of how social conditions registered in the body
                        can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Premarital sex
                        threatens not only the social body, but also the body proper. Austen, when
                        writing <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, was cognizant of the
                        idea of somatization, which suggests that the miscarriage could have been
                        reactionary to Marianne’s devastation. Furthermore, in her thesis on Austen
                        and illness, Pamela Kirkpatrick argues that “Austen shows, through many of her
                        female characters, that the concept of somatic illness . . . is much more
                        complicated than the naïve idea of ailments which are ‘all in the head’”
                        (4).</p>
<p> In addition to the evidence that her loss could be somatic, there is also
                        the suggestion that Marianne actively induces fetal abortion. When she first
                        falls ill after roaming the property in the pouring rain, the narrator notes
                        that the development of her sickness was “assisted by the still greater
                        imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings” (Austen 314). This
                        suggests that Marianne might have acted, at least in part, in a way that
                        contributed to her miscarriage. Furthermore, it is possible to read Mr.
                        Harris as complicit in an abortion. From the onset of Marianne’s illness,
                        “prescriptions poured in from all quarters” (315). Kirkpatrick explains
                        that, during the period, apothecaries provided most routine health care to
                        citizens and that “apothecaries often supplied diagnostic services in
                        addition to prescriptions, and many of them recognized the importance of
                        addressing the patient’s emotional and social needs as well as the physical”
                        (2). It would be impossible for Mr. Harris to be unaware of the massive
                        social ramifications of an unwanted pregnancy, and so helping Marianne both
                        induce and conceal a miscarriage might align with this consideration for
                        patients’ social and physical needs, despite the fact that it was illegal in
                        England, after 1803, to give a woman any substance that might procure an
                        abortion. We must thus decide whether to read Mr. Harris as a stock
                        character or as a radical activist.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>III. Miscarrying the Marriage Plot</head>
<p>If we read Marianne as conceiving Willoughby’s child and then losing or
                        terminating the pregnancy, what does this mean for the marriage plot? We
                        commonly read Jane Austen’s novels as reinforcing social mores through
                        optimistic endings centered on marriage. In these happy endings, the novels
                        reaffirm the reader’s “hope of a personal reward for good social behavior
                        and their faith that public progress promise[s] the stability and continuity
                        of their way of life” (Magee 198). In <title level="m">Sense and
                            Sensibility</title>, the sisters share the goal of being safely
                        conducted into the arms of respectable and wealthy gentlemen and then
                        marrying them. Within this framework, on a surface level, Austen uses her
                        two heroines to discuss passion and romance by contrasting each heroine’s
                        expression of sensibility. In contrast to her reserved, sensible sister,
                        Marianne is consumed by passion and desire for the romance of marriage,
                        which carries her directly into Willoughby’s arms. After this dalliance with
                        a rake and the ambiguous sorrow and sickness that follows, Marianne is
                        redeemed through the proposal of Colonel Brandon, an older man, of a good
                        reputation, financially stable, and, above all, pure in his love for
                        Marianne, which endures even the problems caused by Willoughby. </p>
<p>Beyond forsaking Willoughby in favor of the better match, Marianne undergoes
                        a miraculous conversion as she “discover[s] the falsehood of her own
                        opinions” and grows in fondness toward Colonel Brandon, whom she originally
                        thought was too old for her to marry (Austen 379). She chooses a man that
                        has very little sex appeal, a move that stands in stark contrast to previous
                        choices she has made, and embarks on a relationship that is not first love.
                        This change is celebrated as an innate part of Marianne’s intrinsic purity
                        and moral goodness, which lies even below the “sins” of her actions with
                        Willoughby. Marianne can only accomplish this change because she “was born
                        to an extraordinary fate” which blessed her with the ability to “counteract,
                        by her conduct, her most favorite maxims” of the value of passionate
                        sensibility; in turn, she stands against “falling a sacrifice to an
                        irresistible passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with
                        expecting” (380).<note place="foot" resp="author"> There might be coded
                            irony in the repetition of the word born, here: “Marianne Dashwood was
                            born to an extraordinary fate. She was <emph>born</emph> to discover”
                            (Austen 379, emphasis added). Marianne has borne her own redemption,
                            rather than a child.</note> Marianne, through this redemption, becomes a
                        woman who never fell a sacrifice at all. Her indiscretions are absolved. As
                        compensation for this moral restoration, Marianne is rewarded through the
                        marriage plot with marriage, love, fiscal stability, and power, as she
                        “found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new
                        duties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the
                        patroness of a village” (380). Marianne goes from a damaged woman to a woman
                        superior in life station, power, and wealth in comparison to her
                        contemporaries.</p>
<p>But when we introduce a lost or terminated pregnancy into this equation, we
                        see that this happy ending depends, not only on sense and sensibility, but
                        also, and perhaps more foundationally, on the body. Should Marianne have
                        carried Willoughby’s baby to term, she would have been as doomed as Eliza.
                        Colonel Brandon acknowledges the sharp distinction: <quote>Whatever they may
                            have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless
                                <emph>will</emph> turn with gratitude towards her own condition,
                            when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the
                            wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to
                            herself, with an affection for him as strong, still as strong as her
                            own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her
                            through life. Surely this comparison must have its use with her. She
                            will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no
                            misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. (Austen 229)</quote> While on the
                        surface “they may have been” refers to the emotional connection past between
                        Marianne and Willoughby, it modifies Marianne’s “condition,” thereby both
                        multiplying and pluralizing it. Marianne will feel her own “sufferings” to
                        be “nothing” as opposed to Eliza’s sufferings, which resulted in something,
                        specifically, an illegitimate child. Read in light of a potential pregnancy
                        and miscarriage, Brandon’s speech is deeply ironic. Miscarriage negates
                        “misconduct.” Whether spontaneous or induced, whether the result of a
                        logical calculation or the overflow of emotion, the abortion of Marianne’s
                        fetus has reasserted her virtue and, with it, reaffirmed the marriage plot.
                        The novel’s structuring system, which governs female fate, depends, in the
                        end, on a young girl’s body. Whether that body has been restored to its
                        singular, viable status through sense or sensibility, we can only
                        speculate.</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">In this article, I examine my recent experience in teaching a
                    spring semester literature module to undergraduates. The module is centered
                    around the critical concept of the “brown study” in William Cowper’s evening
                    meditation in <title level="m">The Task</title>. The fading twilight in the
                    winter evening of Cowper’s meditation leads him to reflect on the place where he
                    produces literature about nature: inside in his <emph>brown study</emph>. The
                    class begins with an examination of the critical concept of the brown study as a
                    commonplace in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literatures. How is the brown
                    study contemporary with the development of the concept of the professional
                    literary author? </p>
<p rend="noCount">The brown study is a physical place to write poetry, a designated
                    room in a private house for professional authors, and, most importantly, a
                    creative frame of mind for writing that an author achieves within the study
                    itself. The last definition, signifying a frame of mind in the contemplative
                    mode such as Noah Webster’s serious reverie or Samuel Johnson’s gloomy
                    meditations, is the primary definition in the <title level="m">Oxford English
                        Dictionary Online</title>. We approach the new history of the
                    now-anachronistic brown study through exemplifications of ruminative stances in
                    poetry, in which a poet’s aesthetic first-stage inspiration is broken down. The
                    deconstructive process, informed by readings from Wellmer, Freud, Adorno, and
                    Derrida, is approached in the ways that authors unconsciously select and make
                    distinctions as the initiative experiences are digested, then to be taken into
                    the second-stage reflections that are recorded during composition.</p>
<p rend="noCount">The class’s literature survey covers William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads Preface</title>, James Thomson’s <title level="m">The Task</title>, Anna Letitia Barbauld’s <title level="m">The
                        Invitation</title>, Mary Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters from
                        Sweden, Norway and Denmark</title>, and William Cowper’s <title level="m">The Task</title>, paired each with background from introductory scholarship
                    on the composition processes of the author. We follow the survey of two-stage
                    writing with a classroom discussion/essay assignment on the artistic processes
                    of Romantic-era literature and authorial identity supported by readings from
                    William St. Clair, Catherine Gallagher, Stephen Greenblatt, and Tilottoma Rajan.
                    The class also examines the brown study as a physical space furnished in the
                    writings of several authors who describe their creative processes at home: John
                    Keats, Mary Wollstonecraft, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and William Cowper. At last
                    we consider how one might create a brown study with elements from the topics in
                    the literature from the course module.</p>

<head>I. Introduction: <title level="a">Brown Study</title> Aesthetics</head>
<p>Wind rattling at the window, fire in the grate, and a poet dozing in his chair
                    are images in William Cowper’s <title level="a">A Winter’s Evening: Brown
                        Study.</title> The presence of an aesthetics of a brown study is an issue I
                    invite my classes to study in their theoretical approach to Romanticism from a
                    Survey of British Literature I class. In the class, we study the two stages of
                    composition theory—I: <foreign xml:lang="de">Eingedenken</foreign> and II: Composition (linguistic)—
                    in writing that appears in poetical works by William Cowper, William Collins,
                    James Thomson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Anna Letitia Barbauld, Mary
                    Wollstonecraft and William Wordsworth. The brown study aesthetics poems each
                    feature the two phases, Eingedenken and Composition. In William Cowper’s <title level="m">The Task</title>
<title level="a">Book 4: A Winter’s Evening,</title> aesthetic response occurs in
                    a state of unconscious reflection preceding representation in language. The poet
                    is half-awake and daydreaming. The poet appears overcome with images. At rest
                    after a long day, he is, at least for the present moment, inarticulate. The
                    poet’s frame of mind calls up Theodore Adorno’s theory in <title level="m">Negative Dialectics</title> that aesthetic response is pre-linguistic. In
                    the brown study, Cowper’s poet enjoys a “parlour twilight” and “sweet oblivion
                    of the cares of day” (4.278, 4.250). Theoretically, according to Adorno’s model
                    and following models such as Albrecht Wellmer’s in <title level="m">The
                        Persistence of Modernity: Aesthetics, Ethics and Postmodernism</title>,
                    aesthetics precedes articulation (Wellmer 3–4). However, thoughts that follow an
                    aesthetic response may transpire to linguistic utterances as part of a
                    purposeful inquiry inspired by earlier experiences in an aesthetic state
                    (Wellmer 3–4). </p>
<p>The images in Cowper’s <title level="m">The Task</title> and additional period
                    brown study aesthetics poems are part of a module that I included in a Spring
                    2019 literary studies course for undergraduates. In the module, the class
                    discussed poetical tropes of two-stage composition: (1) the pre-linguistic stage
                    and (2) the linguistic stage. Cowper’s images are a part of a historical
                    tradition of poetical images of slumbers and reflections. Pre-linguistic images
                    precede later images of the compositional phase such as John Keats at his
                    writing office in Joseph Severn’s painting “John Keats at Wentworth Place”
                    (Appendix A).</p>
<p>We begin the module with the first stage of composition, <foreign xml:lang="de">Eingedenken</foreign>, the
                    pre-linguistic phase William Cowper theorizes in <title level="m">The
                        Task</title>, and we conclude with the second stage of composition,
                    Composition, the linguistic phase. In <title level="m">The Task</title>
<title level="a">Book 3: The Garden,</title> Cowper claims that he travels widely
                    during his lifetime. However, in order to write poetry, Cowper returns always to
                    the place of his opening theme of repose from <title level="a">Book 1: The Sofa.</title> The reflective
                    observation situates the sofa, an upholstered chair with soft cushions in the
                    brown study of a poet’s house, as a primary site of attraction for the itinerant
                    poet. Intent on self-discovery through the process of Eingedenken, the poet must
                    prioritize the sofa, as he explains: "I, designing other themes, and called / To
                    adorn the Sofa with eulogium due, / To tell its slumbers and to paint its
                    dreams" (3.13–15). The poet in Cowper’s account travels widely with the aim to
                    reflect on “themes” which he “designs” in pre-linguistic impressions from
                    outside, in nature, and in the city. He returns to the sofa to digest what he
                    saw in “dreams” and in “slumbers” for reflection, after his first-stage travels
                    take him far: <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>one who, long in thickets and in brakes</l>
<l>Entangled, winds now this way and now that</l>
<l>His devious course uncertain, seeking home;</l>
<l>Or, having long in miry ways been foiled</l>
<l>And sore discomfited, from slough to slough</l>
<l>Plunging, and half despairing of escape,</l>
<l>If chance at length he find a greensward smooth</l>
<l>And faithful to the foot, his spirits rise,</l>
<l>He chirrups brisk his ear-erecting steed,</l>
<l>And winds his way with pleasure and with ease;</l>
<l>So I, designing other themes, and called</l>
<l>To adorn the Sofa with eulogium due,</l>
<l>To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams,</l>
<l>Have rambled wide. In country, city, seat</l>
<l>Of academic fame. (3.1–16)</l>
</lg>
</quote> Cowper’s “eulogium” (3.12) on the sofa is a “eulogy” for dead
                    nature without including “mir[e]” (line 4), “slough” (line 5), and
                    “entangle[ment]” (line 2) in a confusion of images now aestheticized in the
                    brown study to be later written down in poetical form. The traveler in the
                    “greensward,” like Cowper’s poet, finds inspiration for writing when he later
                    returns to the sofa to write a formal “eulogium” or a memorial for times passed.
                    During a brown study period, the poet will contemplate themes in nature while in
                    a state of repose, in effect mindfully resting in a state of the Derridean
                    unconscious before he or she later will revive images for writing poetry in an
                    elegiac reconstruction of past events in the phase of Composition
                    (linguistic phase).</p>

<head>II. The “Curtain of Repose”: Nature in the Mindful Unconscious</head>
<p>The author’s awareness of the pre-conceptual space is the “mindfulness
                            [<foreign xml:lang="de">Eingedenken</foreign>] of nature in the subject,” according to
                        Albrecht Wellmer in <title level="m">The Persistence of Modernity:
                            Aesthetics, Ethics and Postmodernism</title> (74). Nature is the state
                        of the unconscious in a brown study repose. The author’s mindful attention
                        to the state of repose evokes in the author his or her own consciousnesses
                        of the boundaries that necessarily are in existence between his or her mind
                        and the objects of thought. As Wellmer explains, the author achieves
                            <foreign xml:lang="du">Eingedenken</foreign> “within the medium of conceptual thought, the
                        necessary condition being that the concept itself is turned against the
                        reifying tendency of conceptual thought” (4). The thought is a delimitation
                        of the awareness of a state of natural repose. The brown study in Romantic
                        literature such as Cowper’s <title level="m">The Task</title> is the state
                        of fading thoughts during the twilight hours of a “curtain of repose”
                        (4.248) that may exist, for poets, prior to a state of enlightenment that
                        occurs later on. In present-day critical theory of brown study
                        compositional poetics by Tilottama Rajan and Richard Adelman, the authors
                        examine the truth value of synthesis and reconstructive aesthetics, known as
                        an <emph>alethiology</emph>, or truth discovery. </p>
<p>Theodor Adorno’s theory in <title level="m">Negative Dialectics</title>
                        examines the unconscious or pre-linguistic phase as a corrective to the
                        presence of the conscious. The source of truth is found in the unconscious
                        state, such as in idle contemplation, dreaming, or brown study mental repose
                        (Adorno 348). Sigmund Freud also uses the unconscious for what he
                        perceives to be an other apparent in the consciousness, as Gayatri Spivak
                        explains in the translator’s preface to Derrida’s <title level="m">On
                            Grammatology</title> (Spivak 86). Jacques Derrida too critiques the
                        foundational theory of a conscious intentionality. Joseph Adamson explains:
                        following Sigmund Freud’s discovery of the unconscious memory, the Derridean
                        “critique of metaphysics and of the ‘presence’ of consciousness” leads
                        towards Derrida’s own idea of the unconscious, which “owes much to Freud’s
                        discovery of the unconscious and theory of unconscious memory” (Adamson
                        296). </p>
<p>Derrida forms his thoughts on deconstruction out of his thoughts on the
                        unconscious, which indeed are a source of Derrida’s own theory of
                        deconstruction. In Derrida’s critique of the foundation of metaphysics,
                        Joseph Adamson shows, he aims to provide a corrective to the overwhelming
                        presence of the conscious in metaphysical theory: “Derrida’s writings
                        critique the Western metaphysical tradition, which he sees as dominated by a
                        discourse of ‘presence’ in the assumption, for example, that truth is a
                        function of the presence of consciousness to itself and to its object. . . . What
                        Derrida calls deconstruction consists in an analysis which overturns these
                        tenacious metaphysical foundations” (Adamson 296). The direction of the
                        critique of the conscious is the recovery of the unconscious from
                        alterity.</p>
<p>Cowper’s “curtain of repose” in <title level="m">The Task</title> draws out
                        the rest of unconsciousness in a “recess” from the outside world of travel
                        and consciousness (4.248, 4.308). During the recess, Cowper dreams of the
                        process of defoliation he has seen out of doors. The activities of the
                        harvest take in the “golden” summer growths leaving an “upturned” soil of
                        “mellow brown” (4.314–15). The harvester takes apart the growth of spring
                        and summer with the scythe of autumn. Variegated nature appears in images of
                        the “rough wind,” “frost raging,” “faded” meadows, “lands . . . of a mellow
                        brown” reaped by the “forceful share”: <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>How calm is my recess! and how the frost</l>

<l>Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.</l>
<l>To-morrow brings a change, a total change,</l>
<l>Which even now, though silently performed</l>
<l>And slowly, and by most unfelt, the face</l>

</quote> The time for memorializing the past seasons of spring and summer is
                        during the seasons of adverse weather and during the seasons of autumn and
                        winter. The period of recess occurs because the poet is unable physically to
                        participate in activities outdoors due to the adversity of the late autumn
                        weather. </p>
<p>Like Cowper, William Collins reflects that his spring and summer rambles end
                        when the adverse fall weather occurs. He seeks a woodland cottage where he
                        may contemplate “dim-discovered spires” and “hamlets brown” (Collins line
                        37). The process of observations and obscurity call to mind a cityscape in
                        the evening or in the nighttime hour like Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s
                        nighttime composition in <title level="a">Frost at Midnight.</title>
                        William Collins writes <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But when chill blustering winds, or driving rain,</l>
<l>Forbid my willing feet, be mine the hut</l>
<l>That from the mountain’s side</l>

<l>And hamlets brown, and dim-discovered spires,</l>
<l>And hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all</l>

</quote>Collins’s poet is able to remark the pre-linguistic music of the
                        church bell and the shades of the evening in gradually darkening “dim” and
                        “dusky” tones of grey and brown (37, 40). Coleridge’s poet,
                        contemplating in a brown study during the evening in winter, remembers
                        “cloisters dim” while at school when he recalls his own childhood and his
                        son Hartley Coleridge’s travels to come: <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim,</l>

<l>But <emph>thou</emph>, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze</l>

</lg>
</quote>The “eternal language” is a composite of the pre-linguistic “shapes
                        and sounds” that appeal to the aesthetic nature of the poet and his family
                        in the “image[s]” of the outdoors, “mountains,” “clouds,” “lakes,” “shores,”
                        “crags,” “sky,” “stars,” and “frost” (Coleridge, <title level="a">Frost at
                            Midnight</title> lines 1–61). The elegiac tone of the odes is audible
                        and visible as well for Keats’s thresher, who is an eponymous
                        personification of the fall in his ode <title level="m">To Autumn</title>.
                        The harvest laborer sits among the reaped fields and listens to the wordless
                        songs of the season in an elegy of loss: <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?</l>
<l>Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—</l>
<l>While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,</l>
<l>And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;</l>
<l>Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn</l>
<l>Among the river sallows, borne aloft</l>
<l>Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;</l>
<l>And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;</l>
<l>Hedge-crickets sing, and now with treble soft</l>
<l>The red-breast whistles from a a garden-croft</l>
<l>And gathering swallows twitter in the skies. (lines 23–33)</l>
</lg>
</quote>The images of the overripe fruits of spring pervade the poem with a
                        sense of premonition of the coming iciness of winter. Elegiac tones are
                        present in the memorialization of the lost season in the reaper’s dreaming
                        as he harvests, breaking off fruits of the spring and the summer, threshing,
                        pressing, and tapping juice from apples, and drawing off sap from the field
                        of poppies: <quote>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?</l>
<l>Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find</l>

<l>Or on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep,</l>
<l>Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook</l>

<l>Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,</l>
<l>Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours. (12–22)</l>
</lg>
</quote>The drowsy thresher is “sound asleep” after a day
                        of processing the fruits of the spring and summer. As the evening falls, the
                        speaker deconstructs the experiences of spring and summer in Keats’s ode are
                        deconstructed by the speaker in an allegory of his own state of
                        unconsciousness, evocative of Wellmer’s <foreign xml:lang="du">Eingedenken</foreign>, the
                        mindfulness of “nature in the subject” (74). The poet’s contemplation of the
                        passing of the day occurs while under a “brown” twilight or under an obscure
                        “curtain of repose” (Cowper 4.248). The
                        phase of unconscious reflection for a poet could sometimes last several
                        hours or take over the day; Keats in his letter number 41 to Benjamin Bailey
                        demands that his friend “give me” some time to compose in “a long brown
                        plain” or stretch of time for several hours to take up the whole of “my
                        morning” in his <title level="m">Letters</title> from Teignmouth on Friday
                        on March 13, 1818. Severn’s “Portrait of Keats” shows the author staring
                        sightlessly at a book, bearing the “real symptoms of sadness” from his late
                        life, and the image is reminiscent of the elements of Cowper’s “eulogium”
                            (3.12) for natures past, an elegiac
                        celebration of past experiences in brown study aesthetic repose.</p>

<head>III. “To Adorn the Sofa with Eulogium Due”: Creative Minds at
                            Home</head>
<p>In the theory of brown study compositional poetics, writing that follows
                            contemplation of experience is subjective and offers a truth value of
                            synthesis and reconstructive aesthetics, known as an <emph>alethiology</emph>. The
                            alethiology is a truth value discovered through access to the “nature of
                            truth” (<title level="m">OED</title>), seen in Eingedenken, the brown
                            study’s first, aesthetic stage of creativity preceding the conceptual
                            thought of the second, compositional stage of creativity. In a Romantic
                            poem written in the brown study aesthetic, the element of
                            “undecidability” should precede the concept, according to Tilottama
                            Rajan (472). As the initial experiences are digested in a deconstructive
                            and self-aware pre-conceptual process, authors unconsciously select and
                            make distinctions. The aesthetic experience is especially powerful in
                            what Richard Adelman defines as the idle or vacant mind, where space
                            occurs between the experience of an object and the concept of the object
                            itself. The period of idle reflection in Cowper’s brown study passage is
                            a stage in contemplation between “voluntary and involuntary” processes
                            of thought, as Adelman explains (76). Despite the involuntariness of
                            contemplation, the mind has a “particular set of abilities” 
                            to produce a concept for reconstruction of an idea (Adelman 64).</p>
<p>Following the Derridean deconstructive stage of creativity, named in
                            poetics by Cowper as the brown study stage, “it is not necessary . . . to
                            reassemble the <foreign xml:lang="la">disjecta membra</foreign>” of the day’s experiences in
                            a structured form (Rajan 464). The deconstructed text of nature in the
                            poet’s experience “can still be alethiological, because the very process
                            of undecidability discloses truth” (Rajan 464). Poetical fragments,
                            notes, marginalia, and free writing are written expressions of
                            undecidability. For poets who are writing in a two-stage process, an
                            idea for a theme is drawn from the brown study and the “thematic
                            expression” then leads to the secondary phase of the rhetorical
                            structure of the poem (Rajan 452). </p>
<p>The deconstructive process provides material in fragments, notes, and
                            marginalia that are recorded during composition to be taken into the
                            second stage reflections. The class’s survey of composition processes in
                            the second stage of writing covers William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> preface, Anna Letitia Barbauld’s <title level="m">The Invitation</title>, James Thomson’s <title level="m">The Seasons</title>, Mary Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters
                                from Sweden, Norway and Denmark</title>, and William Cowper’s <title level="m">The Task and Other Selected Poems</title>, each paired
                            with introductory scholarship on the composition processes of the
                            author. </p>
<p>In Paul de Man’s essays on Romanticism, Tillottama Rajan explains, “the
                            problem of intentionality is historically localized in romantic
                            literature, which is in transit from a medieval literature that grounded
                            allegorical representation in anagogic presence towards a kind of
                            Mallarmean pure poetry that would not be undone by any desire to emerge
                            from the palace of art” (Rajan 455). Schiller writes in <title level="m">Naïve and Sentimental Poetry</title> of the aesthetic pre-concept:
                            “Just as nature began gradually to disappear from human life as
                                <emph>experience</emph> . . . so we see her arise in the world of poetry
                            as <emph>idea</emph> and <emph>object</emph>. . . . The poet, I said, either
                                <emph>is</emph> nature or he will <emph>seek</emph> her” (Schiller
                            105–10). The poet deliberately seeks the Eingedenken or nature of the
                            mindful unconscious in order to generate natural or inspired poetry.
                            William Wordsworth theorizes the nature of Romantic poetry in <title level="m">Preface</title> to <title level="m">Lyrical
                                Ballads</title>: <quote> I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous
                                overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from origin
                                recollected in tranquility: the emotion is contemplated till by a
                                species of reaction the tranquility gradually disappears, and an
                                emotion, similar to that which was before the subject of
                                contemplation, is gradually produced, and does itself actually exist
                                in the mind. In this mood successful composition gradually begins,
                                and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of
                                whatever kind and in whatever degree, from various causes is
                                qualified by various pleasures, so that in describing any passions
                                whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will upon the
                                whole be in a state of enjoyment. Now if Nature be thus cautious in
                                preserving in a state of enjoyment a being thus employed, the Poet
                                out to profit by the lesson thus held forth to him. (183)</quote>
                            Wordsworth creates “the poet as a prophetic figure who [is] defining a
                            subjectivist, expressivist poetics that continues to condition poets’
                            and critics’ understanding of the lyric,” as Nicholas Halmi explains in
                            the notes to <title level="m">Preface.</title> Anna Letitia Barbauld, in
                            her poem <title level="m">The Invitation</title>, suggests a creative
                            mood in “nature” overseen by a “muse” of poetry (1.97, 1.13). Barbauld
                            also intends an “invitation” of creativity to her friend Miss Belsham,
                            the poem’s dedicatee. A cultural ingenuity in cultivated composition is
                            emphasized in Barbauld’s writings; William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft
                            explain: “She seeks, both in herself and in others, to cultivate the
                            disposition (which she assumes exists) to respond 'naturally' to
                            experience” (McCarthy and Kraft 19).</p>
<p>Barbauld aims to encourage Belsham’s creative awakening in nature.
                            Barbauld and Belsham walk the grounds of Warrington Academy—a school of
                            sciences and arts for young gentlemen established by Barbauld’s father
                            John Aikin—and view the riverbanks of the Mersey River and the trees of
                            the grounds. “Will Delia [Belsham] at the muse’s call retire / To the
                            pure pleasures rural scenes inspire?” she asks (lines 13–14). May “fair

                            the speaker notes celebratory elements when he awakens in an allegory of
                            daylit awareness and composition. Thomson contrasts the compositional
                            phase with the previous stage of obscure “brown” evening light in the
                            study phase. His inspiration has been undertaken in what he
                            describes as a “brown night” of dreams (4.52). He writes a hymn,
                            a “sacred song” inspired by “every Muse” of the day (4.63,
                            4.78). In the morning, “Man” may “awake” to enjoy composing during “the
                            silent hour / To meditation due”: <quote>

</quote>“The cool, the fragrant, and the silent hour” is the
                            compositional time the author sets aside for putting words to feelings
                            (Thomson 4.62). In the metaphorical prose of Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway
                                and Denmark</title>, the author shares her experiences of walking
                            outdoors and thoughts on observing the details of the landscape, the
                            flowers, fields, and rocks, around the town of Gothenberg in Sweden. </p>
<p>Following the day’s travels, Wollstonecraft explains, she writes at home
                            about her experiences in a quiet hour. Ingrid Horrocks, in her
                            introduction to Wollstonecraft’s oeuvre, points to a
                            “nostalgic strain in philosophical . . . thought” in the <title level="m">Letters</title> as Wollstonecraft eulogizes the day and her
                            separation from family (Horrocks 25). Like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who
                            sits around the fire in the grate at midnight with his infant son in the
                            poem <title level="a">Frost at Midnight</title>, Wollstonecraft
                            contemplates, “Why fly my thoughts abroad, when every thing around me
                            appears at home? My child was sleeping with equal calmness—innocent
                            and sweet as the closing flowers” (Wollstonecraft 59). However, due to
                            the brightness of the moon, “I could write at midnight very well without
                            a candle. I contemplated all nature at rest; the rocks, even grown
                            darker in their appearance, looked as if they partook of the general
                            repose, and reclined more heavily on their foundation” (Wollstonecraft
                            59). Earlier in the same day described in <title level="a">Letter
                                1,</title> Wollstonecraft describes “still little patches of earth
                            of the most exquisite verdure, enameled with the sweetest wild flowers”
                            and she mourns the passing of the day (57). </p>
<p>The poet in Cowper’s <title level="m">The Task</title> finds “the country
                            wins me still,” and his strategy for translating pre-linguistic
                            reflection into words is to read poetry written by people who write
                            about the country: “No bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned /
                            To Nature’s praises” (4.694, 704–5): <quote>

</lg>
</quote>The two-stage writing period is clear in the contrast between
                            Cowper’s “very dreams” of childhood rural scenes and his mature writing
                            in the writer’s “bower” among the rooftops of London which offer him
                            “amends” for the “lost world” of youth (4.670, 4.728, 4.729–30). In the
                            physical stage of writing “verse” about nature while living in the city,
                            Cowper states that nature is to him “a lost world” now that he lives in
                            the London town of Chertsey (4.730). Yet, while in London, the poet
                            finds that he can obtain in the process of writing “rich amends / For a
                            lost world in solitude and verse” (4.729–730). Cowper sees his verses
                            written in the city as miniature container gardens representative of a
                            larger nature outside. Adjacent to the “brick” walls of homes in the
                            city are “boxes planted thick / And watered duly. There the pitcher
                            stands / A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there,” a synecdoche of
                            “how close pent-up man regrets / The country” (4.771,
                            4.775–78).</p>

<p>Adelman’s study in <title level="m">Idleness, Contemplation and the
                                    Aesthetic, 1750–1830</title> reclassifies several idle
                                activities during the Romantic era. Adelman’s study “charts the
                                construction of the category of idle, aesthetic contemplation”
                                outside the parameters of the categories of “working.” His study
                                begins with Romanticism’s idleness “up until the very point at which
                                this category is put to work in opposition to the political economy
                                that inflected, and indeed anticipated, its parameters” (Adelman 9).
                                The activities of reading and writing may fall alongside the
                                activities of retirement, rest, and solitude.</p>
<p>For Mary Wollstonecraft and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the interiority
                                of the study creates an aesthetics of order and structure from
                                chaotic externality. “I then retired to my apartment,” explains
                                Wollstonecraft of her first night of Swedish residency, but “my
                                senses had been so awake, and my imagination still continued so
                                busy, that I sought for rest in vain” (59). Coleridge’s retirement
                                in <title level="a">Frost at Midnight</title> at Nether Stowey in
                                Somerset is characterized by interior reflection, and his thoughts
                                similarly move from inside with his newborn child to abstractions

</quote>In <title level="m">The Interpretation of Dreams</title>,
                                Sigmund Freud explains, “We are concerned with unconscious
                                thought, and . . . the process may easily be a different one from that
                                which we perceive in ourselves in intentional contemplation
                                accompanied by consciousness” (263). Freud remarks that theme and
                                symbol may “not belong particularly to [a single] dream, but rather
                                to the unconscious thinking” which may be found “in the
                                folklore, . . . myths, legends, and manners of speech…” of a culture,
                                such as in its poems and prose literary texts (245–46).</p>
<p>The activity of reading is a common image in portrayals of the brown
                                study aesthetic. Keats speaks of his composition of poetry in <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title> and Joseph Severn paints
                                him in <title level="m">John Keats at Wentworth Place</title> (1821, Appendix A). Severn
                                writes in his letters that Keats was at repose in a compositional
                                phase in the study surrounded by the furniture necessary to writing.
                                The components of the study during Keats’s composition of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> are presented in detail
                                and are confirmed by Keats’s friend Charles Brown: <quote>This was
                                    the time he [Keats] first fell ill &amp; had written the Ode to
                                    the Nightingale (1819) on the mor[ning] of my visit to Hampstead
                                    I found him sitting with the two chairs as I have painted him
                                    &amp; was struck with the first real symptoms of sadness in
                                    Keats so finely expressed in that Poem. (The room, the open
                                    window, the carpet and chairs are all exact portraits, even to
                                    the mezzotint portrait of Shakespeare given him by his old
                                    landlady in the Isle of Wight. After this time he lost his
                                    cheerfulness &amp; I never saw him like himself again.) I had
                                    a draw of the room, chairs &amp;c done by Mr Charles Brown who
                                    was still living in the same house. (Severn qtd. in Woof and
                                    Hebron 90; see Appendix A)</quote>Brown’s drawing of Keats with
                                the furniture of Brown’s brown study in the foreground, chairs, and
                                paneling illuminated by the window of the grounds aft, is lost. For
                                Keats, who is convalescent in a “palace” of art, windows, chairs,
                                carpets, books, and portraits make the study necessarily a physical
                                place of rest as well as a place of intellectual composure (Rajan
                                455). In the study Keats composes on the “wings of Poesy”: <quote>

</quote>Even Cowper’s gardeners who are “unfurnished” in their

                                to represent “the means of life” (4.770). The pre-linguistic
                                phase of admiration is sustained in the compositional recording of
                                the details of the scene, which become imbued with the life of the
                                inner mind. Following the contemplative stage is a reconstruction of
                                experiences into a poem, yet the reconstruction stage preserves the

                    Technologies of the past and the present offer ample methods for experimenting

                    methodologies of the past but also present-day digital tools provide us with the
                    means to further experience and preserve literature. We should present students
                    with the opportunity to not only experience these memorable works using their

                    and therefore synthesize the imaginative renderings of the Romantic period with
                    our present imaginative possibilities and technological capabilities,
                    experimenting, as readers–listeners–performers, with the affective force of sound
                    as we perceive its function, modernize expressions of the materiality of
                    language and its association with thought, and curate diverse renderings,

<head>Ideal Presence and the Past and Present Acoustic Ecologies of Romanticism:

<p>William Wordsworth knew the association of sound, language, and affect was
                    poetically valuable and used it to his advantage in the creation of acoustic
                    ecologies. He showcases acoustic aesthetics in his poetry through the speech
                    acts of characters, dialogic interaction with audiences, and recitations,
                    creating acoustic ecologies of Romanticism while advancing future ones. Because
                    acoustic ecologies occupy a central presence in his narrative poems, I call for
                    consideration of the power of speech and sound in the teaching of Romantic
                    poetry and insist that students learn the task of close listening, becoming
                    readers–listeners–performers in their literary study.</p>
<p>I value speech acts and sound in poetry and suggest that students of Romanticism
                    be taught to listen closely to the acoustic ecology of Wordsworth as embedded in
                    theirs. In so doing, they will find that poetry exists as innumerable, layered
                    soundscapes in and beyond textual spaces. If students are taught to understand
                    poetry as synthetic and sounded, they will interact with poetry to comprehend
                    how poets move readers between and across patterns of organization and
                    perception to showcase many aspects of their works as sound art. Wordsworth’s
                    poetics is at the core of my theory, but I propose the practice of my theory
                    more broadly as a pedagogical method. I encourage a consideration of the
                    possibilities of sound in Romantic poetry and what technologies past and present
                    might offer in terms of reciting, analyzing, translating, remixing, performing,
                    and preserving Romantic poetry in and for the future.</p>
<p>Teaching students the value of speech acts and importance of recitation begins
                    with an introduction to the history of thinking about language that existed
                    before Romantics were composing and reciting, a history that widely contributed
                    to Romantic poetics. According to the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher Henry
                    Home, Lord Kames, “speech is the most . . . powerful of all the means by which
                    one human being can display itself to another” (1: 43). Teaching Romantic poetry
                    with a focus on the important influence of rational beings stirring emotions
                    through speech means engaging with theories and practices of audition and
                    recitation. In the seventeenth century, linguistic theories and practices in
                    England were concerned with connections of speech to thought. According to
                    Murray Cohen, language at this time could be studied as an object, and “the
                    relationship between language and reality . . . [was] sought in the physical
                    parts of writing and speech—letters and sounds” (7). Seventeenth-century
                    treatises on the physicality of speech reinforced the importance of sound in
                    making meaning. Owen Price’s <title level="m">The Vocal Organ</title> was one of
                    many texts that “provided a scheme visualizing the physiology of sounds . . .
                    [to] propose an articulatory phonetics based on an ordered, elemented, and
                    evident arrangement of the speech organs” (Cohen 11). These speech organs are in
                    part how the body produces language sounds. Language exists through the
                    complexities of one’s speech organs, and these organs make articulations audible
                    in distinct ways. While a conceivably obvious point, acknowledging the body’s
                    critical role in linguistics illumines the relationship between live Romantic
                    articulations, the imagination, and transformation. Connecting acts of the
                    mouth—the body, past and present—to the intellectual quickness of
                    the mind and to broader assemblages of mouths-bodies-minds is necessary to move
                    Romantic poetry through and beyond individual, private notions toward
                    understanding that acknowledges not only isolated incidents of human
                    transformation in nature but conversion of the collective consciousness through
                    public sphere revolution, a sphere just as natural to humanity. Christopher
                    Cooper’s <title level="m">The English Teacher</title> is another text increasing
                    awareness to this possibility. A schoolmaster, Cooper sought to impose rules
                    through his “detailed descriptions of physical sounds” and “alphabetized lists”
                    concerning phonology and phonetics: “he finds the possibilities of language in
                    the ‘powers’ of characters” (Cohen 13). Cooper’s work, as with Price’s, pulls
                    language away from its intangible status into a more tangible reality—one
                    more sounded, heard, felt, and participatory. </p>
<p> As with most treatises during this time, these texts were concerned with
                    linguistic inquiry as a site for knowledge making. Including excerpts from these
                    treatises on a course syllabus could be quite useful, not only for
                    contextualizing the period prior to Romanticism which would help students
                    understand the era’s engagement with linguistic inquiry, but also for vivifying
                    soundscapes of the Romantic imagination. These treatises can be used for
                    dislocating the silent practice of reading Romantic poetry and creating physical
                    articulations through recitation and mouth movements vocalizing the powers of
                    characters. Making students aware of the embodiment of language can help us
                    understand diversity historically. Not everyone will articulate the same, and
                    different sounds produce diverse aesthetic responses and shifts in meaning. We
                    could study patterns that appear across the student body, note variances and
                    illuminate problems, blind spots, and exclusive markers that led to further
                    linguistic thought that Romantic poets were working through, with, and
                    against.</p>
<p> With such background, students will better understand that seventeenth-century
                    linguists’ interests in the materiality of language and its association with
                    thought led to eighteenth-century interests in the rhetorical and affective
                    possibilities associated with language and communication. During the eighteenth
                    century, oral emphasis became the dominant concern in linguistics, and conveying
                    understanding through recitation was key. John Rice’s <title level="m">An
                        Introduction to the Art of Reading</title> represents the view that
                    recitation could “evoke the relationship between thought and speech” and
                    transfer sentiment from speaker to interlocutor (Cohen 105). According to Cohen,
                    the linguistic ability to transfer sentiment depended on the “competence of the
                    speaker rather than on qualities embedded in the language,” but it was accepted
                    that individuals could use their “distinctive linguistic features” to this end
                    (106). The “arrangement of voice inflexions and pauses” could “express each
                    sentence with appropriate ‘passion or emotion’” and shifted the study of
                    language as object to the study of the mind (Cohen 106–7). This lean toward
                    psychology signaled a change in how the affective function of language could
                    materialize—and articulatory phonetics emerged. Articulatory phonetics was
                    concerned with sounds, including “discussions of basic sounds, emphasis, pause,
                    modulation, articulation, accent, pronunciation, quantity, and tone” (Cohen
                    110). During this shift, lecturer Benjamin Martin, important for his role in
                    advancing knowledge about the ear and auditory processing, published <title level="m">Institutions of Language</title>, which contains his <title level="a">Physico–Grammatical Essay on the Propriety and Rationale of the
                        English Tongue</title> and includes a section wherein he “discusses each
                    letter in terms of the physiology of its pronunciation” (Cohen 112). Texts, such
                    as Martin’s, are evidence of theories of language that perceived speech as
                    social and affective. Additional publications proliferated and emphasized
                    pleasure’s role in communication, as elocutionist Thomas Sheridan’s 
                        oeuvre reveals (Cohen 112–14). The importance of linguistic sounds in
                    the eighteenth century led some to instruct speech pronunciation by graphically
                    specifying sounds using a system of notation modeled on musical notation which
                    could, in addition to marking speech emphasis, confront “defects by comparing
                    the voice to a musical instrument” (Cohen 116). This system was also used to
                    record printed information. </p>
<p> As the auditory imagination functions differently for each reader, teaching
                    historical attention to articulatory phonetics would allow for more concrete yet
                    diverse engagement with the sounds of printed texts. Students could produce
                    their creative renderings, or auditory translations, of texts and recorded pieces
                    using notation systems created in the past. Noelle Chao discusses the sonic
                    qualities of printed words in her work, which focuses on the British plantation
                    owner Joshua Steele who, in his 1775 <title level="m">Essay Towards
                        Establishing the Melody and Measure of Speech</title>, outlined “a complex
                    system for recording the voice in print, involving, among other things, a
                    modified musical staff with extra divisions of pitch and rhythm, and a range of
                    additional markings to indicate emphasis and force” (245). Chao’s work addresses
                    a gap in research on recording technology and claims that while the historical
                    narrative depends on the nineteenth century and its technological advancements
                    as the point of origin for recording, in fact, the “eighteenth-century writings
                    on music and elocution developed their . . . logic of recording through the
                    medium of print” (258). Students could devise systems like Steele’s, whose
                    methods, deemed implausible by some critics, were embraced by a select few who
                    supported “conveying sound through the medium of print” using “written markings
                    that could reliably and accurately communicate specific sounds” (Chao 247). Chao
                    argues that “for scholars today, . . . [Steele’s] technology for recording has
                    the potential to amplify eighteenth-century practices of reading and listening,
                    practices made nearly impossible to hear or imagine by modern advances in sound
                    preservation” (247). Therefore, we should be encouraging students to design
                    similar methods of capturing poetic sounds, speech sounds, and soundscapes
                    embedded in Romantic poetry. In this way, students participate in what Julia S.
                    Carlson calls “the voicing of print” to “discover their measure” (2). This
                    “democratic access to . . . measures,” which John Thelwall supported for blank
                    verse at the time of <title level="m">The Excursion</title>, according to
                    Carlson, would teach students to initiate or participate in sound preservation
                    (3). With today’s technological apparatuses, students could reinvent the process
                    to create imaginative multimodal recordings and translations of Romantic texts,
                    take elocution into consideration, and synthesize past recording technologies
                    with those of the present.</p>
<p>Romantic poetry should be examined through the lens of elocutionary theory as it
                    relates to the sound of speech acts and their effects. This lens offers
                    innovative approaches to understanding Romanticism and results in students not
                    only understanding the language of texts but also the rhetorical acts of
                    original recitations and future possible performance translations. Judith
                    Thompson insists that while “much remains to be done to recover and re-evaluate
                    elocutionary history and theory in relation to Romanticism,” attention has begun
                    to shift toward “actual circumstances and active effects of particular speech
                    acts, utterances, genres, and performances” (23). Instead of approaching
                    Romantic poetry only by linking the linguistic to the thematic, I suggest that
                    we teach students of Romantic poetry to examine the linguistic using Romantic
                    theories of hearing and philosophies of sound. Roman Jakobson in “Linguistics
                    and Poetics” “distinguished the context (circumstances described in the message)
                    from the code (the language system that lets the message be put into words),”
                    and Andrew Elfenbein writes that “most literary scholarship on language absorbs
                    code into context, rather than recognizing its potential autonomy” (4).
                    Examining code on its merits forces close engagement with the language system
                    (i.e., speech sounds), influences the context, and vivifies poetic soundscapes. </p>
<p>To consider Romantic poetry on these terms, I envision a reader who advances what
                    Elfenbein calls the “impression of style” (41). Consideration must be given to
                    the kind of reader Wordsworth visualized as he apprised his “Reader” of his
                    style and intent to “look steadily” at his “subject” in the preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (600). Wordsworth unlikely chose “subject”
                    for only its connotations of topic. Rather, he was thinking about the whole of
                    his work in relation to its parts by considering the “subject” position of his
                    “Reader.” His preface and other paratext serve a similar function to produce
                    readers who know their parts but who also submit to poetic authority. Subject in
                    every sense is recognized, and Wordsworth anticipates readers who accommodate
                    him and realize the score in conjunction with their contributions. As Noelle Chao informs us, Steele writes
                    of such a reader in <title level="m">Essay</title> and <title level="m">Prosodia
                        Rationalis</title>: <quote>The reader of such printed symbols is understood
                        to be not only a reader who processes printed text in a silent, sonic
                        vacuum, but a reader–listener, who is able to hear what is being
                        communicated in print within . . . [the] mind’s eye. This reader–listener is
                        often cast as a reader–listener–performer, whom the writer anticipates will
                        rehearse the sounds captured within the text. (258)</quote> Adopting the
                    term reader–listener–performer for students of Romanticism makes sense.
                    Wordsworth was himself a reader–listener–performer, well known to have composed
                    lines of verse orally while walking in nature where public and/or private
                    audiences were attending and listening, leaving behind a methodology for his
                    words to be conveyed by his readers–listeners–performers through an
                    understanding of audition and the affective force of sound. Of course, I do not
                    suggest that we teach students to become Wordsworth in their
                    auditory/performance translations, but I do suggest the importance of
                    understanding Romantic poetry in terms of accepting the importance of readers’
                    subject positions as they express the whole of poems in auditory/performance
                    translations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, readers should balance self-perception of their sonic environments,
                    both created and actual, as well as the acoustic ecologies created in the lines
                    of Romantic poems. With this layered sense of perception, sonic environments of
                    the poets’ created audible worlds become less textual, more active soundscapes.
                    Stressing imaginative interaction, Noel Jackson writes about Wordsworth and his
                    “claim for the sensuous vitality of imaginative narration,” noting that Lord
                    Kames’s term “ideal presence” delineated “the active status of imaginative
                    things in the mind” (85). Wordsworth and Kames share the belief in the mind’s
                    ability to activate sensation. Jackson explains that “ideal presence at once
                    simulates and substitutes for physical sense-perception; this literary effect
                    reproduces the potent effects of sensation without sharing in the limitations
                    that bind it to one body, thereby preventing its communication to others”
                    (85–86). Created acoustic ecologies, considered through Kames’s ideal presence,
                    would function as sonic environments wherein one could have “an embodied
                    experience wholly independent of external stimuli” (Jackson 86). This account
                    theorizes “the signature effect of powerful imaginative representation” and
                    “render[s] . . . the sensuous presence of the past” (Jackson 86). Adding the
                    representation and rendering of the past with the present renderings complicates
                    the sonic landscape, or soundscape, of the poetry, but accepting Kames’s ideal
                    presence along with students’ auditory translations of the texts opens up the
                    poetry to fresh conceptions of poetic sound. This exploration allows for an
                    understanding of acoustic ecologies that reinforces embodiment and direct
                    perception and permits the unbinding of poetry from not only one body but also
                    one imaginative representation. It lets students participate more creatively in
                    poetry and thus participate more fully in the expressive utterance of the poem,
                    by embodying speech, thought, and feeling together through words on their
                    tongues. This participation allows them to experience Romantic poetry as an
                    embodied force always agitating others through utterance. The method teaches
                    that acoustic codes are not stable but subjective, and that such a reality
                    should not negatively affect analytical import. </p>
<p>These systems reproduced in a classroom allow for critical engagement with
                    student recordings. We could make comparisons, notice like patterns in marking,
                    and begin quite possibly to hear Wordsworth’s voice through graphical
                    specifications. Studying linguistic structures by focusing on the sounds of
                    language and affect reveals compelling information about articulation, accent,
                    vocal variations, euphony, stress, cadence, pauses, respiration, punctuation,
                    attention, stimulation, artificiality, force, and more. Romantic poetry emerged
                    in this linguistic environment, so acknowledging these systems in classroom
                    settings better equips students for understanding this environment. </p>
<p>Linguistic structures shift now as they did then as rhetorical situations vary.
                    Sounds of language and affect for exigencies differ, so Romantic articulations
                    should be understood through the complexity of performance or recitation
                    contexts. An introduction to both seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
                    linguistics and articulatory phonetics reinforces the importance of the
                    sonification of language that alphabetic text might obscure for readers; it
                    reifies the attention to social linguistic structures so important in Romantic
                    recitation and readers–listeners–performers’ auditory imaginations. The social
                    origins, intellectual culture, and outcomes of the French Revolution and its
                    ideological birthing shaped Wordsworth’s imagination and concern for his
                    community and thus shaped Wordsworth’s poetics and its emphasis on words and
                    passion. Words in the mouths of revolutionaries elicited substantial
                    consequences, and “unmasking” such penetrating use of political language for
                    Wordsworth likely reinforced his poetic use of words and the force of their
                    passion to affect his audience (Hunt 20–21). Revolutionary speakers were
                    passionate, affective, and “concerned with authority” and “audience,” and
                    Wordsworth recognized that language shaped perception with positive and negative
                    implications (Hunt 25). Language shaped political interests and ideologies and
                    was “a way of reconstituting the social and political world,” in both France and
                    England (Hunt 24–25). Wordsworth knew language served as an “expression of
                    power, and power . . . [was] expressed by the right to speak for the people”
                    (Hunt 23). His concern for man’s nature fueled his sense of preservation and
                    need to speak on behalf of others, to use language to foster political and
                    social change, preserving his experiences and revolutionary sense of language
                    through poetry that could indeed bring authority or sense of liberty to those
                    lacking privilege and agency. Wordsworth experienced that in times of revolution
                    some voices were heard above others, and those silenced by an oppressive
                    majority needed others to help them be heard. Wordsworth poeticizes selfhood
                    that serves broader humanity, whose liberty could be found in conversing with
                    their souls, which his poetics teach and taught even while his explicit
                    political actions waned. At times hiding explicit political intent in verse,
                    Wordsworth spoke for those who could not, for reasons social, political, or
                    otherwise, and emboldened others who listened to participate in society as was
                    possible in spaces where the overlooked were silenced. Taking this voicing into
                    consideration, we can and should problematize and complicate notions of
                    Wordsworthian “liberty” and critique imperialist political and educational aims
                    and realities aurality brings to mind. Attention to aurality always makes
                    audible historically unheard voices that have been enslaved by the English
                    tongue—voices of those silenced, colonized, appropriated, forced into
                    assimilation, and ignored. There are always consequences. In other words, we can
                    critique why Wordsworth felt compelled to speak for others and discuss the
                    implications and ethics of that. Fortified with seventeenth- and
                    eighteenth-century linguistic theory, Wordsworth aligned his thinking about
                    language with the values inherent in political language esteemed during the
                    French Revolution: values of passion, authority, audience, perception, and
                    persuasion that served social and political purposes, expressed power and
                    agency, and ensured Wordsworthian liberty. Teaching values inherent in political
                    language is crucial, and students can understand such thinking through our
                    historical moment, especially in terms of modern audible movements serving
                    social and political justice purposes. </p>
<p> Foregrounding sound as the vessel for the “Visionary Power” (<title level="m">The Prelude</title> 619) of which Wordsworth wrote challenges the thread
                    of research in Romantic studies that fails to articulate such sonic emphasis to
                    instead maintain that sight was more important to the Wordsworthian imagination.
                    I dislocate Wordsworthian “Visionary Power” that “Attends upon the motions of
                    the winds / Embodied in the mystery of words” (<title level="m">The
                        Prelude</title> 619–21) from assumptions of sight. Sound studies demand
                    close listening and conceptualizing aurality through unorthodox means, and a
                    study of sound implies physicality and psychophysicality beyond sensation and
                    new critical regulation. In my classrooms, I seek to supplement traditional
                    close reading with scientifically and historically informed close listening,
                    which makes engaging with not only the physical but also the psychophysical
                    sonic properties of poetry worthwhile. I teach Wordsworth in this way to show
                    through acoustics and psychoacoustics frameworks that he reimagined refined
                    sensibility and anticipated inclusive interpretive communities for poetry; he
                    is, in part, a vessel for a wider social, cultural, discursive logic of the
                    poetics of the Romantic period. If we teach others a similar understanding of
                    Wordsworth, we propel his poetics forward into aural and semantic spaces
                    informed by diverse historical moments, political perspectives, scientific
                    engagements, technological advancements, and physical and psychophysical
                    acoustic ecologies. These spaces inform our thinking; we cannot approach poetics
                    sans current consciousness. </p>
<p>The dialogic quality of Wordsworth’s writing and focus on the interactivity
                    between self, sound, and motion—what I term
                    <emph>psychosonicmotion</emph>, presents opportunities for students to reimagine
                    Wordsworth’s craft, his thinking, and the pleasure he derived, gave, and gives
                    with his work. Consumed by his sense of true personal liberty, Wordsworth chose
                    close listening to self in motion in the interest of preserving ideas in writing
                    for future recollection and pleasure. Wordsworth does not abandon his civic
                    project and exile himself from the world; his work draws in others and others’
                    voices in the service of broader humanity, engaging civically continually.
                    Concerned with not only articulating others’ voices to be heard by others but
                    also hearing his voice speak itself out, Wordsworth arguably privileged close
                    listening and thus positioned sound at the forefront of his poetics as <quote>

</quote> The “presence” (95) here is sound, and the “sense sublime” (96) is
                    hearing.</p>
<p>Wordsworth’s poetics connect not only early linguistic thought to later political
                    language but also the debates regarding thought, language, experience, ideas,
                    and things that existed before and as his poetics took shape. Wordsworth’s
                    position can be traced from John Locke’s first articulation in <title level="m">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</title> (see <title level="a">Of
                        Words</title>) to Leibniz to Berkeley to James Burnet, Lord Monboddo to
                    Locke’s French follower Étienne Bonnot de Condillac to John Horne Tooke to
                    Destutt de Tracy to the <emph>idéologues</emph>, and my argument for sound as
                    fundamental in Wordsworth’s poetics follows from a synthesis of such conceptions
                    (Keach 95–110). William Keach surveys this theoretical terrain, which can be
                    valuable information to include in a course tracing points of thought to
                    Wordsworth’s ideas about language and thought. Keach asserts that Wordsworth’s
                    use of words “gives us a profound sense of the pressure and action of the
                    material world and of the physical significance of writing itself” (109). His
                    tracing of Romantic verbal representation suggests Wordsworth’s intention to
                    produce poetry with sound poetics in mind and must be present in a study of
                    Romantic poetry. </p>
<p>In my ear, the beauty of Wordsworth is that he was able to capture his immersed
                    nature—personally, socially, politically, and naturally. That quality
                    inherent in his writing still remains. We hear even today the sounds of
                    Wordsworth’s verse blending with the voices of the poets before and after him,
                    with the waters and birds around him, with the soundscape we presently occupy.
                    We hear it if we practice close listening. He captured his sonic moment through
                    poeticizing its auditory scenes, documenting an acoustic ecology by layering
                    sonic environments of which he was a part—physically, psychophysically,
                    and imaginatively. By relocating these auditory scenes into verse, he preserved
                    auditory perception in reality and ideality and for futurity, reifying his
                    immersive tendencies to attend to sound through his Romantic ear and prompting
                    our attention to do the same by reading his work—and reading it aloud.
                    Through Wordsworth, by dislocating ourselves from our sonic environments to join
                    his auditory scenes, we become aware of unique sonic environments that
                    inform—even enhance and disrupt—the acoustic ecology of listening to
                    Wordsworth. Through his verbal representation, Wordsworth mediates aurality by
                    pulling his auditory scenes into our sonic worlds to intervene in our present
                    and future systems of aurality. </p>
<p>Diverse approaches let us reconsider, reimagine, and diversify social contexts,
                    past and present, in which Romantic-era poetry is highly valued and appreciated.
                    We learn to understand the value of these aesthetic encounters and how they can
                    be not only preserved but also renewed in our contexts through attention to how
                    past technologies reshape or become reshaped through present technological
                    capabilities. Adam J. Banks writes about the “repositioning” that composition
                    theory and teaching are undergoing “that values cultural diversity and
                    interrogates more deeply the social contexts in which writing occurs,” noting
                    that in the field of composition, “more importance [has been placed] on
                    multiliteracies and multimedia writing” (10). What might the possibilities be
                    if, in teaching literature, we placed such importance on multiliteracies and
                    multimedia writing and how, together, the two could preserve Romantic recitation
                    using digital platforms that allowed for the immersive engagement with sound
                    and/or performance and linguistic variation through the marking systems of the
                    past? These are innovative considerations for literary studies. While Banks
                    clarifies that “digital writing and our immersion in multiple media forms and
                    spaces demands a return to performance as an important area in writing
                    instruction,” reimagining Romantic poetry through diverse performances is also
                    an important area in literature instruction, and this area can be enhanced
                    through explicit attention to the possibilities of digital humanities and our
                    immersion in multiple media forms (11). We can and should interrogate and
                    diversify Romantic recitation and its sonic possibilities by recreating social
                    contexts where reading–listening–performing occurred in the Romantic period,
                    reimagining those moments in new physical locations and electronic
                    spaces—with assorted voices. These contexts are not only textual but also
                    actual and electronic, not only recitative but also performative.</p>
<p>Considering multimedia possibilities for Wordsworth’s poetry is one way we might
                    reimagine the social contexts of present recitation in juxtaposition to
                    Romantic-era recitation. For instance, an audio version of the text might change
                    or enhance the reading of sound figures, and Wordsworth’s work, and all poetry
                    in general, could be examined in this way. Sound figures have acoustic or
                    psychoacoustic resonances, and the textual representations of linguistic
                    utterances are sound figures. Multimedia possibilities for representing sound
                    figures abound through remix, pastiche, sampling, and hybridity. Both language
                    and music have metaphorical capability, and I hear sound figures as the fusion
                    of linguistic and nonlinguistic sonic resonances in the service of metaphor.
                    Hearing and listening to these utterances ignites thought if audiences listen
                    closely. Adrian Curtin writes about examining audio recordings of readings
                    through the concept of close listening (270). He quotes from Charles Bernstein
                    to suggest that “‘close listening . . . may contradict ‘readings’ of poems . . .
                    based exclusively on the printed text . . . that ignore the poet’s own
                    performances, the ‘total’ sound of the work, and the relation of sound to
                    semantics’” (qtd. in Curtin 270). Curtin writes that audiotexts emphasize and
                    reinforce the acoustics of the written text (271). Audiotexts provide “a dense
                    semantic field of linguistic activity and sound shapes that re-stages the
                    printed poem’s ostensible meanings” (271). As we listen to a poem’s
                    dynamic sound registers and begin to notice its layered sonic environments, we
                    can access how technological re-conception of a work might, through newly
                    imagined multimedia forms, bring about audio representations of multiple
                    consciousnesses, which might offer semantic and post-semantic enrichment worth
                    curating. Electronic aural stimuli authorizes the marking of poetry as
                    technologically advanced and quite post-postmodern, insofar as it simultaneously
                    represents communicative voices through messages it transmits through polyphonic
                    figures.</p>
<p>Wordsworth’s poetry already exists as hybrid and “multi discursive,” but through
                    innovative platforms we have access to today, it could become even more so. The 
                    “hybrid genre embraces works of art which transgress genre
                    boundaries by combining characteristic traits and elements of diverse literary
                    and non-literary genres” (Karakoç 70–71). Wordsworth reveals such possibilities
                    through diverse narrative and sonic elements through language and forms; he
                    draws attention to physical and psychophysical sounds through his poetic
                    utterances, which themselves house others’ utterances. Bakhtin defines the
                    hybrid genre as “‘the mixture, within a single concrete utterance, of two or
                    more different linguistic consciousness[es], often widely separated in time and
                    social space’” (qtd. in Karakoç 71). Nonlinguistic acoustic data cutting into
                    language in the text performs this hybridity because it reveals Wordsworth’s
                    consciousness as a poet producing the consciousness of the text that the
                    reader–listener–performer experiences through the works and perpetually renews
                    through future recitations and/or auditory translations that may or may not be
                    electronic.</p>
<p>Poems and the reader–listener–performer become an assemblage of past and present,
                    lyrical and narrative, literary and real, and thus Wordsworth and individual. If
                    “collective life is constituted by a multiplicity of circulating entities that
                    are mutually influencing each other and bending space as a consequence of their
                    divergent activities,” as the “power of rhetorical actancy as a concept”
                    suggests, according to Laurie E. Gries, then Wordsworth’s poetry is a part of
                    that collective, and his readers–listeners–performers are too (75). Both the
                    poem, as technology, and the reader–listener–performer have agency and act in
                    the world. In this sense, Wordsworth’s poetry exists as “distributed cognition .
                    . . dispersed across various, heterogeneous components of an assemblage or
                    assemblages as well as space and time” in a collective that includes nonhumans
                    and humanity in their entirety—past, present, and future (Gries 68).
                    Wordsworth’s poetry exists in hybridity in conjunction with its
                    readership—at any time, and the work maintains a certain kind of living
                    power in readers’ hands or on readers–listeners–performers’ tongues (Gries
                    73).</p>
<p>We should encourage students to envision the sonic environments of poems not as
                    fixed interpretive territories but as interactive acoustic ecologies, allowing
                    them to experience personal circumambient versions of the “‘world around’” or
                        <foreign xml:lang="du">Umwelt</foreign> (Chion and Steintrager 11). Chion and
                    Steintrager maintain that one could argue that “there was a sound and a
                    person”—a system of synthesized surround sound—sound and subject as
                    entity (11). This Romantic understanding of the sonic environment positions the
                    subject to feel “at the center of sound” and builds up sound “as a revelatory
                    fantasy” that can “emphasize by a sort of mirroring effect, as it were, the
                    individuality of the one listening to them” (Chion and Steintrager 11). Keeping
                    this egocentric nature of audition in mind, students can understand that a
                    poem’s sonic environment, soundscape, or acoustic ecology inspires options for
                    discovering meaning. The auditory environment is not static but always
                    fluctuating, perceptually founded. According to Albert Bregman, “auditory scene
                    analysis” functions as a model for auditory perception, and using it, we can
                    listen closely to continuous streams of sound in a sonic environment and analyze
                    the sound mixture by segmenting the streams. It is difficult for a “listener to
                    hear the entire sequence as a single stream of sound,” and differences in
                    effects of the auditory stream vary (Bregman 643). While some active perceivers
                    explore the sonic environment through an ecological model with attention to
                    physical sound, others have powers, as William Noble writes, “to move around, to
                    handle things, to bring objects into full view, to sweep the horizon, to get
                    close to a faint sound” in other ways; instead of physically hearing the
                    acoustic world, they perceptively attend to it (330). Noble suggests that
                    hearing “is not necessarily an <emph>action</emph> that a person takes, but is 
                    rather more like the imposition of an audible object on one’s attention” (332).
                    Such attention can be the result of perceiver choice or due to differences in
                    hearing ability, but the analysis of the features of the audible world heard and
                    attended to are meaningful and complex all the same.</p>
<p>Poetry, for Wordsworth, creates defining realities and distinctive natures and
                    allows for an apprehension and perception of various natures. I suggest that we
                    situate nature according to Peter H. Khost’s definition of the literary
                    affordance and maintain an understanding of nature as an object in relation to
                    its usefulness in the textual environment by all involved actors, which include
                    not only poet and auditors but also intertextual and intratextual voices.
                    According to Khost, a forerunner of ecological psychology James J. Gibson
                    introduced the concept of affordance: “Affordances are uses individuals
                        make of objects, events, concepts, or environments through relation to their
                        discoverable features. . . its basic principle being that experiential,
                        environment-bound relations are central to psychological experience . . .
                        [Affordances involve] situational emphasis” (19–20). Situational
                    emphasis is important to understanding Romantic recitation and
                    should be explored practically and theoretically. Immersive environments are
                    critical to poetry once readers note perceptual offerings environments hold.
                    Khost maintains that “a reader’s needs (and abilities, interests, situation, and
                    so forth) contribute to . . . [their] making of literary affordances” (21).
                    Readers, therefore, give to and take what they need from the sonic environment
                    they find themselves a part of, both in and beyond the text, in order to
                    experience the work more fully. Khost writes that “affordances are not only
                    phenomenal (i.e., experiential), but they are also at the same time substantial
                    (i.e., physical),” and experiential and physical readings offer more
                    interpretive possibilities for the poetry as the literary affordances become
                    more varied based on the variants of nature made possible by due consideration
                    of, attention to, creation of—and re-creation of—multiple sonic
                    environments by diverse readers–listeners–performers (21). That “an affordance
                    is not a property of an environment [literary text] or of a person [reader] but
                    rather a person’s [reader’s] ability to make uses of objects or environments
                    [literary texts] by placing (i.e., identifying) and activating useful features
                    in them” should be something we are teaching students of Romanticism because it
                    allows for reconsiderations of engagement that would be much like the engagement
                    of the poets during their time (Khost 24). It materializes the period to show
                    that these poems were indeed penned by living, breathing bodies who were
                    absorbing their actualities to push beyond them. Experiencing poetry in this way
                    makes it not only perceptual and experiential (i.e., direct) but also both
                    conceptual and referential (i.e., indirect) (Khost 27). The ecosystem of the
                    poem, then, while a complex construction and representation of the poet’s
                    transcendence from material circumstances, becomes rooted in a reader’s material
                    circumstances to substantialize the very materiality the poet captured through
                    the poetic form to begin with. The work then always exists in synthesis beyond
                    the individual poem in its material collectivity, past, present, and future.</p>
<p> Wordsworth’s recitations prompt conjecture regarding the sonification of poetry
                    in our context and how we close listen today as audiences of Romantic poetry as
                    sound art, ourselves reciting, hearing, and listening from positions of present
                    soundscapes and circumstances. It situates perpetual recitation and the need for
                    performance/auditory translations from audiences contextually defined by
                    idiosyncratic and distinct natures. Poetry creates sonic possibilities both
                    referential and nonreferential, and through the experiencing of the poem or the
                    experience the poem concretizes and figurativizes—through its creation,
                    recitation, participation, and perpetuation—these sonic possibilities
                    supply variable resources for knowing, which we should examine. Steven Feld
                    examines what he calls “acoustemology,” which “conjoins ‘acoustics’ and
                    ‘epistemology’ to theorize sound as a way of knowing”; this theorizing “inquires
                    into what is knowable, and how it becomes known, through sounding and listening”
                    and “asks how the physicality of sound is so instantly and forcefully present to
                    experience and experiencers, to interpreters and interpretations” in order to
                    understand “sonic sensation” as “experiential” (qtd. in Novak and Sakakeeny 12).
                    Feld informs our understanding of poetic sound and what we can know from poetic
                    sonification. Realizing sound possibilities by analyzing poetry as audio
                    reshapes our theoretical understanding of poets and poetics and reinforces
                    poetry as a modern somesthetic–affective object. If we conceptualize literary
                    sound in this way, we provide students with unlimited possibilities for
                    encountering poetic acoustic ecologies as three-dimensional and interactive. </p>
<p>The diverse study of sound presents uncountable opportunities for students.
                    Technologies of the past and the present offer ample methods for experimenting
                    with Romantic texts and auditory translations in terms of reciting, analyzing,
                    translating, remixing, performing, and preserving Romantic poetry in and for the
                    future. Sound studies using not only the linguistic treatises and recording
                    methodologies of the past but also present-day digital tools provide us with the
                    means to further experience and preserve literature. We should present students
                    with the opportunity not only to experience these memorable works using their
                    tongues and in new mediums but also to analyze them as originals and translations,
                    synthesizing the imaginative renderings of the Romantic period with our present
                    imaginative possibilities and technological capabilities. Students, as
                    readers–listeners–performers, will experiment with the affective force of sound
                    as we perceive its function, modernizing expressions of language’s materiality and
                    its association with thought while curating diverse renderings, compositions, and
                    analyses under the direction of poets. </p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">While we now know that much of the early reporting after the mass
                    shooting at Columbine High School was incorrect, including the portrayal of the
                    shooters as social outcasts and victims of chronic bullying, the effects of
                    explaining that violence as retaliatory against a culture of elitism and cruelty
                    remain. Students reading <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
                    today—steeped in narratives of mass shootings—are influenced by
                    parallels between how we characterize the motivations of mass shooters and
                    Shelley’s creature. But Shelley’s text offers students more than these
                    parallels. While the Creature explains his acts of violence as reactionary and
                    justified, the novel thinks carefully and critically about his justification and
                    about the rights and responsibilities of men. In this paper I outline a method
                    for teaching the novel, paired with readings that narrate mass shootings as a
                    reaction to societal rejection, that invites students to analyze the way the
                    novel is thinking about acceptance, rejection, violence, and the rights of men.
                    Reading, thinking, and writing about the texts together allows students to more
                    richly examine the beautiful complexity of Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> as well as their own preconceived notions of
                    retaliatory violence.</p>

<p>I first taught <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> in an Introduction to
                    Literature class at a large state university. The student population was
                    socioeconomically and racially diverse, and included a large number of
                    first-generation college students. I was a graduate student at the time, and I
                    was deeply concerned that my lack of teaching experience would negatively impact
                    my students. I wanted more than anything for them to love the literature I loved
                    and to find in it a way of thinking more carefully and critically about all the
                    many things literature is particularly good at helping us think about like
                    identity, responsibility, education, social structures, and gender roles. </p>
<p>With <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> I was half successful. My students
                    loved the novel. They came to class ready to talk about the characters, the
                    plot, the setting and—most especially—what they thought it all
                    meant. They were fascinated by questions of identity formation in the form of
                    nature vs. nurture, the guilt that Victor bears for the Creature’s actions, and
                    Victor’s oscillation between claiming and abdicating responsibility. The
                    conversation was interesting but my students returned again and again to one
                    question: who’s to blame for the Creature’s pain and—without any
                    differentiation between impetus and choice—his actions? I struggled,
                    though they did not, with some of the conclusions they drew. Many of my students
                    read <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> as a didactic text. The central
                    lesson: beware of how you treat others or they might just kill you. </p>
<p>Initially I was disturbed by what seemed to me an absence of nuance in their
                    readings of the text. I tried to push them to think more rigorously but found
                    most often that I was simply engaging them in debate, with them on one side and
                    me on the other. Didn’t they see that the text struggled with issues of identity
                    formation without providing definitive answers? Didn’t they see the difference
                    between condemning Victor’s actions and excusing the Creature’s choices because
                    of Victor’s bad behavior? They definitely didn’t. They didn’t necessarily hold
                    the Creature up as a hero, but they placed the blame for his actions, even his
                    framing of Justine, on others. They didn’t see any problem with the Creature’s
                    belief that he has a right to be loved and that anyone denying him their love
                    was committing violence against him. My students read a clear and logical cause
                    and effect in the novel: Victor—and the world he lived in—denied the
                    Creature love and the Creature reacted with retaliatory violence. I attributed
                    the dissonance between my expectation and their interpretation to my own
                    inexperience. I thought perhaps if I’d included historical material to ground
                    their reading the experience would have been richer. In many ways I looked at
                    the class as a failure because, although they had loved the text, I felt that
                    their didactic reading was at odds with the complexity of Shelley’s novel.</p>
<p> The next time I taught <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> was at a small,
                    private university. The student population was not socioeconomically or racially
                    diverse and the majority of the students were not first generation. Many of the
                    students came from elite private-school backgrounds. They couldn’t be more
                    different from the students I taught in my previous attempt. I, no longer a
                    graduate student, armed myself with a context version of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> that I thought would better prepare my students for
                    the complexities of the text. You can imagine my surprise when the outcome was
                    much the same. While my students enjoyed the novel, they saw it as a warning: be
                    nice or else. They attributed a disturbing logic to Shelley’s work. They argued
                    that the Creature, bereft of love and persecuted by mankind, does exactly what
                    any reasonable person would expect and should have anticipated: he lashes out.
                    The Creature’s behavior, to them, made complete sense and was even predictable.
                    While they acknowledged that what he did was wrong, it was in no way shocking
                    and, for many of them, was even somewhat justifiable. For my students the novel
                    explained violence on the part of the Creature through the actions of those
                    around him, expunged him from personal responsibility, and accepted retaliatory
                    violence as inevitable. </p>
<p>After my second experience teaching <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> I tried
                    several different approaches. I tried providing more history and context,
                    including drawing more heavily from Shelley’s own life and the philosophical
                    conversations in which the novel takes part. I found that the additional context
                    helped my students expand the complexity of their readings but, no matter who
                    and where they were, many of them still argued that the novel posed retaliatory
                    violence as the natural and inevitable consequence of being unloved.</p>
<p>The ubiquity of this didactic reading—let this be a lesson to you: be nice
                    or else—worried me. I began to consider that, at least for my students,
                    Shelley’s work <emph>had</emph> become didactic, and I wanted to know why. While
                    Shelley’s text certainly hadn’t changed, my students were coming at it from a
                    different cultural moment. As I sifted through student responses to the
                    readings, I noticed a recurring word across many different student responses:
                    bullying. Students characterized the fear, revulsion, and rejection the Creature
                    encountered as bullying—a word far more loaded for them than it was for
                    me. My own acquaintance with the anti-bullying movement was passing at best,
                    having attended elementary and high school at a time when it was most often used
                    in the context of after-school specials. My students, however, had spent their
                    elementary and high school years being taught and trained about bullies and
                    bullying. </p>
<p>The anti-bullying movement began in response to the Columbine High School
                    shootings in April of 1999 (Stuart-Cassel, Bell, and Springer 1). By the end of
                    that year Georgia would pass the first anti-bullying legislation and, over the
                    next ten years, most states would follow. Between 1999 and 2010 state
                    legislatures passed over 120 bills addressing bullying (Stuart-Cassel, Bell, and
                    Springer x). In many cases, the legislation mandated that school districts
                    require all students to participate in educational programs intended to decrease
                    bullying. Anti-bullying became the watchword of education across the nation, all
                    in response to Columbine. But Columbine wasn’t the first school
                    shooting—it wasn’t even the first school shooting of the 90s. There was
                    one in 1991 (Iowa), one in 1994 (Washington), two in 1996 (Washington and
                    California), four in 1997 (Alaska, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Arkansas), and
                    five in 1998 (Virginia, Oregon, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Arkansas) (<title level="a">Timeline of School Shootings</title>). However, all of these
                    school shootings had low body counts and were over before the media arrived on
                    the scene (Cullen 14). In contrast, Columbine lasted for over five hours,
                    including what the police then believed was a standoff with the shooters<note place="foot" resp="author">While the police believed they were engaged in a
                        standoff, the two shooters committed suicide inside the school just over
                        40 minutes after the beginning of the attack. The police didn’t realize
                        that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were dead until they found their bodies
                        hours later. In fact, at least one of Klebold and Harris’s victims bled to
                        death after the shooters committed suicide while the police were securing
                        the school (Cullen 83).</note>and culminating in an extensive search of the school.<note place="foot" resp="author">In addition to shooting classmates, Klebold and
                        Harris planted bombs in and around the school. The bombs didn’t inflict the
                        damage they had hoped—some of them didn’t even explode—but they still had to be
                        carefully secured.</note>It was more than enough time for the media to
                    congregate and for the story to quickly go viral. People watched the Columbine
                    tragedy unfold in real time and, as is frequently the case when information is
                    conveyed before it can be verified, much of what was reported was untrue. It was
                    these misconceptions that created and fed the anti-bullying movement that has
                    shaped so many students.</p>
<p>In the days and months after Columbine, the nation looked for answers. It was, at
                    the time, the deadliest school shooting in history.<note place="foot" resp="author">The actual body count—thirteen, including twelve
                        students and one teacher—was significantly lower than the originally
                        reported twenty-five (Brockell).</note> Many people, including school
                    administrators, parents, and legislators, found those answers in the media
                    descriptions of the shooters—Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Both Harris
                    and Klebold were seniors at Columbine High School. They were described as
                    loners, goths, and outcasts. There were reports that the shooters had been
                    bullied. The day after the shooting, <title level="j">The Washington Post</title>
                    published an article stating that students at Columbine described Harris and
                    Klebold as “constant target[s] of derision for at least four years” and said
                    they were “constantly being ribbed by the school's athletes and other, more
                    popular cliques” (Fisher, <title level="a">Gunmen Recalled as Outcast</title>).
                    There was some speculation that, in addition to being goths, the shooters were
                    bullied because they were gay—another report that turned out to be
                    unsubstantiated (Cullen 155). Multiple media outlets reported that the shooters
                    were members of a group of outcasts who called themselves the Trench Coat
                        Mafia.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris weren’t
                        part of the Trench Coat Mafia (TCM) but it did exist. The boys knew students
                        who were part of the TCM—so dubbed because the members of the group
                        all wore trench coats—but none of the members were involved in the
                        shooting. Prior to the shooting on April 20, most members of the TCM had
                        either graduated or stopped wearing trench coats to school. The confusion
                        seems to have arisen from Dylan and Eric using trench coats on the day of
                        the shootings at least in part to hide their weapons (Cullen 147–48).
                    </note> Of course, none of this was true. The two shooters were not part of the
                    Trench Coat Mafia. They weren’t goths, both had friends, participated in school
                    activities, and Klebold even attended prom with a date the weekend before the
                    shooting. Most of the students interviewed, at least initially, didn’t know Eric
                    Harris and Dylan Klebold at all and there’s some indication that the students
                    were led in their descriptions by the questions posed to them by interviewers

<p>Regardless, the picture the American public received was of two bullied, lonely
                    kids who snapped, lashed out and killed. Days after the shooting, Andrew
                    Mitchell, a high school student who lived near Columbine and participated in the
                    goth aesthetic, said, “picture these kids, for years being thrown around,
                    treated horribly. After a while you can’t stand it anymore. They were completely
                    wrong. But there are reasons for why they did it” (Cullen 157). This belief
                    that Harris and Klebold were driven to violence by the cruelty of their peers
                    came to shape public policy and private opinion. Even now, 20 years after
                    Columbine, many people still believe that bullying is the driving force behind
                    violence in schools. We know that wasn’t the case for Harris, who left behind a
                    journal, videos, and a website detailing his plans and motivations (Cullen
                    169–70). In his journal Harris discusses the things and people he hates (pages
                    and pages of them) and the things he loves (such as natural selection) (Cullen
                    183–84). He articulates his wish to kill multiple times. Only months after
                    Columbine, at an FBI-organized summit on school shooters, psychologists who had
                    been studying the case agreed that all indications pointed to Harris having been
                    a textbook psychopath (Cullen 247). Klebold left a journal as well, but although
                    it reveals his self-hatred and depression, it doesn’t offer many clues about
                    what led him to murder his classmates. Most experts agree that he was led by
                    Harris and likely wouldn’t have committed violence on his own (Cullen 188).</p>
<p>Although the myth that Harris and Klebold resorted to violence as retaliation
                    against their peers because of bullying has been debunked for over a decade, we
                    still resort to that myth to explain violence in schools. Non-profits like

                    campaigns like <title level="a">Walk Up Not Out,</title> teach students that
                    there’s a direct connection between bullying and violence. <title level="a">Walk
                        Up Not Out</title> was a countermovement to the walkout in response to the
                    Parkland shooting in 2018. It was inspired by several online posts including a
                    February 2018 Facebook post by David Blair in which he claimed that the solution
                    to school shootings was kindness (Seelinger, <title level="a">What Does 'Walk
                        Up, Not Out' Mean?</title>). Blair writes: <quote>Look around you at your classmates. Do
                        you see the kid over in the corner, alone? He could likely be our next
                        shooter. He needs a friend. He needs you. Go and talk to him, befriend him.
                        Chances are, he won’t be easy to like, but it’s mainly because no one has
                        tried to like him. Ask him about him. Get to know him. He’s just like you in
                        that respect; he wants someone to recognize him as a fellow human being but
                        few people have ever given him the chance. You can. . . . Gun control or
                        more laws is not, and will not, be the answer. You are the answer. Your
                        greeting, your smile, your gentle human touch is the only thing that can
                        change the world of a desperate classmate who may be contemplating something
                        as horrendous as a school shooting.</quote>The message is clear:
                    the kids are the problem, and not the ones killing people. School shooters are
                    the natural result of loneliness and bullying. Kids who exclude others, kids who
                    are mean, kids who don’t spend every moment reaching out to their peers create
                    school shooters. While researchers, psychologists, and every well-informed adult
                    knows this isn’t true, the kids subject to the anti-bullying programs don’t know
                    it. And given that all states now have some kind of anti-bullying legislation,
                    we can expect that almost every student in our classrooms who has attended public
                    school (and some who attended private school) will have been influenced by the
                    myth of Columbine<note place="foot" resp="author">In fact, a National Voices
                        for Equality, Education, and Enlightenment survey found that, “86% of
                        students said, ‘other kids picking on them, making fun of them or bullying
                        them’ causes teenagers to turn to lethal violence in schools” (Bullying
                        Statistics).</note>: be nice or else chances are good those you may have
                    ignored or mistreated will kill you.</p>
<p> It was exactly this belief that murder was a natural human reaction to
                    rejection, isolation, and cruelty that influenced my students’ readings of
                        <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. For them the Creature’s violence was
                    inevitable and understandable, even if they didn’t think what he did was right.
                        <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, like the anti-bullying programs in
                    elementary and high school, seemed to them to be at best a warning and at worst
                    a justification. I had thought that perhaps my students struggled with <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> because they were unprepared to grapple with
                    the complex questions it poses about how we become who we are and what we owe to
                    each other. In actuality, they struggled because they’d been trained to believe
                    they already knew the answers to those questions and could only see <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> as an affirmation of those answers.</p>
<p>To help them really engage with the text and move past reading <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> as a didactic affirmation of their belief that murder
                    was an unfortunate but understandable reaction to rejection, I structured the
                    assignments so that they could challenge the anti-bullying rhetoric that shaped
                    their reading by putting it into direct conversation with <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. My hope was that in pairing <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> with texts like Elliot Rodger’s manifesto and Eric
                    Harris’s journal my students would find a way to think about not only <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> but also their own experiences as members of
                    the post-Columbine generation. With anxiety and depression on the rise in
                    college-aged students, I believe that it’s essential for us to cultivate spaces
                    where our students can think critically about the world as it is now. I believe
                    in the power of literature to teach us to do that. If our students can learn to
                    think critically about the Creature’s claims that his actions are entirely the
                    fault of those who treat him cruelly, they can use those same skills to think
                    critically about the ways we’ve attached anti-bullying rhetoric to school
                    shooting prevention in order to shift the blame onto the victims. </p>
<p>In addition to Harris’s and Rodger’s writing, I also show them the 2016 Sandy
                    Hook Promise Public Service Announcement (PSA), sometimes called <title level="a">Evan.</title> In it we watch two students, Evan and an unnamed
                    young woman, flirt through graffiti they exchange on a library table. They
                    finally meet face-to-face at the end of the year, realizing each other’s
                    identity through their handwriting. As they talk, we see another student in the
                    background throw open the gym door. He has a gun. As the students start to
                    notice him, we see them run and hear them scream. The screen fades to black and
                    the following message appears in white lettering, “As you were watching Evan
                    another student was planning a school shooting. But no one noticed” (<title level="a">Evan</title> 00:01:43). The PSA moves through the same frames we
                    saw before, now highlighting the student in the background. We see the student
                    looking at, drawing, and gesticulating guns. We see him sitting alone at a table
                    and being bullied by a group of larger boys. At the end another message appears
                    in white on the black background, “Gun violence is preventable when you know the
                    signs” (<title level="a">Evan</title> 00:02:18). It’s unclear who is being held
                    accountable for not seeing these signs. The PSA is addressed to viewers, but in
                    many of the scenes only other students are present and so logically they’re the
                    ones who could have seen these signs. In essence, the PSA holds those students
                    flirting, blithely self-absorbed in their teen romance, responsible for the
                    actions of their classmate.</p>
<p>When my students watch this PSA in conversation with <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, it makes them angry. They see that they are being
                    told they must suspend their own feelings and desires on threat of violence and
                    possibly death. Like the Creature, the PSA seems to say that we must give those
                    who threaten us with violence what they want or suffer the consequences. I’ve
                    now taught <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> in conversation with school
                    shootings and bullying rhetoric in three separate courses. Unfortunately,
                    because of the increase in mass shootings, the resources available multiplied
                    between each course. The sequence I describe below is a hybrid; it includes the
                    materials from the most recent course along with edits I’ve made for the next
                    iteration of the sequence.</p>
<div type="section">
<head>Key Course Requirements</head>
<p> Because creating dialogue between texts was essential to the aim of the
                        class, I embedded dialogue into the structure of the class. I’ve done this
                        in a number of ways, depending on the resources available but the essential
                        feature is that students write regular responses to the assigned readings.
                        They read and reply to each other’s responses, and all of these responses
                        remain visible to them throughout the course. Most recently I used the
                        discussion feature of our LMS, Canvas. Students were required to post their
                        own thoughts in response to the readings at least once per week and were
                        also required to comment on their peers’ posts. The discussion posts created
                        dialogue between students prior to class, and often our in-class discussions
                        picked up and pushed that dialogue further. </p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>First Movement</head>
<p>I begin the sequence fairly conventionally by assigning sections from
                        Wollstonecraft. I have students read chapters two and four of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Women</title> along with
                        chapter one of <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. The Wollstonecraft
                        reading positions students to discuss the language Victor uses when talking
                        about Elizabeth. With Wollstonecraft as a resource, they notice that
                        Elizabeth is presented as a “gift” to Victor and that Victor thinks of her
                        as a possession (Shelley 41). This groundwork is important because it
                        provides the conditions for an in-depth conversation about autonomy and
                        gender—one of the ideas the novel investigates. In their posts my
                        students discussed Wollstonecraft’s argument that social expectations and
                        conventions shape identity by limiting freedom.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Second Movement</head>
<p> The majority of pairings I assign are between chapters 10 and 20. I
                        provide my students with selections from Elliot Rodger’s manifesto that
                        reflect similar isolation, anger, and desire for violence. I’ve included
                        them below with corresponding sections from <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. My students make the connections between the
                        readings without prompting outside of my assigning them together. Below each
                        pairing I’ve commented on my goals and the outcomes.</p>

<quote>Humanity... All of my suffering on this world has been at the hands of
                            humanity, particularly women. It has made me realize just how brutal and
                            twisted humanity is as a species. All I ever wanted was to fit in and
                            live a happy life amongst humanity, but I was cast out and rejected,
                            forced to endure an existence of loneliness and insignificance, all
                            because the females of the human species were incapable of seeing the
                            value in me. This is the story of how I, Elliot Rodger, came to be. This
                            is the story of my entire life. It is a dark story of sadness, anger,
                            and hatred. It is a story of a war against cruel injustice. In this
                            magnificent story, I will disclose every single detail about my life,
                            every single significant experience that I have pulled from my superior
                            memory, as well as how those experiences have shaped my views of the
                            world. This tragedy did not have to happen. I didn’t want things to turn
                            out this way, but humanity forced my hand, and this story will explain
                            why. My life didn’t start out dark and twisted. I started out as a happy
                            and blissful child, living my life to the fullest in a world I thought
                            was good and pure. (Rodger 1)</quote>

                            91)</quote>
<p>I pair these sections to draw attention to two aspects of Shelley’s text.
                            First, that the Creature’s argument is transactional in a very specific
                            way. He expects that Victor will supply him with his desires, but he
                            also expects that the people he encounters in the world will supply him
                            with happiness and love. In the absence of the fulfillment of that
                            expectation, the Creature and Rodger threaten violence. The feelings of
                            others are, in a sense, held hostage. When my students read these
                            passages together, they think about the implications of the conditions
                            the Creature and Rodger place on the feelings of others. They ask what
                            it means to offer kindness, friendship, or love out of fear of violence.
                            In doing so, they start to question the anti-bullying rhetoric that asks
                            exactly that of children and teenagers.</p>
<p>My students also begin to question culpability. If Victor won’t cede to
                            the demands of the Creature, is he responsible for the Creature’s
                            actions? If the people he encounters don’t love him, are they
                            responsible for the murders he commits? Set side-by-side with Rodger’s
                            claim that others are responsible for his actions, they think more
                            critically about how the text is questioning what is owed to us and what
                            is not. </p>

<head>Pairing Two</head>
<quote>I was completely and utterly alone. No one knew me or extended a hand
                            to help me. I was an innocent, scared little boy trapped in a jungle
                            full of malicious predators, and I was shown no mercy. Some boys
                            randomly pushed me against the lockers as they walked past me in the
                            hall. One boy who was tall and had blonde hair called me a “loser”,
                            right in front of his girlfriends. Yes, he had girls with him. Pretty
                            girls. And they didn’t seem to mind that he was such an evil bastard. In
                            fact, I bet they liked him for it. This is how girls are, and I was
                            starting to realize it. This was what truly opened my eyes to how brutal
                            the world is. The most meanest and depraved of men come out on top, and
                            women flock to these men. Their evil acts are rewarded by women; while
                            the good, decent men are laughed at. It is sick, twisted, and wrong in
                            every way. I hated the girls even more than the bullies because of this.
                            The sheer cruelty of the world around me was so intense that I will
                            never recover from the mental scars. Any experience I ever had before
                            never traumatized me as much as this. (Rodger 48)</quote>

<p rend="noCount">The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants;
                                and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.
                                Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and
                                were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not appear
                                rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene
                                and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase
                                of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched
                                outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true; but it vanished, when I
                                beheld my person reflected in water, or my shadow in the moonshine,
                                even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.</p>
<p rend="noCount">I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the
                                trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I
                                allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of
                                Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures
                                sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic
                                countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream:
                                no Eve soothed my sorrows, nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I
                                remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator; but where was mine?
                                He had abandoned me; and, in the bitterness of my heart, I cursed
                                him. (Shelley 114)</p>

<p>These sections highlight how the possession of women factors into our
                            ideas about masculinity and male happiness. Rejection by a woman, or
                            women in general, is frequently cited as catalyst for violence by mass
                            shooters; Eric Harris kept a hit list of young women he felt had
                            rejected or spurned him, and Elliot Rodger claimed rejection was his
                            primary motivation. Similarly, the Creature tells Victor that the one
                            thing that will stop him from killing mankind is the creation of a woman
                            specifically for him. When my students read these sections together,
                            they want to talk about the responsibility being placed on women for
                            men’s happiness and for the safety of others at the expense of their own
                            happiness and safety. They begin to see parallels between this aspect of
                                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> and our own culture and
                            critique what they’ve been trained to believe. </p>
<p>Often, this is a moment when my students bring Wollstonecraft back into
                            play. Wollstonecraft’s argument that women have the same divine
                            potential and expectations as men helps them think critically about how
                                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> comments on the roles of women
                            in society. In fact, my students this past semester pointed out that
                            Victor’s fear that a female he created might not love the Creature is
                            the first and only time in the novel that he recognizes the autonomy of
                            a woman. </p>

<quote>I spent more time studying the world, seeing the world for the
                            horrible, unfair place it is. I then had the revelation that just
                            because I was condemned to suffer a life of loneliness and rejection,
                            doesn’t mean I am insignificant. I have an exceptionally high level of
                            intelligence. I see the world differently than anyone else. Because of
                            all of the injustices I went through and the worldview I developed
                            because of them, I must be destined for greatness. I must be destined to
                            change the world, to shape it into an image that suits me! (Rodger
                            56)</quote>
<quote>I formed an ideology in my head of how the world should work. I was
                            fueled both by my desire to destroy all of the injustices of the world,
                            and to exact revenge on everyone I envy and hate. I decided that my
                            destiny in life is to rise to power so I can impose my ideology on the
                            world and set everything right. I was only seventeen, I have plenty of
                            time. I thought to myself. I spent all of my time studying in my room,
                            reading books about history, politics, and sociology, trying to learn as
                            much as I can. I became a new person, furiously driven by a goal. My
                            torment would continue, but I had something to live for. I felt
                            empowered. (Rodger 57)</quote>

<p>Rodger, Harris, and the Creature all display narcissism here that is at
                            direct odds to their claims of inferiority in other places. These
                            passages position my students to think of violence in the novel and in
                            our world as an expression of power, not of frustration, fear, or
                            helplessness, as the anti-bullying movement often claims. This is the
                            moment in the class when they most clearly critique the
                            shooter-as-victim narrative. I also give them Gillian Brockell’s article
                                <title level="a">Bullies and Black Trench Coats: The Columbine

                            Humanity struck at me first by condemning me to experience so much

<p rend="noCount">While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I
                                had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place,
                                I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was
                                sleeping on some straw; she was young: not indeed so beautiful as
                                her whose portrait I held; but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming
                                in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of
                                those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And
                                then I bent over her, and whispered "Awake, fairest, thy lover is
                                near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of
                                affection from thine eyes: my beloved, awake!"</p>
<p rend="noCount">The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she
                                indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?
                                Thus would she assuredly act, if her darkened eyes opened, and she
                                beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me
                                not I, but she shall suffer: the murder I have committed because I
                                am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.
                                The crime had its source in her: be hers the punishment! Thanks to
                                the lessons of Felix, and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned
                                now to work mischief. I bent over her, and placed the portrait
                                securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I
                                fled. (Shelley 123)</p>

<p>These last pairings reemphasize the danger to women I discussed above and
                            the issues of responsibility and autonomy. Students want to discuss who
                            is responsible for emotions, the person who experiences them or the one
                            who may elicit them. The aim is not for my students to condone bullying
                            or become callus to the suffering of others, but to help them question
                            any rhetoric—individual or institutional—that holds them
                            responsible for the feelings and actions of another person. </p>
<p>I know that there’s some danger in pairing these texts together. There’s
                            the possibility that my students will collapse historical distance and
                            pay less attention to the particular moment that produced <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>. It’s a risk I’m willing to take. At
                            its best literature helps us understand the past and allows us to think
                            more clearly about the present. At its very best it helps us imagine a
                            better future. My hope is that through reading and thinking about <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> in conversation with these
                            contemporary horror stories my students and I can learn to do that.</p>

<div type="abstract">
<p rend="noCount">In this essay I relate how a last-minute teaching assignment in an
                    area outside my expertise led to a semester of teaching that was, by necessity,
                    spontaneous and experimental, and how that first exciting semester set the
                    course for a class that made not only poetry, but living itself, an object of
                    critical inquiry. The title of the essay, <title type="a">Living
                        Romanticism,</title> indicates what the two aims of the course became: to
                    suggest to my students that Romanticism is still alive, and second, to offer
                    Romanticism as a way of living. In the essay I describe the evolution of the
                    course, explaining how the various assignments, designed to foster fluency in
                    the aspirations, methods, and ways of being and knowing the Romantics embraced,
                    emerged and changed over time. By telling the story of how encounters with
                    British and American Romantics transformed both me and my students, the essay
                    argues that literary studies is a discipline that should, overtly and
                    explicitly, aspire to more than the conferral of skills, capacities, and
                    historical knowledge.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2015, a class I was supposed to teach on contemporary literature
                    didn’t make, so my colleague Tim and I batted about other options for me, seeing
                    as I had to teach <emph>something</emph>. “How about this course on the British
                    Romantics?” Tim proposed. Our resident Romanticist had recently left our
                    institution, and her course was still on the schedule. Someone needed to step
                    in. “Are you up on your Wordsworth?” Tim asked. My immediate response was an
                    unequivocal “no.” I am an Americanist by training, and more well versed in
                    realism and naturalism than in Romanticism to boot. But because the alternative
                    that fall was teaching advanced composition, I dusted off an old Norton and a
                    book by Harold Bloom and got to work. </p>
<p>I’ve been teaching Romanticism in some fashion ever since, whether British or
                    American or both. During that time my life has shifted, the world opening up in
                    subtle but significant ways, and Romanticism has been both the lever for that
                    shift and the lens I perceive it through. The ideas, insights, and language I’ve
                    immersed myself in and talked to my students about have given me a vocabulary
                    for stirrings I’ve had since I was a child, becoming personal provocations, less
                    definite than a map or a guide, but propelling nonetheless. </p>
<p>This is not how professors are supposed to think about literature. Our training
                    encourages us to interpret, analyze, and argue. Instead, I find that my response
                    to the texts I teach these days is to <emph>feel</emph>, first of all, and then
                    to inhabit the literature subjectively in order to test its use as “equipment
                    for living,” in the evocative phrase that titles one of Kenneth Burke’s essays
                    (Burke, <title level="a">Literature as Equipment for Living</title> 293). As an
                    outsider to the field, I came to Romanticism unencumbered by the debates roiling
                    in scholarly journals or by any sense that a particular poem was so canonical as
                    to be dull. One might also call that position ignorant or even irresponsible, I
                    am aware. But it was my ignorance that made it possible for me to submit to the
                    poems in a way I might not have otherwise. I was naïve enough to approach the
                    period uncritically, and my uncritical embrace of what the Romantics had to
                    teach me in the fall of 2015 shaped the way I taught the period from there on
                    out. </p>
<p>The title of my essay—<title level="a">Living
                    Romanticism</title>—points in two directions. It suggests that Romanticism
                    is still alive, and second, it offers Romanticism as a way of living. In what
                    follows, I’ll explain how these directions became the pedagogical aims through
                    which I sought to reproduce the practice of Romanticism both in the classroom
                    and in my students’ lives. The approach I describe below emerged as I taught a
                    course on British and American Romanticisms three times, over a period of a year
                    and a half. In this class, my ultimate goal was to pave the way for my students
                    to be transformed, as I have been, by their encounters with Blake, Wordsworth,
                    Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Emerson, Hawthorne, Poe, Thoreau, Whitman,
                    Dickinson, and (David Foster) Wallace. A highly canonical lineup to be sure (no
                    surprises there), except perhaps for the inclusion of Wallace. It was what we
                    did with them that was innovative—or maybe just so rearguard as to be
                    novel these days.</p>
<div type="section">
<head>Romanticism Is Still Alive</head>
<p> My first step, back in 2015 and in the semesters that followed, was to
                        create a mood in the classroom that made the subject we were studying seem
                        current, relevant, and ongoing. Music has been one of the most effective
                        tools in achieving this aim. I use it to create an atmosphere, playing a
                        song in the five minutes or so before class begins and accompanying the song
                        with a PowerPoint with visuals for the day: portraits of the writer,
                        photographs of the landscape they lived in, perhaps a picture of a house, or
                        a gravestone.</p>
<p>With my own musical library in mind and more than a little help from Google,
                        I assembled a list of songs that took me through all 42 class days. Some of
                        the links were obvious, as with Patti Smith’s <title level="a">My Blakean
                            Year</title> or Iron Maiden’s <title level="a">The Rime of the Ancient
                            Mariner</title> (which I played along with PowerPoint slides of the
                        Gustave Dore woodcuts). Others, less evident, I could explain to my
                        students’ satisfaction: Wilco’s song <title level="a">Born Alone</title> is
                        assembled from fragments of nineteenth-century poetry, including
                        Dickinson’s; U2’s <title level="a">I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For</title> evokes the
                        restless dissatisfaction of the poet in Shelley’s <title level="a">Alastor.</title> But other
                        connections were more tenuous; the songs were like the literature in mood,
                        but with no direct link. The Avett Brothers’ <title level="a">Head Full of Doubt</title> and a
                        handful of songs by Elliott Smith all evoke, for me, a host of Keatsian
                        paradoxes and tensions by way of intricate songwriting. The Indigo Girls’
                        <title level="a">Prince of Darkness</title> and Elton John’s <title level="a">Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters</title> both
                        extend a generous, open hand to our many-peopled world, much in the spirit
                        of Whitman. James Rovira’s excellent edited volume <title level="m">Rock and
                            Romanticism</title> presents an extended argument about rock music as a
                        renaissance of Romantic thought, exploring the Romanticism inherent in
                        musicians including Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and Leonard Cohen. I
                        wasn’t aware of his book at first though; I was riffing.</p>
<p>Admittedly, many of these choices were, as one student pointed out on a
                        student feedback survey, “subjective.” Of course. But subjectivity was
                        something I leaned into in this class, and I encouraged my students to do
                        the same, looking for ways that, to them, Romanticism was manifest in the
                        world around them. It didn’t take long for the students to join in, emailing
                        me with their suggestions for musical matches to the reading, including
                        Lynard Skynrd’s <title level="a">Simple Man</title> for Thoreau, or
                        Bastille’s <title level="a">The Weight of Living Part 1,</title> with its
                        albatross reference, and plenty of songs I’d never heard of. By the end of
                        the course, we’d collectively assembled a robust playlist of songs that had
                        the power to transport us right back into the poetry and prose we’d explored
                        together.</p>
<p>While music built an affective bridge from us to the Romantics, the
                        literature itself—and the direction our discussions of it
                        took—was sometimes all that was needed to recognize the persistence
                        and relevance of Romantic concerns in the present. This was the case with
                        Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>. My students
                        recognized Shelley’s need to defend the literary arts in a climate that
                        applauded technological advances and material progress as a pressing one
                        that has not gone away; in fact, such a defense might be more necessary
                        today than it was in the nineteenth century. Shelley writes, “The
                        cultivation of those sciences which have enlarged the limits of the empire
                        of man over the external world, has, for want of the poetical faculty,
                        proportionally circumscribed those of the internal world; and man, having
                        enslaved the elements, remains himself a slave” (530). Our conversation
                        about these lines assumed a decidedly presentist bent from the get-go, as we
                        talked about the way our smart phones, the internet, and our social media
                        accounts have circumscribed our worlds and limited our powers of
                        observation, even as they have expanded the scope of what we, in theory, can
                        notice and perceive. It was Shelley’s emphasis on perception that moved my
                        students more than anything. In discussion and in their writing assignments,
                        they pointed repeatedly to his assertion that “poetry lifts the veil from
                        the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they
                        were not familiar” (517). This, for many of them, was the heart of
                        Romanticism, the preeminent idea that they took away from the class.</p>
<p>Shelley and Keats also gave my students a new way to think about their
                        education. We discussed at length Shelley’s notion of how the moral
                        imagination develops through the empathetic engagement that literature helps
                        foster. The English majors in my class were familiar with needing to defend
                        their choice of major to their parents, their friends, and themselves. They
                        could rehearse the familiar claims that we humanists make about the value of
                        critical thinking, analysis, clarity of expression, and close reading. They
                        were, in other words, used to taking the practical skills and habits of mind
                        that English studies helps develop and putting them toward some other, more
                        workman-like application: law, journalism, technical writing. What few of
                        them had considered before was Shelley’s claim that reading literature has a
                        moral component. He writes, <quote>The great secret of morals is Love; or a
                            going out of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the
                            beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A
                            man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he
                            must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains
                            and pleasures of his species must become his own. The great instrument
                            of moral good is the imagination. (517)</quote> For those students
                        in possession of a traditionally religious sensibility, this passage
                        affirmed for them the goodness of their academic vocation. For those
                        committed to working for social justice, the idea that reading is a way of
                        regarding the pain of others helped them to see what we did in the classroom
                        not as divorced from practice, but essential to it. This portion of the
                            <title level="m">Defence</title> led to conversations about the
                        importance of reading about people who are not like you, even about people
                        whom you may not like. It led us to consider what limits can be placed on
                        empathetic identification, whether some perspectives are more worthy of our
                        time and effort than others. Should we bother reading a short story written
                        from the point of view of a racist sheriff, like James Baldwin’s <title level="a">Going to Meet the Man,</title> or is our time better spent in
                        imaginative dedication with a victim of racism? What is the value—or
                        is there one?—of inhabiting a point of view we find repellant? It also
                        got my students to reconsider literature they had heretofore thought of as
                        “apolitical,” for they began to think of seeing through other eyes as one of
                        the most intimate, and enduring, political acts at hand.</p>
<p> Keats followed Shelley in my syllabus, so when we got to his letter to his
                        brother and sister-in-law demarcated in the Norton as <title level="a">The
                            Vale of Soul-Making,</title> they were primed to consider the question
                        that critic William Deresiewicz, invoking Keats, raises in his book <title level="m">Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American
                            Elite</title>. To what degree do our institutions of higher learning
                        encourage the development of the ethical and moral components of the self
                        (Deresiewicz 13–15, 77–87)? The university I teach at is not educating the
                        American elite. Still, my students were eager to discuss Keats’s notion of
                        the world as a “vale of Soul-making” and to think about the role their
                        classroom educations had played shaping and refining their emotional, moral,
                        and ethical intelligences (117). Their answer, mainly, was that this facet
                        of education was rarely foregrounded in the classes they had taken. In
                        exploring Shelley’s and Keats’s ideas about the centrality of literature to
                        human flourishing, community, and ethics, however, my students became
                        inspired to make those kinds of connections themselves. For many of them, a
                        link that had been tenuous or implicit became visible, and thereby plastic.
                        Shelley and Keats empowered my students to take more responsibility for
                        their educations and to make the cultivation of their very
                            <emph>person</emph> a central part of that process.</p>
<p> At the end of this course, I fast forward to the twenty-first century as a
                        way of demonstrating to my students that even though we can demarcate the
                        Romantic period temporally, a certain Romantic sensibility, set of concerns,
                        and philosophical or spiritual posture that is Romantic in nature persists
                        in present-day literature and culture. To illustrate the point, I turn to
                        David Foster Wallace’s Kenyon commencement address—a short, pithy text
                        that contains links back to many of the thinkers we’ve studied. Wallace, a
                        picture boy for postmodernism, is also, I submit, a closet Romantic, more
                        earnest than ironic. Most of my students haven’t heard of David Foster
                        Wallace in the first place, so they don’t need me to persuade them of this
                        reclassification, and when they turn to his commencement address from 2005,
                        the links are apparent enough. Here he is, concerned, like Shelley and
                        Keats, with the moral dimensions of education. Wallace is keen to
                        demonstrate the limits of a liberal arts education and to propose that we
                        all go further, learning not just how to think, but what to think
                        about—a proposal that Thoreau voices, albeit in different phrasing,
                        throughout <title level="m">Walden</title>. Like Coleridge, Wallace suffered,
                        trapped by his own perspective and a frequently recurring sense of numbness
                        and distance from the world. Wallace confronts the despair-inducing
                        potential of everyday life and challenges his audience to transform that
                        life, and themselves, through empathy and imagination. In his climactic call
                        to action, he sounds downright mystical, evoking Whitman and Emerson, to be
                        sure, if not Blake, when he challenges us to pay attention so that it will
                        be within our power to “experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type
                        situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force
                        that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things
                        deep down” (93).</p>
<p> The closing exercise for this course on British and American Romanticisms,
                        which we turn to immediately after discussing Wallace, is an activity I
                        named the “Whither Romanticism?” forum. At the beginning of the semester, I
                        challenge my students to keep their eyes and ears open for Romantic
                        artifacts in our contemporary culture, and at the end, they share their
                        findings with the class. As I put it to my students, the idea is to ask
                        whether, how, and to what degree Romanticism persists in the present day. Is
                        it a literary movement that ended in the nineteenth century, or is it a
                        transhistorical movement, a structure of feeling that grows out of specific
                        circumstances? If it’s the latter—and, obviously, this exercise
                        presupposes an answer to that question—what might those circumstances be? We
                        take one class day for three-minute presentations on the
                        artifacts—quick, clear, and concise. Then the next class day is
                        devoted to a wide-ranging conversation about Romanticism emerging from the
                        archive they assemble.</p>
<p> Most students did not struggle to come up with an artifact; in fact, many
                        had trouble limiting themselves to one. It was no surprise to me that many
                        students chose music, given the nudge I’d provided by framing each class day
                        with a song. The rapper Tyler the Creator appeared more than once across the
                        three semesters, as did David Bowie and the singer-songwriter India Arie. I
                        can always seem to count on interest in the Gothic; at least one student
                        each semester chose a TV show or movie in that genre to talk about. Two of
                        the more intriguing contributions over the years were Instagram—a
                        technology that aestheticizes ordinary objects of everyday life—and
                        the blog <title level="j">Humans of New York</title>, which, à la Whitman and 
                        Wordsworth, trains its focus on regular people thus rendering them marvelous 
                        in their specificity and uniqueness. </p>
<p> This exercise made my students feel like experts on Romanticism, able to
                        apply what they’d learned about the nineteenth century to culture in the
                        twenty-first. On the second day of our forum, I challenged them to consider
                        what the artifacts they’d assembled could tell us about the connections
                        between Romanticism and capitalism, race, gender, and politics. One
                        semester, there were at least three Disney films submitted as Romantic
                        artifacts, which raised the question of whether Romanticism has been coopted
                        by the culture industry, repackaged and sold back to us and our children in
                        the form of movie tickets and plush toys. (My students were less troubled by
                        this possibility than I.) Was Romanticism available to people of color and
                        to white women, who, by and large, were missing from our syllabus? My
                        students felt that it was, and demonstrated as much through their analyses
                        of songs by Kendrick Lamar and Joanna Newsom. One semester, with visible
                        trepidation, a student posed this question, “Is there something Romantic
                        about MAGA?” Her question, which she feared would offend or inflame her
                        classmates, led instead to a productive conversation about the function of
                        nostalgia in both Romantic thinking and contemporary politics. </p>
<p>An exercise like this—and a presentist approach like mine—risks
                        collapsing the temporal distance of two centuries, potentially flattening
                        out the historical specificity of both our moment and the Romantics’. I’m
                        okay with that. From my perspective, what we have to gain by becoming
                        intimate with the past outweighs what is lost.</p>

<div type="section">
<head>Romanticism as a Way of Living</head>
<p>How can a teacher encourage students to experiment with Romanticism as a
                        way of living, in and outside of the classroom? I didn’t set out to do that
                        at first. Only after I taught Romanticism a couple of times did it become
                        apparent to me that I was, in fact, presenting Romanticism as a way of being
                        in the world, one that I promoted through my assignments and activities. And
                        once I realized that, I made my purpose explicit, both to myself and to my
                        students.</p>
<p>One assignment that I came to hope might change the way my students and I
                        inhabited the world was the requirement to memorize and deliver a (Romantic)
                        poem. Inspired by an article in the <title level="j">New York Times
                        </title> that ran in August 2017, <title level="a">Memorize that
                            Poem!,</title> by Molly Worthen, I added the poetry recitation
                        assignment to the syllabus right at the beginning of the semester, an
                        impulsive last-minute addition. I wanted them to internalize a poem—to live
                        with its words in their head. Speaking for myself, I’m sometimes alarmed by
                        the sheer number of 1980s and 1990s rap lyrics I have at my command, yet
                        there’s no Keats in my mental library, no Wordsworth, and hardly any
                        Dickinson. That, I decided, had to change. How might my vision of the world
                        be transformed if I could summon the words of those poets at will?</p>
<p>I told my students that I would memorize along with them; I wasn’t going to
                        make them do something I myself was unwilling to do. So, I started small and
                        built up, eventually going for broke with Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Ode:
                            Intimations of Immortality Upon Recollections of Childhood</title> (I
                        still have a few stanzas of that one to go). This practice did, indeed,
                        shift my way of being in the world. I carried stanzas of Blake with me on my
                        runs, the trochees matching my footfalls. I whispered <title level="a">Frost
                            at Midnight</title> to myself while watching my daughter on the
                        playground. I ran over Wordsworth when stuck in a traffic jam. Now, even
                        though I’m taking a break from this practice, phrases will float up into my
                        consciousness when I need them, offering a slightly different way of seeing
                        things, a gloss on my understanding. </p>
<p>From what I can tell, it didn’t exactly work that way with my students.
                        Predictably, many of them chose the shortest poem they could find. I
                        listened to a lot of declamations of <title level="a">The Tyger.</title>
                        After one semester of this, I changed my evaluation system so that only by
                        choosing a longer poem could one earn the highest grade, sort of like the
                        scoring system for Olympic diving. Students started to be bolder in their
                        choices, and some of them went on to memorize poems beyond the syllabus,
                        committing to memory works that moved them, personally, just so that they
                        could have those words at the ready. I’ve seen former students around
                        campus, and I always ask, do you still have that poem in your mind? Most of
                        them do. </p>
<p>My writing assignments were more effective than the poetry recitation in
                        fostering fluency in the aspirations, methods, and ways of being and knowing
                        that the Romantics embraced. Teaching Romanticism coincided with a certain
                        weariness on my part with respect to the traditional analytic essay. I
                        wanted to find a way for students to write about literature that required
                        them to understand it well enough to adapt it to their own purposes. To that
                        end, the first writing assignment, called “Romantic Imitation,” asked
                        students to write a poem in the form of either <title level="a">The
                            Tyger</title> or <title level="a">I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud.</title>
                        As I explained to them, one way to appreciate the relation of meter to
                        meaning is to attempt to reproduce that meter oneself. I told them that the
                        form had to match one of these two poems, and the content should align with
                        either Blake’s or Wordsworth’s thematic concerns: Christianity, social
                        critique, the ordinary, or recollection, just to name a few. My hope was
                        that students would be inspired by Blake and Wordsworth to apprehend their
                        own lives in a different way. The second part of the assignment required
                        that they write an analysis of their poem, explaining how it was in keeping
                        with one of the two poets’ visions. What this assignment got students to do,
                        in almost every case, was to see moments in their own lives—from buying
                        groceries, to going on a morning run, to remembering childhood—as worthy of
                        poetic contemplation.</p>
<p>Another writing assignment asked students to compare the poetic visions of at
                        least two British Romantics by drawing on the poets’ work in prose. This
                        project evolved over three semesters. The first time, I asked them simply to
                        make a chart comparing and contrasting various poets’ answers to questions
                        like “what is a poet?” and “where does poetry come from?”, as well as “what
                        can poetry contribute to society?” Grading those charts was stultifying. But
                        one submission jolted me to attention. It was a PowerPoint presentation in
                        which the student imagined Ellen DeGeneres putting those questions to
                        Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats. Ellen’s commentary in between responses
                        served as the analysis. The format was brilliant, her innovation hilarious,
                        and the whole project showed me that she understood the poets’ ideas,
                        because she could adapt them to a new context.</p>
<p>The next semester, using that student’s PowerPoint as a model, I modified the
                        assignment so that students had to bring the poets into conversation in some
                        new arena, be it an interview, or perhaps an exchange of letters, or maybe
                        even writing a short play in which two or three of them interact. The
                        requirement was to incorporate the poets’ own words into the new scene while
                        also writing new dialogue that they used analytically to compare and
                        contrast the poets’ ideas. One student made a comic strip story board in
                        which Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats go for a walk together,
                        discussing negative capability and the possibility that poets are the
                        unacknowledged legislators of the world while they wander past a field of
                        daffodils and hear a nightingale calling in the distance. This student wove
                        the poets’ words into a dialogue that highlighted their commonalities while
                        also drawing attention to their differences. Another student wrote a rap
                        battle between Wordsworth and Coleridge (with a special guest appearance by
                        Blake!), after the fashion of MTV’s <title level="a">Wild ‘N Out,</title>
                        with Nick Cannon. From what I gather—I’ve never seen the
                        show—one member of each team is chosen to compete against a member of
                        the other team in a lyrical showdown. Wordsworth started the battle off. <quote>

</quote> When the author and a couple of his classmates performed
                        the entire thing to the instrumental beats of the Houston-based DJ Screw, I
                        was floored. We all were. By translating the Wordsworth and Coleridge
                        relationship into a familiar idiom, he made the poets’ ideas modern and
                        their complicated friendship relatable, taking Wordsworth’s behavior in the
                        historical record and transforming it into the braggadocio for which rappers
                        are well known. It was brilliant.</p>
<p>It was the last assignment in the course, however, that most explicitly asked
                        students to think about elements of Romanticism as potential equipment for
                        living. I asked them to write a listicle—a mix of list and
                        article—that answers the question “how should a person be?” by using
                        the ideas and language of Thoreau, Whitman, or Emerson personally and
                        seriously enough to consider what the writers’ convictions and advice might
                        mean for us today. They didn’t have to be direct about it, though, so long
                        as they got at the question somehow. “So basically,” one student asked, “you
                        want us to write clickbait?” Pretty much, I answered—but intelligent,
                        nerdy clickbait, with quotations, citations, and analysis. Clickbait for
                        English majors. Some of them put their listicles online, using Listly.
                        Others kept it simple, with Word documents or PowerPoints. All of them
                        managed to harness the language of American Romanticism and adapt it to the
                        present, with titles promising to tell us why Emerson should be your
                        therapist, what kind of boyfriend Whitman would make, or why you wouldn’t
                        want to invite Thoreau to your housewarming party. </p>
<p>The titles were classic clickbait, all right, but the substance of each item
                        on the list went far beyond what one would expect from a site like Buzzfeed.
                        The student who wrote about how you might recognize your current paramour as
                        Whitman reincarnated accompanied each item in her list with a GIF. Number
                        four on her list, <title level="a">He Has a God Complex,</title> came with a
                        picture of Kanye West gesticulating against the background of the following
                        words: “Everybody says, ‘Who does he think he is?’ I just told you who I
                        thought I was, a god. That’s who I think I am.” Below the Whitman/West
                        juxtaposition, her own analysis appears, <quote>Other guys stare at the
                            stars and marvel at the universe. Your guy thinks he <emph>is</emph> the
                            universe. Whitman boldly claimed he was “a kosmos” (<title level="m">Song of Myself</title> 497) and although he isn’t a total
                            megalomaniac, his empathy, rejection of shame, and connection with
                            others makes him feel a little special—<emph>prophetically</emph>
                            special. Whitman’s highest worship was his own body, declaring “Divine
                            am I inside and out, and make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from”
                            (524). Try to reason with him all you want, but he’ll just tell
                        you that he can’t “understand who there can be more wonderful than myself”
                        (1281), which is a great argument until it’s his turn to wash the dishes.</quote>
                    Her tone is teasing and familiar, but even as she pokes fun at Whitman for
                        his grandiloquence, she also makes clear that one way to be in the world is
                        to assert that <emph>you are the world</emph>. In her analysis, the student
                        points to the way in which embodiment itself can be sacred.</p>
<p> Other students were more earnest. Another list, <title level="a">Thoreau’s 7
                            New Year’s Resolutions to Rejuvenate Your Life in 2018,</title> included
                        items such as <title level="a">Ditch the Unnecessary Luxuries,</title>
<title level="a">Focus on Your Character Rather Than Your Deeds,</title>
<title level="a">Turn Off the Tech,</title> and <title level="a">Don’t
                            Enslave Yourself to Success and Public Opinion.</title> In mining <title level="m">Walden</title> for advice, the student had found pieces of
                        wisdom she could embrace. The introductory paragraph to her listicle offered
                        Thoreau as a contemporary guru. <quote>Have you ever set out into the new
                            year determined to remodel your life, but found yourself slipping back
                            into the monotony of your old day-to-day routine? Have you struggled in
                            the past to start living the kind of life that allows you to live freely
                            and meaningfully? Oftentimes in drafting resolutions, we focus on making
                            changes in our outer lives, while ignoring the fact that external habits
                            are rooted in internal values. Henry David Thoreau’s ideas and critiques
                            on how a person should live will help you achieve a fresh start in
                            transforming your view of your identity, your purpose, and the way you
                            engage with the world around you.</quote> By way of their listicles,
                        some wry and teasing, others heartfelt, my students managed to convey
                        something enduring about the American Romantics’ proposals about how to live
                        in the world. </p>
<p> Sometimes my nudge toward living romantically was spontaneous, as when I was
                        preparing for the day’s discussion of Emerson’s <title level="a">The
                            American Scholar</title> and I came upon these words: “Man Thinking must
                        not be subdued by his instruments. Books are for the scholar’s idle times.
                        When he can read God directly, the hour is too precious to be wasted in
                        other men's transcripts of their readings” (96). It seemed to me downright
                        criminal to sit there in a classroom to discuss those words, so I didn’t.
                        That day, we sped through the highlights of Emerson’s essay. Then, when one
                        student pointed out this line and answered me accurately when I asked her
                        what it meant, I sent them all out of doors. I told them to wander around
                        campus for the remainder of our time that day, not together, and without
                        their phones. Their only task was to pay attention to what was around them,
                        and, at the end of the day, to email the class their observations.</p>
<p> Seeing the emails pour in was exciting. A lot of students noticed how little
                        they’d noticed before. Many of them paid attention to the squirrels, and the
                        birds, and the trees. Others saw how often their fellow students walk around
                        with earbuds in, tuning out. Many of them simply appreciated the opportunity
                        to be outside without a destination, just being. I took their words and wove
                        them together, erasing individual authorship in the process but coming up
                        with a multivoiced “I”—“Unity in Variety,” as Emerson might say (<title level="m">Nature</title> 52). The next class day, I gave them my collage
                        of their observations, and we read it aloud together. Over the three
                        semesters I did this exercise, which was spontaneous the first time and
                        then, of course, ceased to be, but the students loved it—in sun, in rain,
                        in the early spring chill. Together they wrote,<quote>
<p rend="noCount">I started thinking a lot about presence, and how much
                                of my life I spend existing in a place other than the physical space
                                I am currently occupying. I am always thinking ahead or behind,
                                worrying about the past or the future or both, so much so that the
                                present usually goes unnoticed.</p>
<p rend="noCount">It all reminded me how sometimes it's easy to get lost
                                in what you feel you should be doing, what is expected of you from
                                society, or maybe even trying to find your way in life. Nature,
                                however, has no concept of these kinds of pressures, it just takes
                                life for what it is.</p>
</quote> In feedback surveys, several
                        students cited the day they spent outside as the most valuable of the
                        semester. The best day of class was the day they wandered around alone,
                        without me. I tried not to take it personally.</p>
<p> Given how much they relished being outside, when I taught a course on
                        Transcendentalism, I took my class on a hike at a nearby nature preserve.
                        Seven of them showed up, unused to being out of bed at 10 am on a Saturday
                        and giddy at the prospect of seeing each other off campus. As we made our
                        way through the scrubby cedar forest and into the sunshine, over muddy
                        trails and by meadows of bluebonnets, the students said they wished they
                        could get outside more often. They talked to each other, and to me. Every so
                        often, we stopped and read aloud a piece of Thoreau’s essay <title level="a">Walking.</title> Taking in Thoreau’s words in the classroom is one
                        thing; reading them in the sunshine as we beheld the lake and trees below us
                        was quite another. On the hike, two students climbed a tree. One broke a
                        shoe. Another brought water for the rest of the group. When we got back to
                        the parking lot—muddy, sweaty, tired—the bond among us was
                        warmer and more affectionate than it had been when we set off. We closed
                        with these words of Thoreau’s—“So we saunter toward the Holy Land,
                        till one day the sun shall shine more brightly than ever he has done, shall
                        perchance shine into our minds and hearts, and light up our whole lives with
                        a great awakening light, as warm and serene and golden as on a bankside in
                        autumn”—and said goodbye (280).</p>
<p> Did these nudges move the students toward a different way of being in the
                        world? Yes, in some cases. A few weeks into the semester, I noticed that one
                        student had added a Blake quote to the signature block of his email. Another
                        told me that he’d started carrying a notebook around to jot down ideas and
                        observations, instead of relying on his phone. He said that now when he goes
                        running—he was on the cross-country team—he doesn’t zone out
                        anymore, but looks around him. A third noted, in his final exam booklet,
                        that the class had helped him grow not only as a scholar, but as a person.
                        And a fourth wrote in an email, “At the beginning of the semester when you
                        said that students in the past said that this class changed their life, I
                        didn’t believe you. Now after going through the class, I can definitely say
                        I have a new and better perspective on life.”</p>
<p>I am not alone in my conviction that the poems I care about can offer a path
                        to the good life. In recent years, books prescribing literary or
                        philosophical figures as guides have proliferated, a genre unto themselves.
                        Consider Alain de Botton’s <title level="m">How Proust Can Change Your
                            Life</title>, William Braxton Irvine’s <title level="m">A Guide to the
                            Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</title>, or Sarah Bakewell’s
                            <title level="m">How to Live, or a Life of Montaigne in One Question and
                            Twenty Attempts at an Answer</title>. John Kaag’s <title level="m">Hiking with
                            Nietzsche: On Becoming Who You Are</title> and <title level="m">Sick
                            Souls, Healthy Minds: How William James Can Save Your Life</title> blend
                        analysis with memoir, as do the bibliomemoirs <title level="m">My Life in
                            Middlemarch</title> and <title level="m">A Jane Austen Education: How
                            Six Novels Taught Me About Love, Friendship, and the Things that Really
                            Matter</title>, by Rebecca Mead and William Deresiewicz, respectively.
                        Whether about philosophers or fiction writers, these books share the belief
                        that reading has ethical import. To those inclined to read purely for
                        pleasure, they say that reading can matter. To those trained in the
                        hermeneutics of suspicion, they remind us that we can come to literature in
                        more than one posture, for more than one reason. The practice of
                        bibliotherapy, in which a therapist or teacher and her patients or students
                        discuss fiction in order to provide therapeutic benefit, relies on the
                        possibility that literature can heal. Writing about her experience with
                        bibliotherapy in the <title level="j">New Yorker</title>, Ceridwen Dovey
                        asserts, “In a secular age, I suspect that reading fiction is one of the few
                        remaining paths to transcendence, that elusive state in which the distance
                        between the self and the universe shrinks. Reading fiction makes me lose all
                        sense of self, but at the same time makes me feel most uniquely myself.”
                        Dovey’s observation, which strikes me as Romantic in its own right, aligns
                        with pedagogical currents in the scholarship of teaching and learning that
                        underscore the importance of being “human first, professor second,” so that,
                        in turn, it is our students’ uniqueness, their individual interests and
                        needs, that drives our pedagogies (Davidson).</p>
<p>Still, the question remains, as it always does, of how to embody and transmit
                        these convictions, however deeply held, in the classroom. Tell your students
                        that a bunch of poems have the potential to change their lives, and you’ll
                        be met with skepticism, at best. For me, the answer doesn’t lie in any set
                        of best practices, hacks, or tips. Instead, it comes down to modeling. Spend
                        16 weeks making plain what the literature means to you, giving the
                        students opportunities to internalize and repurpose the ideas they
                        encounter, and it will likely come to mean something to them, too. What I
                        feel most proud of when I reflect on my own teaching British and American
                        Romanticisms is not any particular technique or assignment. It’s that my
                        students and I created a space where it was okay to take things personally.
                        That in itself is an innovation.</p>
