            <p class="noCount">In this essay I relate how a last-minute teaching assignment in an area outside my
               expertise led to a semester of teaching that was, by necessity, spontaneous and experimental,
               and how that first exciting semester set the course for a class that made not only
               poetry, but living itself, an object of critical inquiry. The title of the essay,
               <em>Living Romanticism,</em> indicates what the two aims of the course became: to suggest to my students that
               Romanticism is still alive, and second, to offer Romanticism as a way of living. In
               the essay I describe the evolution of the course, explaining how the various assignments,
               designed to foster fluency in the aspirations, methods, and ways of being and knowing
               the Romantics embraced, emerged and changed over time. By telling the story of how
               encounters with British and American Romantics transformed both me and my students,
               the essay argues that literary studies is a discipline that should, overtly and explicitly,
               aspire to more than the conferral of skills, capacities, and historical knowledge.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Living Romanticism</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>In the fall of 2015, a class I was supposed to teach on contemporary literature didn’t
               make, so my colleague Tim and I batted about other options for me, seeing as I had
               to teach <em>something</em>. “How about this course on the British Romantics?” Tim proposed. Our resident Romanticist
               had recently left our institution, and her course was still on the schedule. Someone
               needed to step in. “Are you up on your Wordsworth?” Tim asked. My immediate response
               was an unequivocal “no.” I am an Americanist by training, and more well versed in
               realism and naturalism than in Romanticism to boot. But because the alternative that
               fall was teaching advanced composition, I dusted off an old Norton and a book by Harold
               Bloom and got to work.</p>
            <p>I’ve been teaching Romanticism in some fashion ever since, whether British or American
               or both. During that time my life has shifted, the world opening up in subtle but
               significant ways, and Romanticism has been both the lever for that shift and the lens
               I perceive it through. The ideas, insights, and language I’ve immersed myself in and
               talked to my students about have given me a vocabulary for stirrings I’ve had since
               I was a child, becoming personal provocations, less definite than a map or a guide,
               but propelling nonetheless. </p>
            <p>This is not how professors are supposed to think about literature. Our training encourages
               us to interpret, analyze, and argue. Instead, I find that my response to the texts
               I teach these days is to <em>feel</em>, first of all, and then to inhabit the literature subjectively in order to test its
               use as “equipment for living,” in the evocative phrase that titles one of Kenneth
               Burke’s essays (Burke, 
               “Literature as Equipment for Living”
               293). As an outsider to the field, I came to Romanticism unencumbered by the debates
               roiling in scholarly journals or by any sense that a particular poem was so canonical
               as to be dull. One might also call that position ignorant or even irresponsible, I
               am aware. But it was my ignorance that made it possible for me to submit to the poems
               in a way I might not have otherwise. I was naïve enough to approach the period uncritically,
               and my uncritical embrace of what the Romantics had to teach me in the fall of 2015
               shaped the way I taught the period from there on out.</p>
            <p>The title of my essay—
               “Living Romanticism”
               —points in two directions. It suggests that Romanticism is still alive, and second,
               it offers Romanticism as a way of living. In what follows, I’ll explain how these
               directions became the pedagogical aims through which I sought to reproduce the practice
               of Romanticism both in the classroom and in my students’ lives. The approach I describe
               below emerged as I taught a course on British and American Romanticisms three times,
               over a period of a year and a half. In this class, my ultimate goal was to pave the
               way for my students to be transformed, as I have been, by their encounters with Blake,
               Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Emerson, Hawthorne, Poe, Thoreau, Whitman,
               Dickinson, and (David Foster) Wallace. A highly canonical lineup to be sure (no surprises
               there), except perhaps for the inclusion of Wallace. It was what we did with them
               that was innovative—or maybe just so rearguard as to be novel these days.</p>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <h2><span class="head">Romanticism Is Still Alive</span></h2>
               <p>My first step, back in 2015 and in the semesters that followed, was to create a mood
                  in the classroom that made the subject we were studying seem current, relevant, and
                  ongoing. Music has been one of the most effective tools in achieving this aim. I use
                  it to create an atmosphere, playing a song in the five minutes or so before class
                  begins and accompanying the song with a PowerPoint with visuals for the day: portraits
                  of the writer, photographs of the landscape they lived in, perhaps a picture of a
                  house, or a gravestone.</p>
               <p>With my own musical library in mind and more than a little help from Google, I assembled
                  a list of songs that took me through all 42 class days. Some of the links were obvious,
                  as with Patti Smith’s 
                  “My Blakean Year”
                  or Iron Maiden’s 
                  “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner”
                  (which I played along with PowerPoint slides of the Gustave Dore woodcuts). Others,
                  less evident, I could explain to my students’ satisfaction: Wilco’s song 
                  “Born Alone”
                  is assembled from fragments of nineteenth-century poetry, including Dickinson’s; U2’s
                  
                  “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For”
                  evokes the restless dissatisfaction of the poet in Shelley’s 
                  “Alastor.”
                  But other connections were more tenuous; the songs were like the literature in mood,
                  but with no direct link. The Avett Brothers’ 
                  “Head Full of Doubt”
                  and a handful of songs by Elliott Smith all evoke, for me, a host of Keatsian paradoxes
                  and tensions by way of intricate songwriting. The Indigo Girls’ 
                  “Prince of Darkness”
                  and Elton John’s 
                  “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters”
                  both extend a generous, open hand to our many-peopled world, much in the spirit of
                  Whitman. James Rovira’s excellent edited volume <em>Rock and Romanticism</em> presents an extended argument about rock music as a renaissance of Romantic thought,
                  exploring the Romanticism inherent in musicians including Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones,
                  and Leonard Cohen. I wasn’t aware of his book at first though; I was riffing.</p>
               <p>Admittedly, many of these choices were, as one student pointed out on a student feedback
                  survey, “subjective.” Of course. But subjectivity was something I leaned into in this
                  class, and I encouraged my students to do the same, looking for ways that, to them,
                  Romanticism was manifest in the world around them. It didn’t take long for the students
                  to join in, emailing me with their suggestions for musical matches to the reading,
                  including Lynard Skynrd’s 
                  “Simple Man”
                  for Thoreau, or Bastille’s 
                  “The Weight of Living Part 1,”
                  with its albatross reference, and plenty of songs I’d never heard of. By the end of
                  the course, we’d collectively assembled a robust playlist of songs that had the power
                  to transport us right back into the poetry and prose we’d explored together.</p>
               <p>While music built an affective bridge from us to the Romantics, the literature itself—and
                  the direction our discussions of it took—was sometimes all that was needed to recognize
                  the persistence and relevance of Romantic concerns in the present. This was the case
                  with Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em>. My students recognized Shelley’s need to defend the literary arts in a climate that
                  applauded technological advances and material progress as a pressing one that has
                  not gone away; in fact, such a defense might be more necessary today than it was in
                  the nineteenth century. Shelley writes, “The cultivation of those sciences which have
                  enlarged the limits of the empire of man over the external world, has, for want of
                  the poetical faculty, proportionally circumscribed those of the internal world; and
                  man, having enslaved the elements, remains himself a slave” (530). Our conversation
                  about these lines assumed a decidedly presentist bent from the get-go, as we talked
                  about the way our smart phones, the internet, and our social media accounts have circumscribed
                  our worlds and limited our powers of observation, even as they have expanded the scope
                  of what we, in theory, can notice and perceive. It was Shelley’s emphasis on perception
                  that moved my students more than anything. In discussion and in their writing assignments,
                  they pointed repeatedly to his assertion that “poetry lifts the veil from the hidden
                  beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar” (517).
                  This, for many of them, was the heart of Romanticism, the preeminent idea that they
                  took away from the class.</p>
               <p>Shelley and Keats also gave my students a new way to think about their education.
                  We discussed at length Shelley’s notion of how the moral imagination develops through
                  the empathetic engagement that literature helps foster. The English majors in my class
                  were familiar with needing to defend their choice of major to their parents, their
                  friends, and themselves. They could rehearse the familiar claims that we humanists
                  make about the value of critical thinking, analysis, clarity of expression, and close
                  reading. They were, in other words, used to taking the practical skills and habits
                  of mind that English studies helps develop and putting them toward some other, more
                  workman-like application: law, journalism, technical writing. What few of them had
                  considered before was Shelley’s claim that reading literature has a moral component.
                  He writes, <span class="quote">‘The great secret of morals is Love; or a going out of our own nature, and an identification
                     of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our
                     own. A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must
                     put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of
                     his species must become his own. The great instrument of moral good is the imagination.
                     (517)’</span> For those students in possession of a traditionally religious sensibility, this passage
                  affirmed for them the goodness of their academic vocation. For those committed to
                  working for social justice, the idea that reading is a way of regarding the pain of
                  others helped them to see what we did in the classroom not as divorced from practice,
                  but essential to it. This portion of the <em>Defence</em> led to conversations about the importance of reading about people who are not like
                  you, even about people whom you may not like. It led us to consider what limits can
                  be placed on empathetic identification, whether some perspectives are more worthy
                  of our time and effort than others. Should we bother reading a short story written
                  from the point of view of a racist sheriff, like James Baldwin’s 
                  “Going to Meet the Man,”
                  or is our time better spent in imaginative dedication with a victim of racism? What
                  is the value—or is there one?—of inhabiting a point of view we find repellant? It
                  also got my students to reconsider literature they had heretofore thought of as “apolitical,”
                  for they began to think of seeing through other eyes as one of the most intimate,
                  and enduring, political acts at hand.</p>
               <p>Keats followed Shelley in my syllabus, so when we got to his letter to his brother
                  and sister-in-law demarcated in the Norton as 
                  “The Vale of Soul-Making,”
                  they were primed to consider the question that critic William Deresiewicz, invoking
                  Keats, raises in his book <em>Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite</em>. To what degree do our institutions of higher learning encourage the development
                  of the ethical and moral components of the self (Deresiewicz 13–15, 77–87)? The university
                  I teach at is not educating the American elite. Still, my students were eager to discuss
                  Keats’s notion of the world as a “vale of Soul-making” and to think about the role
                  their classroom educations had played shaping and refining their emotional, moral,
                  and ethical intelligences (117). Their answer, mainly, was that this facet of education
                  was rarely foregrounded in the classes they had taken. In exploring Shelley’s and
                  Keats’s ideas about the centrality of literature to human flourishing, community,
                  and ethics, however, my students became inspired to make those kinds of connections
                  themselves. For many of them, a link that had been tenuous or implicit became visible,
                  and thereby plastic. Shelley and Keats empowered my students to take more responsibility
                  for their educations and to make the cultivation of their very <em>person</em> a central part of that process.</p>
               <p>At the end of this course, I fast forward to the twenty-first century as a way of
                  demonstrating to my students that even though we can demarcate the Romantic period
                  temporally, a certain Romantic sensibility, set of concerns, and philosophical or
                  spiritual posture that is Romantic in nature persists in present-day literature and
                  culture. To illustrate the point, I turn to David Foster Wallace’s Kenyon commencement
                  address—a short, pithy text that contains links back to many of the thinkers we’ve
                  studied. Wallace, a picture boy for postmodernism, is also, I submit, a closet Romantic,
                  more earnest than ironic. Most of my students haven’t heard of David Foster Wallace
                  in the first place, so they don’t need me to persuade them of this reclassification,
                  and when they turn to his commencement address from 2005, the links are apparent enough.
                  Here he is, concerned, like Shelley and Keats, with the moral dimensions of education.
                  Wallace is keen to demonstrate the limits of a liberal arts education and to propose
                  that we all go further, learning not just how to think, but what to think about—a
                  proposal that Thoreau voices, albeit in different phrasing, throughout <em>Walden</em>. Like Coleridge, Wallace suffered, trapped by his own perspective and a frequently
                  recurring sense of numbness and distance from the world. Wallace confronts the despair-inducing
                  potential of everyday life and challenges his audience to transform that life, and
                  themselves, through empathy and imagination. In his climactic call to action, he sounds
                  downright mystical, evoking Whitman and Emerson, to be sure, if not Blake, when he
                  challenges us to pay attention so that it will be within our power to “experience
                  a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred,
                  on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness
                  of all things deep down” (93).</p>
               <p>The closing exercise for this course on British and American Romanticisms, which we
                  turn to immediately after discussing Wallace, is an activity I named the “Whither
                  Romanticism?” forum. At the beginning of the semester, I challenge my students to
                  keep their eyes and ears open for Romantic artifacts in our contemporary culture,
                  and at the end, they share their findings with the class. As I put it to my students,
                  the idea is to ask whether, how, and to what degree Romanticism persists in the present
                  day. Is it a literary movement that ended in the nineteenth century, or is it a transhistorical
                  movement, a structure of feeling that grows out of specific circumstances? If it’s
                  the latter—and, obviously, this exercise presupposes an answer to that question—what
                  might those circumstances be? We take one class day for three-minute presentations
                  on the artifacts—quick, clear, and concise. Then the next class day is devoted to
                  a wide-ranging conversation about Romanticism emerging from the archive they assemble.</p>
               <p>Most students did not struggle to come up with an artifact; in fact, many had trouble
                  limiting themselves to one. It was no surprise to me that many students chose music,
                  given the nudge I’d provided by framing each class day with a song. The rapper Tyler
                  the Creator appeared more than once across the three semesters, as did David Bowie
                  and the singer-songwriter India Arie. I can always seem to count on interest in the
                  Gothic; at least one student each semester chose a TV show or movie in that genre
                  to talk about. Two of the more intriguing contributions over the years were Instagram—a
                  technology that aestheticizes ordinary objects of everyday life—and the blog <em>Humans of New York</em>, which, à la Whitman and Wordsworth, trains its focus on regular people thus rendering
                  them marvelous in their specificity and uniqueness.</p>
               <p>This exercise made my students feel like experts on Romanticism, able to apply what
                  they’d learned about the nineteenth century to culture in the twenty-first. On the
                  second day of our forum, I challenged them to consider what the artifacts they’d assembled
                  could tell us about the connections between Romanticism and capitalism, race, gender,
                  and politics. One semester, there were at least three Disney films submitted as Romantic
                  artifacts, which raised the question of whether Romanticism has been coopted by the
                  culture industry, repackaged and sold back to us and our children in the form of movie
                  tickets and plush toys. (My students were less troubled by this possibility than I.)
                  Was Romanticism available to people of color and to white women, who, by and large,
                  were missing from our syllabus? My students felt that it was, and demonstrated as
                  much through their analyses of songs by Kendrick Lamar and Joanna Newsom. One semester,
                  with visible trepidation, a student posed this question, “Is there something Romantic
                  about MAGA?” Her question, which she feared would offend or inflame her classmates,
                  led instead to a productive conversation about the function of nostalgia in both Romantic
                  thinking and contemporary politics. </p>
               <p>An exercise like this—and a presentist approach like mine—risks collapsing the temporal
                  distance of two centuries, potentially flattening out the historical specificity of
                  both our moment and the Romantics’. I’m okay with that. From my perspective, what
                  we have to gain by becoming intimate with the past outweighs what is lost.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Romanticism as a Way of Living</span></h2>
               <p>How can a teacher encourage students to experiment with Romanticism as a way of living,
                  in and outside of the classroom? I didn’t set out to do that at first. Only after
                  I taught Romanticism a couple of times did it become apparent to me that I was, in
                  fact, presenting Romanticism as a way of being in the world, one that I promoted through
                  my assignments and activities. And once I realized that, I made my purpose explicit,
                  both to myself and to my students.</p>
               <p>One assignment that I came to hope might change the way my students and I inhabited
                  the world was the requirement to memorize and deliver a (Romantic) poem. Inspired
                  by an article in the <em>New York Times </em> that ran in August 2017, 
                  “Memorize that Poem!,”
                  by Molly Worthen, I added the poetry recitation assignment to the syllabus right at
                  the beginning of the semester, an impulsive last-minute addition. I wanted them to
                  internalize a poem—to live with its words in their head. Speaking for myself, I’m
                  sometimes alarmed by the sheer number of 1980s and 1990s rap lyrics I have at my command,
                  yet there’s no Keats in my mental library, no Wordsworth, and hardly any Dickinson.
                  That, I decided, had to change. How might my vision of the world be transformed if
                  I could summon the words of those poets at will?</p>
               <p>I told my students that I would memorize along with them; I wasn’t going to make them
                  do something I myself was unwilling to do. So, I started small and built up, eventually
                  going for broke with Wordsworth’s 
                  “Ode: Intimations of Immortality Upon Recollections of Childhood”
                  (I still have a few stanzas of that one to go). This practice did, indeed, shift my
                  way of being in the world. I carried stanzas of Blake with me on my runs, the trochees
                  matching my footfalls. I whispered 
                  “Frost at Midnight”
                  to myself while watching my daughter on the playground. I ran over Wordsworth when
                  stuck in a traffic jam. Now, even though I’m taking a break from this practice, phrases
                  will float up into my consciousness when I need them, offering a slightly different
                  way of seeing things, a gloss on my understanding.</p>
               <p>From what I can tell, it didn’t exactly work that way with my students. Predictably,
                  many of them chose the shortest poem they could find. I listened to a lot of declamations
                  of 
                  “The Tyger.”
                  After one semester of this, I changed my evaluation system so that only by choosing
                  a longer poem could one earn the highest grade, sort of like the scoring system for
                  Olympic diving. Students started to be bolder in their choices, and some of them went
                  on to memorize poems beyond the syllabus, committing to memory works that moved them,
                  personally, just so that they could have those words at the ready. I’ve seen former
                  students around campus, and I always ask, do you still have that poem in your mind?
                  Most of them do.</p>
               <p>My writing assignments were more effective than the poetry recitation in fostering
                  fluency in the aspirations, methods, and ways of being and knowing that the Romantics
                  embraced. Teaching Romanticism coincided with a certain weariness on my part with
                  respect to the traditional analytic essay. I wanted to find a way for students to
                  write about literature that required them to understand it well enough to adapt it
                  to their own purposes. To that end, the first writing assignment, called “Romantic
                  Imitation,” asked students to write a poem in the form of either 
                  “The Tyger”
                  or 
                  “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud.”
                  As I explained to them, one way to appreciate the relation of meter to meaning is
                  to attempt to reproduce that meter oneself. I told them that the form had to match
                  one of these two poems, and the content should align with either Blake’s or Wordsworth’s
                  thematic concerns: Christianity, social critique, the ordinary, or recollection, just
                  to name a few. My hope was that students would be inspired by Blake and Wordsworth
                  to apprehend their own lives in a different way. The second part of the assignment
                  required that they write an analysis of their poem, explaining how it was in keeping
                  with one of the two poets’ visions. What this assignment got students to do, in almost
                  every case, was to see moments in their own lives—from buying groceries, to going
                  on a morning run, to remembering childhood—as worthy of poetic contemplation.</p>
               <p>Another writing assignment asked students to compare the poetic visions of at least
                  two British Romantics by drawing on the poets’ work in prose. This project evolved
                  over three semesters. The first time, I asked them simply to make a chart comparing
                  and contrasting various poets’ answers to questions like “what is a poet?” and “where
                  does poetry come from?”, as well as “what can poetry contribute to society?” Grading
                  those charts was stultifying. But one submission jolted me to attention. It was a
                  PowerPoint presentation in which the student imagined Ellen DeGeneres putting those
                  questions to Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats. Ellen’s commentary in between responses
                  served as the analysis. The format was brilliant, her innovation hilarious, and the
                  whole project showed me that she understood the poets’ ideas, because she could adapt
                  them to a new context.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The next semester, using that student’s PowerPoint as a model, I modified the assignment
                     so that students had to bring the poets into conversation in some new arena, be it
                     an interview, or perhaps an exchange of letters, or maybe even writing a short play
                     in which two or three of them interact. The requirement was to incorporate the poets’
                     own words into the new scene while also writing new dialogue that they used analytically
                     to compare and contrast the poets’ ideas. One student made a comic strip story board
                     in which Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats go for a walk together, discussing
                     negative capability and the possibility that poets are the unacknowledged legislators
                     of the world while they wander past a field of daffodils and hear a nightingale calling
                     in the distance. This student wove the poets’ words into a dialogue that highlighted
                     their commonalities while also drawing attention to their differences. Another student
                     wrote a rap battle between Wordsworth and Coleridge (with a special guest appearance
                     by Blake!), after the fashion of MTV’s 
                     “Wild ‘N Out,”
                      with Nick Cannon. From what I gather—I’ve never seen the show—one member of each team
                     is chosen to compete against a member of the other team in a lyrical showdown. Wordsworth
                     started the battle off.

                     beats of the Houston-based DJ Screw, I was floored. We all were. By translating the
                     Wordsworth and Coleridge relationship into a familiar idiom, he made the poets’ ideas
                     modern and their complicated friendship relatable, taking Wordsworth’s behavior in
                     the historical record and transforming it into the braggadocio for which rappers are
                     well known. It was brilliant.</p>
               </div>
               <p>It was the last assignment in the course, however, that most explicitly asked students
                  to think about elements of Romanticism as potential equipment for living. I asked
                  them to write a listicle—a mix of list and article—that answers the question “how
                  should a person be?” by using the ideas and language of Thoreau, Whitman, or Emerson
                  personally and seriously enough to consider what the writers’ convictions and advice
                  might mean for us today. They didn’t have to be direct about it, though, so long as
                  they got at the question somehow. “So basically,” one student asked, “you want us
                  to write clickbait?” Pretty much, I answered—but intelligent, nerdy clickbait, with
                  quotations, citations, and analysis. Clickbait for English majors. Some of them put
                  their listicles online, using Listly. Others kept it simple, with Word documents or
                  PowerPoints. All of them managed to harness the language of American Romanticism and
                  adapt it to the present, with titles promising to tell us why Emerson should be your
                  therapist, what kind of boyfriend Whitman would make, or why you wouldn’t want to
                  invite Thoreau to your housewarming party. </p>
               <p>The titles were classic clickbait, all right, but the substance of each item on the
                  list went far beyond what one would expect from a site like Buzzfeed. The student
                  who wrote about how you might recognize your current paramour as Whitman reincarnated
                  accompanied each item in her list with a GIF. Number four on her list, 
                  “He Has a God Complex,”
                  came with a picture of Kanye West gesticulating against the background of the following
                  words: “Everybody says, ‘Who does he think he is?’ I just told you who I thought I
                  was, a god. That’s who I think I am.” Below the Whitman/West juxtaposition, her own
                  analysis appears, <span class="quote">‘Other guys stare at the stars and marvel at the universe. Your guy thinks he <em>is</em> the universe. Whitman boldly claimed he was “a kosmos” (<em>Song of Myself</em> 497) and although he isn’t a total megalomaniac, his empathy, rejection of shame,
                     and connection with others makes him feel a little special—<em>prophetically</em> special. Whitman’s highest worship was his own body, declaring “Divine am I inside
                     and out, and make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from” (524). Try to reason with
                     him all you want, but he’ll just tell you that he can’t “understand who there can
                     be more wonderful than myself” (1281), which is a great argument until it’s his turn
                     to wash the dishes.’</span> Her tone is teasing and familiar, but even as she pokes fun at Whitman for his grandiloquence,
                  she also makes clear that one way to be in the world is to assert that <em>you are the world</em>. In her analysis, the student points to the way in which embodiment itself can be
                  sacred.</p>
               <p>Other students were more earnest. Another list, 
                  “Thoreau’s 7 New Year’s Resolutions to Rejuvenate Your Life in 2018,”
                  included items such as 
                  “Ditch the Unnecessary Luxuries,”
                  
                  “Focus on Your Character Rather Than Your Deeds,”
                  
                  “Turn Off the Tech,”
                  and 
                  “Don’t Enslave Yourself to Success and Public Opinion.”
                  In mining <em>Walden</em> for advice, the student had found pieces of wisdom she could embrace. The introductory
                  paragraph to her listicle offered Thoreau as a contemporary guru. <span class="quote">‘Have you ever set out into the new year determined to remodel your life, but found
                     yourself slipping back into the monotony of your old day-to-day routine? Have you
                     struggled in the past to start living the kind of life that allows you to live freely
                     and meaningfully? Oftentimes in drafting resolutions, we focus on making changes in
                     our outer lives, while ignoring the fact that external habits are rooted in internal
                     values. Henry David Thoreau’s ideas and critiques on how a person should live will
                     help you achieve a fresh start in transforming your view of your identity, your purpose,
                     and the way you engage with the world around you.’</span> By way of their listicles, some wry and teasing, others heartfelt, my students managed
                  to convey something enduring about the American Romantics’ proposals about how to
                  live in the world.</p>
               <p>Sometimes my nudge toward living romantically was spontaneous, as when I was preparing
                  for the day’s discussion of Emerson’s 
                  “The American Scholar”
                  and I came upon these words: “Man Thinking must not be subdued by his instruments.
                  Books are for the scholar’s idle times. When he can read God directly, the hour is
                  too precious to be wasted in other men's transcripts of their readings” (96). It seemed
                  to me downright criminal to sit there in a classroom to discuss those words, so I
                  didn’t. That day, we sped through the highlights of Emerson’s essay. Then, when one
                  student pointed out this line and answered me accurately when I asked her what it
                  meant, I sent them all out of doors. I told them to wander around campus for the remainder
                  of our time that day, not together, and without their phones. Their only task was
                  to pay attention to what was around them, and, at the end of the day, to email the
                  class their observations.</p>
               <p>Seeing the emails pour in was exciting. A lot of students noticed how little they’d
                  noticed before. Many of them paid attention to the squirrels, and the birds, and the
                  trees. Others saw how often their fellow students walk around with earbuds in, tuning
                  out. Many of them simply appreciated the opportunity to be outside without a destination,
                  just being. I took their words and wove them together, erasing individual authorship
                  in the process but coming up with a multivoiced “I”—“Unity in Variety,” as Emerson
                  might say (<em>Nature</em> 52). The next class day, I gave them my collage of their observations, and we read
                  it aloud together. Over the three semesters I did this exercise, which was spontaneous
                  the first time and then, of course, ceased to be, but the students loved it—in sun,
                  in rain, in the early spring chill. Together they wrote,</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p class="noCount">I started thinking a lot about presence, and how much of my life I spend existing
                     in a place other than the physical space I am currently occupying. I am always thinking
                     ahead or behind, worrying about the past or the future or both, so much so that the
                     present usually goes unnoticed.</p> 
                  <p class="noCount">It all reminded me how sometimes it's easy to get lost in what you feel you should
                     be doing, what is expected of you from society, or maybe even trying to find your
                     way in life. Nature, however, has no concept of these kinds of pressures, it just
                     takes life for what it is.</p>
               </blockquote>
               <p> In feedback surveys, several students cited the day they spent outside as the most
                  valuable of the semester. The best day of class was the day they wandered around alone,
                  without me. I tried not to take it personally.</p>
               <p>Given how much they relished being outside, when I taught a course on Transcendentalism,
                  I took my class on a hike at a nearby nature preserve. Seven of them showed up, unused
                  to being out of bed at 10 am on a Saturday and giddy at the prospect of seeing each
                  other off campus. As we made our way through the scrubby cedar forest and into the
                  sunshine, over muddy trails and by meadows of bluebonnets, the students said they
                  wished they could get outside more often. They talked to each other, and to me. Every
                  so often, we stopped and read aloud a piece of Thoreau’s essay 
                  “Walking.”
                  Taking in Thoreau’s words in the classroom is one thing; reading them in the sunshine
                  as we beheld the lake and trees below us was quite another. On the hike, two students
                  climbed a tree. One broke a shoe. Another brought water for the rest of the group.
                  When we got back to the parking lot—muddy, sweaty, tired—the bond among us was warmer
                  and more affectionate than it had been when we set off. We closed with these words
                  of Thoreau’s—“So we saunter toward the Holy Land, till one day the sun shall shine
                  more brightly than ever he has done, shall perchance shine into our minds and hearts,
                  and light up our whole lives with a great awakening light, as warm and serene and
                  golden as on a bankside in autumn”—and said goodbye (280).</p>
               <p>Did these nudges move the students toward a different way of being in the world? Yes,
                  in some cases. A few weeks into the semester, I noticed that one student had added
                  a Blake quote to the signature block of his email. Another told me that he’d started
                  carrying a notebook around to jot down ideas and observations, instead of relying
                  on his phone. He said that now when he goes running—he was on the cross-country team—he
                  doesn’t zone out anymore, but looks around him. A third noted, in his final exam booklet,
                  that the class had helped him grow not only as a scholar, but as a person. And a fourth
                  wrote in an email, “At the beginning of the semester when you said that students in
                  the past said that this class changed their life, I didn’t believe you. Now after
                  going through the class, I can definitely say I have a new and better perspective
                  on life.”</p>
               <p>I am not alone in my conviction that the poems I care about can offer a path to the
                  good life. In recent years, books prescribing literary or philosophical figures as
                  guides have proliferated, a genre unto themselves. Consider Alain de Botton’s <em>How Proust Can Change Your Life</em>, William Braxton Irvine’s <em>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</em>, or Sarah Bakewell’s <em>How to Live, or a Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer</em>. John Kaag’s <em>Hiking with Nietzsche: On Becoming Who You Are</em> and <em>Sick Souls, Healthy Minds: How William James Can Save Your Life</em> blend analysis with memoir, as do the bibliomemoirs <em>My Life in Middlemarch</em> and <em>A Jane Austen Education: How Six Novels Taught Me About Love, Friendship, and the
                     Things that Really Matter</em>, by Rebecca Mead and William Deresiewicz, respectively. Whether about philosophers
                  or fiction writers, these books share the belief that reading has ethical import.
                  To those inclined to read purely for pleasure, they say that reading can matter. To
                  those trained in the hermeneutics of suspicion, they remind us that we can come to
                  literature in more than one posture, for more than one reason. The practice of bibliotherapy,
                  in which a therapist or teacher and her patients or students discuss fiction in order
                  to provide therapeutic benefit, relies on the possibility that literature can heal.
                  Writing about her experience with bibliotherapy in the <em>New Yorker</em>, Ceridwen Dovey asserts, “In a secular age, I suspect that reading fiction is one
                  of the few remaining paths to transcendence, that elusive state in which the distance
                  between the self and the universe shrinks. Reading fiction makes me lose all sense
                  of self, but at the same time makes me feel most uniquely myself.” Dovey’s observation,
                  which strikes me as Romantic in its own right, aligns with pedagogical currents in
                  the scholarship of teaching and learning that underscore the importance of being “human
                  first, professor second,” so that, in turn, it is our students’ uniqueness, their
                  individual interests and needs, that drives our pedagogies (Davidson).</p>
               <p>Still, the question remains, as it always does, of how to embody and transmit these
                  convictions, however deeply held, in the classroom. Tell your students that a bunch
                  of poems have the potential to change their lives, and you’ll be met with skepticism,
                  at best. For me, the answer doesn’t lie in any set of best practices, hacks, or tips.
                  Instead, it comes down to modeling. Spend 16 weeks making plain what the literature
                  means to you, giving the students opportunities to internalize and repurpose the ideas
                  they encounter, and it will likely come to mean something to them, too. What I feel
                  most proud of when I reflect on my own teaching British and American Romanticisms
                  is not any particular technique or assignment. It’s that my students and I created
                  a space where it was okay to take things personally. That in itself is an innovation.</p>
