               to further experience and preserve literature. We should present students with the
               opportunity to not only experience these memorable works using their tongues and in
               new mediums but also analyze them as originals and translations, and therefore synthesize
               the imaginative renderings of the Romantic period with our present imaginative possibilities
               and technological capabilities, experimenting, as readers–listeners–performers, with
               the affective force of sound as we perceive its function, modernize expressions of

                     and Their Recitations and Auditory Translations</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>William Wordsworth knew the association of sound, language, and affect was poetically
               valuable and used it to his advantage in the creation of acoustic ecologies. He showcases
               acoustic aesthetics in his poetry through the speech acts of characters, dialogic
               interaction with audiences, and recitations, creating acoustic ecologies of Romanticism
               while advancing future ones. Because acoustic ecologies occupy a central presence
               in his narrative poems, I call for consideration of the power of speech and sound
               in the teaching of Romantic poetry and insist that students learn the task of close
               listening, becoming readers–listeners–performers in their literary study.</p>
            <p>I value speech acts and sound in poetry and suggest that students of Romanticism be
               taught to listen closely to the acoustic ecology of Wordsworth as embedded in theirs.
               In so doing, they will find that poetry exists as innumerable, layered soundscapes
               in and beyond textual spaces. If students are taught to understand poetry as synthetic
               and sounded, they will interact with poetry to comprehend how poets move readers between
               and across patterns of organization and perception to showcase many aspects of their
               works as sound art. Wordsworth’s poetics is at the core of my theory, but I propose
               the practice of my theory more broadly as a pedagogical method. I encourage a consideration
               of the possibilities of sound in Romantic poetry and what technologies past and present
               might offer in terms of reciting, analyzing, translating, remixing, performing, and
               preserving Romantic poetry in and for the future.</p>
            <p>Teaching students the value of speech acts and importance of recitation begins with
               an introduction to the history of thinking about language that existed before Romantics
               were composing and reciting, a history that widely contributed to Romantic poetics.
               According to the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher Henry Home, Lord Kames, “speech
               is the most . . . powerful of all the means by which one human being can display itself
               to another” (1: 43). Teaching Romantic poetry with a focus on the important influence
               of rational beings stirring emotions through speech means engaging with theories and
               practices of audition and recitation. In the seventeenth century, linguistic theories
               and practices in England were concerned with connections of speech to thought. According
               to Murray Cohen, language at this time could be studied as an object, and “the relationship
               between language and reality . . . [was] sought in the physical parts of writing and
               speech—letters and sounds” (7). Seventeenth-century treatises on the physicality of
               speech reinforced the importance of sound in making meaning. Owen Price’s <em>The Vocal Organ</em> was one of many texts that “provided a scheme visualizing the physiology of sounds
               . . . [to] propose an articulatory phonetics based on an ordered, elemented, and evident
               arrangement of the speech organs” (Cohen 11). These speech organs are in part how
               the body produces language sounds. Language exists through the complexities of one’s
               speech organs, and these organs make articulations audible in distinct ways. While
               a conceivably obvious point, acknowledging the body’s critical role in linguistics
               illumines the relationship between live Romantic articulations, the imagination, and
               transformation. Connecting acts of the mouth—the body, past and present—to the intellectual
               quickness of the mind and to broader assemblages of mouths-bodies-minds is necessary
               to move Romantic poetry through and beyond individual, private notions toward understanding
               that acknowledges not only isolated incidents of human transformation in nature but
               conversion of the collective consciousness through public sphere revolution, a sphere
               just as natural to humanity. Christopher Cooper’s <em>The English Teacher</em> is another text increasing awareness to this possibility. A schoolmaster, Cooper
               sought to impose rules through his “detailed descriptions of physical sounds” and
               “alphabetized lists” concerning phonology and phonetics: “he finds the possibilities
               of language in the ‘powers’ of characters” (Cohen 13). Cooper’s work, as with Price’s,
               pulls language away from its intangible status into a more tangible reality—one more
               sounded, heard, felt, and participatory.</p>
            <p>As with most treatises during this time, these texts were concerned with linguistic
               inquiry as a site for knowledge making. Including excerpts from these treatises on
               a course syllabus could be quite useful, not only for contextualizing the period prior
               to Romanticism which would help students understand the era’s engagement with linguistic
               inquiry, but also for vivifying soundscapes of the Romantic imagination. These treatises
               can be used for dislocating the silent practice of reading Romantic poetry and creating
               physical articulations through recitation and mouth movements vocalizing the powers
               of characters. Making students aware of the embodiment of language can help us understand
               diversity historically. Not everyone will articulate the same, and different sounds
               produce diverse aesthetic responses and shifts in meaning. We could study patterns
               that appear across the student body, note variances and illuminate problems, blind
               spots, and exclusive markers that led to further linguistic thought that Romantic
               poets were working through, with, and against.</p>
            <p>With such background, students will better understand that seventeenth-century linguists’
               interests in the materiality of language and its association with thought led to eighteenth-century
               interests in the rhetorical and affective possibilities associated with language and
               communication. During the eighteenth century, oral emphasis became the dominant concern
               in linguistics, and conveying understanding through recitation was key. John Rice’s
               <em>An Introduction to the Art of Reading</em> represents the view that recitation could “evoke the relationship between thought
               and speech” and transfer sentiment from speaker to interlocutor (Cohen 105). According
               to Cohen, the linguistic ability to transfer sentiment depended on the “competence
               of the speaker rather than on qualities embedded in the language,” but it was accepted
               that individuals could use their “distinctive linguistic features” to this end (106).
               The “arrangement of voice inflexions and pauses” could “express each sentence with
               appropriate ‘passion or emotion’” and shifted the study of language as object to the
               study of the mind (Cohen 106–7). This lean toward psychology signaled a change in
               how the affective function of language could materialize—and articulatory phonetics
               emerged. Articulatory phonetics was concerned with sounds, including “discussions
               of basic sounds, emphasis, pause, modulation, articulation, accent, pronunciation,
               quantity, and tone” (Cohen 110). During this shift, lecturer Benjamin Martin, important
               for his role in advancing knowledge about the ear and auditory processing, published
               <em>Institutions of Language</em>, which contains his 
               “Physico–Grammatical Essay on the Propriety and Rationale of the English Tongue”
               and includes a section wherein he “discusses each letter in terms of the physiology
               of its pronunciation” (Cohen 112). Texts, such as Martin’s, are evidence of theories
               of language that perceived speech as social and affective. Additional publications
               proliferated and emphasized pleasure’s role in communication, as elocutionist Thomas
               Sheridan’s oeuvre reveals (Cohen 112–14). The importance of linguistic sounds in the
               eighteenth century led some to instruct speech pronunciation by graphically specifying
               sounds using a system of notation modeled on musical notation which could, in addition
               to marking speech emphasis, confront “defects by comparing the voice to a musical
               instrument” (Cohen 116). This system was also used to record printed information.</p>
            <p>As the auditory imagination functions differently for each reader, teaching historical
               attention to articulatory phonetics would allow for more concrete yet diverse engagement
               with the sounds of printed texts. Students could produce their creative renderings,
               or auditory translations, of texts and recorded pieces using notation systems created
               in the past. Noelle Chao discusses the sonic qualities of printed words in her work,
               which focuses on the British plantation owner Joshua Steele who, in his 1775 <em>Essay Towards Establishing the Melody and Measure of Speech</em>, outlined “a complex system for recording the voice in print, involving, among other
               things, a modified musical staff with extra divisions of pitch and rhythm, and a range
               of additional markings to indicate emphasis and force” (245). Chao’s work addresses
               a gap in research on recording technology and claims that while the historical narrative
               depends on the nineteenth century and its technological advancements as the point
               of origin for recording, in fact, the “eighteenth-century writings on music and elocution
               developed their . . . logic of recording through the medium of print” (258). Students
               could devise systems like Steele’s, whose methods, deemed implausible by some critics,
               were embraced by a select few who supported “conveying sound through the medium of
               print” using “written markings that could reliably and accurately communicate specific
               sounds” (Chao 247). Chao argues that “for scholars today, . . . [Steele’s] technology
               for recording has the potential to amplify eighteenth-century practices of reading
               and listening, practices made nearly impossible to hear or imagine by modern advances
               in sound preservation” (247). Therefore, we should be encouraging students to design
               similar methods of capturing poetic sounds, speech sounds, and soundscapes embedded
               in Romantic poetry. In this way, students participate in what Julia S. Carlson calls
               “the voicing of print” to “discover their measure” (2). This “democratic access to
               . . . measures,” which John Thelwall supported for blank verse at the time of <em>The Excursion</em>, according to Carlson, would teach students to initiate or participate in sound preservation
               (3). With today’s technological apparatuses, students could reinvent the process to
               create imaginative multimodal recordings and translations of Romantic texts, take
               elocution into consideration, and synthesize past recording technologies with those
               of the present.</p>
            <p>Romantic poetry should be examined through the lens of elocutionary theory as it relates
               to the sound of speech acts and their effects. This lens offers innovative approaches
               to understanding Romanticism and results in students not only understanding the language
               of texts but also the rhetorical acts of original recitations and future possible
               performance translations. Judith Thompson insists that while “much remains to be done
               to recover and re-evaluate elocutionary history and theory in relation to Romanticism,”
               attention has begun to shift toward “actual circumstances and active effects of particular
               speech acts, utterances, genres, and performances” (23). Instead of approaching Romantic
               poetry only by linking the linguistic to the thematic, I suggest that we teach students
               of Romantic poetry to examine the linguistic using Romantic theories of hearing and
               philosophies of sound. Roman Jakobson in “Linguistics and Poetics” “distinguished
               the context (circumstances described in the message) from the code (the language system
               that lets the message be put into words),” and Andrew Elfenbein writes that “most
               literary scholarship on language absorbs code into context, rather than recognizing
               its potential autonomy” (4). Examining code on its merits forces close engagement
               with the language system (i.e., speech sounds), influences the context, and vivifies
               poetic soundscapes. </p>
            <p>To consider Romantic poetry on these terms, I envision a reader who advances what
               Elfenbein calls the “impression of style” (41). Consideration must be given to the
               kind of reader Wordsworth visualized as he apprised his “Reader” of his style and
               intent to “look steadily” at his “subject” in the preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (600). Wordsworth unlikely chose “subject” for only its connotations of topic. Rather,
               he was thinking about the whole of his work in relation to its parts by considering
               the “subject” position of his “Reader.” His preface and other paratext serve a similar
               function to produce readers who know their parts but who also submit to poetic authority.
               Subject in every sense is recognized, and Wordsworth anticipates readers who accommodate
               him and realize the score in conjunction with their contributions. As Noelle Chao
               informs us, Steele writes of such a reader in <em>Essay</em> and <em>Prosodia Rationalis</em>: <span class="quote">‘The reader of such printed symbols is understood to be not only a reader who processes
                  printed text in a silent, sonic vacuum, but a reader–listener, who is able to hear
                  what is being communicated in print within . . . [the] mind’s eye. This reader–listener
                  is often cast as a reader–listener–performer, whom the writer anticipates will rehearse
                  the sounds captured within the text. (258)’</span> Adopting the term reader–listener–performer for students of Romanticism makes sense.
               Wordsworth was himself a reader–listener–performer, well known to have composed lines
               of verse orally while walking in nature where public and/or private audiences were
               attending and listening, leaving behind a methodology for his words to be conveyed
               by his readers–listeners–performers through an understanding of audition and the affective
               force of sound. Of course, I do not suggest that we teach students to become Wordsworth
               in their auditory/performance translations, but I do suggest the importance of understanding
               Romantic poetry in terms of accepting the importance of readers’ subject positions
               as they express the whole of poems in auditory/performance translations.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, readers should balance self-perception of their sonic environments,
               both created and actual, as well as the acoustic ecologies created in the lines of
               Romantic poems. With this layered sense of perception, sonic environments of the poets’
               created audible worlds become less textual, more active soundscapes. Stressing imaginative
               interaction, Noel Jackson writes about Wordsworth and his “claim for the sensuous
               vitality of imaginative narration,” noting that Lord Kames’s term “ideal presence”
               delineated “the active status of imaginative things in the mind” (85). Wordsworth
               and Kames share the belief in the mind’s ability to activate sensation. Jackson explains
               that “ideal presence at once simulates and substitutes for physical sense-perception;
               this literary effect reproduces the potent effects of sensation without sharing in
               the limitations that bind it to one body, thereby preventing its communication to
               others” (85–86). Created acoustic ecologies, considered through Kames’s ideal presence,
               would function as sonic environments wherein one could have “an embodied experience
               wholly independent of external stimuli” (Jackson 86). This account theorizes “the
               signature effect of powerful imaginative representation” and “render[s] . . . the
               sensuous presence of the past” (Jackson 86). Adding the representation and rendering
               of the past with the present renderings complicates the sonic landscape, or soundscape,
               of the poetry, but accepting Kames’s ideal presence along with students’ auditory
               translations of the texts opens up the poetry to fresh conceptions of poetic sound.
               This exploration allows for an understanding of acoustic ecologies that reinforces
               embodiment and direct perception and permits the unbinding of poetry from not only
               one body but also one imaginative representation. It lets students participate more
               creatively in poetry and thus participate more fully in the expressive utterance of
               the poem, by embodying speech, thought, and feeling together through words on their
               tongues. This participation allows them to experience Romantic poetry as an embodied
               force always agitating others through utterance. The method teaches that acoustic
               codes are not stable but subjective, and that such a reality should not negatively
               affect analytical import. </p>
            <p>These systems reproduced in a classroom allow for critical engagement with student
               recordings. We could make comparisons, notice like patterns in marking, and begin
               quite possibly to hear Wordsworth’s voice through graphical specifications. Studying
               linguistic structures by focusing on the sounds of language and affect reveals compelling
               information about articulation, accent, vocal variations, euphony, stress, cadence,
               pauses, respiration, punctuation, attention, stimulation, artificiality, force, and
               more. Romantic poetry emerged in this linguistic environment, so acknowledging these
               systems in classroom settings better equips students for understanding this environment.
               </p>
            <p>Linguistic structures shift now as they did then as rhetorical situations vary. Sounds
               of language and affect for exigencies differ, so Romantic articulations should be
               understood through the complexity of performance or recitation contexts. An introduction
               to both seventeenth- and eighteenth-century linguistics and articulatory phonetics
               reinforces the importance of the sonification of language that alphabetic text might
               obscure for readers; it reifies the attention to social linguistic structures so important
               in Romantic recitation and readers–listeners–performers’ auditory imaginations. The
               social origins, intellectual culture, and outcomes of the French Revolution and its
               ideological birthing shaped Wordsworth’s imagination and concern for his community
               and thus shaped Wordsworth’s poetics and its emphasis on words and passion. Words
               in the mouths of revolutionaries elicited substantial consequences, and “unmasking”
               such penetrating use of political language for Wordsworth likely reinforced his poetic
               use of words and the force of their passion to affect his audience (Hunt 20–21). Revolutionary
               speakers were passionate, affective, and “concerned with authority” and “audience,”
               and Wordsworth recognized that language shaped perception with positive and negative
               implications (Hunt 25). Language shaped political interests and ideologies and was
               “a way of reconstituting the social and political world,” in both France and England
               (Hunt 24–25). Wordsworth knew language served as an “expression of power, and power
               . . . [was] expressed by the right to speak for the people” (Hunt 23). His concern
               for man’s nature fueled his sense of preservation and need to speak on behalf of others,
               to use language to foster political and social change, preserving his experiences
               and revolutionary sense of language through poetry that could indeed bring authority
               or sense of liberty to those lacking privilege and agency. Wordsworth experienced
               that in times of revolution some voices were heard above others, and those silenced
               by an oppressive majority needed others to help them be heard. Wordsworth poeticizes
               selfhood that serves broader humanity, whose liberty could be found in conversing
               with their souls, which his poetics teach and taught even while his explicit political
               actions waned. At times hiding explicit political intent in verse, Wordsworth spoke
               for those who could not, for reasons social, political, or otherwise, and emboldened
               others who listened to participate in society as was possible in spaces where the
               overlooked were silenced. Taking this voicing into consideration, we can and should
               problematize and complicate notions of Wordsworthian “liberty” and critique imperialist
               political and educational aims and realities aurality brings to mind. Attention to
               aurality always makes audible historically unheard voices that have been enslaved
               by the English tongue—voices of those silenced, colonized, appropriated, forced into
               assimilation, and ignored. There are always consequences. In other words, we can critique
               why Wordsworth felt compelled to speak for others and discuss the implications and
               ethics of that. Fortified with seventeenth- and eighteenth-century linguistic theory,
               Wordsworth aligned his thinking about language with the values inherent in political
               language esteemed during the French Revolution: values of passion, authority, audience,
               perception, and persuasion that served social and political purposes, expressed power
               and agency, and ensured Wordsworthian liberty. Teaching values inherent in political
               language is crucial, and students can understand such thinking through our historical
               moment, especially in terms of modern audible movements serving social and political
               justice purposes. </p>
            <p>Foregrounding sound as the vessel for the “Visionary Power” (<em>The Prelude</em> 619) of which Wordsworth wrote challenges the thread of research in Romantic studies
               that fails to articulate such sonic emphasis to instead maintain that sight was more
               important to the Wordsworthian imagination. I dislocate Wordsworthian “Visionary Power”
               that “Attends upon the motions of the winds / Embodied in the mystery of words” (<em>The Prelude</em> 619–21) from assumptions of sight. Sound studies demand close listening and conceptualizing
               aurality through unorthodox means, and a study of sound implies physicality and psychophysicality
               beyond sensation and new critical regulation. In my classrooms, I seek to supplement
               traditional close reading with scientifically and historically informed close listening,
               which makes engaging with not only the physical but also the psychophysical sonic
               properties of poetry worthwhile. I teach Wordsworth in this way to show through acoustics
               and psychoacoustics frameworks that he reimagined refined sensibility and anticipated
               inclusive interpretive communities for poetry; he is, in part, a vessel for a wider
               social, cultural, discursive logic of the poetics of the Romantic period. If we teach
               others a similar understanding of Wordsworth, we propel his poetics forward into aural
               and semantic spaces informed by diverse historical moments, political perspectives,
               scientific engagements, technological advancements, and physical and psychophysical
               acoustic ecologies. These spaces inform our thinking; we cannot approach poetics sans
               current consciousness.</p>
            <p>The dialogic quality of Wordsworth’s writing and focus on the interactivity between
               self, sound, and motion—what I term <em>psychosonicmotion</em>, presents opportunities for students to reimagine Wordsworth’s craft, his thinking,
               and the pleasure he derived, gave, and gives with his work. Consumed by his sense
               of true personal liberty, Wordsworth chose close listening to self in motion in the
               interest of preserving ideas in writing for future recollection and pleasure. Wordsworth
               does not abandon his civic project and exile himself from the world; his work draws
               in others and others’ voices in the service of broader humanity, engaging civically
               continually. Concerned with not only articulating others’ voices to be heard by others
               but also hearing his voice speak itself out, Wordsworth arguably privileged close
               listening and thus positioned sound at the forefront of his poetics as </p>

            <p> The “presence” (95) here is sound, and the “sense sublime” (96) is hearing.</p>
            <p>Wordsworth’s poetics connect not only early linguistic thought to later political
               language but also the debates regarding thought, language, experience, ideas, and
               things that existed before and as his poetics took shape. Wordsworth’s position can
               be traced from John Locke’s first articulation in <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (see 
               “Of Words”
               ) to Leibniz to Berkeley to James Burnet, Lord Monboddo to Locke’s French follower
               Étienne Bonnot de Condillac to John Horne Tooke to Destutt de Tracy to the <em>idéologues</em>, and my argument for sound as fundamental in Wordsworth’s poetics follows from a
               synthesis of such conceptions (Keach 95–110). William Keach surveys this theoretical
               terrain, which can be valuable information to include in a course tracing points of
               thought to Wordsworth’s ideas about language and thought. Keach asserts that Wordsworth’s
               use of words “gives us a profound sense of the pressure and action of the material
               world and of the physical significance of writing itself” (109). His tracing of Romantic
               verbal representation suggests Wordsworth’s intention to produce poetry with sound
               poetics in mind and must be present in a study of Romantic poetry.</p>
            <p>In my ear, the beauty of Wordsworth is that he was able to capture his immersed nature—personally,
               socially, politically, and naturally. That quality inherent in his writing still remains.
               We hear even today the sounds of Wordsworth’s verse blending with the voices of the
               poets before and after him, with the waters and birds around him, with the soundscape
               we presently occupy. We hear it if we practice close listening. He captured his sonic
               moment through poeticizing its auditory scenes, documenting an acoustic ecology by
               layering sonic environments of which he was a part—physically, psychophysically, and
               imaginatively. By relocating these auditory scenes into verse, he preserved auditory
               perception in reality and ideality and for futurity, reifying his immersive tendencies
               to attend to sound through his Romantic ear and prompting our attention to do the
               same by reading his work—and reading it aloud. Through Wordsworth, by dislocating
               ourselves from our sonic environments to join his auditory scenes, we become aware
               of unique sonic environments that inform—even enhance and disrupt—the acoustic ecology
               of listening to Wordsworth. Through his verbal representation, Wordsworth mediates
               aurality by pulling his auditory scenes into our sonic worlds to intervene in our
               present and future systems of aurality. </p>
            <p>Diverse approaches let us reconsider, reimagine, and diversify social contexts, past
               and present, in which Romantic-era poetry is highly valued and appreciated. We learn
               to understand the value of these aesthetic encounters and how they can be not only
               preserved but also renewed in our contexts through attention to how past technologies
               reshape or become reshaped through present technological capabilities. Adam J. Banks
               writes about the “repositioning” that composition theory and teaching are undergoing
               “that values cultural diversity and interrogates more deeply the social contexts in
               which writing occurs,” noting that in the field of composition, “more importance [has
               been placed] on multiliteracies and multimedia writing” (10). What might the possibilities
               be if, in teaching literature, we placed such importance on multiliteracies and multimedia
               writing and how, together, the two could preserve Romantic recitation using digital
               platforms that allowed for the immersive engagement with sound and/or performance
               and linguistic variation through the marking systems of the past? These are innovative
               considerations for literary studies. While Banks clarifies that “digital writing and
               our immersion in multiple media forms and spaces demands a return to performance as
               an important area in writing instruction,” reimagining Romantic poetry through diverse
               performances is also an important area in literature instruction, and this area can
               be enhanced through explicit attention to the possibilities of digital humanities
               and our immersion in multiple media forms (11). We can and should interrogate and
               diversify Romantic recitation and its sonic possibilities by recreating social contexts
               where reading–listening–performing occurred in the Romantic period, reimagining those
               moments in new physical locations and electronic spaces—with assorted voices. These
               contexts are not only textual but also actual and electronic, not only recitative
               but also performative.</p>
            <p>Considering multimedia possibilities for Wordsworth’s poetry is one way we might reimagine
               the social contexts of present recitation in juxtaposition to Romantic-era recitation.
               For instance, an audio version of the text might change or enhance the reading of
               sound figures, and Wordsworth’s work, and all poetry in general, could be examined
               in this way. Sound figures have acoustic or psychoacoustic resonances, and the textual
               representations of linguistic utterances are sound figures. Multimedia possibilities
               for representing sound figures abound through remix, pastiche, sampling, and hybridity.
               Both language and music have metaphorical capability, and I hear sound figures as
               the fusion of linguistic and nonlinguistic sonic resonances in the service of metaphor.
               Hearing and listening to these utterances ignites thought if audiences listen closely.
               Adrian Curtin writes about examining audio recordings of readings through the concept
               of close listening (270). He quotes from Charles Bernstein to suggest that “‘close
               listening . . . may contradict ‘readings’ of poems . . . based exclusively on the
               printed text . . . that ignore the poet’s own performances, the ‘total’ sound of the
               work, and the relation of sound to semantics’” (qtd. in Curtin 270). Curtin writes
               that audiotexts emphasize and reinforce the acoustics of the written text (271). Audiotexts
               provide “a dense semantic field of linguistic activity and sound shapes that re-stages
               the printed poem’s ostensible meanings” (271). As we listen to a poem’s dynamic sound
               registers and begin to notice its layered sonic environments, we can access how technological
               re-conception of a work might, through newly imagined multimedia forms, bring about
               audio representations of multiple consciousnesses, which might offer semantic and
               post-semantic enrichment worth curating. Electronic aural stimuli authorizes the marking
               of poetry as technologically advanced and quite post-postmodern, insofar as it simultaneously
               represents communicative voices through messages it transmits through polyphonic figures.</p>
            <p>Wordsworth’s poetry already exists as hybrid and “multi discursive,” but through innovative
               platforms we have access to today, it could become even more so. The “hybrid genre
               embraces works of art which transgress genre boundaries by combining characteristic
               traits and elements of diverse literary and non-literary genres” (Karakoç 70–71).
               Wordsworth reveals such possibilities through diverse narrative and sonic elements
               through language and forms; he draws attention to physical and psychophysical sounds
               through his poetic utterances, which themselves house others’ utterances. Bakhtin
               defines the hybrid genre as “‘the mixture, within a single concrete utterance, of
               two or more different linguistic consciousness[es], often widely separated in time
               and social space’” (qtd. in Karakoç 71). Nonlinguistic acoustic data cutting into
               language in the text performs this hybridity because it reveals Wordsworth’s consciousness
               as a poet producing the consciousness of the text that the reader–listener–performer
               experiences through the works and perpetually renews through future recitations and/or
               auditory translations that may or may not be electronic.</p>
            <p>Poems and the reader–listener–performer become an assemblage of past and present,
               lyrical and narrative, literary and real, and thus Wordsworth and individual. If “collective
               life is constituted by a multiplicity of circulating entities that are mutually influencing
               each other and bending space as a consequence of their divergent activities,” as the
               “power of rhetorical actancy as a concept” suggests, according to Laurie E. Gries,
               then Wordsworth’s poetry is a part of that collective, and his readers–listeners–performers
               are too (75). Both the poem, as technology, and the reader–listener–performer have
               agency and act in the world. In this sense, Wordsworth’s poetry exists as “distributed
               cognition . . . dispersed across various, heterogeneous components of an assemblage
               or assemblages as well as space and time” in a collective that includes nonhumans
               and humanity in their entirety—past, present, and future (Gries 68). Wordsworth’s
               poetry exists in hybridity in conjunction with its readership—at any time, and the
               work maintains a certain kind of living power in readers’ hands or on readers–listeners–performers’
               tongues (Gries 73).</p>
            <p>We should encourage students to envision the sonic environments of poems not as fixed
               interpretive territories but as interactive acoustic ecologies, allowing them to experience
               personal circumambient versions of the “‘world around’” or <span class="foreign" xml:lang="du" lang="du">Umwelt</span> (Chion and Steintrager 11). Chion and Steintrager maintain that one could argue that
               “there was a sound and a person”—a system of synthesized surround sound—sound and
               subject as entity (11). This Romantic understanding of the sonic environment positions
               the subject to feel “at the center of sound” and builds up sound “as a revelatory
               fantasy” that can “emphasize by a sort of mirroring effect, as it were, the individuality
               of the one listening to them” (Chion and Steintrager 11). Keeping this egocentric
               nature of audition in mind, students can understand that a poem’s sonic environment,
               soundscape, or acoustic ecology inspires options for discovering meaning. The auditory
               environment is not static but always fluctuating, perceptually founded. According
               to Albert Bregman, “auditory scene analysis” functions as a model for auditory perception,
               and using it, we can listen closely to continuous streams of sound in a sonic environment
               and analyze the sound mixture by segmenting the streams. It is difficult for a “listener
               to hear the entire sequence as a single stream of sound,” and differences in effects
               of the auditory stream vary (Bregman 643). While some active perceivers explore the
               sonic environment through an ecological model with attention to physical sound, others
               have powers, as William Noble writes, “to move around, to handle things, to bring
               objects into full view, to sweep the horizon, to get close to a faint sound” in other
               ways; instead of physically hearing the acoustic world, they perceptively attend to
               it (330). Noble suggests that hearing “is not necessarily an <em>action</em> that a person takes, but is rather more like the imposition of an audible object
               on one’s attention” (332). Such attention can be the result of perceiver choice or
               due to differences in hearing ability, but the analysis of the features of the audible
               world heard and attended to are meaningful and complex all the same.</p>
            <p>Poetry, for Wordsworth, creates defining realities and distinctive natures and allows
               for an apprehension and perception of various natures. I suggest that we situate nature
               according to Peter H. Khost’s definition of the literary affordance and maintain an
               understanding of nature as an object in relation to its usefulness in the textual
               environment by all involved actors, which include not only poet and auditors but also
               intertextual and intratextual voices. According to Khost, a forerunner of ecological
               psychology James J. Gibson introduced the concept of affordance: “Affordances are
               uses individuals make of objects, events, concepts, or environments through relation
               to their discoverable features. . . its basic principle being that experiential, environment-bound
               relations are central to psychological experience . . . [Affordances involve] situational
               emphasis” (19–20). Situational emphasis is important to understanding Romantic recitation
               and should be explored practically and theoretically. Immersive environments are critical
               to poetry once readers note perceptual offerings environments hold. Khost maintains
               that “a reader’s needs (and abilities, interests, situation, and so forth) contribute
               to . . . [their] making of literary affordances” (21). Readers, therefore, give to
               and take what they need from the sonic environment they find themselves a part of,
               both in and beyond the text, in order to experience the work more fully. Khost writes
               that “affordances are not only phenomenal (i.e., experiential), but they are also
               at the same time substantial (i.e., physical),” and experiential and physical readings
               offer more interpretive possibilities for the poetry as the literary affordances become
               more varied based on the variants of nature made possible by due consideration of,
               attention to, creation of—and re-creation of—multiple sonic environments by diverse
               readers–listeners–performers (21). That “an affordance is not a property of an environment
               [literary text] or of a person [reader] but rather a person’s [reader’s] ability to
               make uses of objects or environments [literary texts] by placing (i.e., identifying)
               and activating useful features in them” should be something we are teaching students
               of Romanticism because it allows for reconsiderations of engagement that would be
               much like the engagement of the poets during their time (Khost 24). It materializes
               the period to show that these poems were indeed penned by living, breathing bodies
               who were absorbing their actualities to push beyond them. Experiencing poetry in this
               way makes it not only perceptual and experiential (i.e., direct) but also both conceptual
               and referential (i.e., indirect) (Khost 27). The ecosystem of the poem, then, while
               a complex construction and representation of the poet’s transcendence from material
               circumstances, becomes rooted in a reader’s material circumstances to substantialize
               the very materiality the poet captured through the poetic form to begin with. The
               work then always exists in synthesis beyond the individual poem in its material collectivity,
               past, present, and future.</p>
            <p>Wordsworth’s recitations prompt conjecture regarding the sonification of poetry in
               our context and how we close listen today as audiences of Romantic poetry as sound
               art, ourselves reciting, hearing, and listening from positions of present soundscapes
               and circumstances. It situates perpetual recitation and the need for performance/auditory
               translations from audiences contextually defined by idiosyncratic and distinct natures.
               Poetry creates sonic possibilities both referential and nonreferential, and through
               the experiencing of the poem or the experience the poem concretizes and figurativizes—through
               its creation, recitation, participation, and perpetuation—these sonic possibilities
               supply variable resources for knowing, which we should examine. Steven Feld examines
               what he calls “acoustemology,” which “conjoins ‘acoustics’ and ‘epistemology’ to theorize
               sound as a way of knowing”; this theorizing “inquires into what is knowable, and how
               it becomes known, through sounding and listening” and “asks how the physicality of
               sound is so instantly and forcefully present to experience and experiencers, to interpreters
               and interpretations” in order to understand “sonic sensation” as “experiential” (qtd.
               in Novak and Sakakeeny 12). Feld informs our understanding of poetic sound and what
               we can know from poetic sonification. Realizing sound possibilities by analyzing poetry
               as audio reshapes our theoretical understanding of poets and poetics and reinforces
               poetry as a modern somesthetic–affective object. If we conceptualize literary sound
               in this way, we provide students with unlimited possibilities for encountering poetic
               acoustic ecologies as three-dimensional and interactive. </p>
            <p>The diverse study of sound presents uncountable opportunities for students. Technologies
               of the past and the present offer ample methods for experimenting with Romantic texts
               and auditory translations in terms of reciting, analyzing, translating, remixing,
               performing, and preserving Romantic poetry in and for the future. Sound studies using
               not only the linguistic treatises and recording methodologies of the past but also
               present-day digital tools provide us with the means to further experience and preserve
               literature. We should present students with the opportunity not only to experience
               these memorable works using their tongues and in new mediums but also to analyze them
               as originals and translations, synthesizing the imaginative renderings of the Romantic
               period with our present imaginative possibilities and technological capabilities.
               Students, as readers–listeners–performers, will experiment with the affective force
               of sound as we perceive its function, modernizing expressions of language’s materiality
               and its association with thought while curating diverse renderings, compositions,
               and analyses under the direction of poets. </p>
