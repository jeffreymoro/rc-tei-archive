                <p class=" ">In this article, I examine my recent experience in teaching a
                    spring semester literature module to undergraduates. The module is centered
                    around the critical concept of the &ldquo;brown study&rdquo; in William Cowper&rsquo;s evening
                    meditation in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span>. The fading twilight in the
                    winter evening of Cowper&rsquo;s meditation leads him to reflect on the place where he
                    produces literature about nature: inside in his <em xmlns="">brown study</em>. The
                    class begins with an examination of the critical concept of the brown study as a
                    commonplace in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literatures. How is the brown
                    study contemporary with the development of the concept of the professional
                    literary author? </p>
                <p class=" ">The brown study is a physical place to write poetry, a designated
                    room in a private house for professional authors, and, most importantly, a
                    creative frame of mind for writing that an author achieves within the study
                    itself. The last definition, signifying a frame of mind in the contemplative
                    mode such as Noah Webster&rsquo;s serious reverie or Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s gloomy
                    meditations, is the primary definition in the <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Oxford English
                        Dictionary Online</span>. We approach the new history of the
                    now-anachronistic brown study through exemplifications of ruminative stances in
                    poetry, in which a poet&rsquo;s aesthetic first-stage inspiration is broken down. The
                    deconstructive process, informed by readings from Wellmer, Freud, Adorno, and
                    Derrida, is approached in the ways that authors unconsciously select and make
                    distinctions as the initiative experiences are digested, then to be taken into
                    the second-stage reflections that are recorded during composition.</p>
                <p class=" ">The class&rsquo;s literature survey covers William Wordsworth&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Lyrical Ballads Preface</span>, James Thomson&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span>, Anna Letitia Barbauld&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The
                        Invitation</span>, Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Letters from
                        Sweden, Norway and Denmark</span>, and William Cowper&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span>, paired each with background from introductory scholarship
                    on the composition processes of the author. We follow the survey of two-stage
                    writing with a classroom discussion/essay assignment on the artistic processes
                    of Romantic-era literature and authorial identity supported by readings from
                    William St. Clair, Catherine Gallagher, Stephen Greenblatt, and Tilottoma Rajan.
                    The class also examines the brown study as a physical space furnished in the
                    writings of several authors who describe their creative processes at home: John
                    Keats, Mary Wollstonecraft, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and William Cowper. At last
                    we consider how one might create a brown study with elements from the topics in
                    the literature from the course module.</p>

            <div class="section" id="body.1_div.1_div.1"><h4 align="center">I. Introduction: "Brown Study" Aesthetics</h4>
                
                <p class=" "><strong>1</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind rattling at the window, fire in the grate, and a poet dozing in his chair
                    are images in William Cowper&rsquo;s "A Winter&rsquo;s Evening: Brown
                        Study." The presence of an aesthetics of a brown study is an issue I
                    invite my classes to study in their theoretical approach to Romanticism from a
                    Survey of British Literature I class. In the class, we study the two stages of
                    composition theory&mdash;I: <span xmlns="" class="foreign">Eingedenken</span> and II: Composition (linguistic)&mdash;
                    in writing that appears in poetical works by William Cowper, William Collins,
                    James Thomson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Anna Letitia Barbauld, Mary
                    Wollstonecraft and William Wordsworth. The brown study aesthetics poems each
                    feature the two phases, Eingedenken and Composition. In William Cowper&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span>
                    "Book 4: A Winter&rsquo;s Evening," aesthetic response occurs in
                    a state of unconscious reflection preceding representation in language. The poet
                    is half-awake and daydreaming. The poet appears overcome with images. At rest
                    after a long day, he is, at least for the present moment, inarticulate. The
                    poet&rsquo;s frame of mind calls up Theodore Adorno&rsquo;s theory in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Negative Dialectics</span> that aesthetic response is pre-linguistic. In
                    the brown study, Cowper&rsquo;s poet enjoys a &ldquo;parlour twilight&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweet oblivion
                    of the cares of day&rdquo; (4.278, 4.250). Theoretically, according to Adorno&rsquo;s model
                    and following models such as Albrecht Wellmer&rsquo;s in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The
                        Persistence of Modernity: Aesthetics, Ethics and Postmodernism</span>,
                    aesthetics precedes articulation (Wellmer 3&ndash;4). However, thoughts that follow an
                    aesthetic response may transpire to linguistic utterances as part of a
                    purposeful inquiry inspired by earlier experiences in an aesthetic state
                    (Wellmer 3&ndash;4). </p>
                <p class=" "><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The images in Cowper&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span> and additional period
                    brown study aesthetics poems are part of a module that I included in a Spring
                    2019 literary studies course for undergraduates. In the module, the class
                    discussed poetical tropes of two-stage composition: (1) the pre-linguistic stage
                    and (2) the linguistic stage. Cowper&rsquo;s images are a part of a historical
                    tradition of poetical images of slumbers and reflections. Pre-linguistic images
                    precede later images of the compositional phase such as John Keats at his
                    writing office in Joseph Severn&rsquo;s painting &ldquo;John Keats at Wentworth Place&rdquo;
                    (Appendix A).</p>
                <p class=" "><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We begin the module with the first stage of composition, <span xmlns="" class="foreign">Eingedenken</span>, the
                    pre-linguistic phase William Cowper theorizes in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The
                        Task</span>, and we conclude with the second stage of composition,
                    Composition, the linguistic phase. In <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span> "Book 3: The Garden," Cowper claims that he travels widely
                    during his lifetime. However, in order to write poetry, Cowper returns always to
                    the place of his opening theme of repose from "Book 1: The Sofa." The reflective
                    observation situates the sofa, an upholstered chair with soft cushions in the
                    brown study of a poet&rsquo;s house, as a primary site of attraction for the itinerant
                    poet. Intent on self-discovery through the process of Eingedenken, the poet must
                    prioritize the sofa, as he explains: "I, designing other themes, and called / To
                    adorn the Sofa with eulogium due, / To tell its slumbers and to paint its
                    dreams" (3.13&ndash;15). The poet in Cowper&rsquo;s account travels widely with the aim to
                    reflect on &ldquo;themes&rdquo; which he &ldquo;designs&rdquo; in pre-linguistic impressions from
                    outside, in nature, and in the city. He returns to the sofa to digest what he
                    saw in &ldquo;dreams&rdquo; and in &ldquo;slumbers&rdquo; for reflection, after his first-stage travels
                    take him far: <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote">
                        <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="stanza">
                            <div class="l">one who, long in thickets and in brakes</div>
                            <div class="l">Entangled, winds now this way and now that</div>
                            <div class="l">His devious course uncertain, seeking home;</div>
                            <div class="l">Or, having long in miry ways been foiled</div>
                            <div class="l">And sore discomfited, from slough to slough</div>
                            <div class="l">Plunging, and half despairing of escape,</div>
                            <div class="l">If chance at length he find a greensward smooth</div>
                            <div class="l">And faithful to the foot, his spirits rise,</div>
                            <div class="l">He chirrups brisk his ear-erecting steed,</div>
                            <div class="l">And winds his way with pleasure and with ease;</div>
                            <div class="l">So I, designing other themes, and called</div>
                            <div class="l">To adorn the Sofa with eulogium due,</div>
                            <div class="l">To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams,</div>
                            <div class="l">Have rambled wide. In country, city, seat</div>
                            <div class="l">Of academic fame. (3.1&ndash;16)</div>
                        </div>
                    </div> Cowper&rsquo;s &ldquo;eulogium&rdquo; (3.12) on the sofa is a &ldquo;eulogy&rdquo; for dead
                    nature without including &ldquo;mir[e]&rdquo; (line 4), &ldquo;slough&rdquo; (line 5), and
                    &ldquo;entangle[ment]&rdquo; (line 2) in a confusion of images now aestheticized in the
                    brown study to be later written down in poetical form. The traveler in the
                    &ldquo;greensward,&rdquo; like Cowper&rsquo;s poet, finds inspiration for writing when he later
                    returns to the sofa to write a formal &ldquo;eulogium&rdquo; or a memorial for times passed.
                    During a brown study period, the poet will contemplate themes in nature while in
                    a state of repose, in effect mindfully resting in a state of the Derridean
                    unconscious before he or she later will revive images for writing poetry in an
                    elegiac reconstruction of past events in the phase of Composition
                    (linguistic phase).</p>
            </div>
                <div class="section" id="body.1_div.1_div.2"><h4 align="center">II. The &ldquo;Curtain of Repose&rdquo;: Nature in the Mindful Unconscious</h4>
                    
                    <p class=" "><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author&rsquo;s awareness of the pre-conceptual space is the &ldquo;mindfulness
                            [<span xmlns="" class="foreign">Eingedenken</span>] of nature in the subject,&rdquo; according to
                        Albrecht Wellmer in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Persistence of Modernity:
                            Aesthetics, Ethics and Postmodernism</span> (74). Nature is the state
                        of the unconscious in a brown study repose. The author&rsquo;s mindful attention
                        to the state of repose evokes in the author his or her own consciousnesses
                        of the boundaries that necessarily are in existence between his or her mind
                        and the objects of thought. As Wellmer explains, the author achieves
                            <span xmlns="" class="foreign">Eingedenken</span> &ldquo;within the medium of conceptual thought, the
                        necessary condition being that the concept itself is turned against the
                        reifying tendency of conceptual thought&rdquo; (4). The thought is a delimitation
                        of the awareness of a state of natural repose. The brown study in Romantic
                        literature such as Cowper&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span> is the state
                        of fading thoughts during the twilight hours of a &ldquo;curtain of repose&rdquo;
                        (4.248) that may exist, for poets, prior to a state of enlightenment that
                        occurs later on. In present-day critical theory of brown study
                        compositional poetics by Tilottama Rajan and Richard Adelman, the authors
                        examine the truth value of synthesis and reconstructive aesthetics, known as
                        an <em xmlns="">alethiology</em>, or truth discovery. </p>
                    <p class=" "><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theodor Adorno&rsquo;s theory in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Negative Dialectics</span>
                        examines the unconscious or pre-linguistic phase as a corrective to the
                        presence of the conscious. The source of truth is found in the unconscious
                        state, such as in idle contemplation, dreaming, or brown study mental repose
                        (Adorno 348). Sigmund Freud also uses the unconscious for what he
                        perceives to be an other apparent in the consciousness, as Gayatri Spivak
                        explains in the translator&rsquo;s preface to Derrida&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">On
                            Grammatology</span> (Spivak 86). Jacques Derrida too critiques the
                        foundational theory of a conscious intentionality. Joseph Adamson explains:
                        following Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s discovery of the unconscious memory, the Derridean
                        &ldquo;critique of metaphysics and of the &lsquo;presence&rsquo; of consciousness&rdquo; leads
                        towards Derrida&rsquo;s own idea of the unconscious, which &ldquo;owes much to Freud&rsquo;s
                        discovery of the unconscious and theory of unconscious memory&rdquo; (Adamson
                        296). </p>
                    <p class=" "><strong>6</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrida forms his thoughts on deconstruction out of his thoughts on the
                        unconscious, which indeed are a source of Derrida&rsquo;s own theory of
                        deconstruction. In Derrida&rsquo;s critique of the foundation of metaphysics,
                        Joseph Adamson shows, he aims to provide a corrective to the overwhelming
                        presence of the conscious in metaphysical theory: &ldquo;Derrida&rsquo;s writings
                        critique the Western metaphysical tradition, which he sees as dominated by a
                        discourse of &lsquo;presence&rsquo; in the assumption, for example, that truth is a
                        function of the presence of consciousness to itself and to its object. . . . What
                        Derrida calls deconstruction consists in an analysis which overturns these
                        tenacious metaphysical foundations&rdquo; (Adamson 296). The direction of the
                        critique of the conscious is the recovery of the unconscious from
                        alterity.</p>
                    <p class=" "><strong>7</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cowper&rsquo;s &ldquo;curtain of repose&rdquo; in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Task</span> draws out
                        the rest of unconsciousness in a &ldquo;recess&rdquo; from the outside world of travel
                        and consciousness (4.248, 4.308). During the recess, Cowper dreams of the

                        &ldquo;mellow brown&rdquo; (4.314&ndash;15). The harvester takes apart the growth of spring
                        and summer with the scythe of autumn. Variegated nature appears in images of

                        during the seasons of adverse weather and during the seasons of autumn and
                        winter. The period of recess occurs because the poet is unable physically to
                        participate in activities outdoors due to the adversity of the late autumn

                        when the adverse fall weather occurs. He seeks a woodland cottage where he
                        may contemplate &ldquo;dim-discovered spires&rdquo; and &ldquo;hamlets brown&rdquo; (Collins line
                        37). The process of observations and obscurity call to mind a cityscape in
                        the evening or in the nighttime hour like Samuel Taylor Coleridge&rsquo;s
                        nighttime composition in "Frost at Midnight."

                        deconstructed by the speaker in an allegory of his own state of
                        unconsciousness, evocative of Wellmer&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="foreign">Eingedenken</span>, the
                        mindfulness of &ldquo;nature in the subject&rdquo; (74). The poet&rsquo;s contemplation of the
                        passing of the day occurs while under a &ldquo;brown&rdquo; twilight or under an obscure
                        &ldquo;curtain of repose&rdquo; (Cowper 4.248). The
                        phase of unconscious reflection for a poet could sometimes last several
                        hours or take over the day; Keats in his letter number 41 to Benjamin Bailey
                        demands that his friend &ldquo;give me&rdquo; some time to compose in &ldquo;a long brown
                        plain&rdquo; or stretch of time for several hours to take up the whole of &ldquo;my

                        on March 13, 1818. Severn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Portrait of Keats&rdquo; shows the author staring
                        sightlessly at a book, bearing the &ldquo;real symptoms of sadness&rdquo; from his late
                        life, and the image is reminiscent of the elements of Cowper&rsquo;s &ldquo;eulogium&rdquo;

                        <p class=" "><strong>9</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the theory of brown study compositional poetics, writing that follows
                            contemplation of experience is subjective and offers a truth value of
                            synthesis and reconstructive aesthetics, known as an <em xmlns="">alethiology</em>. The
                            alethiology is a truth value discovered through access to the &ldquo;nature of
                            truth&rdquo; (<span xmlns="" class="titlem">OED</span>), seen in Eingedenken, the brown
                            study&rsquo;s first, aesthetic stage of creativity preceding the conceptual
                            thought of the second, compositional stage of creativity. In a Romantic
                            poem written in the brown study aesthetic, the element of
                            &ldquo;undecidability&rdquo; should precede the concept, according to Tilottama
                            Rajan (472). As the initial experiences are digested in a deconstructive
                            and self-aware pre-conceptual process, authors unconsciously select and
                            make distinctions. The aesthetic experience is especially powerful in
                            what Richard Adelman defines as the idle or vacant mind, where space
                            occurs between the experience of an object and the concept of the object
                            itself. The period of idle reflection in Cowper&rsquo;s brown study passage is
                            a stage in contemplation between &ldquo;voluntary and involuntary&rdquo; processes
                            of thought, as Adelman explains (76). Despite the involuntariness of
                            contemplation, the mind has a &ldquo;particular set of abilities&rdquo; 
                            to produce a concept for reconstruction of an idea (Adelman 64).</p>
                        <p class=" "><strong>10</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Derridean deconstructive stage of creativity, named in
                            poetics by Cowper as the brown study stage, &ldquo;it is not necessary . . . to
                            reassemble the <span xmlns="" class="foreign">disjecta membra</span>&rdquo; of the day&rsquo;s experiences in
                            a structured form (Rajan 464). The deconstructed text of nature in the
                            poet&rsquo;s experience &ldquo;can still be alethiological, because the very process
                            of undecidability discloses truth&rdquo; (Rajan 464). Poetical fragments,
                            notes, marginalia, and free writing are written expressions of
                            undecidability. For poets who are writing in a two-stage process, an
                            idea for a theme is drawn from the brown study and the &ldquo;thematic
                            expression&rdquo; then leads to the secondary phase of the rhetorical
                            structure of the poem (Rajan 452). </p>
                        <p class=" "><strong>11</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deconstructive process provides material in fragments, notes, and
                            marginalia that are recorded during composition to be taken into the
                            second stage reflections. The class&rsquo;s survey of composition processes in

                            literature, which is in transit from a medieval literature that grounded
                            allegorical representation in anagogic presence towards a kind of
                            Mallarmean pure poetry that would not be undone by any desire to emerge
                            from the palace of art&rdquo; (Rajan 455). Schiller writes in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Na&iuml;ve and Sentimental Poetry</span> of the aesthetic pre-concept:
                            &ldquo;Just as nature began gradually to disappear from human life as
                                <em xmlns="">experience</em> . . . so we see her arise in the world of poetry
                            as <em xmlns="">idea</em> and <em xmlns="">object</em>. . . . The poet, I said, either
                                <em xmlns="">is</em> nature or he will <em xmlns="">seek</em> her&rdquo; (Schiller
                            105&ndash;10). The poet deliberately seeks the Eingedenken or nature of the
                            mindful unconscious in order to generate natural or inspired poetry.
                            William Wordsworth theorizes the nature of Romantic poetry in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Preface</span> to <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Lyrical
                                Ballads</span>: <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"> I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous
                                overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from origin
                                recollected in tranquility: the emotion is contemplated till by a
                                species of reaction the tranquility gradually disappears, and an
                                emotion, similar to that which was before the subject of
                                contemplation, is gradually produced, and does itself actually exist
                                in the mind. In this mood successful composition gradually begins,
                                and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of
                                whatever kind and in whatever degree, from various causes is
                                qualified by various pleasures, so that in describing any passions
                                whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will upon the
                                whole be in a state of enjoyment. Now if Nature be thus cautious in
                                preserving in a state of enjoyment a being thus employed, the Poet
                                out to profit by the lesson thus held forth to him. (183)</div>
                            Wordsworth creates &ldquo;the poet as a prophetic figure who [is] defining a
                            subjectivist, expressivist poetics that continues to condition poets&rsquo;

                            also intends an &ldquo;invitation&rdquo; of creativity to her friend Miss Belsham,
                            the poem&rsquo;s dedicatee. A cultural ingenuity in cultivated composition is
                            emphasized in Barbauld&rsquo;s writings; William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft
                            explain: &ldquo;She seeks, both in herself and in others, to cultivate the

                            (Thomson 4.62). In the metaphorical prose of Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway
                                and Denmark</span>, the author shares her experiences of walking
                            outdoors and thoughts on observing the details of the landscape, the
                            flowers, fields, and rocks, around the town of Gothenberg in Sweden. </p>
                        <p class=" "><strong>14</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the day&rsquo;s travels, Wollstonecraft explains, she writes at home
                            about her experiences in a quiet hour. Ingrid Horrocks, in her
                            introduction to Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s oeuvre, points to a
                            &ldquo;nostalgic strain in philosophical . . . thought&rdquo; in the <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Letters</span> as Wollstonecraft eulogizes the day and her
                            separation from family (Horrocks 25). Like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who
                            sits around the fire in the grate at midnight with his infant son in the
                            poem "Frost at Midnight", Wollstonecraft
                            contemplates, &ldquo;Why fly my thoughts abroad, when every thing around me
                            appears at home? My child was sleeping with equal calmness&mdash;innocent
                            and sweet as the closing flowers&rdquo; (Wollstonecraft 59). However, due to
                            the brightness of the moon, &ldquo;I could write at midnight very well without
                            a candle. I contemplated all nature at rest; the rocks, even grown
                            darker in their appearance, looked as if they partook of the general
                            repose, and reclined more heavily on their foundation&rdquo; (Wollstonecraft
                            59). Earlier in the same day described in "Letter
                                1," Wollstonecraft describes &ldquo;still little patches of earth
                            of the most exquisite verdure, enameled with the sweetest wild flowers&rdquo;
                            and she mourns the passing of the day (57). </p>

                            physical stage of writing &ldquo;verse&rdquo; about nature while living in the city,
                            Cowper states that nature is to him &ldquo;a lost world&rdquo; now that he lives in
                            the London town of Chertsey (4.730). Yet, while in London, the poet
                            finds that he can obtain in the process of writing &ldquo;rich amends / For a
                            lost world in solitude and verse&rdquo; (4.729&ndash;730). Cowper sees his verses
                            written in the city as miniature container gardens representative of a
                            larger nature outside. Adjacent to the &ldquo;brick&rdquo; walls of homes in the
                            city are &ldquo;boxes planted thick / And watered duly. There the pitcher
                            stands / A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there,&rdquo; a synecdoche of
                            &ldquo;how close pent-up man regrets / The country&rdquo; (4.771,
                            4.775&ndash;78).</p>

                                activities during the Romantic era. Adelman&rsquo;s study &ldquo;charts the

                                outside the parameters of the categories of &ldquo;working.&rdquo; His study
                                begins with Romanticism&rsquo;s idleness &ldquo;up until the very point at which
                                this category is put to work in opposition to the political economy

                                The activities of reading and writing may fall alongside the
                                activities of retirement, rest, and solitude.</p>
                            <p class=" "><strong>17</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mary Wollstonecraft and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the interiority
                                of the study creates an aesthetics of order and structure from
                                chaotic externality. &ldquo;I then retired to my apartment,&rdquo; explains
                                Wollstonecraft of her first night of Swedish residency, but &ldquo;my

                                accompanied by consciousness&rdquo; (263). Freud remarks that theme and
                                symbol may &ldquo;not belong particularly to [a single] dream, but rather
                                to the unconscious thinking&rdquo; which may be found &ldquo;in the

                                study aesthetic. Keats speaks of his composition of poetry in "Ode to a Nightingale," and Joseph Severn paints
                                him in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">John Keats at Wentworth Place</span> (1821, Appendix A). Severn
                                writes in his letters that Keats was at repose in a compositional
                                phase in the study surrounded by the furniture necessary to writing.
                                The components of the study during Keats&rsquo;s composition of "Ode to a Nightingale" are presented in detail
                                and are confirmed by Keats&rsquo;s friend Charles Brown: <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote">This was

                                aesthetics in period literature, undergraduate students complete an
                                assignment that pairs a critical approach to authorship in the
                                Romantic era with an author&rsquo;s discussion of his or her own practices
                                of authorship in a brown study mood, defined by activity and/or
                                location in a furnished space. The critical approaches (students
                                choose one of three) are William St. Clair&rsquo;s approach to
                                professional writing in "The Reading Nation in the
                                    Romantic Period"; Catherine Gallagher and Stephen
                                Greenblatt&rsquo;s approach to &ldquo;the triumph of an expressivist and
                                creative notion of language&rdquo; in "Practicing New

                                    Studies after Paul de Man" (Rajan 455). The students may
                                pair one of the three critical approaches with a text by one of the
                                authors (prose or poetry) studied in lecture.</p>

                                essays listed on the course&rsquo;s syllabus. Provided the students&rsquo;
                                theoretical approaches to the literature are sound, the students

                                phase of admiration is sustained in the compositional recording of
                                the details of the scene, which become imbued with the life of the
                                inner mind. Following the contemplative stage is a reconstruction of
                                experiences into a poem, yet the reconstruction stage preserves the
                                tone and meaning of the pre-linguistic phase. The resonance between
                                the aesthetic pre-conceptual space and the conceptual space is
