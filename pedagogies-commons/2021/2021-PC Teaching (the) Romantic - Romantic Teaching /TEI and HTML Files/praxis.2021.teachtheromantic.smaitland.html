            <p class="noCount">While we now know that much of the early reporting after the mass shooting at Columbine
               High School was incorrect, including the portrayal of the shooters as social outcasts
               and victims of chronic bullying, the effects of explaining that violence as retaliatory
               against a culture of elitism and cruelty remain. Students reading <em>Frankenstein</em> today—steeped in narratives of mass shootings—are influenced by parallels between
               how we characterize the motivations of mass shooters and Shelley’s creature. But Shelley’s
               text offers students more than these parallels. While the Creature explains his acts
               of violence as reactionary and justified, the novel thinks carefully and critically
               about his justification and about the rights and responsibilities of men. In this
               paper I outline a method for teaching the novel, paired with readings that narrate
               mass shootings as a reaction to societal rejection, that invites students to analyze
               the way the novel is thinking about acceptance, rejection, violence, and the rights
               of men. Reading, thinking, and writing about the texts together allows students to
               more richly examine the beautiful complexity of Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> as well as their own preconceived notions of retaliatory violence.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">Teaching <em>Frankenstein</em> in the Post-Columbine Classroom</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>I first taught <em>Frankenstein</em> in an Introduction to Literature class at a large state university. The student population
               was socioeconomically and racially diverse, and included a large number of first-generation
               college students. I was a graduate student at the time, and I was deeply concerned
               that my lack of teaching experience would negatively impact my students. I wanted
               more than anything for them to love the literature I loved and to find in it a way
               of thinking more carefully and critically about all the many things literature is
               particularly good at helping us think about like identity, responsibility, education,
               social structures, and gender roles.</p>
            <p>With <em>Frankenstein</em> I was half successful. My students loved the novel. They came to class ready to talk
               about the characters, the plot, the setting and—most especially—what they thought
               it all meant. They were fascinated by questions of identity formation in the form
               of nature vs. nurture, the guilt that Victor bears for the Creature’s actions, and
               Victor’s oscillation between claiming and abdicating responsibility. The conversation
               was interesting but my students returned again and again to one question: who’s to
               blame for the Creature’s pain and—without any differentiation between impetus and
               choice—his actions? I struggled, though they did not, with some of the conclusions
               they drew. Many of my students read <em>Frankenstein</em> as a didactic text. The central lesson: beware of how you treat others or they might
               just kill you.</p>
            <p>Initially I was disturbed by what seemed to me an absence of nuance in their readings
               of the text. I tried to push them to think more rigorously but found most often that
               I was simply engaging them in debate, with them on one side and me on the other. Didn’t
               they see that the text struggled with issues of identity formation without providing
               definitive answers? Didn’t they see the difference between condemning Victor’s actions
               and excusing the Creature’s choices because of Victor’s bad behavior? They definitely
               didn’t. They didn’t necessarily hold the Creature up as a hero, but they placed the
               blame for his actions, even his framing of Justine, on others. They didn’t see any
               problem with the Creature’s belief that he has a right to be loved and that anyone
               denying him their love was committing violence against him. My students read a clear
               and logical cause and effect in the novel: Victor—and the world he lived in—denied
               the Creature love and the Creature reacted with retaliatory violence. I attributed
               the dissonance between my expectation and their interpretation to my own inexperience.
               I thought perhaps if I’d included historical material to ground their reading the
               experience would have been richer. In many ways I looked at the class as a failure
               because, although they had loved the text, I felt that their didactic reading was
               at odds with the complexity of Shelley’s novel.</p>
            <p>The next time I taught <em>Frankenstein</em> was at a small, private university. The student population was not socioeconomically
               or racially diverse and the majority of the students were not first generation. Many
               of the students came from elite private-school backgrounds. They couldn’t be more
               different from the students I taught in my previous attempt. I, no longer a graduate
               student, armed myself with a context version of <em>Frankenstein</em> that I thought would better prepare my students for the complexities of the text.
               You can imagine my surprise when the outcome was much the same. While my students
               enjoyed the novel, they saw it as a warning: be nice or else. They attributed a disturbing
               logic to Shelley’s work. They argued that the Creature, bereft of love and persecuted
               by mankind, does exactly what any reasonable person would expect and should have anticipated:
               he lashes out. The Creature’s behavior, to them, made complete sense and was even
               predictable. While they acknowledged that what he did was wrong, it was in no way
               shocking and, for many of them, was even somewhat justifiable. For my students the
               novel explained violence on the part of the Creature through the actions of those
               around him, expunged him from personal responsibility, and accepted retaliatory violence
               as inevitable.</p>
            <p>After my second experience teaching <em>Frankenstein</em> I tried several different approaches. I tried providing more history and context,
               including drawing more heavily from Shelley’s own life and the philosophical conversations
               in which the novel takes part. I found that the additional context helped my students
               expand the complexity of their readings but, no matter who and where they were, many
               of them still argued that the novel posed retaliatory violence as the natural and
               inevitable consequence of being unloved.</p>
            <p>The ubiquity of this didactic reading—let this be a lesson to you: be nice or else—worried
               me. I began to consider that, at least for my students, Shelley’s work <em>had</em> become didactic, and I wanted to know why. While Shelley’s text certainly hadn’t
               changed, my students were coming at it from a different cultural moment. As I sifted
               through student responses to the readings, I noticed a recurring word across many
               different student responses: bullying. Students characterized the fear, revulsion,
               and rejection the Creature encountered as bullying—a word far more loaded for them
               than it was for me. My own acquaintance with the anti-bullying movement was passing
               at best, having attended elementary and high school at a time when it was most often
               used in the context of after-school specials. My students, however, had spent their
               elementary and high school years being taught and trained about bullies and bullying.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The anti-bullying movement began in response to the Columbine High School shootings
                  in April of 1999 (Stuart-Cassel, Bell, and Springer 1). By the end of that year Georgia
                  would pass the first anti-bullying legislation and, over the next ten years, most
                  states would follow. Between 1999 and 2010 state legislatures passed over 120 bills
                  addressing bullying (Stuart-Cassel, Bell, and Springer x). In many cases, the legislation
                  mandated that school districts require all students to participate in educational
                  programs intended to decrease bullying. Anti-bullying became the watchword of education
                  across the nation, all in response to Columbine. But Columbine wasn’t the first school
                  shooting—it wasn’t even the first school shooting of the 90s. There was one in 1991
                  (Iowa), one in 1994 (Washington), two in 1996 (Washington and California), four in
                  1997 (Alaska, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Arkansas), and five in 1998 (Virginia, Oregon,
                  Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Arkansas) (
                  “Timeline of School Shootings”
                  ). However, all of these school shootings had low body counts and were over before
                  the media arrived on the scene (Cullen 14). In contrast, Columbine lasted for over
                  five hours, including what the police then believed was a standoff with the shooters

                           suicide inside the school just over 40 minutes after the beginning of the attack.
                           The police didn’t realize that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were dead until they
                           found their bodies hours later. In fact, at least one of Klebold and Harris’s victims
                           bled to death after the shooters committed suicide while the police were securing
                           the school (Cullen 83).</span></div>
                  </div>and culminating in an extensive search of the school.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           even explode—but they still had to be carefully secured.</span></div>
                  </div>It was more than enough time for the media to congregate and for the story to quickly
                  go viral. People watched the Columbine tragedy unfold in real time and, as is frequently
                  the case when information is conveyed before it can be verified, much of what was
                  reported was untrue. It was these misconceptions that created and fed the anti-bullying
                  movement that has shaped so many students.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the days and months after Columbine, the nation looked for answers. It was, at
                  the time, the deadliest school shooting in history.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The actual body count—thirteen, including twelve students and one teacher—was significantly
                           lower than the originally reported twenty-five (Brockell).</span></div>
                  </div> Many people, including school administrators, parents, and legislators, found those
                  answers in the media descriptions of the shooters—Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Both
                  Harris and Klebold were seniors at Columbine High School. They were described as loners,
                  goths, and outcasts. There were reports that the shooters had been bullied. The day
                  after the shooting, <em>The Washington Post</em> published an article stating that students at Columbine described Harris and Klebold
                  as “constant target[s] of derision for at least four years” and said they were “constantly
                  being ribbed by the school's athletes and other, more popular cliques” (Fisher, 
                  “Gunmen Recalled as Outcast”
                  ). There was some speculation that, in addition to being goths, the shooters were
                  bullied because they were gay—another report that turned out to be unsubstantiated
                  (Cullen 155). Multiple media outlets reported that the shooters were members of a
                  group of outcasts who called themselves the Trench Coat Mafia.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris weren’t part of the Trench Coat Mafia (TCM) but it did
                           exist. The boys knew students who were part of the TCM—so dubbed because the members
                           of the group all wore trench coats—but none of the members were involved in the shooting.
                           Prior to the shooting on April 20, most members of the TCM had either graduated or
                           stopped wearing trench coats to school. The confusion seems to have arisen from Dylan
                           and Eric using trench coats on the day of the shootings at least in part to hide their
                           weapons (Cullen 147–48). </span></div>
                  </div> Of course, none of this was true. The two shooters were not part of the Trench Coat
                  Mafia. They weren’t goths, both had friends, participated in school activities, and
                  Klebold even attended prom with a date the weekend before the shooting. Most of the
                  students interviewed, at least initially, didn’t know Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
                  at all and there’s some indication that the students were led in their descriptions
                  by the questions posed to them by interviewers (Cullen 74).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Regardless, the picture the American public received was of two bullied, lonely kids
               who snapped, lashed out and killed. Days after the shooting, Andrew Mitchell, a high
               school student who lived near Columbine and participated in the goth aesthetic, said,
               “picture these kids, for years being thrown around, treated horribly. After a while
               you can’t stand it anymore. They were completely wrong. But there are reasons for
               why they did it” (Cullen 157). This belief that Harris and Klebold were driven to
               violence by the cruelty of their peers came to shape public policy and private opinion.
               Even now, 20 years after Columbine, many people still believe that bullying is the
               driving force behind violence in schools. We know that wasn’t the case for Harris,
               who left behind a journal, videos, and a website detailing his plans and motivations
               (Cullen 169–70). In his journal Harris discusses the things and people he hates (pages
               and pages of them) and the things he loves (such as natural selection) (Cullen 183–84).
               He articulates his wish to kill multiple times. Only months after Columbine, at an
               FBI-organized summit on school shooters, psychologists who had been studying the case
               agreed that all indications pointed to Harris having been a textbook psychopath (Cullen
               247). Klebold left a journal as well, but although it reveals his self-hatred and
               depression, it doesn’t offer many clues about what led him to murder his classmates.
               Most experts agree that he was led by Harris and likely wouldn’t have committed violence
               on his own (Cullen 188).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Although the myth that Harris and Klebold resorted to violence as retaliation against
                  their peers because of bullying has been debunked for over a decade, we still resort
                  to that myth to explain violence in schools. Non-profits like Rachel’s Challenge,

                  “Walk Up Not Out”
                   was a countermovement to the walkout in response to the Parkland shooting in 2018.
                  It was inspired by several online posts including a February 2018 Facebook post by
                  David Blair in which he claimed that the solution to school shootings was kindness
                  (Seelinger, 
                  “What Does 'Walk Up, Not Out' Mean?”
                  ). Blair writes: <span class="quote">‘Look around you at your classmates. Do you see the kid over in the corner, alone?

                     people have ever given him the chance. You can. . . . Gun control or more laws is
                     not, and will not, be the answer. You are the answer. Your greeting, your smile, your
                     gentle human touch is the only thing that can change the world of a desperate classmate
                     who may be contemplating something as horrendous as a school shooting.’</span>The message is clear: the kids are the problem, and not the ones killing people. School
                  shooters are the natural result of loneliness and bullying. Kids who exclude others,
                  kids who are mean, kids who don’t spend every moment reaching out to their peers create
                  school shooters. While researchers, psychologists, and every well-informed adult knows
                  this isn’t true, the kids subject to the anti-bullying programs don’t know it. And
                  given that all states now have some kind of anti-bullying legislation, we can expect
                  that almost every student in our classrooms who has attended public school (and some
                  who attended private school) will have been influenced by the myth of Columbine

            <p>It was exactly this belief that murder was a natural human reaction to rejection,
               isolation, and cruelty that influenced my students’ readings of <em>Frankenstein</em>. For them the Creature’s violence was inevitable and understandable, even if they
               didn’t think what he did was right. <em>Frankenstein</em>, like the anti-bullying programs in elementary and high school, seemed to them to
               be at best a warning and at worst a justification. I had thought that perhaps my students
               struggled with <em>Frankenstein</em> because they were unprepared to grapple with the complex questions it poses about
               how we become who we are and what we owe to each other. In actuality, they struggled
               because they’d been trained to believe they already knew the answers to those questions
               and could only see <em>Frankenstein</em> as an affirmation of those answers.</p>
            <p>To help them really engage with the text and move past reading <em>Frankenstein</em> as a didactic affirmation of their belief that murder was an unfortunate but understandable
               reaction to rejection, I structured the assignments so that they could challenge the
               anti-bullying rhetoric that shaped their reading by putting it into direct conversation
               with <em>Frankenstein</em>. My hope was that in pairing <em>Frankenstein</em> with texts like Elliot Rodger’s manifesto and Eric Harris’s journal my students would
               find a way to think about not only <em>Frankenstein</em> but also their own experiences as members of the post-Columbine generation. With
               anxiety and depression on the rise in college-aged students, I believe that it’s essential
               for us to cultivate spaces where our students can think critically about the world
               as it is now. I believe in the power of literature to teach us to do that. If our
               students can learn to think critically about the Creature’s claims that his actions
               are entirely the fault of those who treat him cruelly, they can use those same skills
               to think critically about the ways we’ve attached anti-bullying rhetoric to school
               shooting prevention in order to shift the blame onto the victims.</p>
            <p>In addition to Harris’s and Rodger’s writing, I also show them the 2016 Sandy Hook
               Promise Public Service Announcement (PSA), sometimes called 
               “Evan.”
               In it we watch two students, Evan and an unnamed young woman, flirt through graffiti
               they exchange on a library table. They finally meet face-to-face at the end of the
               year, realizing each other’s identity through their handwriting. As they talk, we
               see another student in the background throw open the gym door. He has a gun. As the
               students start to notice him, we see them run and hear them scream. The screen fades
               to black and the following message appears in white lettering, “As you were watching
               Evan another student was planning a school shooting. But no one noticed” (
               “Evan”
               00:01:43). The PSA moves through the same frames we saw before, now highlighting the
               student in the background. We see the student looking at, drawing, and gesticulating
               guns. We see him sitting alone at a table and being bullied by a group of larger boys.
               At the end another message appears in white on the black background, “Gun violence
               is preventable when you know the signs” (
               “Evan”
               00:02:18). It’s unclear who is being held accountable for not seeing these signs.
               The PSA is addressed to viewers, but in many of the scenes only other students are
               present and so logically they’re the ones who could have seen these signs. In essence,
               the PSA holds those students flirting, blithely self-absorbed in their teen romance,
               responsible for the actions of their classmate.</p>
            <p>When my students watch this PSA in conversation with <em>Frankenstein</em>, it makes them angry. They see that they are being told they must suspend their own
               feelings and desires on threat of violence and possibly death. Like the Creature,
               the PSA seems to say that we must give those who threaten us with violence what they
               want or suffer the consequences. I’ve now taught <em>Frankenstein</em> in conversation with school shootings and bullying rhetoric in three separate courses.
               Unfortunately, because of the increase in mass shootings, the resources available
               multiplied between each course. The sequence I describe below is a hybrid; it includes
               the materials from the most recent course along with edits I’ve made for the next
               iteration of the sequence.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Key Course Requirements</span></h2>
               <p>Because creating dialogue between texts was essential to the aim of the class, I embedded
                  dialogue into the structure of the class. I’ve done this in a number of ways, depending
                  on the resources available but the essential feature is that students write regular
                  responses to the assigned readings. They read and reply to each other’s responses,
                  and all of these responses remain visible to them throughout the course. Most recently
                  I used the discussion feature of our LMS, Canvas. Students were required to post their
                  own thoughts in response to the readings at least once per week and were also required
                  to comment on their peers’ posts. The discussion posts created dialogue between students
                  prior to class, and often our in-class discussions picked up and pushed that dialogue
                  further. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">First Movement</span></h2>
               <p>I begin the sequence fairly conventionally by assigning sections from Wollstonecraft.
                  I have students read chapters two and four of <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em> along with chapter one of <em>Frankenstein</em>. The Wollstonecraft reading positions students to discuss the language Victor uses
                  when talking about Elizabeth. With Wollstonecraft as a resource, they notice that
                  Elizabeth is presented as a “gift” to Victor and that Victor thinks of her as a possession
                  (Shelley 41). This groundwork is important because it provides the conditions for
                  an in-depth conversation about autonomy and gender—one of the ideas the novel investigates.
                  In their posts my students discussed Wollstonecraft’s argument that social expectations
                  and conventions shape identity by limiting freedom.</p>

               <p>The majority of pairings I assign are between chapters 10 and 20. I provide my students
                  with selections from Elliot Rodger’s manifesto that reflect similar isolation, anger,
                  and desire for violence. I’ve included them below with corresponding sections from
                  <em>Frankenstein</em>. My students make the connections between the readings without prompting outside
                  of my assigning them together. Below each pairing I’ve commented on my goals and the

               <h2><span class="head">Pairing One</span></h2>
               <blockquote class="quote">Humanity... All of my suffering on this world has been at the hands of humanity, particularly
                  women. It has made me realize just how brutal and twisted humanity is as a species.
                  All I ever wanted was to fit in and live a happy life amongst humanity, but I was
                  cast out and rejected, forced to endure an existence of loneliness and insignificance,
                  all because the females of the human species were incapable of seeing the value in
                  me. This is the story of how I, Elliot Rodger, came to be. This is the story of my
                  entire life. It is a dark story of sadness, anger, and hatred. It is a story of a
                  war against cruel injustice. In this magnificent story, I will disclose every single
                  detail about my life, every single significant experience that I have pulled from
                  my superior memory, as well as how those experiences have shaped my views of the world.
                  This tragedy did not have to happen. I didn’t want things to turn out this way, but
                  humanity forced my hand, and this story will explain why. My life didn’t start out
                  dark and twisted. I started out as a happy and blissful child, living my life to the
                  fullest in a world I thought was good and pure. (Rodger 1)</blockquote><br/><hr/><br/><blockquote class="quote">All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all
                  living things! . . . Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the
                  rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you
                  at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with
                  the blood of your remaining friends. (Shelley 90)</blockquote>
               <blockquote class="quote">Every where I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent
                  and good; misery made me a fiend. (Shelley 90)</blockquote>
               <blockquote class="quote">Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies. I am
                  miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. (Shelley 91)</blockquote>
               <p>I pair these sections to draw attention to two aspects of Shelley’s text. First, that
                  the Creature’s argument is transactional in a very specific way. He expects that Victor
                  will supply him with his desires, but he also expects that the people he encounters
                  in the world will supply him with happiness and love. In the absence of the fulfillment
                  of that expectation, the Creature and Rodger threaten violence. The feelings of others
                  are, in a sense, held hostage. When my students read these passages together, they
                  think about the implications of the conditions the Creature and Rodger place on the
                  feelings of others. They ask what it means to offer kindness, friendship, or love
                  out of fear of violence. In doing so, they start to question the anti-bullying rhetoric
                  that asks exactly that of children and teenagers.</p>
               <p>My students also begin to question culpability. If Victor won’t cede to the demands
                  of the Creature, is he responsible for the Creature’s actions? If the people he encounters
                  don’t love him, are they responsible for the murders he commits? Set side-by-side
                  with Rodger’s claim that others are responsible for his actions, they think more critically
                  about how the text is questioning what is owed to us and what is not. </p>

               <blockquote class="quote">I was completely and utterly alone. No one knew me or extended a hand to help me.
                  I was an innocent, scared little boy trapped in a jungle full of malicious predators,
                  and I was shown no mercy. Some boys randomly pushed me against the lockers as they
                  walked past me in the hall. One boy who was tall and had blonde hair called me a “loser”,
                  right in front of his girlfriends. Yes, he had girls with him. Pretty girls. And they
                  didn’t seem to mind that he was such an evil bastard. In fact, I bet they liked him
                  for it. This is how girls are, and I was starting to realize it. This was what truly
                  opened my eyes to how brutal the world is. The most meanest and depraved of men come
                  out on top, and women flock to these men. Their evil acts are rewarded by women; while
                  the good, decent men are laughed at. It is sick, twisted, and wrong in every way.
                  I hated the girls even more than the bullies because of this. The sheer cruelty of
                  the world around me was so intense that I will never recover from the mental scars.
                  Any experience I ever had before never traumatized me as much as this. (Rodger 48)</blockquote>

                  suffer such misery. (Rodger 54)</blockquote>
               <blockquote class="quote">I could go nowhere without being insulted by my enemies. The mere sight of them enjoying

                     a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement
                     and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not appear
                     rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful,
                     while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered
                     to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true; but
                     it vanished, when I beheld my person reflected in water, or my shadow in the moonshine,

                     creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances
                     breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream: no Eve soothed my sorrows,
                     nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator;
                     but where was mine? He had abandoned me; and, in the bitterness of my heart, I cursed
                     him. (Shelley 114)</p>

               <p>These sections highlight how the possession of women factors into our ideas about
                  masculinity and male happiness. Rejection by a woman, or women in general, is frequently
                  cited as catalyst for violence by mass shooters; Eric Harris kept a hit list of young
                  women he felt had rejected or spurned him, and Elliot Rodger claimed rejection was
                  his primary motivation. Similarly, the Creature tells Victor that the one thing that
                  will stop him from killing mankind is the creation of a woman specifically for him.
                  When my students read these sections together, they want to talk about the responsibility
                  being placed on women for men’s happiness and for the safety of others at the expense
                  of their own happiness and safety. They begin to see parallels between this aspect
                  of <em>Frankenstein</em> and our own culture and critique what they’ve been trained to believe.</p>
               <p>Often, this is a moment when my students bring Wollstonecraft back into play. Wollstonecraft’s
                  argument that women have the same divine potential and expectations as men helps them
                  think critically about how <em>Frankenstein</em> comments on the roles of women in society. In fact, my students this past semester
                  pointed out that Victor’s fear that a female he created might not love the Creature
                  is the first and only time in the novel that he recognizes the autonomy of a woman.</p>

               <p>Rodger, Harris, and the Creature all display narcissism here that is at direct odds
                  to their claims of inferiority in other places. These passages position my students
                  to think of violence in the novel and in our world as an expression of power, not
                  of frustration, fear, or helplessness, as the anti-bullying movement often claims.
                  This is the moment in the class when they most clearly critique the shooter-as-victim

                  “Bullies and Black Trench Coats: The Columbine Shooting’s Most Dangerous Myths.”
                  The article clearly lays out the misinformation that shaped the myth.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Pairing Four</span></h2>
               <blockquote class="quote">All I ever wanted was to love women, and in turn to be loved by them back. Their behavior
                  towards me has only earned my hatred, and rightfully so! I am the true victim in all
                  of this. I am the good guy. Humanity struck at me first by condemning me to experience
                  so much suffering. I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t want this. I didn’t start this
                  war... I wasn’t the one who struck first... But I will finish it by striking back.
                  I will punish everyone. And it will be beautiful. Finally, at long last, I can show
                  the world my true worth. (Rodger 137)</blockquote><br/><hr/><br/><blockquote class="quote">
                  <p class="noCount">While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the
                     murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared
                     to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young: not indeed so
                     beautiful as her whose portrait I held; but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in
                     the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting
                     smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over her, and whispered "Awake,
                     fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection
                     from thine eyes: my beloved, awake!"</p> 
                  <p class="noCount">The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and
                     see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act, if
                     her darkened eyes opened, and she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the
                     fiend within me not I, but she shall suffer: the murder I have committed because I
                     am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its
                     source in her: be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix, and the sanguinary
                     laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her, and placed the portrait
                     securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled. (Shelley 123)</p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>These last pairings reemphasize the danger to women I discussed above and the issues
                  of responsibility and autonomy. Students want to discuss who is responsible for emotions,
                  the person who experiences them or the one who may elicit them. The aim is not for
                  my students to condone bullying or become callus to the suffering of others, but to
                  help them question any rhetoric—individual or institutional—that holds them responsible
                  for the feelings and actions of another person. </p>
               <p>I know that there’s some danger in pairing these texts together. There’s the possibility
                  that my students will collapse historical distance and pay less attention to the particular
                  moment that produced <em>Frankenstein</em>. It’s a risk I’m willing to take. At its best literature helps us understand the
                  past and allows us to think more clearly about the present. At its very best it helps
                  us imagine a better future. My hope is that through reading and thinking about <em>Frankenstein</em> in conversation with these contemporary horror stories my students and I can learn
                  to do that.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">While the police believed they were engaged in a standoff, the two shooters committed
               suicide inside the school just over 40 minutes after the beginning of the attack.
               The police didn’t realize that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were dead until they
               found their bodies hours later. In fact, at least one of Klebold and Harris’s victims
               bled to death after the shooters committed suicide while the police were securing
               the school (Cullen 83).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">In addition to shooting classmates, Klebold and Harris planted bombs in and around
               the school. The bombs didn’t inflict the damage they had hoped—some of them didn’t
               even explode—but they still had to be carefully secured.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">The actual body count—thirteen, including twelve students and one teacher—was significantly
               lower than the originally reported twenty-five (Brockell).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris weren’t part of the Trench Coat Mafia (TCM) but it did
               exist. The boys knew students who were part of the TCM—so dubbed because the members
               of the group all wore trench coats—but none of the members were involved in the shooting.
               Prior to the shooting on April 20, most members of the TCM had either graduated or
               stopped wearing trench coats to school. The confusion seems to have arisen from Dylan
               and Eric using trench coats on the day of the shootings at least in part to hide their
               weapons (Cullen 147–48). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Rachel’s Challenge was named after Rachel Joy Scott, the first victim of Harris and

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Project Respect has come to focus more on teaching emotional intelligence but was

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">In fact, a National Voices for Equality, Education, and Enlightenment survey found
               that, “86% of students said, ‘other kids picking on them, making fun of them or bullying
               them’ causes teenagers to turn to lethal violence in schools” (Bullying Statistics).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
