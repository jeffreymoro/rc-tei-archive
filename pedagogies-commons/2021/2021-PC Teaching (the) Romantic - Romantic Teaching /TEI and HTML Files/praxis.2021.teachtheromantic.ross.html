            <p class="noCount">This article offers fresh and detailed information about how the elite schools and
               colleges of Oxford and Cambridge educated many of the canonical writers and public
               men of the Romantic Period. While these schools excluded women and non-Anglicans,
               they offered their students—among whom numbered Percy, Cowper, Darwin, Crabbe Wordsworth,
               Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, Sidney Smith, Canning, and most of the clergymen
               and men of state—a remarkable program of linguistic, mathematical, and theological
               training. Students began composing metrical verse in Latin and Greek from boyhood,
               studied logic and read Euclid’s geometry in Greek, did copious amounts of memory work,
               wrote “themes” several times a week in three languages, and declaimed and argued publicly
               at least once a year. Understanding how these writers were educated offers scholars
               of the period several new ways to think about and teach the works of those writers
               and the movement they inspired. It also allows students of the period to have greater
               appreciation of Romantic writers’ craft and their own experiences of learning about
               language, literature, and composition.</p>

                  <p>Understanding how writers of the English Romantic Period were educated offers modern
                     professors studying the period several new ways to think about and teach the works
                     of those writers and the movement they inspired. It also allows students studying
                     the period to have greater appreciation for Romantic writers’ craft and their own
                     experiences of learning about language, literature, and composition. Formal education
                     between the years 1770 and 1850 was neither well organized nor widely available in
                     England. Working class children might have had the benefit of no more than a few years
                     of instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic; they were considered “literate”
                     even if they could do nothing more than write their names. The daughters of the middle
                     and upper classes might be taught at home by their fathers, public-school educated
                     brothers, or governesses, and later sent away to ladies’ seminaries to improve their
                     reading and writing skills and to learn French, music, drawing, dancing, and fine
                     stitchery. University education was out of the question for English girls until late
                     in the Victorian Period, though some studied ancient Greek privately and used it to
                     publish translations of Greek tragedies.

                              from Oxford or Cambridge until the 20th century. Some colleges at both universities
                              did not become fully co-educational until the 1980s.</span></div>
                     </div> The sons of these families—many of whom are among the canonized poets of the period—were
                     more fortunate. They were sent away to one of the great public schools, such as Eton
                     or Harrow, or to one of the endowed grammar schools, such as Hawkshead or Chesterfield
                     Grammar, which prepared them for study at Oxford or Cambridge. Boys were packed off
                     to these schools no later than age thirteen; some boys were enrolled as young as age
                     eight. Wordsworth was nine when his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School; he
                     boarded nearby with Ann Tyson for eight years. Samuel Taylor Coleridge was ten when
                     he was sent to Christ’s Hospital. Horace Walpole boarded at Eton for seven years;
                     Shelley was there for six; Byron was at Harrow for five. With the exception of Shelley,
                     all of these students subsequently attended Oxford or Cambridge for at least three
                     years.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Among the other poets who were educated at what might be called the “Anglo-classical
                              academy” were poets such as Thomas Warton (1728–1790), Thomas Percy (1729–1811), William
                              Cowper (1731–1800), Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), George Crabbe (1754–1832), George
                              Dyer (1755–1841), William Lisle Bowles (1762–1850), William Wordsworth (1770–1850),
                              Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), Robert Southey (1774–1843), Lord Byron (1788–1824),
                              Percy Shelley (1792–1822), and Thomas Dale (1797–1870). Others writers and important
                              intellectuals of the period were similarly educated as well: This group includes John
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> These institutions taught these writers and many other middle- and upper-class boys
                     in their audience most of what they knew about the meanings, sounds, and use of language
                     in texts. These schools and university colleges were where many poets became remarkably
                     well-acquainted with literary forms, the art of writing, and the Western literary
                     canon.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Instruction at these elite schools focused on language. Youngsters began building
                  a rich classical vocabulary, first in Latin, later in Greek, through guided reading,
                  translation, memory work, recitation, and conversation. Students read verse in these
                  languages every day, and at least three days a week they were required to compose
                  verse and prose in them as well. Schoolmasters typically chose classical verse or
                  discourses that were intentionally didactic, such as Cicero’s epistles to his son
                  and Quintilian’s lessons on how to be “a good man . . . speaking well” (Bizell and
                  Herzberg 323–24). In addition to these circumstances, it is important to note that
                  all the teachers at these elite institutions were Oxford- or Cambridge-educated Anglican
                  clergymen and that every day school and college began and ended with communal celebration
                  of the Morning and Evening Prayer services. Moreover, teaching and learning at these
                  institutions were quite personal: schoolmasters lived, ate, and worshiped with their
                  students. Tutors at the two ancient English universities, which had a combined enrollment
                  of only 1250 students in 1800, also resided, shared commons, and worshiped in college
                  with their students. Romantic-era tutors were college fellows, and each worked individually
                  with a small group of students from the day they entered as freshmen. Tutors designed
                  and guided students’ reading, according to each one’s personal aspirations, in readiness
                  for the college exams. If a student was clever and ambitious, his tutor’s job included
                  helping him prepare for the much more competitive university exams that typically
                  lead to fellowships and a career in academia or the church. Tutors were responsible
                  as well for students’ behavior, belongings, and personal financial affairs. Added
                  to these circumstances, it was not unusual for students to be in the presence of members
                  of the royal family, bishops, and other statesmen, for these individuals were often
                  guests of honor at festivities held at the schools. University Chancellors were statesmen
                  or high-ranking men of court, and both universities elected their own Members of Parliament.
                  This collection of academic, religious, and social practices at the schools and universities
                  helps clarify why Coleridge thought of poets and other learned people as members of
                  a <em>clerisy</em> and why Shelley claimed that poets are the legislators of the world. It also explains
                  why Wordsworth asserted in the Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> that that poets are translators and why he wrote his friend George Beaumont that
                  “Every great Poet is a Teacher: I wish either to be considered as a Teacher, or as
                  nothing” (De Selincourt <em>Letters</em>, 195).</p>

                  <p>I have recently completed a book, tentatively titled <em>Training for the Writer's Life in Anglo-classical Academy, 1770–1850</em>. From a pedagogical perspective, the two most notable findings of my research are
                     how the Romantics were taught Latin and Greek “grammar,” which included not only vocabulary
                     building and syntax, but also memory work and explicit daily instruction about the
                     sound and rhythms of language, and how much writing students were required to do each
                     week. With regard to the possible influences this education may have had upon the
                     Romantics’ formal or thematic choices, one of the most interesting findings was how
                     familiar students became with a wide range of verse forms—from heroic couplets to
                     epics. Daily reading and instruction using scripture and the elegantly ordinary language
                     of the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> was also an important aspect of this education thanks to the Lectionary of the <em>BCP</em>; every month students read all 150 psalms, and in a year’s time, they read through
                     the entire New Testament.

                     I will suggest a number of assignments modern professors of the Romantic Period might
                     use to help their students have a richer appreciation of the word choice, linguistic
                     register, music, formal choices, and attitudes or themes that appear in poems written
                     by poets who had the privilege of this elite classical education.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Classical “Grammar”</span></h2>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Educators in the Romantic Period believed along with the Scottish poet James Beattie
                     that a person must be “something of a grammarian to be able thoroughly to understand
                     a well-written book . . . [for] the complicated inflexions and syntax of these elegant
                     tongues [give] rise to innumerable subtleties of connection, and minute varieties
                     of meaning, whereof the superficial reader, who thinks grammar below his notice can
                     have no idea” (508–9). Hence, the focus of the first years at school in the Romantic
                     Period was Latin “grammar,” which began with boys learning words in Latin along with
                     instruction in how to use them. These included “the art of spelling; . . . parts of
                     speech, with their accidents and formations; . . . the construction of words into
                     sentences, according to their several relations to each other . . .; and . . . the
                     quantity of syllables and their arrangement in versification” (<em>The Eton Latin Grammar</em> 3). The methods schoolmasters used to build students’ grammar skills began with explaining
                     and demonstrating the meanings of clusters of Latin words that appeared in simple
                     verse texts by writers such as Ovid and Terence. Teachers attended not only to the
                     meanings and proper grammatical use of words, but also, significantly, to the accents
                     and the quantities (the longs and shorts) of each syllable. Every night for homework
                     boys memorized the verses, vocabulary, and grammar rules covered in class. The next
                     day, they recited and reviewed the previous lesson, read more lines of verse, and
                     learned new words and grammar rules. This sequence would be repeated every day, with
                     review on Fridays and Saturdays.

                              not to go faster in teaching than boys could learn.</span></div>

               <p>The most common texts used in the lower forms were Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, composed entirely in dactylic hexameter; Terence’s verse comedies; and Phaedrus’s
                  Latin verse translations of Aesop’s fables. Beattie noted that reading these “harmonious”
                  and “amusive” stories as a youngster both awakened and soothed his “human passions”
                  (497). After a few weeks, boys were asked to compose their first <em>themes</em>, which were nonsense verses, comprised of strings of Latin words that fit simple
                  metrical patterns. The lines of words did not have to make sense; they simply had
                  to demonstrate the boys’ knowledge of the pronunciation of the words and the metrical
                  patterns they were learning. Pupils might be asked to compose these themes several
                  times a week. Once boys had large enough vocabularies, their teachers required them
                  to write verse themes that made sense. As mentioned above and also detailed below,
                  by the time a boy was thirteen or fourteen, he was composing verse and prose themes
                  every week.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Usually by their second or third year at school, students were reading much more complicated

                              at Hawkshead, where he used Hendricks’ Greek lexicon and owned his own copy of Demosthenes.
                              In 1785 his father also bought him a copy of Euclid in Greek and a Greek exercise
                              book. Wordsworth’s brother Christopher was similarly taught as a boy and both continued
                              their classical reading at Cambridge. Years later, when he became Master of Trinity,
                              Christopher Wordsworth encouraged Greek studies in English schools, and, despite the
                              dominance of Newtonian mathematics at the university, he encouraged interest in class…</span></div>
                     </div> A fifth-form student at any of these schools might be asked in one week’s time to
                     read, parse, memorize, and write translations of approximately 150 lines of Homer,
                     sixty lines of Horace, seventy lines of Virgil, and assorted passages from writers
                     such as Aeschylus, Euripides, Pindar, Sappho, and Cicero, as well as the Book of Psalms
                     and the Old and New Testaments. The standard text at virtually all the public schools,
                     grammar schools, and the universities was Virgil’s <em>Aeneid</em>. This text gave students the occasion to study some of the classical world’s finest

                     such as odes, hymns, psalms, and paeans; narratives such as epics, <em>epyllia</em> (mini-epics), comedies, tragedies, and tragi-comedies; verse epistles, satire, allegories,

                              which memory is one of the five canons. The Pythagoreans were especially dedicated
                              to using memory training, for they considered the possession of a powerful memory
                              as necessary to their endeavors to recollect the immortal soul. Memory was, therefore,
                              a necessary pre-condition of moral and spiritual excellence. In later Christian times,
                              cultivating the memory became a part of salvation theology. The importance of memory
                              is not unprecedented in other cultures. From at least the time of the Middle Ages,

                     an evening exercise, with great ease, and with apparent pleasure. This is really done,”
                     he said, “three or four nights in a week, in our best schools” (99). Assisted by their
                     natural sense of rhythm and the patterns of verse that they were learning, many students
                     easily memorized hundreds of lines of Latin and Greek verse. Schoolmasters also appealed
                     to youngsters’ natural competitiveness when assigning memory work. Boy battles over
                     who could memorize the most lines were not uncommon. When Arnold studied at Winchester,
                     he was reputed to have memorized three thousand lines of Homer (Clarke 54).

                     poetry, drama, and satire gave him a “copious and splendid command of language” and
                     an “ear tuned up . . . to the ‘noiseless music of the spheres’” (<em>The Etonian</em> 102). He also maintained that the experience of memorizing great literature gave poets
                     “prototypes” to “impregnate with the living soul and breath of [their own] Imagination”
                     (102). Critics and, indeed, writers themselves may never be entirely sure of the degree
                     to which the content, language, or rhythms of any text are original, recalled, or
                     a mix of both; but understanding the degree to which memory work was a part of the
                     Romantics’ education should be useful to scholars, particularly those interested in
                     the composition process, influence studies, or the trajectory of certain writer’s
                     careers. For example, Coleridge’s issues with plagiarism or Wordsworth’s valorization
                     of those “sublime” moments when memory helps a person “see into the life of things”
                     might be assessed in new ways in the light of this information.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As noted above, Romantic-era schoolboys were assigned compositions several times every
                  week. Along with their nonsense verses, students’ earliest writing assignments were
                  translations: first of the easy verses of Ovid, but later of much more complicated
                  classical and/or biblical texts in Latin and Greek. Students were instructed to avoid
                  word-for-word translations and, instead, to express the sense, verbal register, and
                  style of the original text in idiomatic English. As a Rugby student explained, this
                  was excellent writing practice because it excused boys from having to come up with
                  original ideas but gave them practice constructing sentences or lines of verse that
                  demonstrated careful word choice, that were grammatically correct, and that adhered
                  to accepted literary conventions. Boys called upon these translation exercises and
                  their memory work as well as their fulsome experience reading a variety of literary
                  forms to complete their many writing assignments.</p>
               <p>In the 1790s a typical week of compositions for the fifth form at Rugby included four
                  themes, at least two of which would be Latin or Greek verses; a translation in English
                  from a text in one of these languages; and a piece of verse or prose in English. Examples
                  of the verse topics Thomas Arnold assigned include: <em>Porcia, Catonis Filia, Bruti Uxor</em> (Portia, the daughter of Cato and wife of Brutus) and <em>Africa, bonarum atrium nutrix, nunc barbarie premitur</em> (Africa, once the nurse of benign skills, is now barbarically oppressed). His prose
                  theme assignments ranged from essays on miracles to realistic descriptions of the
                  state of affairs for residents of the continent in the summer of 1815. A typical week
                  at Tonbridge Grammar School included assignments to write a short ode in Greek, twenty
                  lines of iambic pentameter, a letter home in English, and a collection of Latin verse
                  epigrams, each with a different topic. The amount of daily and weekly practice Romantic
                  period schoolboys had using words, thinking about the meanings and sounds of words,
                  and composing various verse and prose forms is remarkable. By one calculation, a boy
                  who spent six years in boarding school might have translated as many as six thousand
                  lines of Latin or Greek prose and 4800 lines of Latin or Greek verse. This youngster
                  would have also written ninety prose essays and as many as 4200 lines of verse (the
                  equivalent of 300 sonnets).</p>
               <p>Romantic-era educators’ defense of requiring so much verse composition took several
                  forms. Themes were assigned not only to ensure boys appreciated quantities of Latin
                  words “without knowledge of which [they] will not be able to read Latin with propriety”
                  (Knox 60), but also to make sure boys learned to be precise and to waste no words.
                  Edward Copleston, the Professor of Poetry at Oxford, asserted in 1810 that educators
                  did not give verse assignments because they expected students to produce original
                  verse, but because “the poetic faculty exists to a certain degree in all minds and
                  should not lie uncultivated in any” (129). Moreover, writing verse teaches the “habit
                  of compression without obscurity, . . . of selecting the fittest materials . . . setting
                  them in the nicest order . . . and a command of pure, terse, polished diction” (Copleston
                  131). Producing lines of meaningful Latin in specified meters, teachers explained,
                  helped to tune students’ “ears to harmony” and to afford them “greater pleasure in
                  reading poetry” (Sergeant 31). In the <em>Biographia Literaria</em>, Coleridge remarks that his contemporaries’ admirable ability to “translate . . .
                  prose thoughts into poetic language had been kept up by, if it did not wholly arise
                  from, the custom of writing Latin verses, and [by] the great importance attached to
                  these exercises in our public schools” (388).</p>

                  <p>Not a few public and grammar school students, including Wordsworth, Byron, and Percy
                     Shelley, began writing and publishing English verse while in school, and several recognized
                     their calling as poets at school. In the <em>Biographia Literaria</em>, Coleridge says that he learned from his headmaster, James Boyer, that no word, “phrase,
                     metaphor, or image [in a poem should be] unsupported by a sound sense,” and that “plainer
                     words,” which can impart the same sense with “force and dignity,” are to be preferred
                     (381).

               <p>Among the books used to help Romantic period students with their study and writing
                  of poetry was John Newbery’s <em>Poetry Made Familiar and Easy</em> (1776). Newbery asserts that “Poetry’s task, since the earliest Ages of the World,”
                  is to “celebrate the Praises of the GREAT AUTHOR of the Universe” (ii). Its whole
                  aim and intention are “to <em>please</em> and to instruct” by borrowing from “Nature every thing that is gay and delightful”
                  and adorning its “Diction with Number and Harmony,” and by employing “the <em>Marvellous</em> and <em>Pathetic</em> in their proper Places” (v–vi). Newbery defines the “true Poet” as one who is <span class="quote">‘distinguished by a fruitfulness of Invention, a lively Imagination tempered by solid
                     judgment, and Nobleness of Sentiments and Ideas, and bold, lofty, and figurative Manner
                     of Expression. He thoroughly understands the Nature of his Subject; and [regardless
                     of the length of his poem], he forms a Design or Plan, by which every Verse is directed
                     to a certain End, and each has a just Dependance on the other. (8) ’</span> Examples of instruction such as this suggest that some of the Romantics’ most famous
                  statements about poetry, the poet, his imagination, and his embrace of the natural
                  world were not as original to them as scholars have assumed.</p>
               <p>So how might modern teaching scholars use this information about how the Romantics’
                  classical education endeavored to raise young men with “A copious and splendid command
                  of language and an ear tuned to the ‘noiseless music of the spheres’” (<em>The Etonian</em> 102)? For starters, we would do well to redouble our efforts to train students in
                  close reading, to remind them to attend to word choice (including the etymology of
                  key words), and to metrical matters in Romantic verse. New source and influence studies,
                  particularly ones that examine Greek and Latin pastoral verse and the religious texts
                  students read, including the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em>, are also indicated. In the spirit of this issue of <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Pedagogies Editions</em>, I offer the following categories and proposed class assignments or research projects,
                  which range from close reading to thematic studies. When I assign the projects suggested
                  below, I begin with a lecture on how the Romantics were trained, using the information
                  explained above, and discussion on the importance of understanding the contexts and
                  constraints under which writers labored. I also remind students that many in the Romantic
                  audience possessed similar literary and linguistic knowledge. These assignments will,
                  of course, require some revision based upon local curricula and individual professors’
                  teaching plans and their style of assignment-writing.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Etymology Exercises</span></h2>
               <p>I suggest that professors begin by explaining that educated Romantics were trained
                  in the classical languages from which English evolved. Students could recognize if
                  a word were derived from Latin, Greek, German, Old or Middle English, then follow
                  this plan:</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 1:</span> Working in pairs, ask students to select a passage from an early poem by Wordsworth,
                  such as the first ten lines of 
                  “An Evening Walk,”
                  which describe the countryside of the English Lake District. Then ask them to look
                  up the etymology of the key words in these lines in the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>. (They are almost all from Old or Middle English, not Latin. In my view, this is
                  no accident.) Ask each pair of students to discuss these word choices and then to
                  present their findings to the class.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 2:</span> Ask students to do the same etymological work with a much later work that focuses
                  upon another place, such as one of the poems about Rome in 
                  “Memorials of A Tour in Italy, 1837.”
                  The question for discussion might be, What differences in word choice do you notice?</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 3:</span> Ask students to compare word choice in a series of lyrics by classically educated
                  poets and those who were not, such as Charlotte Smith and John Clare, to see what
                  meaningful patterns emerge.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Prosody Exercises</span></h2>
               <p>A lesson on Romantic prosody should begin with an explanation of how students were
                  trained to recognize the music of language, the quantities of syllables, and conventional
                  metrical requirements of particular verse forms. Then students should be reminded
                  that students wrote verse every week, and this exercise ensured that they both understood
                  meter and had learned to use it skillfully. Ask your students, out of respect for
                  this tradition, to start paying more attention to the Romantics’ metrical efforts.
                  Then I suggest the following series of assignments:</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 1.</span> Begin this series of exercises with a lesson about prosody that reviews the different
                     feet, the line lengths, the notion of metrical contracts, and the purposes of metrical
                     variation. Some of this will be quite foreign and confusing to students. If this goes
                     well, add a brief survey of the metrical conventions of the genres that the Romantics
                     knew well, such as the epic, the pastoral, the ode, and the heroic couplet. Good sources
                     for these matters are Paul Fussell’s <em>Poetic Meter and Poetic Form</em>; John Hollander’s <em>Rhyme’s Reason, a Guide to English Verse</em>; Timothy Steele’s <em>All the Fun’s in How You Say a Thing</em>; Ellen Stauder’s online <em>Interactive Tutorial On Rhythm Analysis</em> used at Reed College, which cites Derek Attridge’s method of scansion among others;

               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 2.</span> Follow these lessons with a close metrical analysis of an easy, regular poem, such
                  as Wordsworth’s 
                  “I wandered lonely as a cloud”
                  ; it is very regular iambic tetrameter until line 6, where the first significant variation
                  occurs: “<em>Flut</em>’ring and <em>danc</em>ing in the breeze,” a move that emphasizes the liveliness of the daffodils (De Selincourt
                  149).</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 3.</span> Next try the same exercise on Wordsworth’s 
                  “We Are Seven”
                  ; it uses alternating lines of tetrameter and trimeter, but the pattern is not clear
                  until stanza three. I suggest that you acknowledge this and then ask students to start
                  their scanning practice with stanza three, noting where and how Wordsworth varies
                  the meter elsewhere in the poem. Then ask students why Wordsworth might have chosen
                  to <em>begin</em> the poem with stanzas that vary the metrical pattern that he later uses throughout
                  most of the rest of his poem.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 4.</span> If this exercise goes well, challenge students to have a go at a passage from 
                  “Tintern Abbey”
                  in De Selincourt’s <em>Poeticial Works</em>. I suggest starting in stanza four in the middle of line 88 at “For I have learned
                  / To look on nature, not as in the hour / Of thoughtless youth,” and stopping at the
                  end of the stanza with these words: “the nurse / The guide, the guardian of my heart,
                  and soul / Of all my moral being” (De Selincourt, lines 109–10). I ask them to look
                  for the lines that are pure iambic pentameter versus the ones where Wordsworth varies
                  the accents. The question, again, is as follows: What is accomplished by the metrical
                  variations?</p>
               <p class="noCount">For students wishing to pursue the subject of meter in English poetry further, you
                  might suggest that they read Meredith Martin’s <em>The Rise and Fall of Meter: Poetry and English National Culture, 1860–1930</em>. Though the period she focuses upon is later, her discussion of how meter offers
                  insight into issues such as class, identity (both personal and national), and patriotism
                  is compelling.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Form Study</span></h2>
               <p>A third possible close reading exercise, once students have reviewed classical forms
                  such as the ode or georgics and the English sonnet tradition, challenges students
                  to examine the Romantics’ management of literary forms and conventions. Even though
                  sonnets are not a classical form, I include them because trying to do this exercise
                  with longer poems is hard for some undergraduates. Any of the odes by Wordsworth,
                  Coleridge, and Keats as well as well-known pastoral verses or georgics of the period
                  that students might select themselves are good for such work. I also suggest asking
                  students to compare sonnets by several Romantics, at least two of whom were not classically
                  trained. Wordsworth’s 
                  “Prefatory Sonnet”
                  (it serves a double purpose of introducing the form with its tight structure and of
                  representing Wordsworth’s style), Coleridge’s 
                  “Work Without Hope,”
                  Keats’ 
                  “On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer,”
                  Byron’s 
                  “Sonnet on Chillon,”
                  Shelley’s 
                  “Lift not the painted veil,”
                  and Charlotte Smith’s 
                  “To Night”
                  all work well. I invite the class to compare each poet’s handling of structure and
                  metrics and to discuss how these contribute to the impact and fluidity of the lines.
                  The question for discussion is as follows: Are the poems by classically trained poets
                  noticeably different? When students find differences, I challenge them to rank the
                  effectiveness of each poet’s aesthetic and formal choices and to explain their rationale
                  for their ranking.</p>

               <p>A graduate student with a classical background might be encouraged to undertake comparative
                  study of odes by Pindar and Coleridge for an article or thesis. I have not tried this
                  yet, but I yearn to challenge graduate students to select examples of one of the victory
                  odes (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">epinikia</span>) of Pindar, which, as Rutherford aptly notes, are “highly poetic, full of compounds,
                  unusual words, and florid metaphors” and which discourse on the theme of “ambition
                  for fame in spite of risk” (178–79). The tasks would be for students to map those
                  compounds, odd words, and metaphors, and then to compare Byron’s use of compounds,
                  odd words, and metaphors in one of the cantos of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>. A similarly classic-focused exercise would be to introduce senior majors in a Wordsworth
                  seminar to Clancey’s book about Wordsworth’s classical training, <em>Wordsworth's Classical Undersong: Education, Rhetoric, and Poetic Truth.</em> Ask students to compare one of the passages from Horace (in translation) to a text
                  by Wordsworth. After they have done the work, have students read Clancey’s discussion
                  of the same texts and see if they have been able to replicate any of his analysis.</p>

               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 1.</span> Remind the class what the Rugby student, quoted above, said about the value of translation
                  work and then ask them to “translate” several short verse texts by the Romantics into
                  prose. This would work well with Coleridge’s 
                  “Kubla Khan”
                  or with some of the confusing stanzas in 
                  “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.”
                  Shelley’s and Keats’s sonnets, because they are shorter, would work for this exercise
                  as well.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 2.</span> Have students select a Romantic poet they admire and three or four of his or her
                  poems. Ask them to read each text closely—checking the etymology of key words, parsing
                  the grammar, translating the poems into prose, memorizing at least one of the poems,
                  and drawing conclusions about the poet, the poems, and the experience of studying
                  them this way. This exercise could be expanded into a term project, in which students
                  select more poems and prepare a class presentation, starting with a recitation of
                  a representative poem.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">Step 3.</span> To give students a chance to experience the composition training schoolboys at Romantic

                  did for two weeks. Assuming a Monday, Wednesday, Friday class schedule, ask them to
                  compose lines of verse for two classes each week; on the third day of the week discuss
                  the experience and what it taught them about the composition process in a short essay
                  (the Romantic educator would call it a theme). Possible verse assignments could be

                  Wordsworth. Compare your findings to work by John Clare on the same theme. He knew
                  the agricultural scene even more intimately than Wordsworth and was not classically
                  educated.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">(3)</span> Have students read the Anglican liturgies for Morning and Evening Prayer, select
                  a week in the school year, consult the Lectionary in the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em>, and have students note the scriptures that would have been part of the services
                  that week. Then ask students to find at least three Romantic poems that discuss themes
                  such as sin and/or forgiveness. Challenge them to find the psalms and gospel texts
                  that treat these themes and then compare language and approach.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">(4)</span> Compare Horace’s notion of the ideal gentleman to characters in Jane Austen’s novels
                  or to Robert Walton, Victor Frankenstein, his father, and/or his friend Henry Clerval.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span style="font-weight:bold">(5)</span> Review the Romantics’ memory training as youngsters, research what modern cognitive
                  scientists know about memory, and then collect and discuss Romantic-era poems about
                  memory.</p>
               <p class="noCount">To conclude, each of these assignments might disrupt your usual method of studying
                  Romantic texts, but all can help modern students gain fresh insights into the lives
                  and work of the Romantics and into their own learning and writing experiences. Asking
                  our students to write as often for class as the Romantic schoolboys did will teach
                  them what a difference practice and revision can make in their own compositions. Knowing
                  what Romantic schoolboys and college students were trained to do with words and literary
                  forms and how central linguistic and metrical issues were to those students’ early
                  experience with literature will support modern professors’ requests that their students
                  pay greater attention to close reading, word choice, and meter. This information also
                  underscores how important it is, in general, to consider texts in their historical
                  context. Knowing how intensively and carefully many of the Romantic writers worked
                  on poetry as schoolboys helps modern students to appreciate why Wordsworth claimed
                  to have “acquired a greater readiness and power in expressing what he thinks and feels”
                  because he had learned that the situation of an accomplished poet “is altogether slavish
                  and mechanical” (Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> in De Selincourt 734–41). These circumstances also explain why Wordsworth claimed
                  to have a “sublime notion of poetry” (738). Finally, the story of the Anglo-classical
                  tradition in Romantic-era schools and colleges may even make some modern students
                  jealous of the Romantics’ richly stocked memories and sensoria and inspire them to
                  study classical languages.</p>

               academy” were poets such as Thomas Warton (1728–1790), Thomas Percy (1729–1811), William
               Cowper (1731–1800), Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), George Crabbe (1754–1832), George

               Percy Shelley (1792–1822), and Thomas Dale (1797–1870). Others writers and important
               intellectuals of the period were similarly educated as well: This group includes John
               Wesley (1703–1791), David Hartley (1705–1757), Samuel Johnson (1709–1784), Horace
               Walpole (1717–1797), Adam Smith (1723–1790), William Gilpin (1724–1804), Henry Cavendish

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Even though an avowed atheist, Shelley demonstrated the effects of his early biblical
               training right up to the month of his death, when, according to Holmes, he kept a
               small vellum notebook in which he recorded bits of verse and Biblical fragments (726).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Dr. Vincent, the headmaster of Westminster when Southey was there, cautioned schoolmasters

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">We know that by the time he was fourteen, Wordsworth had advanced to Greek studies
               at Hawkshead, where he used Hendricks’ Greek lexicon and owned his own copy of Demosthenes.
               In 1785 his father also bought him a copy of <em>Euclid</em> in Greek and a Greek exercise book. Wordsworth’s brother Christopher was similarly
               taught as a boy and both continued their classical reading at Cambridge. Years later,
               when he became Master of Trinity, Christopher Wordsworth encouraged Greek studies
               in English schools, and, despite the dominance of Newtonian mathematics at the university,
               he encouraged interest in classical studies at Trinity. As Bruce Graver has reminded
               us, it was through his brother at Trinity that Wordsworth “kept in touch with many
               of the leading Hellenists of the day” (42).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Charles James Fox, who attended Eton and Oxford, is reputed to have carried a volume

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Alcaics are strophes of three or four lines, which usually consist of eleven, ten,

         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">An indication of how well-acquainted boys were with the purposes and conventions of
               prosody can be discerned in the questions appearing in the grammar textbook used at
               the Bath Grammar School in 1794. These included “What is the use of Prosody,” “What
               are the Feet most commonly made Use of?”, “Of how many Syllables does a Dactyl consist?”,
               and “What is Synalaepha?” (Morgan 9, 10, 15, 20).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">A mora is a lingering or “long” syllable. A moraic trochee is a foot in which the
               first syllable is a “long” syllable, which, therefore, carries more stress than the
               first syllable of a simple trochee.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">The emphasis upon memory work is founded on the classical rhetorical tradition, in
               which memory is one of the five canons. The Pythagoreans were especially dedicated
               to using memory training, for they considered the possession of a powerful memory
               as necessary to their endeavors to recollect the immortal soul. Memory was, therefore,
               a necessary pre-condition of moral and spiritual excellence. In later Christian times,
               cultivating the memory became a part of salvation theology. The importance of memory
               is not unprecedented in other cultures. From at least the time of the Middle Ages,
               Chinese students were expected to memorize the Five Classics and the Four Books of
               Confucian teaching along with the commentaries by Zhu Xi (1130–1200). The Brahmin
               tradition of India even today depends upon students having highly trained memories.
               The Vedas and commentaries are memorized using elaborate methods, including memorizing
               syllables of passages in reverse to the end that all rituals will be correctly chanted.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               that “honour, spirit, [and] liberality, will be acquired, by committing to memory
               the thoughts and words of heroes, and of worthies, who eminently shone in every species
               of excellence” (102).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
