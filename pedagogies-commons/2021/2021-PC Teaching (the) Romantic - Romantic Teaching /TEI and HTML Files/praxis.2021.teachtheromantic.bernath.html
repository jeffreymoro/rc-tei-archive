            <p class="noCount">In this article, I examine my recent experience in teaching a spring semester literature
               module to undergraduates. The module is centered around the critical concept of the
               “brown study” in William Cowper’s evening meditation in <em>The Task</em>. The fading twilight in the winter evening of Cowper’s meditation leads him to reflect
               on the place where he produces literature about nature: inside in his <em>brown study</em>. The class begins with an examination of the critical concept of the brown study
               as a commonplace in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literatures. How is the brown
               study contemporary with the development of the concept of the professional literary
               author?</p>
            <p class="noCount">The brown study is a physical place to write poetry, a designated room in a private
               house for professional authors, and, most importantly, a creative frame of mind for
               writing that an author achieves within the study itself. The last definition, signifying
               a frame of mind in the contemplative mode such as Noah Webster’s serious reverie or
               Samuel Johnson’s gloomy meditations, is the primary definition in the <em>Oxford English Dictionary Online</em>. We approach the new history of the now-anachronistic brown study through exemplifications
               of ruminative stances in poetry, in which a poet’s aesthetic first-stage inspiration
               is broken down. The deconstructive process, informed by readings from Wellmer, Freud,
               Adorno, and Derrida, is approached in the ways that authors unconsciously select and
               make distinctions as the initiative experiences are digested, then to be taken into
               the second-stage reflections that are recorded during composition.</p>
            <p class="noCount">The class’s literature survey covers William Wordsworth’s <em>Lyrical Ballads Preface</em>, James Thomson’s <em>The Task</em>, Anna Letitia Barbauld’s <em>The Invitation</em>, Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>Letters from Sweden, Norway and Denmark</em>, and William Cowper’s <em>The Task</em>, paired each with background from introductory scholarship on the composition processes
               of the author. We follow the survey of two-stage writing with a classroom discussion/essay
               assignment on the artistic processes of Romantic-era literature and authorial identity
               supported by readings from William St. Clair, Catherine Gallagher, Stephen Greenblatt,
               and Tilottoma Rajan. The class also examines the brown study as a physical space furnished
               in the writings of several authors who describe their creative processes at home:
               John Keats, Mary Wollstonecraft, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and William Cowper. At last
               we consider how one might create a brown study with elements from the topics in the
               literature from the course module.</p>

                     “Brown Study”
                     Aesthetics</span></h2>
               <p>Wind rattling at the window, fire in the grate, and a poet dozing in his chair are
                  images in William Cowper’s 
                  “A Winter’s Evening: Brown Study.”
                  The presence of an aesthetics of a brown study is an issue I invite my classes to
                  study in their theoretical approach to Romanticism from a Survey of British Literature
                  I class. In the class, we study the two stages of composition theory—I: <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Eingedenken</span> and II: Composition (linguistic)— in writing that appears in poetical works by William
                  Cowper, William Collins, James Thomson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Anna
                  Letitia Barbauld, Mary Wollstonecraft and William Wordsworth. The brown study aesthetics
                  poems each feature the two phases, Eingedenken and Composition. In William Cowper’s
                  <em>The Task</em> 
                  “Book 4: A Winter’s Evening,”
                  aesthetic response occurs in a state of unconscious reflection preceding representation
                  in language. The poet is half-awake and daydreaming. The poet appears overcome with
                  images. At rest after a long day, he is, at least for the present moment, inarticulate.
                  The poet’s frame of mind calls up Theodore Adorno’s theory in <em>Negative Dialectics</em> that aesthetic response is pre-linguistic. In the brown study, Cowper’s poet enjoys
                  a “parlour twilight” and “sweet oblivion of the cares of day” (4.278, 4.250). Theoretically,
                  according to Adorno’s model and following models such as Albrecht Wellmer’s in <em>The Persistence of Modernity: Aesthetics, Ethics and Postmodernism</em>, aesthetics precedes articulation (Wellmer 3–4). However, thoughts that follow an
                  aesthetic response may transpire to linguistic utterances as part of a purposeful
                  inquiry inspired by earlier experiences in an aesthetic state (Wellmer 3–4).</p>
               <p>The images in Cowper’s <em>The Task</em> and additional period brown study aesthetics poems are part of a module that I included
                  in a Spring 2019 literary studies course for undergraduates. In the module, the class
                  discussed poetical tropes of two-stage composition: (1) the pre-linguistic stage and
                  (2) the linguistic stage. Cowper’s images are a part of a historical tradition of
                  poetical images of slumbers and reflections. Pre-linguistic images precede later images
                  of the compositional phase such as John Keats at his writing office in Joseph Severn’s
                  painting “John Keats at Wentworth Place” (Appendix A).</p>
               <p>We begin the module with the first stage of composition, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Eingedenken</span>, the pre-linguistic phase William Cowper theorizes in <em>The Task</em>, and we conclude with the second stage of composition, Composition, the linguistic
                  phase. In <em>The Task</em> 
                  “Book 3: The Garden,”
                  Cowper claims that he travels widely during his lifetime. However, in order to write
                  poetry, Cowper returns always to the place of his opening theme of repose from 
                  “Book 1: The Sofa.”
                  The reflective observation situates the sofa, an upholstered chair with soft cushions
                  in the brown study of a poet’s house, as a primary site of attraction for the itinerant
                  poet. Intent on self-discovery through the process of Eingedenken, the poet must prioritize
                  the sofa, as he explains: "I, designing other themes, and called / To adorn the Sofa
                  with eulogium due, / To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams" (3.13–15). The
                  poet in Cowper’s account travels widely with the aim to reflect on “themes” which
                  he “designs” in pre-linguistic impressions from outside, in nature, and in the city.
                  He returns to the sofa to digest what he saw in “dreams” and in “slumbers” for reflection,
                  after his first-stage travels take him far: </p>

               </blockquote>
               <p> Cowper’s “eulogium” (3.12) on the sofa is a “eulogy” for dead nature without including
                  “mir[e]” (line 4), “slough” (line 5), and “entangle[ment]” (line 2) in a confusion
                  of images now aestheticized in the brown study to be later written down in poetical
                  form. The traveler in the “greensward,” like Cowper’s poet, finds inspiration for
                  writing when he later returns to the sofa to write a formal “eulogium” or a memorial
                  for times passed. During a brown study period, the poet will contemplate themes in
                  nature while in a state of repose, in effect mindfully resting in a state of the Derridean
                  unconscious before he or she later will revive images for writing poetry in an elegiac
                  reconstruction of past events in the phase of Composition (linguistic phase).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. The “Curtain of Repose”: Nature in the Mindful Unconscious</span></h2>
               <p>The author’s awareness of the pre-conceptual space is the “mindfulness [<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Eingedenken</span>] of nature in the subject,” according to Albrecht Wellmer in <em>The Persistence of Modernity: Aesthetics, Ethics and Postmodernism</em> (74). Nature is the state of the unconscious in a brown study repose. The author’s
                  mindful attention to the state of repose evokes in the author his or her own consciousnesses
                  of the boundaries that necessarily are in existence between his or her mind and the
                  objects of thought. As Wellmer explains, the author achieves <span class="foreign" xml:lang="du" lang="du">Eingedenken</span> “within the medium of conceptual thought, the necessary condition being that the
                  concept itself is turned against the reifying tendency of conceptual thought” (4).
                  The thought is a delimitation of the awareness of a state of natural repose. The brown
                  study in Romantic literature such as Cowper’s <em>The Task</em> is the state of fading thoughts during the twilight hours of a “curtain of repose”
                  (4.248) that may exist, for poets, prior to a state of enlightenment that occurs later
                  on. In present-day critical theory of brown study compositional poetics by Tilottama
                  Rajan and Richard Adelman, the authors examine the truth value of synthesis and reconstructive
                  aesthetics, known as an <em>alethiology</em>, or truth discovery.</p>
               <p>Theodor Adorno’s theory in <em>Negative Dialectics</em> examines the unconscious or pre-linguistic phase as a corrective to the presence
                  of the conscious. The source of truth is found in the unconscious state, such as in
                  idle contemplation, dreaming, or brown study mental repose (Adorno 348). Sigmund Freud
                  also uses the unconscious for what he perceives to be an other apparent in the consciousness,
                  as Gayatri Spivak explains in the translator’s preface to Derrida’s <em>On Grammatology</em> (Spivak 86). Jacques Derrida too critiques the foundational theory of a conscious
                  intentionality. Joseph Adamson explains: following Sigmund Freud’s discovery of the
                  unconscious memory, the Derridean “critique of metaphysics and of the ‘presence’ of
                  consciousness” leads towards Derrida’s own idea of the unconscious, which “owes much
                  to Freud’s discovery of the unconscious and theory of unconscious memory” (Adamson
                  296).</p>
               <p>Derrida forms his thoughts on deconstruction out of his thoughts on the unconscious,
                  which indeed are a source of Derrida’s own theory of deconstruction. In Derrida’s
                  critique of the foundation of metaphysics, Joseph Adamson shows, he aims to provide
                  a corrective to the overwhelming presence of the conscious in metaphysical theory:
                  “Derrida’s writings critique the Western metaphysical tradition, which he sees as
                  dominated by a discourse of ‘presence’ in the assumption, for example, that truth
                  is a function of the presence of consciousness to itself and to its object. . . .
                  What Derrida calls deconstruction consists in an analysis which overturns these tenacious
                  metaphysical foundations” (Adamson 296). The direction of the critique of the conscious
                  is the recovery of the unconscious from alterity.</p>
               <p>Cowper’s “curtain of repose” in <em>The Task</em> draws out the rest of unconsciousness in a “recess” from the outside world of travel
                  and consciousness (4.248, 4.308). During the recess, Cowper dreams of the process
                  of defoliation he has seen out of doors. The activities of the harvest take in the
                  “golden” summer growths leaving an “upturned” soil of “mellow brown” (4.314–15). The
                  harvester takes apart the growth of spring and summer with the scythe of autumn. Variegated
                  nature appears in images of the “rough wind,” “frost raging,” “faded” meadows, “lands
                  . . . of a mellow brown” reaped by the “forceful share”: </p>

               <p> The time for memorializing the past seasons of spring and summer is during the seasons
                  of adverse weather and during the seasons of autumn and winter. The period of recess
                  occurs because the poet is unable physically to participate in activities outdoors
                  due to the adversity of the late autumn weather.</p>
               <p>Like Cowper, William Collins reflects that his spring and summer rambles end when
                  the adverse fall weather occurs. He seeks a woodland cottage where he may contemplate
                  “dim-discovered spires” and “hamlets brown” (Collins line 37). The process of observations
                  and obscurity call to mind a cityscape in the evening or in the nighttime hour like
                  Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s nighttime composition in 
                  “Frost at Midnight.”

                  shades of the evening in gradually darkening “dim” and “dusky” tones of grey and brown
                  (37, 40). Coleridge’s poet, contemplating in a brown study during the evening in winter,
                  remembers “cloisters dim” while at school when he recalls his own childhood and his

               <p>The “eternal language” is a composite of the pre-linguistic “shapes and sounds” that
                  appeal to the aesthetic nature of the poet and his family in the “image[s]” of the

                  of his own state of unconsciousness, evocative of Wellmer’s <span class="foreign" xml:lang="du" lang="du">Eingedenken</span>, the mindfulness of “nature in the subject” (74). The poet’s contemplation of the
                  passing of the day occurs while under a “brown” twilight or under an obscure “curtain
                  of repose” (Cowper 4.248). The phase of unconscious reflection for a poet could sometimes
                  last several hours or take over the day; Keats in his letter number 41 to Benjamin
                  Bailey demands that his friend “give me” some time to compose in “a long brown plain”
                  or stretch of time for several hours to take up the whole of “my morning” in his <em>Letters</em> from Teignmouth on Friday on March 13, 1818. Severn’s “Portrait of Keats” shows the
                  author staring sightlessly at a book, bearing the “real symptoms of sadness” from
                  his late life, and the image is reminiscent of the elements of Cowper’s “eulogium”
                  (3.12) for natures past, an elegiac celebration of past experiences in brown study
                  aesthetic repose.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III. “To Adorn the Sofa with Eulogium Due”: Creative Minds at Home</span></h2>
               <p>In the theory of brown study compositional poetics, writing that follows contemplation
                  of experience is subjective and offers a truth value of synthesis and reconstructive
                  aesthetics, known as an <em>alethiology</em>. The alethiology is a truth value discovered through access to the “nature of truth”
                  (<em>OED</em>), seen in Eingedenken, the brown study’s first, aesthetic stage of creativity preceding
                  the conceptual thought of the second, compositional stage of creativity. In a Romantic
                  poem written in the brown study aesthetic, the element of “undecidability” should
                  precede the concept, according to Tilottama Rajan (472). As the initial experiences
                  are digested in a deconstructive and self-aware pre-conceptual process, authors unconsciously
                  select and make distinctions. The aesthetic experience is especially powerful in what
                  Richard Adelman defines as the idle or vacant mind, where space occurs between the
                  experience of an object and the concept of the object itself. The period of idle reflection
                  in Cowper’s brown study passage is a stage in contemplation between “voluntary and
                  involuntary” processes of thought, as Adelman explains (76). Despite the involuntariness
                  of contemplation, the mind has a “particular set of abilities” to produce a concept
                  for reconstruction of an idea (Adelman 64).</p>
               <p>Following the Derridean deconstructive stage of creativity, named in poetics by Cowper
                  as the brown study stage, “it is not necessary . . . to reassemble the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">disjecta membra</span>” of the day’s experiences in a structured form (Rajan 464). The deconstructed text
                  of nature in the poet’s experience “can still be alethiological, because the very
                  process of undecidability discloses truth” (Rajan 464). Poetical fragments, notes,
                  marginalia, and free writing are written expressions of undecidability. For poets
                  who are writing in a two-stage process, an idea for a theme is drawn from the brown
                  study and the “thematic expression” then leads to the secondary phase of the rhetorical
                  structure of the poem (Rajan 452).</p>
               <p>The deconstructive process provides material in fragments, notes, and marginalia that
                  are recorded during composition to be taken into the second stage reflections. The
                  class’s survey of composition processes in the second stage of writing covers William
                  Wordsworth’s <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> preface, Anna Letitia Barbauld’s <em>The Invitation</em>, James Thomson’s <em>The Seasons</em>, Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>Letters from Sweden, Norway and Denmark</em>, and William Cowper’s <em>The Task and Other Selected Poems</em>, each paired with introductory scholarship on the composition processes of the author.</p>
               <p>In Paul de Man’s essays on Romanticism, Tillottama Rajan explains, “the problem of
                  intentionality is historically localized in romantic literature, which is in transit
                  from a medieval literature that grounded allegorical representation in anagogic presence
                  towards a kind of Mallarmean pure poetry that would not be undone by any desire to
                  emerge from the palace of art” (Rajan 455). Schiller writes in <em>Naïve and Sentimental Poetry</em> of the aesthetic pre-concept: “Just as nature began gradually to disappear from human
                  life as <em>experience</em> . . . so we see her arise in the world of poetry as <em>idea</em> and <em>object</em>. . . . The poet, I said, either <em>is</em> nature or he will <em>seek</em> her” (Schiller 105–10). The poet deliberately seeks the Eingedenken or nature of
                  the mindful unconscious in order to generate natural or inspired poetry. William Wordsworth
                  theorizes the nature of Romantic poetry in <em>Preface</em> to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>: <span class="quote">‘I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes
                     its origin from origin recollected in tranquility: the emotion is contemplated till
                     by a species of reaction the tranquility gradually disappears, and an emotion, similar
                     to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and
                     does itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition gradually
                     begins, and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of whatever
                     kind and in whatever degree, from various causes is qualified by various pleasures,
                     so that in describing any passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the
                     mind will upon the whole be in a state of enjoyment. Now if Nature be thus cautious
                     in preserving in a state of enjoyment a being thus employed, the Poet out to profit
                     by the lesson thus held forth to him. (183)’</span> Wordsworth creates “the poet as a prophetic figure who [is] defining a subjectivist,
                  expressivist poetics that continues to condition poets’ and critics’ understanding
                  of the lyric,” as Nicholas Halmi explains in the notes to <em>Preface.</em> Anna Letitia Barbauld, in her poem <em>The Invitation</em>, suggests a creative mood in “nature” overseen by a “muse” of poetry (1.97, 1.13).
                  Barbauld also intends an “invitation” of creativity to her friend Miss Belsham, the
                  poem’s dedicatee. A cultural ingenuity in cultivated composition is emphasized in
                  Barbauld’s writings; William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft explain: “She seeks, both
                  in herself and in others, to cultivate the disposition (which she assumes exists)
                  to respond 'naturally' to experience” (McCarthy and Kraft 19).</p>
               <p>Barbauld aims to encourage Belsham’s creative awakening in nature. Barbauld and Belsham
                  walk the grounds of Warrington Academy—a school of sciences and arts for young gentlemen
                  established by Barbauld’s father John Aikin—and view the riverbanks of the Mersey
                  River and the trees of the grounds. “Will Delia [Belsham] at the muse’s call retire
                  / To the pure pleasures rural scenes inspire?” she asks (lines 13–14). May “fair ideas
                  all her fancy fill,” hopes Barbauld (8): </p>

               <p>“The cool, the fragrant, and the silent hour” is the compositional time the author
                  sets aside for putting words to feelings (Thomson 4.62). In the metaphorical prose
                  of Wollstonecraft’s <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark</em>, the author shares her experiences of walking outdoors and thoughts on observing
                  the details of the landscape, the flowers, fields, and rocks, around the town of Gothenberg
                  in Sweden.</p>
               <p>Following the day’s travels, Wollstonecraft explains, she writes at home about her
                  experiences in a quiet hour. Ingrid Horrocks, in her introduction to Wollstonecraft’s
                  oeuvre, points to a “nostalgic strain in philosophical . . . thought” in the <em>Letters</em> as Wollstonecraft eulogizes the day and her separation from family (Horrocks 25).

                  , Wollstonecraft contemplates, “Why fly my thoughts abroad, when every thing around

                  the closing flowers” (Wollstonecraft 59). However, due to the brightness of the moon,
                  “I could write at midnight very well without a candle. I contemplated all nature at
                  rest; the rocks, even grown darker in their appearance, looked as if they partook
                  of the general repose, and reclined more heavily on their foundation” (Wollstonecraft
                  59). Earlier in the same day described in 
                  “Letter 1,”
                  Wollstonecraft describes “still little patches of earth of the most exquisite verdure,
                  enameled with the sweetest wild flowers” and she mourns the passing of the day (57).</p>
               <p>The poet in Cowper’s <em>The Task</em> finds “the country wins me still,” and his strategy for translating pre-linguistic

               <p>The two-stage writing period is clear in the contrast between Cowper’s “very dreams”
                  of childhood rural scenes and his mature writing in the writer’s “bower” among the
                  rooftops of London which offer him “amends” for the “lost world” of youth (4.670,
                  4.728, 4.729–30). In the physical stage of writing “verse” about nature while living
                  in the city, Cowper states that nature is to him “a lost world” now that he lives
                  in the London town of Chertsey (4.730). Yet, while in London, the poet finds that
                  he can obtain in the process of writing “rich amends / For a lost world in solitude
                  and verse” (4.729–730). Cowper sees his verses written in the city as miniature container
                  gardens representative of a larger nature outside. Adjacent to the “brick” walls of
                  homes in the city are “boxes planted thick / And watered duly. There the pitcher stands
                  / A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there,” a synecdoche of “how close pent-up
                  man regrets / The country” (4.771, 4.775–78).</p>

               <p>Adelman’s study in <em>Idleness, Contemplation and the Aesthetic, 1750–1830</em> reclassifies several idle activities during the Romantic era. Adelman’s study “charts
                  the construction of the category of idle, aesthetic contemplation” outside the parameters
                  of the categories of “working.” His study begins with Romanticism’s idleness “up until
                  the very point at which this category is put to work in opposition to the political
                  economy that inflected, and indeed anticipated, its parameters” (Adelman 9). The activities
                  of reading and writing may fall alongside the activities of retirement, rest, and
                  solitude.</p>
               <p>For Mary Wollstonecraft and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the interiority of the study
                  creates an aesthetics of order and structure from chaotic externality. “I then retired
                  to my apartment,” explains Wollstonecraft of her first night of Swedish residency,
                  but “my senses had been so awake, and my imagination still continued so busy, that
                  I sought for rest in vain” (59). Coleridge’s retirement in 
                  “Frost at Midnight”
                  at Nether Stowey in Somerset is characterized by interior reflection, and his thoughts
                  similarly move from inside with his newborn child to abstractions about the past day
                  and the nature outdoors: </p>

               <p>In <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>, Sigmund Freud explains, “We are concerned with unconscious thought, and . . . the
                  process may easily be a different one from that which we perceive in ourselves in
                  intentional contemplation accompanied by consciousness” (263). Freud remarks that
                  theme and symbol may “not belong particularly to [a single] dream, but rather to the
                  unconscious thinking” which may be found “in the folklore, . . . myths, legends, and
                  manners of speech…” of a culture, such as in its poems and prose literary texts (245–46).</p>

                  Keats speaks of his composition of poetry in 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale,”
                  and Joseph Severn paints him in <em>John Keats at Wentworth Place</em> (1821, Appendix A). Severn writes in his letters that Keats was at repose in a compositional
                  phase in the study surrounded by the furniture necessary to writing. The components
                  of the study during Keats’s composition of 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale”
                  are presented in detail and are confirmed by Keats’s friend Charles Brown: <span class="quote">‘This was the time he [Keats] first fell ill &amp; had written the Ode to the Nightingale
                     (1819) on the mor[ning] of my visit to Hampstead I found him sitting with the two

                     given him by his old landlady in the Isle of Wight. After this time he lost his cheerfulness
                     &amp; I never saw him like himself again.) I had a draw of the room, chairs &amp;c done by
                     Mr Charles Brown who was still living in the same house. (Severn qtd. in Woof and

               <p>Following the classroom lectures on the brown study aesthetics in period literature,
                  undergraduate students complete an assignment that pairs a critical approach to authorship
                  in the Romantic era with an author’s discussion of his or her own practices of authorship
                  in a brown study mood, defined by activity and/or location in a furnished space. The
                  critical approaches (students choose one of three) are William St. Clair’s approach
                  to professional writing in 
                  “The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period”
                  ; Catherine Gallagher and Stephen Greenblatt’s approach to “the triumph of an expressivist
                  and creative notion of language” in 
                  “Practicing New Historicism”
                  (Gallagher and Greenblatt 13); and Tilottama Rajan’s theory of aesthetics and “the
                  palace of art” in “pure poetry” in 
                  “Displacing Post-Structuralism: Romantic Studies after Paul de Man”
                  (Rajan 455). The students may pair one of the three critical approaches with a text
                  by one of the authors (prose or poetry) studied in lecture.</p>
               <p>The students may choose widely from within the authors’ oeuvres corresponding with
                  the poems, letters, and essays listed on the course’s syllabus. Provided the students’
                  theoretical approaches to the literature are sound, the students may, in ways that
                  may be broadly understood, interpret their texts’ approaches to questions of authorship.

               <p>Even Cowper’s gardeners who are “unfurnished” in their efforts to cultivate may recapture
                  nature, with comparatively little to represent “the means of life” (4.770). The pre-linguistic
                  phase of admiration is sustained in the compositional recording of the details of
                  the scene, which become imbued with the life of the inner mind. Following the contemplative
                  stage is a reconstruction of experiences into a poem, yet the reconstruction stage
                  preserves the tone and meaning of the pre-linguistic phase. The resonance between
                  the aesthetic pre-conceptual space and the conceptual space is tonally expressed:
