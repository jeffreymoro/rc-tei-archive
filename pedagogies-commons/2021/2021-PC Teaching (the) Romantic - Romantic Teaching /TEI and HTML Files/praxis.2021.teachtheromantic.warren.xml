            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">In this essay I relate how a last-minute teaching assignment in an
                    area outside my expertise led to a semester of teaching that was, by necessity,
                    spontaneous and experimental, and how that first exciting semester set the
                    course for a class that made not only poetry, but living itself, an object of
                    critical inquiry. The title of the essay, <title type="a">Living
                        Romanticism,</title> indicates what the two aims of the course became: to
                    suggest to my students that Romanticism is still alive, and second, to offer
                    Romanticism as a way of living. In the essay I describe the evolution of the
                    course, explaining how the various assignments, designed to foster fluency in
                    the aspirations, methods, and ways of being and knowing the Romantics embraced,
                    emerged and changed over time. By telling the story of how encounters with
                    British and American Romantics transformed both me and my students, the essay
                    argues that literary studies is a discipline that should, overtly and
                    explicitly, aspire to more than the conferral of skills, capacities, and
                    historical knowledge.</p>

                <p>In the fall of 2015, a class I was supposed to teach on contemporary literature
                    didn’t make, so my colleague Tim and I batted about other options for me, seeing
                    as I had to teach <emph>something</emph>. “How about this course on the British
                    Romantics?” Tim proposed. Our resident Romanticist had recently left our
                    institution, and her course was still on the schedule. Someone needed to step
                    in. “Are you up on your Wordsworth?” Tim asked. My immediate response was an
                    unequivocal “no.” I am an Americanist by training, and more well versed in
                    realism and naturalism than in Romanticism to boot. But because the alternative
                    that fall was teaching advanced composition, I dusted off an old Norton and a
                    book by Harold Bloom and got to work. </p>
                <p>I’ve been teaching Romanticism in some fashion ever since, whether British or
                    American or both. During that time my life has shifted, the world opening up in
                    subtle but significant ways, and Romanticism has been both the lever for that
                    shift and the lens I perceive it through. The ideas, insights, and language I’ve
                    immersed myself in and talked to my students about have given me a vocabulary
                    for stirrings I’ve had since I was a child, becoming personal provocations, less
                    definite than a map or a guide, but propelling nonetheless. </p>
                <p>This is not how professors are supposed to think about literature. Our training
                    encourages us to interpret, analyze, and argue. Instead, I find that my response
                    to the texts I teach these days is to <emph>feel</emph>, first of all, and then
                    to inhabit the literature subjectively in order to test its use as “equipment
                    for living,” in the evocative phrase that titles one of Kenneth Burke’s essays
                    (Burke, <title level="a">Literature as Equipment for Living</title> 293). As an
                    outsider to the field, I came to Romanticism unencumbered by the debates roiling
                    in scholarly journals or by any sense that a particular poem was so canonical as
                    to be dull. One might also call that position ignorant or even irresponsible, I
                    am aware. But it was my ignorance that made it possible for me to submit to the
                    poems in a way I might not have otherwise. I was naïve enough to approach the
                    period uncritically, and my uncritical embrace of what the Romantics had to
                    teach me in the fall of 2015 shaped the way I taught the period from there on
                    out. </p>
                <p>The title of my essay&#8212;<title level="a">Living
                    Romanticism</title>&#8212;points in two directions. It suggests that Romanticism
                    is still alive, and second, it offers Romanticism as a way of living. In what
                    follows, I’ll explain how these directions became the pedagogical aims through
                    which I sought to reproduce the practice of Romanticism both in the classroom
                    and in my students’ lives. The approach I describe below emerged as I taught a
                    course on British and American Romanticisms three times, over a period of a year
                    and a half. In this class, my ultimate goal was to pave the way for my students
                    to be transformed, as I have been, by their encounters with Blake, Wordsworth,
                    Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Emerson, Hawthorne, Poe, Thoreau, Whitman,
                    Dickinson, and (David Foster) Wallace. A highly canonical lineup to be sure (no
                    surprises there), except perhaps for the inclusion of Wallace. It was what we
                    did with them that was innovative&#8212;or maybe just so rearguard as to be
                    novel these days.</p>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>Romanticism Is Still Alive</head>
                    <p> My first step, back in 2015 and in the semesters that followed, was to
                        create a mood in the classroom that made the subject we were studying seem
                        current, relevant, and ongoing. Music has been one of the most effective
                        tools in achieving this aim. I use it to create an atmosphere, playing a
                        song in the five minutes or so before class begins and accompanying the song
                        with a PowerPoint with visuals for the day: portraits of the writer,
                        photographs of the landscape they lived in, perhaps a picture of a house, or
                        a gravestone.</p>
                    <p>With my own musical library in mind and more than a little help from Google,
                        I assembled a list of songs that took me through all 42 class days. Some of
                        the links were obvious, as with Patti Smith’s <title level="a">My Blakean
                            Year</title> or Iron Maiden’s <title level="a">The Rime of the Ancient
                            Mariner</title> (which I played along with PowerPoint slides of the
                        Gustave Dore woodcuts). Others, less evident, I could explain to my
                        students’ satisfaction: Wilco’s song <title level="a">Born Alone</title> is
                        assembled from fragments of nineteenth-century poetry, including
                        Dickinson’s; U2’s <title level="a">I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For</title> evokes the
                        restless dissatisfaction of the poet in Shelley’s <title level="a">Alastor.</title> But other
                        connections were more tenuous; the songs were like the literature in mood,
                        but with no direct link. The Avett Brothers’ <title level="a">Head Full of Doubt</title> and a
                        handful of songs by Elliott Smith all evoke, for me, a host of Keatsian
                        paradoxes and tensions by way of intricate songwriting. The Indigo Girls’
                        <title level="a">Prince of Darkness</title> and Elton John’s <title level="a">Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters</title> both
                        extend a generous, open hand to our many-peopled world, much in the spirit
                        of Whitman. James Rovira’s excellent edited volume <title level="m">Rock and
                            Romanticism</title> presents an extended argument about rock music as a
                        renaissance of Romantic thought, exploring the Romanticism inherent in
                        musicians including Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and Leonard Cohen. I
                        wasn’t aware of his book at first though; I was riffing.</p>
                    <p>Admittedly, many of these choices were, as one student pointed out on a
                        student feedback survey, “subjective.” Of course. But subjectivity was
                        something I leaned into in this class, and I encouraged my students to do
                        the same, looking for ways that, to them, Romanticism was manifest in the
                        world around them. It didn’t take long for the students to join in, emailing
                        me with their suggestions for musical matches to the reading, including
                        Lynard Skynrd’s <title level="a">Simple Man</title> for Thoreau, or
                        Bastille’s <title level="a">The Weight of Living Part 1,</title> with its
                        albatross reference, and plenty of songs I’d never heard of. By the end of
                        the course, we’d collectively assembled a robust playlist of songs that had
                        the power to transport us right back into the poetry and prose we’d explored
                        together.</p>
                    <p>While music built an affective bridge from us to the Romantics, the
                        literature itself&#8212;and the direction our discussions of it
                        took&#8212;was sometimes all that was needed to recognize the persistence
                        and relevance of Romantic concerns in the present. This was the case with
                        Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>. My students
                        recognized Shelley’s need to defend the literary arts in a climate that
                        applauded technological advances and material progress as a pressing one
                        that has not gone away; in fact, such a defense might be more necessary
                        today than it was in the nineteenth century. Shelley writes, “The
                        cultivation of those sciences which have enlarged the limits of the empire
                        of man over the external world, has, for want of the poetical faculty,
                        proportionally circumscribed those of the internal world; and man, having
                        enslaved the elements, remains himself a slave” (530). Our conversation
                        about these lines assumed a decidedly presentist bent from the get-go, as we
                        talked about the way our smart phones, the internet, and our social media
                        accounts have circumscribed our worlds and limited our powers of
                        observation, even as they have expanded the scope of what we, in theory, can
                        notice and perceive. It was Shelley’s emphasis on perception that moved my
                        students more than anything. In discussion and in their writing assignments,
                        they pointed repeatedly to his assertion that “poetry lifts the veil from
                        the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they
                        were not familiar” (517). This, for many of them, was the heart of
                        Romanticism, the preeminent idea that they took away from the class.</p>
                    <p>Shelley and Keats also gave my students a new way to think about their
                        education. We discussed at length Shelley’s notion of how the moral
                        imagination develops through the empathetic engagement that literature helps
                        foster. The English majors in my class were familiar with needing to defend
                        their choice of major to their parents, their friends, and themselves. They
                        could rehearse the familiar claims that we humanists make about the value of
                        critical thinking, analysis, clarity of expression, and close reading. They
                        were, in other words, used to taking the practical skills and habits of mind
                        that English studies helps develop and putting them toward some other, more
                        workman-like application: law, journalism, technical writing. What few of
                        them had considered before was Shelley’s claim that reading literature has a
                        moral component. He writes, <quote>The great secret of morals is Love; or a
                            going out of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the
                            beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A
                            man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he
                            must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains
                            and pleasures of his species must become his own. The great instrument
                            of moral good is the imagination. (517)</quote> For those students
                        in possession of a traditionally religious sensibility, this passage
                        affirmed for them the goodness of their academic vocation. For those
                        committed to working for social justice, the idea that reading is a way of
                        regarding the pain of others helped them to see what we did in the classroom
                        not as divorced from practice, but essential to it. This portion of the
                            <title level="m">Defence</title> led to conversations about the
                        importance of reading about people who are not like you, even about people
                        whom you may not like. It led us to consider what limits can be placed on
                        empathetic identification, whether some perspectives are more worthy of our
                        time and effort than others. Should we bother reading a short story written
                        from the point of view of a racist sheriff, like James Baldwin’s <title
                            level="a">Going to Meet the Man,</title> or is our time better spent in
                        imaginative dedication with a victim of racism? What is the value&#8212;or
                        is there one?&#8212;of inhabiting a point of view we find repellant? It also
                        got my students to reconsider literature they had heretofore thought of as
                        “apolitical,” for they began to think of seeing through other eyes as one of
                        the most intimate, and enduring, political acts at hand.</p>
                    <p> Keats followed Shelley in my syllabus, so when we got to his letter to his
                        brother and sister-in-law demarcated in the Norton as <title level="a">The
                            Vale of Soul-Making,</title> they were primed to consider the question
                        that critic William Deresiewicz, invoking Keats, raises in his book <title
                            level="m">Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American
                            Elite</title>. To what degree do our institutions of higher learning
                        encourage the development of the ethical and moral components of the self
                        (Deresiewicz 13–15, 77–87)? The university I teach at is not educating the
                        American elite. Still, my students were eager to discuss Keats’s notion of
                        the world as a “vale of Soul-making” and to think about the role their
                        classroom educations had played shaping and refining their emotional, moral,
                        and ethical intelligences (117). Their answer, mainly, was that this facet
                        of education was rarely foregrounded in the classes they had taken. In
                        exploring Shelley’s and Keats’s ideas about the centrality of literature to
                        human flourishing, community, and ethics, however, my students became
                        inspired to make those kinds of connections themselves. For many of them, a
                        link that had been tenuous or implicit became visible, and thereby plastic.
                        Shelley and Keats empowered my students to take more responsibility for
                        their educations and to make the cultivation of their very
                            <emph>person</emph> a central part of that process.</p>
                    <p> At the end of this course, I fast forward to the twenty-first century as a
                        way of demonstrating to my students that even though we can demarcate the
                        Romantic period temporally, a certain Romantic sensibility, set of concerns,
                        and philosophical or spiritual posture that is Romantic in nature persists
                        in present-day literature and culture. To illustrate the point, I turn to
                        David Foster Wallace’s Kenyon commencement address&#8212;a short, pithy text
                        that contains links back to many of the thinkers we’ve studied. Wallace, a
                        picture boy for postmodernism, is also, I submit, a closet Romantic, more
                        earnest than ironic. Most of my students haven’t heard of David Foster
                        Wallace in the first place, so they don’t need me to persuade them of this
                        reclassification, and when they turn to his commencement address from 2005,
                        the links are apparent enough. Here he is, concerned, like Shelley and
                        Keats, with the moral dimensions of education. Wallace is keen to
                        demonstrate the limits of a liberal arts education and to propose that we
                        all go further, learning not just how to think, but what to think
                        about&#8212;a proposal that Thoreau voices, albeit in different phrasing,
                        throughout <title level="m">Walden</title>. Like Coleridge, Wallace suffered,
                        trapped by his own perspective and a frequently recurring sense of numbness
                        and distance from the world. Wallace confronts the despair-inducing
                        potential of everyday life and challenges his audience to transform that
                        life, and themselves, through empathy and imagination. In his climactic call
                        to action, he sounds downright mystical, evoking Whitman and Emerson, to be
                        sure, if not Blake, when he challenges us to pay attention so that it will
                        be within our power to “experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type
                        situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force
                        that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things
                        deep down” (93).</p>
                    <p> The closing exercise for this course on British and American Romanticisms,
                        which we turn to immediately after discussing Wallace, is an activity I
                        named the “Whither Romanticism?” forum. At the beginning of the semester, I
                        challenge my students to keep their eyes and ears open for Romantic
                        artifacts in our contemporary culture, and at the end, they share their
                        findings with the class. As I put it to my students, the idea is to ask
                        whether, how, and to what degree Romanticism persists in the present day. Is
                        it a literary movement that ended in the nineteenth century, or is it a
                        transhistorical movement, a structure of feeling that grows out of specific
                        circumstances? If it’s the latter&#8212;and, obviously, this exercise
                        presupposes an answer to that question&#8212;what might those circumstances be? We
                        take one class day for three-minute presentations on the
                        artifacts&#8212;quick, clear, and concise. Then the next class day is
                        devoted to a wide-ranging conversation about Romanticism emerging from the
                        archive they assemble.</p>
                    <p> Most students did not struggle to come up with an artifact; in fact, many
                        had trouble limiting themselves to one. It was no surprise to me that many
                        students chose music, given the nudge I’d provided by framing each class day
                        with a song. The rapper Tyler the Creator appeared more than once across the
                        three semesters, as did David Bowie and the singer-songwriter India Arie. I
                        can always seem to count on interest in the Gothic; at least one student
                        each semester chose a TV show or movie in that genre to talk about. Two of
                        the more intriguing contributions over the years were Instagram&#8212;a
                        technology that aestheticizes ordinary objects of everyday life&#8212;and
                        the blog <title level="j">Humans of New York</title>, which, à la Whitman and 
                        Wordsworth, trains its focus on regular people thus rendering them marvelous 
                        in their specificity and uniqueness. </p>
                    <p> This exercise made my students feel like experts on Romanticism, able to
                        apply what they’d learned about the nineteenth century to culture in the
                        twenty-first. On the second day of our forum, I challenged them to consider
                        what the artifacts they’d assembled could tell us about the connections
                        between Romanticism and capitalism, race, gender, and politics. One
                        semester, there were at least three Disney films submitted as Romantic
                        artifacts, which raised the question of whether Romanticism has been coopted
                        by the culture industry, repackaged and sold back to us and our children in
                        the form of movie tickets and plush toys. (My students were less troubled by
                        this possibility than I.) Was Romanticism available to people of color and
                        to white women, who, by and large, were missing from our syllabus? My
                        students felt that it was, and demonstrated as much through their analyses
                        of songs by Kendrick Lamar and Joanna Newsom. One semester, with visible
                        trepidation, a student posed this question, “Is there something Romantic
                        about MAGA?” Her question, which she feared would offend or inflame her
                        classmates, led instead to a productive conversation about the function of
                        nostalgia in both Romantic thinking and contemporary politics. </p>
                    <p>An exercise like this&#8212;and a presentist approach like mine—risks
                        collapsing the temporal distance of two centuries, potentially flattening
                        out the historical specificity of both our moment and the Romantics’. I’m
                        okay with that. From my perspective, what we have to gain by becoming
                        intimate with the past outweighs what is lost.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>Romanticism as a Way of Living</head>
                    <p>How can a teacher encourage students to experiment with Romanticism as a
                        way of living, in and outside of the classroom? I didn’t set out to do that
                        at first. Only after I taught Romanticism a couple of times did it become
                        apparent to me that I was, in fact, presenting Romanticism as a way of being
                        in the world, one that I promoted through my assignments and activities. And
                        once I realized that, I made my purpose explicit, both to myself and to my
                        students.</p>
                    <p>One assignment that I came to hope might change the way my students and I
                        inhabited the world was the requirement to memorize and deliver a (Romantic)
                        poem. Inspired by an article in the <title level="j">New York Times
                        </title> that ran in August 2017, <title level="a">Memorize that
                            Poem!,</title> by Molly Worthen, I added the poetry recitation
                        assignment to the syllabus right at the beginning of the semester, an
                        impulsive last-minute addition. I wanted them to internalize a poem&#8212;to live
                        with its words in their head. Speaking for myself, I’m sometimes alarmed by
                        the sheer number of 1980s and 1990s rap lyrics I have at my command, yet
                        there’s no Keats in my mental library, no Wordsworth, and hardly any
                        Dickinson. That, I decided, had to change. How might my vision of the world
                        be transformed if I could summon the words of those poets at will?</p>
                    <p>I told my students that I would memorize along with them; I wasn’t going to
                        make them do something I myself was unwilling to do. So, I started small and
                        built up, eventually going for broke with Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Ode:
                            Intimations of Immortality Upon Recollections of Childhood</title> (I
                        still have a few stanzas of that one to go). This practice did, indeed,
                        shift my way of being in the world. I carried stanzas of Blake with me on my
                        runs, the trochees matching my footfalls. I whispered <title level="a">Frost
                            at Midnight</title> to myself while watching my daughter on the
                        playground. I ran over Wordsworth when stuck in a traffic jam. Now, even
                        though I’m taking a break from this practice, phrases will float up into my
                        consciousness when I need them, offering a slightly different way of seeing
                        things, a gloss on my understanding. </p>
                    <p>From what I can tell, it didn’t exactly work that way with my students.
                        Predictably, many of them chose the shortest poem they could find. I
                        listened to a lot of declamations of <title level="a">The Tyger.</title>
                        After one semester of this, I changed my evaluation system so that only by
                        choosing a longer poem could one earn the highest grade, sort of like the
                        scoring system for Olympic diving. Students started to be bolder in their
                        choices, and some of them went on to memorize poems beyond the syllabus,
                        committing to memory works that moved them, personally, just so that they
                        could have those words at the ready. I’ve seen former students around
                        campus, and I always ask, do you still have that poem in your mind? Most of
                        them do. </p>
                    <p>My writing assignments were more effective than the poetry recitation in
                        fostering fluency in the aspirations, methods, and ways of being and knowing
                        that the Romantics embraced. Teaching Romanticism coincided with a certain
                        weariness on my part with respect to the traditional analytic essay. I
                        wanted to find a way for students to write about literature that required
                        them to understand it well enough to adapt it to their own purposes. To that
                        end, the first writing assignment, called “Romantic Imitation,” asked
                        students to write a poem in the form of either <title level="a">The
                            Tyger</title> or <title level="a">I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud.</title>
                        As I explained to them, one way to appreciate the relation of meter to
                        meaning is to attempt to reproduce that meter oneself. I told them that the
                        form had to match one of these two poems, and the content should align with
                        either Blake’s or Wordsworth’s thematic concerns: Christianity, social
                        critique, the ordinary, or recollection, just to name a few. My hope was
                        that students would be inspired by Blake and Wordsworth to apprehend their
                        own lives in a different way. The second part of the assignment required
                        that they write an analysis of their poem, explaining how it was in keeping
                        with one of the two poets’ visions. What this assignment got students to do,
                        in almost every case, was to see moments in their own lives&#8212;from buying
                        groceries, to going on a morning run, to remembering childhood&#8212;as worthy of
                        poetic contemplation.</p>
                    <p>Another writing assignment asked students to compare the poetic visions of at
                        least two British Romantics by drawing on the poets’ work in prose. This
                        project evolved over three semesters. The first time, I asked them simply to
                        make a chart comparing and contrasting various poets’ answers to questions
                        like “what is a poet?” and “where does poetry come from?”, as well as “what
                        can poetry contribute to society?” Grading those charts was stultifying. But
                        one submission jolted me to attention. It was a PowerPoint presentation in
                        which the student imagined Ellen DeGeneres putting those questions to
                        Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats. Ellen’s commentary in between responses
                        served as the analysis. The format was brilliant, her innovation hilarious,
                        and the whole project showed me that she understood the poets’ ideas,
                        because she could adapt them to a new context.</p>
                    <p>The next semester, using that student’s PowerPoint as a model, I modified the
                        assignment so that students had to bring the poets into conversation in some
                        new arena, be it an interview, or perhaps an exchange of letters, or maybe
                        even writing a short play in which two or three of them interact. The
                        requirement was to incorporate the poets’ own words into the new scene while
                        also writing new dialogue that they used analytically to compare and
                        contrast the poets’ ideas. One student made a comic strip story board in
                        which Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats go for a walk together,
                        discussing negative capability and the possibility that poets are the
                        unacknowledged legislators of the world while they wander past a field of
                        daffodils and hear a nightingale calling in the distance. This student wove
                        the poets’ words into a dialogue that highlighted their commonalities while
                        also drawing attention to their differences. Another student wrote a rap
                        battle between Wordsworth and Coleridge (with a special guest appearance by
                        Blake!), after the fashion of MTV’s <title level="a">Wild ‘N Out,</title>
                        with Nick Cannon. From what I gather&#8212;I’ve never seen the
                        show&#8212;one member of each team is chosen to compete against a member of
                        the other team in a lyrical showdown. Wordsworth started the battle off. <quote>

                        the entire thing to the instrumental beats of the Houston-based DJ Screw, I
                        was floored. We all were. By translating the Wordsworth and Coleridge
                        relationship into a familiar idiom, he made the poets’ ideas modern and
                        their complicated friendship relatable, taking Wordsworth’s behavior in the
                        historical record and transforming it into the braggadocio for which rappers
                        are well known. It was brilliant.</p>
                    <p>It was the last assignment in the course, however, that most explicitly asked
                        students to think about elements of Romanticism as potential equipment for
                        living. I asked them to write a listicle&#8212;a mix of list and
                        article&#8212;that answers the question “how should a person be?” by using
                        the ideas and language of Thoreau, Whitman, or Emerson personally and
                        seriously enough to consider what the writers’ convictions and advice might
                        mean for us today. They didn’t have to be direct about it, though, so long
                        as they got at the question somehow. “So basically,” one student asked, “you
                        want us to write clickbait?” Pretty much, I answered&#8212;but intelligent,
                        nerdy clickbait, with quotations, citations, and analysis. Clickbait for
                        English majors. Some of them put their listicles online, using Listly.
                        Others kept it simple, with Word documents or PowerPoints. All of them
                        managed to harness the language of American Romanticism and adapt it to the
                        present, with titles promising to tell us why Emerson should be your
                        therapist, what kind of boyfriend Whitman would make, or why you wouldn’t
                        want to invite Thoreau to your housewarming party. </p>
                    <p>The titles were classic clickbait, all right, but the substance of each item
                        on the list went far beyond what one would expect from a site like Buzzfeed.
                        The student who wrote about how you might recognize your current paramour as
                        Whitman reincarnated accompanied each item in her list with a GIF. Number
                        four on her list, <title level="a">He Has a God Complex,</title> came with a
                        picture of Kanye West gesticulating against the background of the following
                        words: “Everybody says, ‘Who does he think he is?’ I just told you who I
                        thought I was, a god. That’s who I think I am.” Below the Whitman/West
                        juxtaposition, her own analysis appears, <quote>Other guys stare at the
                            stars and marvel at the universe. Your guy thinks he <emph>is</emph> the
                            universe. Whitman boldly claimed he was “a kosmos” (<title level="m"
                                >Song of Myself</title> 497) and although he isn’t a total
                            megalomaniac, his empathy, rejection of shame, and connection with
                            others makes him feel a little special&#8212;<emph>prophetically</emph>
                            special. Whitman’s highest worship was his own body, declaring “Divine
                            am I inside and out, and make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from”
                            (524). Try to reason with him all you want, but he’ll just tell
                        you that he can’t “understand who there can be more wonderful than myself”
                        (1281), which is a great argument until it’s his turn to wash the dishes.</quote>
                    Her tone is teasing and familiar, but even as she pokes fun at Whitman for
                        his grandiloquence, she also makes clear that one way to be in the world is
                        to assert that <emph>you are the world</emph>. In her analysis, the student
                        points to the way in which embodiment itself can be sacred.</p>
                    <p> Other students were more earnest. Another list, <title level="a">Thoreau’s 7
                            New Year’s Resolutions to Rejuvenate Your Life in 2018,</title> included
                        items such as <title level="a">Ditch the Unnecessary Luxuries,</title>
                        <title level="a">Focus on Your Character Rather Than Your Deeds,</title>
                        <title level="a">Turn Off the Tech,</title> and <title level="a">Don’t
                            Enslave Yourself to Success and Public Opinion.</title> In mining <title
                            level="m">Walden</title> for advice, the student had found pieces of
                        wisdom she could embrace. The introductory paragraph to her listicle offered
                        Thoreau as a contemporary guru. <quote>Have you ever set out into the new
                            year determined to remodel your life, but found yourself slipping back
                            into the monotony of your old day-to-day routine? Have you struggled in
                            the past to start living the kind of life that allows you to live freely
                            and meaningfully? Oftentimes in drafting resolutions, we focus on making
                            changes in our outer lives, while ignoring the fact that external habits
                            are rooted in internal values. Henry David Thoreau’s ideas and critiques
                            on how a person should live will help you achieve a fresh start in
                            transforming your view of your identity, your purpose, and the way you
                            engage with the world around you.</quote> By way of their listicles,
                        some wry and teasing, others heartfelt, my students managed to convey
                        something enduring about the American Romantics’ proposals about how to live
                        in the world. </p>
                    <p> Sometimes my nudge toward living romantically was spontaneous, as when I was
                        preparing for the day’s discussion of Emerson’s <title level="a">The
                            American Scholar</title> and I came upon these words: “Man Thinking must
                        not be subdued by his instruments. Books are for the scholar’s idle times.
                        When he can read God directly, the hour is too precious to be wasted in
                        other men's transcripts of their readings” (96). It seemed to me downright
                        criminal to sit there in a classroom to discuss those words, so I didn’t.
                        That day, we sped through the highlights of Emerson’s essay. Then, when one
                        student pointed out this line and answered me accurately when I asked her
                        what it meant, I sent them all out of doors. I told them to wander around
                        campus for the remainder of our time that day, not together, and without
                        their phones. Their only task was to pay attention to what was around them,
                        and, at the end of the day, to email the class their observations.</p>
                    <p> Seeing the emails pour in was exciting. A lot of students noticed how little
                        they’d noticed before. Many of them paid attention to the squirrels, and the
                        birds, and the trees. Others saw how often their fellow students walk around
                        with earbuds in, tuning out. Many of them simply appreciated the opportunity
                        to be outside without a destination, just being. I took their words and wove
                        them together, erasing individual authorship in the process but coming up
                        with a multivoiced “I”&#8212;“Unity in Variety,” as Emerson might say (<title
                            level="m">Nature</title> 52). The next class day, I gave them my collage
                        of their observations, and we read it aloud together. Over the three
                        semesters I did this exercise, which was spontaneous the first time and
                        then, of course, ceased to be, but the students loved it&#8212;in sun, in rain,
                        in the early spring chill. Together they wrote,<quote>
                            <p rend="noCount">I started thinking a lot about presence, and how much
                                of my life I spend existing in a place other than the physical space
                                I am currently occupying. I am always thinking ahead or behind,
                                worrying about the past or the future or both, so much so that the
                                present usually goes unnoticed.</p>
                            <p rend="noCount">It all reminded me how sometimes it's easy to get lost
                                in what you feel you should be doing, what is expected of you from
                                society, or maybe even trying to find your way in life. Nature,
                                however, has no concept of these kinds of pressures, it just takes
                                life for what it is.</p></quote> In feedback surveys, several
                        students cited the day they spent outside as the most valuable of the
                        semester. The best day of class was the day they wandered around alone,
                        without me. I tried not to take it personally.</p>
                    <p> Given how much they relished being outside, when I taught a course on
                        Transcendentalism, I took my class on a hike at a nearby nature preserve.
                        Seven of them showed up, unused to being out of bed at 10 am on a Saturday
                        and giddy at the prospect of seeing each other off campus. As we made our
                        way through the scrubby cedar forest and into the sunshine, over muddy
                        trails and by meadows of bluebonnets, the students said they wished they
                        could get outside more often. They talked to each other, and to me. Every so
                        often, we stopped and read aloud a piece of Thoreau’s essay <title level="a"
                            >Walking.</title> Taking in Thoreau’s words in the classroom is one
                        thing; reading them in the sunshine as we beheld the lake and trees below us
                        was quite another. On the hike, two students climbed a tree. One broke a
                        shoe. Another brought water for the rest of the group. When we got back to
                        the parking lot&#8212;muddy, sweaty, tired&#8212;the bond among us was
                        warmer and more affectionate than it had been when we set off. We closed
                        with these words of Thoreau’s&#8212;“So we saunter toward the Holy Land,
                        till one day the sun shall shine more brightly than ever he has done, shall
                        perchance shine into our minds and hearts, and light up our whole lives with
                        a great awakening light, as warm and serene and golden as on a bankside in
                        autumn”&#8212;and said goodbye (280).</p>
                    <p> Did these nudges move the students toward a different way of being in the
                        world? Yes, in some cases. A few weeks into the semester, I noticed that one
                        student had added a Blake quote to the signature block of his email. Another
                        told me that he’d started carrying a notebook around to jot down ideas and
                        observations, instead of relying on his phone. He said that now when he goes
                        running&#8212;he was on the cross-country team&#8212;he doesn’t zone out
                        anymore, but looks around him. A third noted, in his final exam booklet,
                        that the class had helped him grow not only as a scholar, but as a person.
                        And a fourth wrote in an email, “At the beginning of the semester when you
                        said that students in the past said that this class changed their life, I
                        didn’t believe you. Now after going through the class, I can definitely say
                        I have a new and better perspective on life.”</p>
                    <p>I am not alone in my conviction that the poems I care about can offer a path
                        to the good life. In recent years, books prescribing literary or
                        philosophical figures as guides have proliferated, a genre unto themselves.
                        Consider Alain de Botton’s <title level="m">How Proust Can Change Your
                            Life</title>, William Braxton Irvine’s <title level="m">A Guide to the
                            Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</title>, or Sarah Bakewell’s
                            <title level="m">How to Live, or a Life of Montaigne in One Question and
                            Twenty Attempts at an Answer</title>. John Kaag’s <title level="m">Hiking with
                            Nietzsche: On Becoming Who You Are</title> and <title level="m">Sick
                            Souls, Healthy Minds: How William James Can Save Your Life</title> blend
                        analysis with memoir, as do the bibliomemoirs <title level="m">My Life in
                            Middlemarch</title> and <title level="m">A Jane Austen Education: How
                            Six Novels Taught Me About Love, Friendship, and the Things that Really
                            Matter</title>, by Rebecca Mead and William Deresiewicz, respectively.
                        Whether about philosophers or fiction writers, these books share the belief
                        that reading has ethical import. To those inclined to read purely for
                        pleasure, they say that reading can matter. To those trained in the
                        hermeneutics of suspicion, they remind us that we can come to literature in
                        more than one posture, for more than one reason. The practice of
                        bibliotherapy, in which a therapist or teacher and her patients or students
                        discuss fiction in order to provide therapeutic benefit, relies on the
                        possibility that literature can heal. Writing about her experience with
                        bibliotherapy in the <title level="j">New Yorker</title>, Ceridwen Dovey
                        asserts, “In a secular age, I suspect that reading fiction is one of the few
                        remaining paths to transcendence, that elusive state in which the distance
                        between the self and the universe shrinks. Reading fiction makes me lose all
                        sense of self, but at the same time makes me feel most uniquely myself.”
                        Dovey’s observation, which strikes me as Romantic in its own right, aligns
                        with pedagogical currents in the scholarship of teaching and learning that
                        underscore the importance of being “human first, professor second,” so that,
                        in turn, it is our students’ uniqueness, their individual interests and
                        needs, that drives our pedagogies (Davidson).</p>
                    <p>Still, the question remains, as it always does, of how to embody and transmit
                        these convictions, however deeply held, in the classroom. Tell your students
                        that a bunch of poems have the potential to change their lives, and you’ll
                        be met with skepticism, at best. For me, the answer doesn’t lie in any set
                        of best practices, hacks, or tips. Instead, it comes down to modeling. Spend
                        16 weeks making plain what the literature means to you, giving the
                        students opportunities to internalize and repurpose the ideas they
                        encounter, and it will likely come to mean something to them, too. What I
                        feel most proud of when I reflect on my own teaching British and American
                        Romanticisms is not any particular technique or assignment. It’s that my
                        students and I created a space where it was okay to take things personally.
                        That in itself is an innovation.</p>
