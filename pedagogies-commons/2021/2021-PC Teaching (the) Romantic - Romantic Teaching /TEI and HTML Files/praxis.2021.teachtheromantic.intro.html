                  <p>Jean-Francois Lyotard argues that true learning can only occur once we begin to “learn
                     to unlearn” our various expertises (101). Each time we return to a text or a question
                     we must “recommence . . . [and] always begin in the middle” (100–101). This collection
                     of essays, <em>Teaching (the) Romantic / Romantic Teaching</em>, would seem to bear witness to this fact; it might easily be retitled <em>Pictures from the Scene of Unlearning</em>. When Kate Singer and I first issued the call for this volume, we were interested
                     in collecting essays that might have slipped through the cracks of our many themed
                     volumes (<em>Teaching Romanticism and Technology</em>, <em>Teaching Global Romanticism</em>, etc.). The types of essays we were hoping for would examine new collective and individual
                     intuitions of pedagogy, reimaginings of the concerns of cognition, language sensitivity,
                     and world-making; in other words, we were looking for reports of pedagogical practice
                     that shared certain premises about the world with the Romantic-era writers we write
                     about and teach. If the kinds of “soul making” that Keats and Charlotte Smith engaged
                     in was in a certain sense uncategorizable, then perhaps it should not surprise us
                     that the ideas, techniques, and teachings through which its pedagogy is constituted
                     might also defy categorization.

                     </div> In any case, we were overwhelmed by the response to our call. We received far more
                     excellent proposals than could ever fit into a single volume. Especially during the
                     COVID-19 pandemic, when so many folks are doing such amazing work, we decided we wanted
                     to create a more robust platform from which teachers of Romanticism could articulate
                     and share their experience and intellectual labor. As a result, what you are now reading
                     is volume one of a two-volume set.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Why all of this interest in pedagogy at this particular moment? One answer may be
                  that when we are in the classroom, however that may look (my current classroom during
                  the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is virtual and distanced), we are best positioned to see
                  the text from a new perspective and to discover a new relation of text to world. The
                  inherent multiplicity of the classroom situation, and its ever-varying constituencies,
                  makes this possible. As such, teaching holds open the possibility of seeing in new
                  ways; it socializes the text by requiring that we continually “recommence” (Lyotard
                  105).</p>
               <p>The essays collected here are keen examples of this revisionary and processual pedagogy.
                  They ask us to reconsider our relationship to the two key moments of any pedagogical
                  “project,” what was and what is yet to be (Sartre 91). As such, the essays in this
                  collection move beyond mere contextualization. Sarah Maitland’s 
                  “Teaching <em>Frankenstein</em> in the Post-Columbine Classroom”
                  narrates the efforts of her class to understand the social and psychic underpinnings
                  of the Creature’s action by contrasting his narrative to fragments from the journals
                  of the Columbine High School shooters. Catherine Ross’s examination of the curriculums
                  of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century elite English schools not only enlightens readers
                  of Romanticism by situating canonical poets in their own pedagogical milieu, but also
                  suggests exercises designed to reproduce the effects and experience for our twenty-first-century
                  students. One senses in these essays a profound commitment to the living history of
                  a Romanticism that is constantly being learned and unlearned, sketched out, erased,
                  complicated, and rewritten according to the ever-shifting exigencies of the political
                  and pedagogical field. Also included in this collection are two excellent essays focused
                  on poetry and poetics, each addressing a different aspect of verse practice or lyric
                  theory. Elizabeth Walker’s essay, 
                  “‘Brown Study’ Aesthetics in Romantic Literature,”
                  describes her attempts to reframe, with her students, Romantic-era practices of reverie
                  and lyric production in terms of William Cowper’s poetic reflection as described in
                  <em>The Task</em>. Carrie Busby’s essay, using Wordsworth as a model, focuses on the “acoustic ecologies”
                  of Romanticism, past and present, suggesting that the reverberative effects of sounded-out
                  poetic environments and subjectivities are perceptible on several levels in poetry,
                  and, importantly, achievable in the classroom. Finally, we present two mixed-genre
                  essays. Rachel Feder’s collaborative “field study” is a speculative essay composed
                  with her students. It asks and addresses the question, what if, in Jane Austen’s <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, Marianne becomes pregnant when she and Willoughby visit Allenham House? Kathryn
                  H. Warren’s contribution closes our volume. A full-throated defense of Romanticism
                  as a living force, Warren’s essay asks us to bring all of ourselves into the classroom
                  and to model for our students what it means to “take things personally.”</p>
               <p>We are so grateful to all these writers for their originality, perspicacity, and courage,
                  and are happy to be able to provide their essays with, if not a fixed and stable home,
                  then at least a space that they can shelter in place.</p>
