                    <head>Preface</head>
                    <p>After hearing a recent conference presentation in which I discussed my
                        interest in the connections between Jane Austen and questions of what we
                        might now call reproductive justice, a senior scholar in the field shared
                        with me an interesting piece of gossip: that there exists, or once existed,
                        a family that claims to be descended from the illegitimate child of Jane
                        Austen’s sister and best friend, Cassandra. As the story goes, Cassandra
                        Austen conceived this child with her fiancé, who died. Of course, the
                        scholar impressed upon me, there would be no way to prove or disprove the
                        efficacy of this claim. But so what? In recent years, I have become
                        interested in the critical and pedagogical potentials of speculation,
                        indeed, in speculation as a form of feminist praxis. In my book <title
                            level="m">Harvester of Hearts: Motherhood under the Sign of <title
                                level="m">Frankenstein</title></title>, I consider some of the
                        things that an adherence to argument as the gold standard of literary
                        criticism keeps us from saying—about the connections between life and work,
                        for example, or the entanglements of intellectual and bodily history, or
                        things that might have happened, but we cannot know for sure. In the
                        classroom, I offer my students low-stakes, hybrid, creative, and other
                        non-thesis-driven writing assignments that encourage them to move beyond
                        what they can prove to uncover truly experimental interpretations. I do this
                        because I am interested in what Romantic era literature can help students
                        understand about their own lives and worlds, and because these kinds of
                        trans-historical applications often derive from provocations and
                        possibilities, not only from thesis-driven, close reading–supported analyses
                        (of course, we learn to craft those, too).</p>
                    <p>During a question and answer session at the 2018 meeting of the North
                        American Society for the Study of Romanticism, Deidre Lynch claimed that
                        “Austen is way more gothic than we have been told,” to which Sonia Hofkosh
                        replied, “It’s fantasy fiction!” In the popular imagination, Austen’s novels
                        are not just fantasy fiction in the sense of the augmented, perhaps
                        idealized, reality they describe, but also in the extent to which Austen’s
                        texts inspire personal and communal fantasies. If speculative, fan-fictional
                        reading is a common mode of engagement with the novels, then what is its
                        place in the literary studies classroom? Put another way, what might the
                        modes and methods of literary criticism keep us from saying about Jane
                        Austen’s novels, and what might we gain by saying those things—both in
                        class, and in print?</p>
                    <p>What follows is a collaborative, speculative close reading of <title
                            level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> that interprets Marianne’s
                        illness as an illegitimate pregnancy that terminates in either a
                        premeditated abortion (sense) or a somatic miscarriage (sensibility). This
                        reading emerges from a free-flowing class discussion among eight
                        undergraduate students—students that I encouraged, from go, to get to know
                        one another as full people and to bring their own lives, concerns,
                        histories, and preoccupations to bear on course materials—and me. By tracing
                        this provocative possibility through the novel, our group demonstrates the
                        pedagogical potentials of speculation. We cannot assert that this is the
                            <emph>true</emph> or <emph>right</emph> reading of the text, just like
                        we can never know whether Cassandra Austen bore a child out of wedlock. But
                        by lingering on the possibility of secrecy and coded meaning and by thinking
                        through the social, political, and trans-historical implications of this
                        fantasy, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of Marianne’s universe,
                        a universe in which the stakes of sexuality are higher for her than for her
                        male counterparts and in which her choices—and lack of choices—may be, in
                        Lynch’s words, “way more Gothic than we have been told.” Indeed, our
                        experimental reading—the kind of reading that can emerge in the low-stakes
                        environment of the student-centered, discussion-based classroom—reveals the
                        darker potentialities hidden within the folds of Marianne’s dress, a fragile
                        relationship to maternity haunting our lovesick heroine. For the eight
                        undergraduate students in my seminar—and for me—this possibility acted as a
                        sort of time machine transporting <title level="m">Sense and
                            Sensibility</title> into our contemporary sociopolitical moment. </p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head>Miscarrying the Marriage Plot</head>
                    <p>What if we read Marianne’s despair following Willoughby’s desertion not as
                        naïve passion but as a physical experience of loss? This collaborative essay
                        grew out of an undergraduate seminar in which we discussed the darker
                        shadows and edges of Jane Austen’s fiction: realism that is really gothic;
                        sex scenes that are not sex scenes; resolutions that are really
                        condemnations. Our in-class discussion of <title level="m">Sense and
                            Sensibility</title> led us to develop a shared, speculative reading of
                        the novel in which Marianne becomes pregnant by Willoughby and miscarries
                        his child, whether this miscarriage represents a spontaneous abortion, a
                        deliberately induced abortion, and/or a psychosomatic response in
                        miscarriage to the emotional trauma of losing her first love.<note
                            place="foot" resp="author"> Focusing on the Victorian period, Doreen
                            Theiruf argues that medical professionals “sometimes conflated
                            contraception, miscarriage, and abortion because they were ignorant
                            about the physiological processes in question, or because they wished to
                            avoid the dissemination of dangerously potent information. Since
                            abortion in the nineteenth century was neither widely debated nor
                            circulated in the press before the very end of the period, its presence
                            remains dubious and its principles nebulous” (480).</note></p>
                    <p>Read in light of a potential miscarriage, Marianne presents a young woman
                        experiencing intense trauma. Her claim, at the novel’s end, that “My
                        illness . . . had been entirely brought on by myself, by such negligence of my
                        own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong” can be read as
                        remorse following a physical, rather than emotional, transgression (Austen
                        350). When Marianne goes on to admit, “Had I died—, it would have been
                        self-destruction,” her claim resonates with eighteenth-century fictional
                        treatments of abortion such as Jemima’s experience in Wollstonecraft’s
                            <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</title> (Austen 350). In
                        that unfinished text, Jemima first regards an offered “phial” of
                        abortifacient with the thought that “it was killing myself,” a description
                        that encapsulates both her youthful confusion and the extent to which she
                        identifies with her fetus as “ever called a bastard, a bastard appeared to
                        me an object of the greatest compassion in creation.” When she
                        finally decides to “procure abortion,” Jemima “swallow[s] it, with a wish
                        that it might destroy me, at the same time” (Wollstonecraft 194–95). What might we learn
                        if, for the duration of this essay, we let go of our attachments to standard
                        readings of Marianne Dashwood and instead give Austen credit for the
                        darkness that we have come to expect from Wollstonecraft? What if we add to
                        that binary—sense vs. sensibility—the question of embodiment? In this
                        article, we will hazard this provocative interpretation in order to rethink
                        the lessons implied by Marianne’s marriage plot. </p>

                    <head>I. Marginal Intimacy</head>
                    <p>The whirlwind romance between Marianne and Willoughby, celebrated by her
                        mother and judged indiscreet by her sister, culminates in an unchaperoned
                        visit to the estate of Willoughby’s aunt. There, Marianne and Willoughby
                        consummate their relationship. Austen does not describe the sexual nature of
                        their short-lived relationship beyond winks and euphemisms. “Bound by
                        pre-Victorian limitations of subject matter which had already turned sex
                        into a topic for covert implication rather than overt description,” Austen
                        asks readers to draw on clues such as the courtship narrative, the language
                        surrounding that clandestine meeting, and the comparison to fallen Eliza in
                        order to confirm the sexual nature of the excursion (Chandler 89). Marianne
                        embodies unbridled and rebellious teenage sexuality, while Willoughby is all
                        too willing to play into her love fantasy. </p>
                    <p>Just prior to Marianne’s fateful carriage ride, she gifts Willoughby a lock
                        of her hair, and he promises her a horse. Marianne’s sister, Margaret,
                        recounts the gift-giving scene, describing it to Elinor as follows:
                            <quote>[Willoughby] seemed to be begging something of [Marianne], and
                            presently he took up her scissars and cut off a long lock of her hair,
                            for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up
                            in a piece of white paper, and put it into his pocket-book. (Austen 94)</quote>
                        Margaret’s recounting of the scene portrays it as a moment of loaded
                        negotiation. Marianne is enamored with Willoughby; yet, he still has to
                        plead with her to give him a piece of her hair. The words that Austen
                        intertwines within this scene—“whispering,” “begging,” “kissed”—indicate
                        that the gifting of hair is more than a sentimental gesture (94). These
                        words imply a vow of silence or secrecy surrounding the act. There is also a
                        forceful nature to the scene—Willoughby literally <emph>takes</emph> a piece
                        of Marianne’s body for his own. Jill Heydt-Stevenson argues that the
                        “exchange of hair between Willoughby and Marianne also doubles as physical
                        colloquy between bodies” and points out that Austen uses the word
                        “tumbling . . . to denote sexual intercourse” (Heydt-Stevenson 36, 15). Marianne’s
                        hair tumbles down her back with abandon; Willoughby presses the cutting to
                        his lips before folding it in a piece of pure, white paper and taking it for
                        himself. Later in the novel, after Willoughby has informed Marianne that his
                        affections had “been long engaged elsewhere,” Marianne demands the hair back
                        (Austen 205). But the hair has already been cut, and Austen coyly suggests
                        that Marianne has given Willoughby something she cannot take back. </p>

                    <p>While Willoughby procures hair from Marianne, he also offers to give her
                        something: a horse named Queen Mab, which Marianne accepts and then must
                        refuse for the sake of prudence. This seems on the surface to be just another
                        example of her impulsiveness and propensity to say yes when it comes to
                        Willoughby. However, this horse is not just a horse. As Elinor and Marianne
                        walk alongside each other, Marianne describes Willoughby’s gift as “a horse,
                        one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was
                        exactly calculated to carry a woman” (Austen 93). Confer Shakespeare’s
                            <title level="m">Romeo and Juliet</title>: “This is the hag, when maids
                        lie on their backs, / That presses them and learns them first to bear”
                        (1.4.93–94). Queen Mab can be understood as a fabled being that teaches
                        women to bear both penetrative sex and the children that result from it.
                        Queen Mab is the gift that hangs between Marianne and Willoughby,
                        foreshadowing that although Marianne is open to sex with Willoughby, she
                        will ultimately be unable, or unwilling, to bear her pregnancy.<note

                            interpretations of this allusion in order to argue that “the nexus of
                            associations, erotic and ideological, surrounding both the Shakespearean
                            and the colloquial ‘Mab,’ coalesce in this moment as Willoughby’s covert
                            marriage proposal doubles as a prophesy of her ruined terminus: like the
                            first Eliza, dead from suffering and illness and like the second Eliza
                            (or Maria in <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, for that matter),
                            who spins out her life isolated in a country cottage”
                        (58–60).</note></p>
                    <p>Sexual excitement surrounds the pair. The immediate agreeability between them
                        stems from their mutual openness of thought and speech. They giggle about
                        everyone and everything around them. When Elinor begins to suspect
                        Willoughby’s outright desertion of Marianne, Mrs. Dashwood counters,
                        “Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been
                        attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved” (Austen 113). Except
                        there has been secrecy, whether or not Mrs. Dashwood chooses to see it. When
                        the family left in one carriage, and Marianne and Willoughby in another,
                        “nothing more of them was seen till their return.” At Mrs.
                        Jennings’s smug insistence that she knows where they have been, Marianne
                        feigns ignorance, asking, “Where, pray?” while Willoughby jumps to say that
                        they have been in his carriage, obviously (110). Their deception,
                        albeit a weak attempt, does more to suggest sexual impropriety than anything
                        else. Though doing so may not be her intention, Mrs. Dashwood confirms the
                        seriousness of the incident by condemning secrecy. </p>
                    <p>After giving up the lie, Marianne confides in Elinor about her visit to
                        Willoughby’s prospective estate. She exclaims, “I never spent a pleasanter
                        morning in my life”; this is the closest she comes to describing their
                        sexual encounter (Austen 102). Her official story is that Willoughby,
                        without even the attendance of his aunt, showed her all the rooms of the
                        house. Of course, “the implication is clear that the couple had been
                        examining the bedrooms also” (Cornog and Perper 162). Marianne’s unbridled
                        passion and proud contrarianism toward courtship etiquette at the outset of
                        the novel make plausible an implied sex scene. </p>
                    <p>At this point in the novel, Willoughby has already had a tryst with Colonel
                        Brandon’s ward, Eliza. People speculate that she has fallen ill, much like
                        Marianne will; she gives birth to an illegitimate child in secrecy and
                        shame. Willoughby, finally attempting to explain this indiscretion to
                        Elinor, describes “the violence of her passions, the weakness of her
                        understanding,” oscillating between hollow self-chastisement and blaming
                        Eliza (Austen 329). He convinces skeptical Elinor to feel pity for him,
                        though it is he who had sex out of wedlock, conceived with Eliza, and
                        refused to marry her. (If, at this point, he has indeed lost a child by
                        Marianne, and if Elinor somehow knows about this, then this might help
                        explain Elinor’s feeling of pity, as well.) Even as he attempts to distance
                        the two women intellectually, he draws exacting similarities. Marianne acts
                        on him while his only fault is letting her. Willoughby reflects on “giving
                        way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging”
                        with Marianne (327). This language, in combination with his remarks
                        about Marianne’s own “deep regret,” suggests cause for remorse that goes
                        beyond leading her on in words alone (Austen 331). Eliza’s demise alerts the
                        reader to an alternate potentiality for Marianne in her imprudent
                        interactions with Willoughby. Mrs. Jennings compares Marianne’s particular
                        suffering with the youthful crushes that came and went among her own
                        daughters: “as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature,” unable
                        to recover with adolescent resiliency (205). She is altered; having
                        lost her virginity and having been impregnated by the obviously virile
                        Willoughby, Marianne’s future could look a lot like Eliza’s. </p>
                    <p> Pregnancy out of wedlock, in the world of the novel, is a direct route to
                        social rejection and a defiled reputation. Eliza, daughter of Colonel
                        Brandon’s first love, Elizabeth Williams, is seduced by Willoughby’s
                        flirtations and promises of marriage, and impregnated by him at the age of
                        15. “[Willoughby] had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had
                        seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no
                        help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He had left her promising to
                        return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her” (Austen 228).
                        Marianne and Willoughby’s relationship directly parallels Eliza’s case.
                        Colonel Brandon himself compares the two, saying, “your sister, I hope,
                        cannot be offended . . . by the resemblance I have fancied between her and
                        my poor disgraced relation” (227). Given the potential social
                        consequences, it comes as no surprise that Marianne, an impressionable
                        embodiment of “sensibility,” keeps her precarious situation a secret from
                        everyone, including her family. In keeping this secret, she sometimes
                        appears to be hysterical, a historically diagnosable illness that, Carroll
                        Smith-Rosenberg contends, “can be seen as an alternate role option for
                        particular women incapable of accepting their life situation” (655).<note
                            place="foot" resp="author"> While Smith-Rosenberg writes about the
                            nineteenth-century American context, her pithy description of hysteria
                            resonates with Marianne’s impossible position. See also Eve Kosofky
                            Sedgwick’s famous essay <title level="a">Jane Austen and the

                    <p>Read through the lens of a possible pregnancy, what the other characters in
                        the novel may understand to be young love, heartbreak, and hysteria emerges
                        as a much more complicated and potentially damning experience. Marianne’s
                        desperation to get in touch with Willoughby after he avoids and rejects her
                        in public is divulged in her frenzied appeal to Elinor to force Willoughby
                        to talk to her. Her language in this passage is not that of a scorned lover,
                        but rather of someone whose entire future is on the line. She pleads that
                        she “must see him again—must speak to him instantly.—I cannot rest—I shall
                        not have a moment’s peace till this is explained—some dreadful
                        misapprehension or other.—Oh go to him this moment” (Austen 200). The
                        chapter ends with Marianne leaving a party because of her grief. Her actions
                        in the time that follows—hiding in her room for weeks on end, walking
                        through the rain, running away and hiding herself from the people she is
                        closest with—can be understood as hysteria or as a radical act of social
                            self-preservation.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For example, upon
                            guests’ arrival, “Marianne had left the room…”; Elinor claims that
                            Marianne “has been very much plagued lately with nervous headaches,
                            which make her unfit for company or conversation” (Austen 186,
                            237).</note></p>
                    <p>Although Marianne and Elinor have a close, sisterly relationship, there are
                        several moments in the novel when Elinor is seen discussing her sister’s
                        secrets with those who are known to gossip, such as Mrs. Jennings. Perhaps
                        most striking is the moment when Elinor defends Willoughby, saying, “he has
                        broken no positive engagement with my sister.” Mrs. Jennings is
                        shocked by this and goes on to discuss the evidence that Marianne and
                        Willoughby were engaged, saying, “No positive engagement indeed! after
                        taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they were
                        to live in hereafter!” (Austen 217). While this evidence points to a
                        potential engagement between Marianne and Willoughby, it also reinforces the
                        possibility that something improper, something that could only be rectified
                        through marriage, happened in Allenham house.</p>

                    <head>II. Removing the Infant </head>
                    <p>After leaving London with her sister and Mrs. Jennings, Marianne arrives at
                        the Palmers’ house at Cleveland feeling partly renewed but mostly devastated
                        at the incurred distance between herself and Willoughby, the father of her
                        secret, unborn child. Here, she isolates herself from any company and only
                        takes solace in walking alone around the property, despite the dangers of
                        the temperamental climate. A short time into her stay, Marianne becomes
                        dangerously ill, which leads to the sublimated denouement of the miscarriage
                        as her illness here is used to mask the scene of her failed delivery. </p>
                    <p>After Marianne’s health worsens despite the household’s initial expectations,
                        an apothecary is called in to consult. The Palmers’ apothecary, Mr. Harris,
                        who does not believe that Marianne is gravely ill, allows the word
                        “infection” to pass his lips, which “g[ives] instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,
                        on her baby’s account,” and causes Mrs. Jennings to then urge the “immediate
                        removal” of the infant (Austen 316). By positioning concern for infant
                        safety and mortality so close to the discussion of Marianne’s ailment,
                        Austen insinuates a direct connection between the two. The mortal threat in
                        question is not to Mrs. Palmer’s baby, but to Marianne’s fetus. The explicit
                        departure of a baby from the house stands in as a socially acceptable
                        substitution, a plot device that mirrors the parallel departure of an unborn
                        child behind closed doors.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Furthermore, in

                            characterized by “identification with the mother” whose safe arrival at
                            her daughter’s side signals the end of the episode (<title level="a"

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Harris’s incongruent evaluation of the gravity of Marianne’s illness to
                        the rest of the party also suggests that he may have some understanding of
                        the true nature of the situation. The use of the term “infection” within the
                        context of Marianne’s misery is interesting, because it positions the fetus
                        as an unwanted, reviled threat to both Marianne’s physical wellbeing and her
                        standing in society. John Wiltshire argues: “Austen is interested in
                        illnesses’ cultural aspects, in the patient’s use of the body for social
                        advantage. . . . At the same time, the novels also understand how social
                        conditions register themselves in the body, especially in the bodies of
                        women” (<title level="a">Medicine, illness and disease</title> 306). In this
                        case, Marianne is an example of how social conditions registered in the body
                        can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Premarital sex
                        threatens not only the social body, but also the body proper. Austen, when
                        writing <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, was cognizant of the
                        idea of somatization, which suggests that the miscarriage could have been
                        reactionary to Marianne’s devastation. Furthermore, in her thesis on Austen
                        and illness, Pamela Kirkpatrick argues that “Austen shows, through many of her
                        female characters, that the concept of somatic illness . . . is much more
                        complicated than the naïve idea of ailments which are ‘all in the head’”
                        (4).</p>
                    <p> In addition to the evidence that her loss could be somatic, there is also
                        the suggestion that Marianne actively induces fetal abortion. When she first
                        falls ill after roaming the property in the pouring rain, the narrator notes
                        that the development of her sickness was “assisted by the still greater
                        imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings” (Austen 314). This
                        suggests that Marianne might have acted, at least in part, in a way that
                        contributed to her miscarriage. Furthermore, it is possible to read Mr.
                        Harris as complicit in an abortion. From the onset of Marianne’s illness,
                        “prescriptions poured in from all quarters” (315). Kirkpatrick explains
                        that, during the period, apothecaries provided most routine health care to
                        citizens and that “apothecaries often supplied diagnostic services in
                        addition to prescriptions, and many of them recognized the importance of
                        addressing the patient’s emotional and social needs as well as the physical”
                        (2). It would be impossible for Mr. Harris to be unaware of the massive
                        social ramifications of an unwanted pregnancy, and so helping Marianne both
                        induce and conceal a miscarriage might align with this consideration for
                        patients’ social and physical needs, despite the fact that it was illegal in
                        England, after 1803, to give a woman any substance that might procure an
                        abortion. We must thus decide whether to read Mr. Harris as a stock
                        character or as a radical activist.</p>

                    <head>III. Miscarrying the Marriage Plot</head>
                    <p>If we read Marianne as conceiving Willoughby’s child and then losing or
                        terminating the pregnancy, what does this mean for the marriage plot? We
                        commonly read Jane Austen’s novels as reinforcing social mores through
                        optimistic endings centered on marriage. In these happy endings, the novels
                        reaffirm the reader’s “hope of a personal reward for good social behavior
                        and their faith that public progress promise[s] the stability and continuity
                        of their way of life” (Magee 198). In <title level="m">Sense and
                            Sensibility</title>, the sisters share the goal of being safely
                        conducted into the arms of respectable and wealthy gentlemen and then
                        marrying them. Within this framework, on a surface level, Austen uses her
                        two heroines to discuss passion and romance by contrasting each heroine’s
                        expression of sensibility. In contrast to her reserved, sensible sister,
                        Marianne is consumed by passion and desire for the romance of marriage,
                        which carries her directly into Willoughby’s arms. After this dalliance with
                        a rake and the ambiguous sorrow and sickness that follows, Marianne is
                        redeemed through the proposal of Colonel Brandon, an older man, of a good
                        reputation, financially stable, and, above all, pure in his love for
                        Marianne, which endures even the problems caused by Willoughby. </p>
                    <p>Beyond forsaking Willoughby in favor of the better match, Marianne undergoes
                        a miraculous conversion as she “discover[s] the falsehood of her own
                        opinions” and grows in fondness toward Colonel Brandon, whom she originally
                        thought was too old for her to marry (Austen 379). She chooses a man that
                        has very little sex appeal, a move that stands in stark contrast to previous
                        choices she has made, and embarks on a relationship that is not first love.
                        This change is celebrated as an innate part of Marianne’s intrinsic purity
                        and moral goodness, which lies even below the “sins” of her actions with
                        Willoughby. Marianne can only accomplish this change because she “was born
                        to an extraordinary fate” which blessed her with the ability to “counteract,
                        by her conduct, her most favorite maxims” of the value of passionate
                        sensibility; in turn, she stands against “falling a sacrifice to an
                        irresistible passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with
                        expecting” (380).<note place="foot" resp="author"> There might be coded
                            irony in the repetition of the word born, here: “Marianne Dashwood was
                            born to an extraordinary fate. She was <emph>born</emph> to discover”
                            (Austen 379, emphasis added). Marianne has borne her own redemption,
                            rather than a child.</note> Marianne, through this redemption, becomes a
                        woman who never fell a sacrifice at all. Her indiscretions are absolved. As
                        compensation for this moral restoration, Marianne is rewarded through the
                        marriage plot with marriage, love, fiscal stability, and power, as she
                        “found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new
                        duties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the
                        patroness of a village” (380). Marianne goes from a damaged woman to a woman
                        superior in life station, power, and wealth in comparison to her
                        contemporaries.</p>
                    <p>But when we introduce a lost or terminated pregnancy into this equation, we
                        see that this happy ending depends, not only on sense and sensibility, but
                        also, and perhaps more foundationally, on the body. Should Marianne have
                        carried Willoughby’s baby to term, she would have been as doomed as Eliza.
                        Colonel Brandon acknowledges the sharp distinction: <quote>Whatever they may
                            have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless
                                <emph>will</emph> turn with gratitude towards her own condition,
                            when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the
                            wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to
                            herself, with an affection for him as strong, still as strong as her
                            own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her
                            through life. Surely this comparison must have its use with her. She
                            will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no
                            misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. (Austen 229)</quote> While on the
                        surface “they may have been” refers to the emotional connection past between
                        Marianne and Willoughby, it modifies Marianne’s “condition,” thereby both
                        multiplying and pluralizing it. Marianne will feel her own “sufferings” to
                        be “nothing” as opposed to Eliza’s sufferings, which resulted in something,
                        specifically, an illegitimate child. Read in light of a potential pregnancy
                        and miscarriage, Brandon’s speech is deeply ironic. Miscarriage negates
                        “misconduct.” Whether spontaneous or induced, whether the result of a
                        logical calculation or the overflow of emotion, the abortion of Marianne’s
                        fetus has reasserted her virtue and, with it, reaffirmed the marriage plot.
                        The novel’s structuring system, which governs female fate, depends, in the
                        end, on a young girl’s body. Whether that body has been restored to its
                        singular, viable status through sense or sensibility, we can only
                        speculate.</p>
