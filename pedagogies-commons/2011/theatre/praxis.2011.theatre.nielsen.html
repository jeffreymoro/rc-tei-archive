               <p>In the past two decades, scholarship on British Romantic drama has illustrated the
                  centrality of theater to understanding the era’s “geo-historical and geo-political”
                  issues, and to appreciating women writers’ previously unacknowledged roles in public
                  debates (Purinton, 
                  “On Teaching”
                   353).

                           S. Buckley, Julie Carlson, Jeffrey Cox, Daniel O'Quinn, Jane Moody, Gillian Russell,

                  </div> Key among these geo-historical and geo-political issues was the French Revolution.
                  The dramatic events of the French Revolution shaped British Romantic writers’ thinking
                  on social justice campaigns such as democracy, women’s rights, and abolitionism. However,
                  our critical lens for these international crises often remains rather Anglo-centric,
                  perhaps because dramas from Continental authors do not receive enough attention, except
                  in contemporary translations. Oft-cited examples include Elizabeth Inchbald’s <em>Lovers’ Vows</em> (1798), adapted from August von Kotzebue’s comedy <em>Child of Love</em> (<em><span class="foreign">Kind der Liebe</span></em>) or Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s <em>Pizarro</em> (1799), adapted from Kotzebue’s <em>The Spaniards in Peru</em> (<em><span class="foreign">Die Spanier in Peru</span></em>) (Burwick, “German Romantic Drama” 157). This paper reflects on the pedagogical benefits
                  of incorporating Europe and its drama into Romantic coursework. An eight-day teaching
                  unit on 
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="commons4.2011.nielsen_syllabus.html">Romantic Revolutions in Europe</a>”
                   explores the international dimensions of Romantic drama.</p>

               <p>Recommending introductory reading about the French Revolution is a rather difficult
                  task, and Matthew S. Buckley’s recent book, <em>Tragedy Walks the Streets: The French Revolution in the Making of Modern Drama</em>, explains why: the ostensible truth about the Revolution is as elusive as the tragic
                  drama it evokes. As Buckley and others maintain, one can only understand the French
                  Revolution by dissecting its theater.

                  </div> Republicans employed the methodologies of theater in order to broadcast Revolutionary
                  propaganda abroad. These theatrical techniques also resembled those of the aristocracy
                  and the Church, who communicated with the masses through allegorical parades and pictorials. <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign"><em>Fêtes publiques</em></span> (or public festivals) replaced religious feasts, and actors, actresses, playwrights,
                  and artists such as Jacques-Louis David participated in their production.

                  </div> The first ever use of the term "theatricality" in English, as Tracy C. Davis points
                  out, appears in Thomas Carlyle’s <em>The French Revolution: a History</em> (1837), and his accounts of festivals demonstrate the <span class="foreign"><em>theatrum mundi</em></span> sense of the word (Davis 132). The playhouses experienced a transformation as well.
                  Strict licensing for spoken-word dramas disappeared in January 1791, and theaters
                  reenacted the happenings on the streets of Paris with astonishing rapidity. After
                  Charlotte Corday assassinated Jean-Paul Marat, theaters adorned their buildings with
                  the bust of the “Friend of the People,” and dozens of productions recreated the event
                  for spectators.

                  after 1792, Jacobins began to censor dramas that questioned the new order. For example,
                  Jean-Louis Laya’s comedy, <em>The Friend of the Laws</em> (<span class="foreign"><em>L’Ami des loix</em></span>), faced scrutiny because it satirized Jacobins like Robespierre and Marat.

               <p>The British press represented the French Revolution in similarly theatrical terms.
                  Thus when Burke calls the Revolution “this great drama” in <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> (1790), he appears to mimic the Republicans’ rhetorical mode (74). Many critics have
                  noted the histrionics in the following passage from <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>:
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                     into the chamber of the queen, and pierced with a hundred strokes of bayonets and
                     poniards the bed, from whence this persecuted woman had but just time to fly almost
                     naked, and, through ways unknown to the murderers, had escaped to seek refuge at the
                     feet of a king and husband, not secure of his own life for a moment (71).</span><br/> A Gothic cast of characters populates Burke’s melodrama: the vulnerable queen in distress,
                  the chivalrous father/king, and the villainous masses seeking revenge. Burke evokes
                  a domesticated ideal of the queen as wife and mother in order to lament the loss of
                  chivalry. Other women, notably the tragic actress Sarah Siddons (1755-1831), reminded
                  Burke about his <span class="italics">true</span> feelings for Marie Antoinette, whom he met in 1777. Recalling the “tears that Garrick
                  formerly, or that Siddons not long since, have exhorted” from him, Burke admits to
                  feeling “truly ashamed” for these “tears of hypocrisy” and “folly;” “that superficial,
                  theatric sense of painted distress” hardly compares to exulting “over it in real life”
                  (71).</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>While Burke’s histrionic rhetoric has long puzzled and amused modern readers, we might
                  compare it to the ambivalent theatricality of the Revolution. French theater, politics,
                  and journalism—in some respects, one and the same entity—played with the lines between
                  realism and abstract representation. Direct representation was a powerful tool of
                  the Old Regime, which equated the royal body with divine right and power. So in broadsheets,
                  Republicans advertised the death of the nation as <span class="foreign"><em>corpus mysticum</em></span>, or the mystical body.

                  </div> In his book <em>Political Actors: Representative Bodies and Theatricality in the Age of the French
                     Revolution</em>, Paul Friedland insists that French theatricality is not what it seems: “Theatrical
                  actors were prevailed upon to represent their characters abstractly, in a manner that <span class="italics">seemed realistic</span> to the audience, rather than a manner that the actors experienced <span class="italics">as real</span>” (6). Politicians, according to Friedland, practiced this methodology as well: “unlike
                  previous political bodies that had claimed to <span class="ital">be</span> the French nation, the National Assembly merely claimed to speak on the nation’s behalf”
                  (6). So in fact, Burke’s sympathetic portrait of Marie Antoinette, that “Roman matron,”
                  resembles the representational strategies of the Old Regime and the counter-revolution,
                  which also rely on metaphors (Burke 72). Moreover, Burke’s portrait contrasts with
                  Marie Antoinette’s reputation in France. Revolutionaries charged the Queen with incest,
                  pornography, and other acts of debauchery.

               <p>In the undergraduate classroom, sharing this theatrical history might help to clarify
                  why the French Revolution remains such an opaque subject. Reading <em>The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</em> (1789) alongside the United States' <em>Declaration of Independence</em> (1776) further orients students to the similarities between the American and French
                  Revolutions (see Day 2 of my online syllabus for 
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="commons4.2011.nielsen_syllabus.html#n2">Romantic Revolutions in Europe</a>”
                  ). A wealth of information about the Revolution exists in standard anthologies, and
                  students can learn a lot about the early 1790s in Britain and France by reading Helen
                  Maria Williams’s <em>Letters Written in France</em>, Thomas Paine’s <em>The Rights of Man</em>, Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</em>, and William Godwin’s <em>An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em> alongside Burke’s text. However, sometimes when students attempt to decipher the complex
                  events of the Revolution, they may become frustrated with the pointed rhetoric that
                  writers like Burke and Wollstonecraft employ to debate the rights of man and woman.
                  Whereas Paine writes with what my students claim is uncomplicated clarity, Wollstonecraft
                  sometimes baffles these twenty-first century readers with her series of rhetorical
                  questions, and Burke, likewise, carries a few of his metaphors so far that the impatient
                  reader might mistake their meaning.

            <p>Pedagogy rooted in the dramatic arts could very well lead to a deeper appreciation
               of the Revolution and its legacy in Romantic writing. As instructors, we can paint
               pictures of the different scenes of the Revolution. More importantly, students benefit
               from applying these dramatic techniques to their own writing. One creative writing
               exercise that works well is the following. Students write a dramatic sketch between
               Burke and Wollstonecraft in pairs. The setting is a London coffeehouse, where the
               two meet by chance and discuss the French Revolution. In another in-class writing
               exercise, students write on an online discussion board (see Day 4). In this exercise,
               half of the class adopts the personae of either Wollstonecraft, Godwin, or Paine,
               and the other half writes an anti-Jacobin response to <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</em>, <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, <em>An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em>, or <em>Rights of Man</em> in the voices of a Church parson, Richard Polwhele, Edmund Burke, Hannah More, or
               another persona of their choosing. I strongly suggest using a discussion board, because
               students adapt easily to aliases online.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>These in-class writing exercises prepare students to write their final essay for this
                  unit. One formal writing assignment, 
                  “Romantic Revolutionaries and their Personae”
                  , requires students to compose a creative writing piece and a critical introduction
                  that analyzes their own work and one to three texts from the unit on 
                  “Romantic Revolutions in Europe.”
                   In addition to a version of the assignment described above, students are invited to
                  convert a scene from a prose work into a dramatic sketch. Olaudah Equiano’s <em>Interesting Narrative</em> or Mary Prince’s <em>History</em> work well as potential screenplays since they feature episodic styles. The success
                  of these creative writing pieces depends on how well students are able to construct
                  their hypothetical audiences. Instructors might also support the writing process by
                  requiring class participants to read and perform their dialogues and scenes aloud.
                  These composition exercises serve two purposes. They prompt students to articulate
                  the debate about the rights of men and women, issues evoked by events in France. Secondly,
                  class participants adopt Romantic aliases, and this technique foregrounds authors’
                  attempts to construct ethos, or the invention of authoritative and ostensibly good
                  personae. Of course, in <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</em> Wollstonecraft critiqued Burke on these very grounds, his apparent misuse of ethos:
                  “My indignation was roused by the sophistical arguments, that every moment crossed
                  me, in the questionable shape of natural feelings and common sense” (77). Rhetoricians
                  have recently rediscovered the powerful role that persona, ethos, and creative writing
                  can play in the English classroom.

                  </div> As Gary Thompson suggests, incorporating ethos into the English classroom transforms
                  the process of writing into a type of performance: “Seeing writing as performance
                  can direct attention to the nature of literacy as dialogic. All forms of communication
                  involve recursion, and, ultimately, the socially constructed subject in dialogue with
                  a wider audience” (89).</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>These same subjects—writers and audiences—faced official scrutiny in the Romantic
                  period. To teach Romantic drama and the Revolution means to teach about censorship.
                  The Lord Chamberlain's Examiner of Plays, John Larpent, censored most British dramas
                  about the French Revolution regardless of their political viewpoint.

                  her only tragedy, <em>The Massacre</em> (1792), from print and the stage (see <a class="link_ref" href="commons4.2011.nielsen_syllabus.html#n5">Day 5</a>). Given current concerns about violence in entertainment, students appear ready to
                  discuss why these tragedies could or could not be produced, and their essays might
                  analyze the suitability of <em>The Cenci</em> and <em>The Massacre</em> for performance. Ostensibly set during the massacre of French Protestants in the late
                  sixteenth century, Inchbald’s play actually refers to the slaughter of Parisians during
                  August/September 1792. The leading man, Eusèbe, gets caught up in the violence offstage,
                  and he fails to defend his wife and children, who are presented on biers in the final

                  original of the play (<em>Jean Hennuyer, or the Bishop of Lizieux</em> by Louis-Sébastien Mercier), the figure of the wife is invited to arm herself, but
                  Inchbald alters this event; Eusèbe would not have his wife’s “feminine virtues” disturbed
                  by engaging in violence (Inchbald 15).

               <p>Romantic drama also augments students’ study of slavery and abolitionism in the Romantic
                  period. My syllabus recommends reading Olympe de Gouges’s <em>Black Slavery or the Happy Shipwreck</em> (<em><span class="foreign">L’esclavage des noirs ou l’heureux naufrage</span></em>), which advocates emancipation and argues for the rights of illegitimate children.
                  The plot of the short three-act play, available in English, is as follows. The ex-slaves
                  Zamor and Mirza escaped to an island because their master’s steward made sexual advances
                  on Mirza, and Zamor killed him. They save the French couple Valère and Sophie, who
                  shipwreck on the island, but soon troops arrive and arrest the escaped slaves. Valère
                  and Sophie help to free Zamor and Mirza by entreating the Governor, who turns out
                  to be Sophie’s father (from a youthful liaison). <em>Black Slavery</em> was performed in the prestigious Comédie-Française (then called Théâtre de la Nation)
                  in December 1789, before emancipation took effect. Among the play’s several production
                  difficulties, the actors refused to paint their faces black and instead dressed as
                  “Indians,” and lobbyists for the colonists probably influenced poor reviews in the
                  press.

                  of an unfinished play, <em>France Preserved, or the Tyrant Dethroned</em> (<em>La France sauvée ou le tyran détroné</em>), because it featured the Queen as a character. Although Gouges’s politics upset
                  her contemporaries (she advocated constitutional monarchy alongside her fight for
                  human rights), she mirrored ideas prevalent in Romantic-era Britain. Like Mary Prince’s <em>History of Mary Prince</em> and Equiano’s <em>Interesting Narrative</em>, <em>Black Slavery</em> addresses the painful but important topic of sexual violence against women of color.
                  For an analytical essay topic, students can compare Prince’s <em>History</em>, Gouges’s <em>Black Slavery</em>, and Equiano’s <em>Interesting Narrative</em> and argue which text would make Romantic audiences most sympathetic to the cause of
                  abolitionism. Student papers on this subject might examine the role of violence in

                  its colonies in 1794, but Napoleon revoked the ordinance in 1802. The inclusion of
                  this French drama opens up discussion about slavery in the Americas. For example,
                  in 1804, Toussaint l'Ouverture helped to found Haiti, the first free Black nation

                           historical plays. The Warrior's Barrow (prem. Sept. 1850 in Christiania, now called
                           Oslo) resembles Romantic drama more than Ibsen's later Naturalist plays.</span></div>
                  </div> French Studies reserves the label Romantic for writers like Alfred de Musset (1810-57)
                  and Victor Hugo (1805-85), whose “Preface to Cromwell” (“Préface à Cromwell” 1827)
                  announces the arrival of the movement. For Hugo and Stendhal, in <em>Racine et Shakespeare</em> (1823), “the proving ground of romantic doctrine” is not lyrical poetry, but rather
                  historical tragedy, the genre that Shakespeare introduces to French audiences (Roussetzki
                  493). Thus Hugo’s accessible text demonstrates the impact of Shakespeare on literature
                  beyond Britain’s borders, while acquainting students with key terms such as the Gothic,
                  melancholy, and the sublime. Musset’s greatest drama, <em>Lorenzaccio</em> (1834) pairs well thematically with Shelley’s <em>Cenci</em>. Hugo’s <em>Hernani</em> (1829, prem. Paris Feb. 1830) echoes Schiller’s <em>The Robbers</em> (<em>Die Räuber</em> 1781, prem. Mannheim Jan. 1782) in its raucous reception. However, <em>The Robbers</em>’ theme of the outlaw hero ties it to Wordsworth’s tragedy, <em>The Borderers</em> (1795-96/1842), as well. At least two translations and performances of <em>The Robbers</em> appeared in London in the 1790s, and Matthew Lewis translated Schiller’s politically-charged
                  comedy, <em>Intrigue and Love</em> (<em>Kabale und Liebe</em> 1783/84), as <em>The Harper’s Daughter</em> (Covent Garden, May 1803).

                  von Arnim (1785-1859). In fact, women played integral roles in eighteenth-century
                  German theater. The actress Caroline Neuber (1697-1760) founded one of the first national,
                  non-court-based theaters in Leipzig (where she produced Lessing’s first play), and
                  Luise Adelgunde Gottsched (1713-62) translated several dramas for the stage. Gottsched—also
                  commonly called by the feminine form of her name, “die Gottschedin,” in order not
                  to confuse her with her playwright husband—struggled with a problem that plagued other

               <p>Scholars of British Romanticism have long recognized the central role that European
                  letters played in the intellectual and cultural lives of contemporary authors.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For comparative studies of Romanticism, see Frederick Burwick, Angela Esterhammer,
                           Michael Ferber, Lillian Furst, Gerald Gillespie, Gregory Maertz, Martin Meisel, and

                  </div> European Romantic drama offers many ways to make the past come alive in the classroom
                  and to augment the study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century literature
                  and history. Moreover, when instructors internationalize the Romantic curriculum,
                  they recreate the cosmopolitan flavor of London in the years around 1800. Romantic
                  drama can play a powerful role in shaping students’ understanding of personae, and
                  through creative writing and dialogue, class participants have the opportunity to
                  achieve a new sense of their own writing voices and those of the Romantics.</p>

               of tyranny, shall be extinct in the minds of men, plots and assassinations will be
               anticipated by preventive murder and preventive confiscation, and that long roll of
               grim and bloody maxims, which form the political code of all power, not standing on
               its own honour, and the honour of those who are to obey it. Kings will be tyrants

               Danish Romantic writer Adam Oehlenschläger (1779-1850) influenced Henrik Ibsen's early
               historical plays. <em>The Warrior's Barrow</em> (prem. Sept. 1850 in Christiania, now called Oslo) resembles Romantic drama more
