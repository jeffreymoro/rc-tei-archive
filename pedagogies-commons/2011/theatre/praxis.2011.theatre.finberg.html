               <h2><span class="head">The Classroom Dramaturg</span></h2>
               <p>In most theater survey or dramatic literature classes, plays are treated as literature.
                  The term “dramaturgy” never comes up, either as a theatrical discipline or as a critical
                  tool for helping our students understand drama. I propose changing this situation,
                  and I will use Hannah Cowley’s comic masterpiece, <em>The Belle’s Stratagem</em> (1780), to demonstrate how looking at plays from a dramaturgical perspective can
                  provide both students and teachers with a more dynamic relationship to Romantic dramatic
                  texts.</p>
               <p>As a dramaturg, scholar, and teacher working with historical playwrights, I seek to
                  bridge the worlds of the academy and the professional theater. I find my scholarly
                  background imparts a rigor to my dramaturgy and my dramaturgical perspective colors
                  my approach in the classroom. The job of the dramaturg, when working on an historic
                  play, has many facets. The dramaturg must advocate for the necessarily absent author,
                  educate the director, cast, designers and audience about the language and historic
                  background of the play, and keep the production true to the integrity of the work,
                  while at the same time keeping in mind the artistic, physical, and economic realities
                  of the theater. As a dramaturg, I consider it most important that my students be aware
                  that drama is a form of literature not meant primarily to be read but to be heard
                  and seen. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Theater is, by its very nature, a collaborative art. The text of a play is the skeleton,
                     the bones of the work of art, that must be fleshed out by the joint efforts of actors,
                     directors, designers, and even dramaturgs. The final collaborator is the audience.
                     Every performance is individual and unrepeatable. Living, breathing actors embody
                     a text and <span style="font-weight:bold">connect</span> with a specific living, breathing audience, making the performance both a public and
                     an intimate event. Part of a dramaturg’s function is to facilitate that connection.
                     The dramaturg must always be asking, “What is the play’s relationship with the audience?”

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For those who have never worked on a historical production with a dramaturg, I wish
                              to clarify some of the differences between the roles of director and dramaturg. The
                              director chooses what the overall interpretation of the script will be and the dramaturg,
                              actors and designers all serve the director to achieve his or her vision. By having
                              a dramaturg keeping track of the story and making sure all the elements are clear
                              to the audience, the director is freed to focus on the details of each scene and the
                              moment to moment relationships between the characters. In addition to providing historical
                              …</span></div>
                     </div>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>To understand what that relationship is, more questions must be asked. What is left
                  unsaid in the play? Are there assumptions the audience is supposed to make? Are these
                  assumptions culturally or historically specific? If so, what can theater artists do
                  to recreate the appropriate receptivity on the part of the audience? What are the
                  silences in the play, the blanks in the script we must choose either to fill or elide,
                  that will color our entire interpretation? (Whether we fill or elide these silences,
                  we are making an interpretational choice, so we might as well make a conscious choice,
                  while recognizing at the same time that other choices are equally possible.) How do
                  we recognize the silences? All these are dramaturgical questions that broaden our
                  understanding of a play beyond the simply literary perspective and lead us to a multidisciplinary
                  approach to this art form that requires our active participation.</p>
               <p>I propose to look at teaching Hannah Cowley’s comic masterpiece <em>The Belle’s Stratagem</em> (1780) from a dramaturgical perspective, and that means that the first task is to
                  shatter the preconception that a Romantic play is a dusty period piece from a quaint
                  and less sophisticated time. I want to get our students to recognize that the script
                  is alive and subject to multiple interpretations. This can be demonstrated by showing
                  how portraying a minor aspect of the play from different perspectives will change
                  the resonance of the play for today’s audience, while remaining true to the integrity
                  of the text.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">On the Margins of <em>The Belle’s Stratagem</em></span></h2>
               <p>While <em>The Belle’s Stratagem</em> is set firmly in the fashionable society of late eighteenth-century London, and its
                  style is reminiscent of Cowley’s Restoration and Augustan predecessors, Cowley’s comedy
                  demonstrates concerns about the laboring classes and their relationship to the moneyed
                  elite. The title of Cowley’s comedy pays homage to one of her favorite Augustan playwrights,
                  George Farquhar (1677-1707), and his <em>The Beaux’s Stratagem</em> (1707), and like many of these earlier comedies, <em>The Belle’s Stratagem</em> juxtaposes two story lines: Letitia Hardy’s ingenious plot to win the heart of her
                  betrothed, Doricourt, against the marital problems of jealous Sir George Touchwood
                  and his wife, the naïve Lady Frances. Both plots concern men learning to respect the
                  women in their lives both before and after marriage, and are further connected by
                  questions regarding the nature and fluidity of identity. Interwoven with these plots
                  are transitional scenes among servants, tradesmen and con artists who make their livings
                  off the excesses of fashionable life.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The title plot revolves around Letitia Hardy and her fiancé Doricourt, who have been
                     engaged since childhood, but who have not seen each other in years. Doricourt, back
                     from his tour of the continent, has returned to London as its most fashionable and
                     seemingly eligible bachelor. Abroad, he has learned to appreciate continental beauty
                     and manners and he disparages Englishwomen (much to the disgust of his good friend,
                     Saville). Letitia finds herself captivated by the man Doricourt has become, but dashed
                     by his apparent indifference to her. She vows to “win his heart or never be his wife.”

                     </div> Her stratagem, as she confides to her doting father and her cousin, Mrs. Racket, is
                     based on the maxim that it is “easier to convert a sentiment into its opposite than
                     to transform indifference into tender passion” (p. 227 [1.4.225-26]). Letitia plans
                     to disgust Doricourt by posing as an ignorant, vulgar rustic and later to enchant
                     him in masquerade as a cosmopolitan lady of mystery. In many ways, this plot is a
                     reversal of Goldsmith’s <em>She Stoops to Conquer</em>, in which Kate Hardcastle wins her lover by abasing herself. Kate is building up
                     the confidence of a man too insecure to address women of his own class; Letitia, on
                     the other hand, cuts Doricourt down to size and makes him acknowledge his own naïveté.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Cowley’s secondary story line is a retelling of the Pinchwife plot of Wycherley’s
                  <em>The Country Wife</em>. Sir George Touchwood, a man of the world and former avowed bachelor, has married
                  the lovely but sheltered Lady Frances. He has been compelled to bring her to London
                  to be presented at court, but aspires to keep her all to himself and away from the
                  pernicious pleasures of the town that once made up his own life. While Sir George
                  lacks Pinchwife’s overt cruelty, Cowley uses his character to question whether jealousy
                  and the concomitant infantilization of the beloved is not cruelty in and of itself.
                  Cowley’s character Courtall, a rewrite of Wycherley’s Horner, the man out to seduce
                  the naïve bride, is a rake in the wrong century. His seduction plots backfire and
                  sexual humiliation is his to receive, not to inflict.</p>
               <p>Bridging the two stories are Mrs. Racket, a merry widow, and Villers, a debonair bachelor
                  – a witty sophisticated pair who egg on the mischief, and each other – as well as
                  Flutter, a gossipy fop who can be counted on to get every story wrong, and loyal Saville,
                  Doricourt’s best friend, who still pines for Lady Frances.</p>
               <p>The major plots of <em>The Belle’s Stratagem </em>can be staged as an effervescent confection – fast-paced, intricately choreographed
                  and filled with sparkling repartée. The transitional scenes ground the plot by revealing
                  the sordid underpinnings of frivolous fashionable life. Cowley gives us our first
                  glimpse of laboring life in the second scene of the comedy, among Doricourt’s servants.
                  A tabloid reporter bribes Doricourt’s porter for information on any romantic liaisons
                  involving his quasi-celebrity master. They dicker over the value of the porter’s possible
                  information. Their tète-á-tète is interrupted by the entrance of a horde of servants
                  and tradesmen, who have bribed Doricourt’s valet for a view of the gentleman’s <span class="foreign">haute couture</span> Parisian fashions with an eye to copy them for their masters and customers. Later
                  there is a scene between an auctioneer and his shills. These lower-class hirelings
                  pose as people of fashion, bidding on items to help drive up the prices.</p>
               <p>Each of these scenes serves as a precursor to the later grand masquerade. Below stairs
                  at Doricourt’s and at the auction house, we see the lower classes masquerading as
                  the elite for various motives. In the first, they are creating a parallel world to
                  those of the upper classes: just as Doricourt is preparing to attend the king’s levée
                  and people of high fashion hang around the court to stay current on the latest gossip
                  and trends, so the servants and the less socially prominent attend the households
                  and servants of the fashionable. At the auction house, the auctioneer, Mr. Silvertongue,
                  prepares his “puffers” to drive up the bids at the upcoming sale. He coaches them
                  on jargon and the details of artists and items and he criticizes their clothing. They
                  must appear like people of fashion to fool people of fashion. A female puffer complains
                  Silvertongue doesn’t pay her enough to afford appropriate clothes and they argue about
                  wages, comparing them to soldier’s wages. The behind-the-scenes scrapping reminds
                  the audience that London’s fashionable life is based on a teetering economy: everyone
                  at the auction is there to ogle or buy items seized to settle debts of those financially
                  ruined by gambling and extravagance. </p>
               <p>These scenes stand out from the general effervescence with their ugly glimpses of
                  the economic realities behind the glamour. They have grit. They rub our noses into
                  the fact that this is a society of many degrees of haves and have-nots. And some of
                  these have-nots are finding and taking every opportunity to exploit their oblivious
                  masters. They call our attention to the cannibalistic nature of this society, as we
                  watch different classes prey upon each other and even on the remains of members of
                  their own class who have fallen into financial ruin.</p>
               <p>These transitional scenes present us with dramaturgical choices: how much attention
                  should they be given in comparison to the scenes of the major action? Are they casual
                  moments the audience catches in passing, or are they moments that deliberately stop
                  the forward motion of the plot? How much do they infiltrate or color our perception
                  of the fashionable society that dominates the plot? In some productions, historically
                  as well as today, they are cut entirely.</p>
               <p>There is no right or wrong answer, but whatever choice we make will color the audience’s
                  understanding of the text. We can compare a dramatic work to a diamond: letting different
                  facets catch the light changes our view of the stone itself – its color, its reflective
                  capacities, even its beauty. In teaching a play, examining several of the different
                  facets and their coloring of the interpretation of the piece will give students a
                  richer understanding of how a dramatic text comes to life.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, to understand the possible choices, we will need to encourage our students
                  to do multidisciplinary research. In the case of <em>The Belle’s Stratagem</em>, such research will involve cultural and economic history of the period. What did
                  the people look like? Who are the servants to the upper classes? What are their backgrounds?
                  What was a levée? How is a levée being parodied? What were the gossip columns of the
                  day like? How do they compare to today’s tabloids? What was the role of the auction
                  houses? What was being auctioned? Where and how did classes mix? There are so many
                  topics that could be explored to shed light on the life the play assumes its audience
                  will know that it is impossible for a teacher to cover them all in a class. One possible
                  way to involve students in unearthing the social assumptions of the play would be
                  to have them do individual reports or papers on different topics and then share them
                  with the whole class. Once everyone has a substantial background in the social world
                  of the play, discussions can take place about how to incorporate this new understanding
                  into the staging of the play.</p>
               <p>To demonstrate how a class might go about this process, I will use the example of
                  one marginal character within <em>Belle’s Stratagem</em> and the questions that are raised by Cowley’s employment of her. Kitty Willis comes
                  to play an important role in one of Cowley’s major plots, although Kitty has very
                  few lines. Courtall, the supposed rake, has taunted Saville, Doricourt’s best friend,
                  over Saville’s chaste passion for Lady Frances Touchwood. Saville insults Courtall
                  by casting doubts on Courtall’s self-proclaimed successes with women. An enraged Courtall
                  plots his revenge by planning to deceive and abduct Lady Frances at the masquerade,
                  but Saville gets wind of the plan and decides to outplot the plotter. Saville confides
                  in Doricourt that he has found a woman “whose reputation cannot be hurt” (p. 256,
                  [4.1.155]) to masquerade as Lady Frances and deceive Courtall. That woman is Kitty
                  Willis. This is the only description we are given of Kitty. As Shakespeare would say,
                  “The rest is silence.” (<em>Hamlet</em>, 5.2.360) But for drama to live, the silence has to be filled. How do we discover
                  how to fill it?</p>

               <p>To understand how to teach our students how to approach the dramatic text as the framework
                  for a performance, I suggest starting with the language of theater practitioners.
                  One of the first tasks a director, actor, designer, or dramaturg undertakes when beginning
                  to work with a script is to to determine the “given circumstances” of the text or
                  of an individual character. These “given circumstances” are the facts the author has
                  provided for us through the words and actions of the play. They are the theater artist’s
                  point of departure in analyzing the text, and they will vary depending on whether
                  one is examining one specific character or the entire play. One character’s given
                  circumstances will differ from another’s by virtue of what the character <em>knows</em> about the rest of the plot or characters, as well as who the character <em>is</em>. Differences about what each character knows are often the basis of comedy and farce.
                  Differences about who characters are provide depth and variety to the life of the
                  play.</p>
               <p>What are Kitty Willis’s given circumstances? Cowley provides us with minimal information.
                  Kitty: </p>
               <ul>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e350">has a distinctive, diminutive name.</li>

                  <li class="item" id="d30e356">is immediately recognized by all the men when she unmasks in Courtall’s rooms.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e357">is addressed merely as “Kitty” by the men.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e358">teases Courtall about his former adoration of her.</li>
               </ul>
               <p> From these given circumstances, we must make deductions and begin our research.</p>

                     her respectability from damage. (By 1780 women novelists could be respectable, while
                     actresses were still considered not much better than prostitutes. As a playwright,
                     Cowley found herself in disputed territory: did the public confer upon her the respectability
                     of the novelist or the opprobrium of the actress/prostitute? Although she asserted
                     her respectability – even when writing the words of disreputable characters – critics
                     challenged “whether Mrs. Cowley ought so to have expressed herself?”)

                     Research into the topic of eighteenth-century British prostitution yields many different
                     possible answers to this question, each of which provides us with different approaches
                     to staging Kitty. Any production must make one strong choice about Kitty and allow
                     that choice to influence the staging of her relationships with each of the characters
                     she encounters, including the effect her presence brings to the central masquerade

                  <p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, prostitution was the subject of much
                     public debate and fascination. It not only played a part in many of the novels of
                     the day, but prostitute narratives, purported to be the true histories or memoirs
                     of real prostitutes and courtesans, proliferated and were vastly popular. In her recent
                     study, <em>Infamous Commerce: Prostitution in Eighteenth-Century British Literature and Culture</em>, Laura Rosenthal points out that these novels and narratives took primarily two different
                     approaches to the profession. The first took the form of libertine narrative in which
                     a woman rises through her labors to fame (or infamy) and fortune. There is a quality
                     of entrepreneurship to her profession and ownership of her body. Such narratives describe
                     a woman rising from the brothel to the life of celebrity as a courtesan; sometimes
                     they show her fall back into degradation and poverty, but still she remains a sympathetic
                     representative of upward mobility, using what she has to succeed.

                  <p>The second type of prostitution narrative shows the prostitute as tragic victim. She
                     is driven by economic necessity to degradation and her feelings are sentimentalized.
                     As one such writer describes, <span class="quote">‘There are not perhaps on Earth greater Objects of Compassion; all Sense of Pleasure

                     writer J. W. Archeholz commented in his <em>A Picture of England: Containing a Description of the Laws, Customs, and Manners</em>, that the British had no real stake in ending prostitution. While English laws “are
                     not favourable to the fair sex,” successful prostitutes enjoy independence and add
                     glamour to London.

               <p>Nathaniel Hone also painted her in 1765 in a portrait which made a visual pun on her

                  begun her career as an actress, but found more lucrative work and celebrity as a courtesan.
                  Her narrative reflects the typical view of both reformers and libertine writers that
                  some young women believed their beauty and accomplishments made them eligible to rise
                  socially and turned to prostitution as a business to make the most of their talents.

                  she an actress? And once we have decided what kind of public woman she is, how will
                  we stage her and how will she fit into the ensemble of other characters?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As is typical of many skilled dramatists, Cowley provides us with information that
                     can be interpreted in a number of ways. On the one hand, Kitty’s name recalls the
                     late famous Kitty Fisher, but on the other hand, another famed “Kitty” was the great
                     actress Kitty Clive (1711-85). Both Kitty Fisher and Kitty Clive were well-known celebrities
                     and women of wit, intelligence and ambition, but Cowley’s Kitty is “Willis” or perhaps,
                     “will-less,” that is without inner strength or ambition, a woman who has simply “fallen”
                     into her line of work because of her lack of discipline or fortitude. Cowley even
                     makes a subtle allusion to the desperation of this latter kind of prostitute when
                     she has the fop Flutter entertain Lady Frances with the description of a family at
                     the masquerade: <span class="quote">‘In the next apartment there’s a whole family, who, to my knowledge, have lived on
                        watercresses this month to make a figure here tonight; but, to make up for that, they’ll
                        cram their pockets with cold ducks and chickens for a carnival tomorrow. (4.1.82-86)’</span> Cowley here alludes to Henry Fielding’s poetic description in his <em>The Masquerade</em>: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                     like the provident family and hungry whores, in addition to her pay for the deception
                     at Courtall’s?</p>
               </div>
               <p>And how precisely do the men “know” Kitty? They are all on familiar enough terms with
                  her to address her simply as “Kitty,” when they discover her in Courtall’s rooms,
                  while they address none of the women of their own class so informally. Is she communal
                  property? As a whore or as a celebrity? Is there anything particular about her relationship
                  with Courtall that might add to her enjoyment of the joke? </p>
               <p>Again, I reiterate, there is no one right answer to this question, only choices –
                  although some choices are more interesting than others. These are more places where
                  Cowley is silent and where the script must be fleshed out. This is where actors and
                  directors ask, “What if?” What if Courtall was Kitty’s original seducer? Or what if
                  he had formerly kept her? How would such possibilities contribute to deepening Courtall’s
                  sense of humiliation in mistaking Kitty for Lady Frances when he has her in his bedroom?
                  What would such an interpretation add to the significance of Kitty’s line to Courtall
                  after he has damned those present for humiliating him, “What! Me, too, Mr. Courtall?
                  Me, whom you have knelt to, prayed to, and adored?” (4.2.61-62). Is Kitty just adding
                  to the banter or is she getting her own revenge?</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Applying Dramaturgical Theory</span></h2>
               <p>When staging a performance of <em>Belle’s Stratagem</em>, one has to make one choice and commit to it. All further choices build upon those
                  that have gone before. How should Kitty be costumed? If she is wearing a domino, as
                  Cowley describes, do we see her own clothes under it when she unmasks? If so, will
                  they be the equivalent of the society women’s we have seen. More ornate? Will they
                  be shabby or dirty? Who is revealed when Kitty unmasks? A proud woman of the world
                  or one closer to the prostitute described by the uncomfortable <em>Spectator</em> on an evening in the early part of the century? Kitty’s unmasking prefigures Letitia’s
                  unmasking at the conclusion of the play. How do they connect to each other?</p>

               <p>Understanding who prostitutes were in the London of the late eighteenth century as
                  well as understanding who the women of high society were and what was expected of
                  them, gives students a grasp of the visceral reaction an audience would have to seeing
                  both respectable and disreputable women in the same public place or confusing them.
                  It calls their attention to questions the play is raising about how women are categorized
                  and about the fluidity of anyone’s identity. When Cowley dresses Sir George, Lady
                  Frances, Courtall, and Kitty in interchangeable costumes, she suggests with the different
                  pairings that result in the course of the ball, the ease with which the rake can be
                  confused with the devoted husband and the harlot with the virtuous wife. Does Kitty
                  becomes Leah to Lady Frances’s Rachel, sisters under the veil, in some ways indistinguishable?
                  Does Courtall’s inability to distinguish between the masked Kitty Willis and Lady
                  Frances reflect on Doricourt’s inability to distinguish the real Letitia behind her
                  many masks? If so, how?</p>
               <p>When teaching the play in class, however, I advocate exploring as many of the choices
                  as time permits. Asking our students to look at a variety of perspectives increases
                  their understanding of a play as a living art. Each choice is an interpretation of
                  the play. How do we come to see how examining a particular facet of a play from a
                  particular angle reflects throughout the whole gem of the play? How do we consciously
                  lead an audience to view a play based on a particular interpretation? For this, I
                  recommend further readings about the art of dramaturgy and ideas and theories about
                  how to connect audiences with classic productions.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One of the best texts for introducing students to dramaturgy as a discipline is <em>Dramaturgy in American Theater: A Source Book</em>, a collection of essays on various aspects and uses of dramaturgical theory and practice.
                     Selected essays from the section entitled “New Contexts” are especially appropriate
                     for teachers and students of Romantic Drama. In her essay, “Aiming the Canon at Now:
                     Strategies for Adaptation,” Susan Jonas examines “how theatermakers can employ the
                     canon to <span class="hi">reveal</span> its own biases” 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div>(emphasis hers). One technique Jonas suggests to amplify marginalized voices from
                     an historical text is one she terms “simultaneity” (255). Simultaneity refers to seeing
                     a silenced aspect of the play at the same time as the play proceeds as scripted. Such
                     a technique encourages the audience to view the play from the perspective of the less-privileged
                     characters and thus critically comments on the actions of the central characters and
                     expands our understanding of the world of the play. I will use this technique to suggest
                     one possible way of exploring <em>Belle’s Stratagem</em> dramaturgically.</p>
               </div>
               <p>While there are several scenes of lower-class characters used as transitions in Cowley’s
                  comedy, there are also public scenes for which little description is provided. The
                  play opens with Saville arriving with his servant at Lincoln’s Inn, one of the inns
                  of court where lawyers keep offices. Courtall describes the place as “the most private
                  place in town” (1.1.39-40) of a morning because no fashionable person would be seen
                  there – unless on legal business. But Lincoln’s Inn is inhabited by lawyers, their
                  families, their servants and their clients. People indeed may be coming and going
                  during the scene, just not people of high society. Saville begins the scene at a loss
                  for where to go and is talking with his servant before he sees Courtall. What if before
                  he sees Courtall, the audience sees Courtall being accosted by or in conversation
                  with Kitty – perhaps trying to extricate himself from her; perhaps giving her money?
                  If we have made the choice that Kitty has seen better days, how will this contribute
                  to their later confrontation? There is nothing in the script to prevent such a meeting.
                  Might Courtall be a poseur? Are his vaunted relationships with “women of quality”
                  really only assignations with prostitutes or seductions of young girls? How might
                  such a choice play out over the production? Or is Kitty some relic from his past?
                  Is he in her debt? Does he owe her money? No dialogue needs to be spoken, yet questions
                  can be raised in the audience’s mind. </p>
               <p>Other public scenes include the auction and the masquerade. Are there possibilities
                  for simultaneous actions in any of these? Cowley provides dialogue for the auctioneer
                  and his puffers before the gentry enter, yet she doesn’t account for the actions of
                  the shills once the fashionable characters arrive. What are they doing? Are they interacting?
                  Pickpocketing? Are they successful in impersonating the visitors? Does Kitty Willis
                  make an appearance? Is she the celebrated, wealthy courtesan, shunned by the women
                  but fawned over by the men? Or is she, like the puffers, trying to appear fashionable,
                  but coming up short? Does she make any connection with Courtall here? If so, what
                  kind? What about the masquerade? What is Kitty’s relationship to Saville? Is he hiring
                  an impoverished whore, a moderately successful one, a kept woman, or a courtesan out
                  for a lark? Do we recognize any of the servants or tradesmen at the masquerade? Is
                  the tabloid writer lurking there (or at the auction, for that matter)? Simultaneous
                  actions fill in the world of the play.</p>
               <p>Other possible dramaturgical approaches might be to create framing devices or to utilize
                  Brechtian alienation techniques. In the first transitional scene in the play, Cowley
                  shows us servants and tradespeople actively observing and feeding off the lives of
                  the fashionable. Might these working-class people observe, judge and/or profit from
                  their masters throughout the play? Might they be watching everything from the sidelines
                  or margins? Might we see their reactions to the stratagems and counter-stratagems
                  of those who live the high life? Cowley embeds many metatheatrical elements within
                  the comedy of various characters performing for others. Could we expand on the metatheatrics
                  and create a variation of the Shakespearean conceit of one set of characters watching
                  and reacting to another set performing a play for them? When she is not part of the
                  action, could Kitty be watching and forming her own judgments that color her responses
                  within her scenes? </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Might some, or all, of the actors be playing their lines to the audience by calling
                     attention to their own judgment of the characters? This type of approach deliberately
                     distances the audience from the action of the play rather than draws it into a suspension
                     of disbelief. It is part of the technique Bertolt Brecht uses to create what he calls
                     the “alienation effect,” and its purpose is to call attention to the economic, political
                     and class issues inherent in a dramatic text. Brecht does not want the audience to
                     “feel” for the characters so much as to “think” about them and the significance of
                     what they do. Brecht lays forth his theories in <em>The Messingkauf Dialogues.</em> 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> A useful assignment to help students understand how Brechtian theory can be applied
                     to historical drama, is to have them read and compare John Gay’s <em>The Beggar’s Opera</em> (1728) to Brecht’s adaptation of it, <em>The Threepenny Opera</em> (1928). What if the actress playing Kitty plays her as if she is an observer commenting
                     on her character and the actions of the scene in Brechtian fashion?</p>
               </div>
               <p>All of the questions I have suggested derive from the initial question of how to stage
                  the character of Kitty Willis, a character who appears in only two scenes of <em>The Belle’s Stratagem</em> and who only speaks five lines in those scenes, and yet the choices we make about
                  this character color the interpretation of the entire play. Such dramaturgical questions
                  must be asked about every character and every scene in every production of a dramatic
                  text, and so infinite interpretations are possible and valid. Each staging must simply
                  be consistent within itself.</p>
               <p>Teaching our students to approach Romantic Drama dramaturgically teaches them to work
                  in a multidisciplinary fashion and create a dynamic relationship with the text. It
                  encourages them to perform primary research into the period and to track down images,
                  music and cultural artifacts of the period, including gossip columns, broadsides,
                  and other records of popular culture. Understanding what connected and still connects
                  an audience to a play helps them to make personal connections as well. Our goal is
                  to help students see Romantic Drama as a multi-faceted art form as alive and open
                  to interpretation today as it was two hundred years ago.</p>

               to clarify some of the differences between the roles of director and dramaturg. The
               director chooses what the overall interpretation of the script will be and the dramaturg,
               actors and designers all serve the director to achieve his or her vision. By having
               a dramaturg keeping track of the story and making sure all the elements are clear
               to the audience, the director is freed to focus on the details of each scene and the
               moment to moment relationships between the characters. In addition to providing historical
               research the dramaturg may take notes during a rehearsal and pass them on to the director
               to help make sure the overall narrative doesn’t get lost in the development of a particular
               scene. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               herself from attacks from her critics based not on her talent and the realism of her
               character creations, but on her gender and whether she should write such characters
               so well. Janet Todd (in <em>The Sign of Angellica: Women, Writing and Fiction, 1660 – 1800 </em>(New York: Columbia University Press, 1989) traces the woman writer’s concern with
               being a public woman, and thus being equated with the disreputable prostitute, back
               to Aphra Behn’s character of Angellica Bianca, in <em>The Rover</em>, who hangs her picture with her price outside her door and tries to claim the same
               sexual freedom as men.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
