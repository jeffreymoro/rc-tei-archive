                  <div class="indent8">—Joanna Baillie, 
                     “Introductory Discourse,”
                      <span class="date">1798</span></div>’</span></div>
            <p>This essay addresses two questions that motivated the design of my new graduate seminar:
               why I extended the survey to include romantic drama, and why I believe romantic drama
               is particularly suited to a discussion of the pedagogical process. In the introduction
               to <em>Romantic Pedagogy Commons</em>, the editors explain that <span class="quote">‘this journal presents articles about how teaching works. Occasionally, in an essay
                  about teaching, the writer of the essay will say, 'Then I get students to see that
                  . . . .' Sometimes whatever follows the 'that' is in fact less significant than what
                  has been elided. What's missing is an answer to the question, HOW? How do you get
                  students to see what you see in a text? (Mandell)’</span><br/> This apt observation underlines that, when we teach or talk about our teaching, it
               is much easier to focus on our goal, <em>what</em> we want to teach our students, than on the process by which we achieve that goal.
               Pedagogy defies definition, in part because our teaching truly is a performance—scripted
               to a certain extent, but dependent on mood, on audience, on time—and so bounded by
               the rules of performance. Our teaching can never be repeated exactly the same way
               each time we do it, and the act of teaching is always slipping determinedly into the
               past. We emerge from a good class, or a bad one, with a record of what we have conveyed
               yet only a memory of how we have done so.</p>
            <p>Of course, none of these factors mean that we cannot discuss how we teach (only why
               these discussions are difficult), and I have always found that teaching drama gives
               me a model for how to reflect on my own teaching practice. Teaching a genre contingent
               upon performance reminds me that we cannot understand "what" without talking about
               "how." Teaching drama trains me to comprehend theory and practice simultaneously,
               and as a result I'm more ready to bring this approach to the subject of teaching itself.
               But recently, as I began to work more with those plays classified as "romantic dramas,"
               I discovered that drama could be more than a model. Romantic drama in particular seems
               interested in how theatrical practice works as a pedagogical strategy, so that the
               "what" these plays are all about becomes the "how" that we as scholars and teachers
               tend to efface. For instance, when Marjean D. Purinton presents the metatheatrics
               of Joanna Baillie's comedy <em>The Tryal</em> as "a pedagogical strategy offering women an alternative relationship to power" (133),
               her statement suggests the point of the play rests not just in what women are taught,
               but in the method by which women are taught it: through theater. This focus then reflects
               metatheatrically on the function of Joanna Baillie's play, such that "<em>The Tryal</em> makes its own pretense as theatre ironically powerful as a teaching tool" (Purinton
               133).<span class="hi"> </span></p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>So what should romantic drama teach us? "The Drama improves us by the knowledge we
                  acquire of our own minds, from the natural desire we have to look into the thoughts,
                  and observe the behaviour of others," Baillie states in the introductory preface to
                  her <em>Plays on the Passions</em> (90). Baillie here seems to outline first a method and then a goal: by observing the
                  "varieties of the human mind," by "examining others," we may in turn "know ourselves"
                  ("Preface" 76, 74). Both her choice to write drama and her insistence that her plays
                  were intended for the stage make sense in light of these methods, as the observation
                  and examination of others would seem to be best fulfilled in the embodied realm of
                  performance ("Preface" 108-9).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Despite the vexed performance history of her plays, Baillie insists she wrote them
                           to be performed. According to Catherine Burroughs, the playwright's stated intention
                           disqualifies her plays as "closet dramas." I'm citing Burroughs' talk "The Persistence
                           of Closet Drama: Theory, History, Form," given at the Huntington Library, San Marino,
                           California, March 4th, 2006.</span></div>
                  </div> But because of these methods, the "what" these plays are supposed to teach us—to know
                  ourselves, to know our own minds—is a quantity always to be discovered, contingent
                  as it is upon the infinite varieties and behaviors we can observe. More properly,
                  Baillie is invested in teaching method: we learn from her plays <em>how</em> to know ourselves. When studied from this perspective, these plays reveal that self-knowledge,
                  the pedagogical "goal" of Baillie and many other romanticists, is itself a process
                  far more than a precept. And when studied from this perspective, Baillie's plays allow
                  us to have methodologically oriented discussions that reflect more generally on the
                  practice of teaching, itself.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The links between subjectivity and pedagogy in the romantic period run wide and deep,
               and my graduate seminar builds to these links by situating Baillie's plays at the
               end of a historical survey of drama. The survey has a practical function—my class
               is perhaps the only course in eighteenth-century literature that my graduate students
               will take, and I feel responsible for providing coverage—but it has an intellectual
               purpose as well. I want my students to experience the liminal moments in literary
               history, to make connections among literary periods sometimes presented as distinct.
               The survey format also means that, by the time we reach romantic drama, we can discuss
               why plays that reflect on the pedagogical benefits of performance are also suited
               to explore the issues of subjectivity and self-knowledge with which they engage.</p>
            <p>The stated rubric of my course is that eighteenth-century plays depict identity as
               both metaphorically and literally theatrical. Our readings from the eighteenth century,
               texts from <em>The Rover</em>, to <em>The Beggar's Opera</em>, to <em>The Belle's Stratagem</em>, illustrate that an awareness of actual theatrical practice informs the way characters
               stage their identities in the "offstage" regions of these plays. I want students to
               think about how these observations resonate in provocative ways with contemporary
               theories of gender and identity construction, and I also want students to think about
               how current scholars are using terms from theater history in more theoretical ways.
               I therefore pair our primary readings for each week with a specific keyword, taken
               from theater / performance / gender studies, that reinforces in some way the themes
               of the text. Every student must choose one such word, research its theatrical and
               theoretical applications, and share a brief essay on their findings with the class.
               Keywords range from "ritual," to "masquerade," to "spectacle." By the time we get
               to "performativity," students recognize that we have already been using the word,
               in its current theoretical sense of acts or behaviors that construct the state of
               being they purport to express, to describe many acts of theatrical performance explored
               within these eighteenth-century plays. For example, we discuss the way a comedy such
               as Hannah Cowley's <em>The Belle's Stratagem</em> explores the idea of pre-existing social roles by having its title character move
               through a series of different and overtly theatrical roles onstage. These connections
               between "performativity" and "performance" (and I have the presenting student read
               at least the introduction to the Parker and Sedgwick collection of essays on this
               topic) encourage us to read the ideas about subjectivity considered in these plays
               in terms of evolutions—or continuities—in theatrical practice. I then pair our final
               keyword, "theatricality," with Baillie's <em>Plays on the Passions</em>, so that students will question the closeted nature of her plays and discuss to what
               extent theatricality can still characterize texts that are not actively performed.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thus, as we move into our romantic plays and challenge their delineation as "closet
                  dramas," we also create the potential for more continuity between eighteenth-century
                  and romantic conceptions of subjectivity than is currently assumed.

                           the delineation "closet drama." </span></div>
                  </div> Dror Wharman's recent book <em>The Making of the Modern Self </em>offers one version of the kind of polarized view we challenge. In this book, Wahrman
                  argues that "selfhood" in the short eighteenth century (the version of the century
                  that eschews the romantic period) was understood as something Protean, superficial,
                  something Wahrman calls "socially turned" (168). Not until the end of the century,
                  he claims, did identity come to be understood as something more essentialist and interior—the
                  romantic idea of the self.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For Wahrman, "identity" and "self" become interchangeable in the later eighteenth
                           century, as the point at which "identity became personal, interiorized, essential,
                           even innate." Once identity is something internalized, "it was made synonymous with
                           self" (276). </span></div>
                  </div> Yet Wahrman mistakenly invokes eighteenth-century theater as illustrative of, even
                  responsible for, this shift. He claims that "the [eighteenth-century] actor…was expected
                  to believe in his own actual metamorphosis in order to achieve the ideal dramatic
                  effect," so that if an eighteenth-century audience witnessed an actress in a breeches
                  part, it would read the performance as indicative of "a playful splitting of identity,
                  a splitting literal rather than metaphorical" (172, 176). Contrary to Wahrman's assertions,
                  the necessary identification of an actor with his or her part was in fact the subject
                  of much debate in the eighteenth century, as our reading from Diderot's <em><span class="foreign">Paradoxe sur le comédien</span></em> makes clear. At the same time, our dramatic readings showcase characters who do identify
                  with the theatrical roles they adopt, but for very different reasons, and with very
                  different results, than the ones Wahrman suggests. Many of our plays include characters
                  who adopt parts and put on roles, not always in an effort to reinvent themselves (Wahrman),
                  nor with the ability or desire to retain some theatrical detachment from the role
                  they take up (Diderot), but in a conscious effort to convey sentiments that would
                  otherwise be inexpressible. Cowley's Letitia Hardy fits into this characterization,
                  as do Behn's Hellena and Goldsmith's Kate Hardcastle. As these characters flit from
                  persona to persona, their roles are connected by a consistent, self-defining emotion
                  that the various roles allow them to convey. Indeed, the Goldsmith and Cowley heroines
                  make students think back to Eliza Haywood's heroine Fantomina, the titular character
                  from one of the few non-dramatic pieces we read. In all these cases, the theatrical
                  "splittings of identity" emerge as a characteristic performance strategy that creates
                  a link, not simply a gap, between self and persona, with a relationship between the
                  two that is not necessarily deceptive.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The eighteenth-century "self" seems much less Protean in this context, much less superficial,
               and much more associated with the sense of coherence and interiority that accompanies
               later romantic models of subjectivity. By the same token, these characteristics of
               romanticism emerge as a continuation of, not a deviation from, the ideas about subjectivity
               embodied on the eighteenth-century stage. Yet within this continuum any sense of interiority
               is constructed by the reiteration of theatrical acts, a rather un-romantic revision
               of essentialism. Imagine, for instance, how a student coming from a survey of eighteenth-century
               plays would read the following passage from Baillie's tragedy <em>De Monfort</em>, the moment at which Lady Jane De Monfort has tracked her conflicted brother to his
               friend Count Freberg's residence. Desperate to learn why De Monfort has fled their
               home, Jane takes Freberg's advice and veils herself, so that she may accost her brother
               while her own identity is obscured: </p>

               a mask in an attempt to assess "the temper of [her brother's] mind" (2.1.104). But
               the effect of Jane's disguise is surprising, for it prompts De Monfort to compare
               her to the person she actually is. Her face, behind those sable folds, <em>is</em> exactly as fair as the face that De Monfort imagines, her kindly deeds measure up
               precisely to the obligations her brother praises. Jane's disguise also means she belies
               herself when she claims "all sisters are not to the soul entwin'd / with equal bands."
               The sisters she describes are actually only one sister, the bands she describes exactly
               equivalent. All sisters conflate within her sable folds, so that De Monfort when confronted
               with her veil may see—correctly—the sister of whom he speaks.</p>
            <p>Her performance says much about the evolution and nature of romantic subjectivity.
               First, students will recognize that Jane takes her cue from a slew of earlier dramatic
               heroines. Like Letitia's or Fantomina's acts of disguise, Jane's masking becomes an
               expressive not an obfuscating act, and De Monfort would be better served by taking
               her at face value than by seeking to see something different beneath her veil. But
               Jane's veil is expressive in that it is evocative of the self upon which it is layered.
               The theater's use of costumes and vizards provides a physical source for the metaphorical
               layering that occurs in theatrical presentation, so that as theatrical presentation
               provides a surface, it simultaneously suggests an element of depth. Theatrical performance
               becomes an efficacious form of expression in this scene as it offers up the very surfaces
               that reinforce a subject's depth and dimensionality; selfhood in this model remains
               internalized, even as its interiority is perpetuated by the theatrical acts that confirm
               it. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Jane's masquerade also has a clear teaching purpose that reinforces this reading of
                  subjectivity as consistently multi-layered. She may speak as a sister in this scene
                  only because she is veiled, and thus only because De Monfort assumes he is not the
                  brother of whom she speaks. She may express her familial feelings precisely because
                  they are articulated during a performance, which suggests that even when the masks
                  characters don are expressive and not obfuscating the interiority-producing layer
                  of the mask is essential to maintain. Furthermore, it is crucial to De Monfort's reaction
                  that he be "caught up in the act" without quite knowing that he has become so. Jane's
                  theatrical display encourages in her brother neither catharsis nor even vicarious
                  sympathy. De Monfort experiences something more psychoanalytic, as the act of witnessing
                  Jane's performance brings his own latent passions to the surface and forces him to
                  come to terms with them.

                           propensity" (73, 76). Unlike Adam Smith, who claims that sympathy enables us "change
                           places with the sufferer," to gain some sense of his torments, Baillie asserts that
                           "in examining others we know ourselves" (74).</span></div>

               <p>Yet performance becomes pedagogical only under specific conditions. As the wronged
                  sister, Jane consciously adopts a role that communicates her own feelings. She performs
                  her part with an unexpected emotional honesty, and her ultimate influence over her
                  brother derives from the fact that she is not only like the sister of whom she speaks,
                  but she is the sister herself. De Monfort, on the other hand, does not know he is
                  participating in a performance until Jane unmasks. In Baillie's play, acts of performance
                  shift from entertaining to instructive when they are crafted so that their specific
                  didactic purpose is somewhat obscured, and so that the intended student audience (in
                  this case, De Monfort) is at least temporarily unaware of the scene's crafted nature.

                           concept, though we do not have time to read them in my class.</span></div>
                  </div> For the typical theater audience tucked safely behind a fourth wall, the conditions
                  of performance are both more apparent and less interactive. Yet by incorporating models
                  of pedagogical performance within themselves, plays like <em>De Monfort</em> reflect suggestively on their own pedagogical function. Indeed, by framing pedagogical
                  moments within the play as covertly didactic, the play reclaims its own generic conventions
                  as advantageous to its didactic project. The broader convention of the stage, which
                  seems to require that the theater audience observe yet not participate in the dialogues
                  they witness, also insists that the play's pedagogical claims on its external audience
                  be at least temporarily disguised. (In this model, Baillie's "Introductory Discourse"
                  becomes akin to the explication of Jane's unmasking.) The theater audience thus shares
                  a position with DeMonfort, as both are unaware of exactly how they are engaged and
                  implicated in the didactic project of the performance before them, while this temporary
                  suspension of awareness is encouraged by and crucial to the pedagogical program outlined
                  within the play itself.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In the classroom, we are much more attuned to the fact that we are teaching or being
               taught, though here too we can be subtle about how our goals are advertised or achieved.
               For instance, I publicize my graduate course as a course on "staging identity," though
               my publicized interest in subjectivity and my closeted interest in pedagogy ultimately
               align. A tenet that remains consistent among rationalist and romantic ideas of education
               alike is that the preceptor is not a dictator so much as a guide (Richardson). The
               student must learn how to learn; they must, as Maria Edgeworth puts it, learn to "think
               and reason for [themselves]" (297). The educator in this model does not disseminate
               facts so much as lead students toward personal discoveries, so that students have
               for themselves the experience of proving theorems, of testing precepts. And for the
               student—be he a doctoral candidate or the tormented De Monfort—to learn from experience,
               he must be able to react to a staged circumstance with his own emotions. The good
               teacher both creates and obscures the conditions that enable this emotional reaction
               to occur. In other words, teaching, when done well, obscures its scripted nature.</p>
            <p>What I have learned, then, in teaching romantic drama is that students need guidance,
               but that they also need to reach conclusions on their own. In the case of my graduate
               seminar, they need to experience for themselves the instructive, constructive relationship
               of performance to subjectivity. So in addition to having my students attend productions
               of Bertolt Brecht's <em>The Threepenny Opera</em> and a dramatic adaptation of <em>Mansfield Park</em> (which the USC School of Theatre very conveniently scheduled to overlap with my seminar),
               I have my class conclude with a student performance that coincides with their final
               reading assignment in Austen's novel <em>Mansfield Park</em>. As a class, they must agree upon one scene from all the plays we have read, cast
               the actors, decide on whatever props will be necessary, and rehearse to whatever extent
               they see fit. The preparation for the assignment asks them to review the plays and
               themes from throughout the semester, but it also asks them to mimic the process of
               decision and rehearsal that frames <em>Mansfield Park's</em> controversial home theatricals. We have shared an experience with the Crawfords and
               the Bertrams and should never read the novel in quite the same way, again.</p>
            <p>More specifically, the actual staging gives us a chance to discuss how performance
               intensifies one's experience of a scene and why performance, in the nineteenth-century
               context of Austen's novel, might be considered risky. As we discuss, Fanny's discomfort
               with the playacting in the novel responds on some level to the fact that Austen's
               characters pair off in a manner that reflects their real life affections, so that
               the rehearsals become a chance to act on the flirtatious impulses that might otherwise
               be kept in check. And as the strategic space between actor and role is lost, the personal
               expressions of these actors—more than theatricality itself—become the subject of Austen's
               critique. </p>
            <p>So unlike Baillie's play, in which the assumed discrepancy between actor and role
               provides Jane De Monfort the space and opportunity for self-expression, Austen's novel
               depicts an unmediated understanding of performance, and the theater in this novel
               is disbanded exactly when it has become recognized as an expressive more than a performative
               space. But as we approach this novel at the end of our survey of texts, and concurrent
               with our own attempts to choose and enact roles, we find ourselves discussing expression
               and performativity as dialectical, not antithetical, concepts. Our historical survey
               shows us instead that what varies from play to play is not the project of the theater,
               so much as the audience sensitivity towards one or the other potential of theatrical
               performance and, correspondingly, an author's manipulation of this sensitivity through
               his or her framing of the act of performance itself.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Yet by ending our seminar with a novel, we also end with a question: if performance
                  and the associated behaviors of observation and participation were so crucial to a
                  romantic program of education, why is it that the novel and the closet drama (genres
                  that do not require performance) become the dominant genres for conveying pedagogy?
                  The rise of the novel in all its didactic glory is something critics acknowledge,
                  and this is a genre we discuss at least briefly in our class. I also want to mention
                  here the plethora of "academic dramas" that marked the end of the century, the proliferation
                  of dramatic dialogues that were seen as "lesson[s] in the guise of play[s]" though
                  plays that were never meant to be performed.<sup> </sup><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The term "academic dramas" is from Marta Strazinicky, 426; the quoted phrase is from
                           Hannah More's closet drama A Search after Happiness (composed 1763; published 1773).
                           For examples of these "lesson[s] in the guise of play[s]," see (among others) C. Short,
                           Dramas for the use of young ladies (1792); Elizabeth Pinchard Dramatic Dialogues,

                           with me.</span></div>
                  </div><sup> </sup> Why does pedagogy become increasingly associated with the closet drama, increasingly
                  detached from actual performance?</p>
            </div>
            <p>This shift reveals, I believe, that the key to romantic pedagogy is not embodiment,
               per se, but mediated experience: physical observation or interaction is ultimately
               less crucial to romantic pedagogies than the notion that <span class="hi">we learn about ourselves through others</span>. This claim offers an alternate reading of romantic drama, one that reveals the pedagogical
               potential of theater to rest in more than just its ability to encourage audience observation
               of embodied roles. If we go back to Baillie's play, we see that Jane's physical presence
               is actually less important to De Monfort's epiphany (indeed, he does not know that
               Jane is present) than the means by which she communicates with her brother: from behind
               a mask, and by directing her explanation for the mask—not to her brother, for whom
               both mask and explanation are clearly meant—but to Count Freberg, the very man who
               advocated the disguise. In this scene, Jane highlights a key component of all playacting,
               and a characteristic of theatricality: not embodiment, but mediation. The act of acting
               is by definition the act of conveying ideas or thoughts via intermediate roles. And
               yet, on the stage this process is often all too overt, especially if the theatrical
               nature of a performance must be obscured for it to function in a pedagogical manner.
               Closet drama (and, I would argue, a novel such as <em>Mansfield Park</em>, which juxtaposes its own generic conventions to the current unmediated conventions
               of the Bertram's theater) interrupt what Martin Puchner calls the "unmediated theatricality
               of the stage" (22). The closet drama insists that the theatrical process itself be
               mediated; paradoxically enough, it restores the theatricality to drama and thus drama's
               pedagogical potential.</p>
            <p>I therefore believe that romantic drama can teach us much about teaching and even
               more about why we teach literature, of any genre or period. As students, teachers,
               and lovers of books—a body of people who often struggle to define the value of theorizing
               about imaginary heroines, dead authors, and subjective readings—we learn from romantic
               drama to focus on the benefits, indeed the necessity, of learning about ourselves
               through others. Additionally, these plays remind us that teaching is not about a set
               of definitions but about shared methods, experiences, and a collective process of
               discovery. We are passionate about what we read and teach because we have felt the
               benefit of emotional and intellectual engagement with what we read and teach. And
               we know that literature, as that which provides such an experience, can teach us something
               about ourselves. </p>
