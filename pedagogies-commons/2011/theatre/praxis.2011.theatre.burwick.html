                  </div> I continue to alter my teaching of production and performance with each new play.
                  One reason for change is that each play brings its own peculiar set of demands on
                  the cast. Another reason for change is that each new cast brings a different set of
                  talents to be developed. A third factor is my own evolving attention to the characteristics
                  of period acting.

            <p>As an introduction to the drama of 1780-1830, with emphasis on production and performance,
               English 97H: <em>Romantic Drama. Production and Performance</em>, includes practice in acting styles of the period (gesture, elocution, delivery),
               historical theater construction, period costumes, and stage design. Although a large
               number of theater majors, music majors, and English majors turn out, auditions are
               open to all students. They are asked to prepare a monologue, a song, and to provide
               a “cold” reading of a dramatic passage. In selecting the play to be performed each
               year, the primary concerns are to find a play that will challenge student abilities,
               that will be accessible to our audiences, that will be rich in historical relevance,
               and that will depict the temper and tastes of the period. Because the theater of the
               period is musical theater, there is also the difficulty of securing a musical score.
               Many productions relied on interpolated songs, and even where full scores exist, those
               score were often altered with changes in the cast from one season to the next. Obviously
               the music, then as now, had to suit the abilities of the cast.</p>

                  by James Cobb (1756-1818). Opening at Drury Lane November 24, 1789, this comic opera
                  was a significant success, with eighty-four performances in its first two seasons,
                  many more throughout the 1790s, and frequent revivals for the next half century.

                  </div> <em>The Haunted Tower</em> provides an excellent example because of its particularly rich fabric of historical,
                  social, theatrical, and musical issues. Having in previous years directed Elizabeth
                  Inchbald’s <em>Animal Magnetism</em> and Hannah Cowley’s <em>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</em>, I was ready to prompt students to give special attention to disguise and role-playing
                  as a dramatic means of exposing prejudicial assumptions about gender, class, and national
                  character. <em>The Haunted Tower</em> proved a good choice both pedagogically and dramatically, providing insight into social
                  issues, political tensions, national and international turmoil. The representation
                  of English-French relations on the very eve of the Revolution would, in itself, amply
                  justify the focus on <em>The Haunted Tower</em>. The fact that it is also a play adapted from the French of the Marquis de Sade for
                  performance on the English stage gives it an added dimension of political complexity.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Discovering Storace and Cobb</span></h2>
               <p>Storace and Cobb began their collaboration with a translation of <em>The Doctor and the Apothecary</em>, which opened at Drury Lane on October 25, 1788. This production closely followed
                  the Viennese original, <em>Doktor und Apotheker</em> (1786), with a score by Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf (1739-1799) and libretto by
                  Gottlieb Stephanie (1741-1800). After the great success of <em>The Haunted Tower</em>, Cobb and Storace continued their collaboration with another comic opera, <em>The Siege of Belgrade</em>, first performed on January 1, 1791; <em>The Pirates</em>, performed at the King’s Theatre on November 21, 1792; and <em>The Cherokee</em>, performed December 20, 1794. In addition to his collaboration with Cobb, Storace
                  also wrote the score for <em>No Song No Supper</em>, an opera in two acts by Prince Hoare (1755-1834), performed at Drury Lane April
                  16, 1790. For Hoare’s libretto Storace introduced some of the music that he had written
                  in Venice of his opera, <em>Gli equivoci</em> (December 27, 1786), based on Shakespeare’s <em>Comedy of Errors</em>. The music forGeorge Colman’s <em>The Iron Chest</em> (March 12, 1796) was also composed by Storace.</p>
               <p>Although I was excited about working with a musical score that included 29 songs,
                  with overture and finale, I also recognized that the music would be a challenge vocally
                  to a student cast. The success was due to the Vocal Director, Stephen Pu, graduate
                  student in Musicology at UCLA. In an attempt to trace the origin of the plot, and
                  hoping to find hints on performance, I turned to Michael Kelly’s <em>Reminiscences</em> (1826). Kelly performed with the Storaces in Vienna and returned with them to London
                  in March, 1787. Kelly made regular trips to Paris in search of material for the London
                  stage. At the Comédie-Italienne in Paris, 1790, Kelly saw <em>Raoul Barbe-Bleue</em>, a comic opera by Ernest Modeste Grétry (1741–1813), with libretto by Michel-Jean
                  Sedaine (1719-1797). Kelly not only persuaded George Colman to write an English adaptation,
                  Kelly himself composed the musical score. <em>Blue-Beard; or, Female Curiosity</em> opened at Drury Lane on January 16, 1798.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When Kelly made the trip to Paris in 1788, he returned with a work entitled, <em>La tour enchantée, un opéra-comique</em>. In searching for the author of this French work, I discovered that it was none other
                     than the infamous Marquis de Sade, who had sent it, along with several other plays,
                     to theaters in Paris in late summer, 1788.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>La tour enchantée, un opéra-comique, as described in the Marquis de Sade’s Catalogue
                              raisonné (October 1, 1788), was the concluding episode to a sequence of six plays
                              entitled L’union des arts. On February 27, 1791, Monsieur Framery, agent for playwrights,
                              informed Sade that several of the plays had been accepted for performance. They remained
                              unstaged, but La tour enchantée, un opéra-comique made its way from Paris to London.</span></div>
                     </div> This discovery was not mine. John and Ben Franceschina provide a comparison of the
                     French and English versions in the introduction to their translation, <em>The Plays of the Marquis de Sade,</em> 3 vols. (2000). Serendipitously, I also discovered that UCLA’s Clark Library possessed
                     a manuscript of Sade’s <em>La tour enchantée</em> and that the manuscript of Cobb’s libretto was in the Larpent Collection at the nearby
                     Huntington Library.</p>
               </div>
               <p>During the Fall term I set to work with the necessary adaptations. First, I turned
                  to Brian Holmes (San Jose State University) to adapt the musical score for performance
                  by a chamber ensemble (violin, viola, flute, keyboard) rather than a full orchestra.
                  Brian also provided an additional song for a scene that had been omitted by Cobb (“My
                  love is not a problem” II.vi). This song is sung by a tax collector, whom two young
                  ladies are trying to persuade to enter the Haunted Tower (“Attune the pipe” II.vi).
                  The first week began with discussion of plot, character, and acting styles, and many
                  improvisation exercises in period acting accompanied scene by scene blocking of the
                  play. For the first several weeks vocal rehearsals were held separate from acting
                  rehearsals, but because this production is so extensively musical, the two had to
                  be integrated by the fourth week. Additional time was required for vocal rehearsals
                  right up to the time of performance at the end of the eighth week. For our final dress/tech
                  on Thursday, March 1, we had the benefit of an exclusive audience of specialists:
                  Catherine Burroughs (Wells College), Jeff Cox (Colorado), and Jane Moody (York), who
                  provided a useful critique following the performance.</p>
               <p>The great advantage of utilizing performance and production in teaching Romantic Drama
                  is that the students learn the material literally from the inside out. They gain an
                  understanding of the language, the acting, and the music that mere reading cannot
                  provide. With this particular play, the students were made aware of gender issues,
                  as well as national tensions (French vs. English) and social tensions (aristocracy
                  vs. lower classes) that prevailed during the period. As the only work of the Marquis
                  de Sade to be performed on the London stage during his own lifetime, <em>The Haunted Tower</em> also gave students insight into the international reach of the drama of the period.</p>

                     comments about the English. Cobb had to tell the story from an English rather than
                     a French perspective. He was greatly assisted in this task by Storace, who provided
                     several set pieces to reinforce a sense of British tradition: an opening chorus “To
                     Albion’s Genius” (I.i), a hunting song, “Hark! The sweet horn” (I.iii), a chorus to
                     the “Roast Beef of Old England”(II.vii), and a drinking song praising English ale,
                     “And now we're met, a jolly set” (III.iv).

                     </div> Further, Cobb’s version, with its marriage between Lady Elinor de Courcy and Lord
                     William, restored to his estate as the true Baron of Oakland, reestablishes harmony
                     between France and England. The division between the aristocracy and the common folk
                     is not overcome, but the virtues and advantages of the commoners are repeatedly affirmed.
                     Indeed, the significant contribution of the subplot, the love of Edward and Adela,
                     was to emphasize the sincerity and integrity of the lower classes. Michael Kelly declares
                     that the subplot “was taken from an Italian intermezzo opera,” and it was clear that
                     Stephen Storace intended the role of Adela as a showcase for his sister Anna Storace’s
                     accomplishments, “both as a singer and an actress.” Kelly describes his own solos
                     as Lord William, “From hope's fond dream” (I.i) and “Spirit of my sainted Sire” (III.iv),
                     as “fine songs,” but notes that the latter was “one of the most difficult songs ever
                     composed for the tenor voice.”

               <p>Revolutionary themes are incorporated but controverted: the corrupt aristocracy is
                  overthrown, but the usurping Baron was only a fake aristocrat. The class hierarchy
                  is topsy-turvy. In his endeavor to fulfill his father’s expectations as heir to the
                  Baron’s estate, “plain Edward the ploughman” introduces his beloved Adela, a cottager,
                  into court disguised as Lady Elinor. Meanwhile, to avoid the unwanted marriage, Lady
                  Elinor pretends to be her own maid-in-waiting and Lord William passes himself off
                  as a court jester. As jester, Lord William mocks the false Baron, who can only pretend
                  to sexual attraction and prowess, but is still rich enough to pay for flattery and
                  other services: </p>

               <p>Several songs express the honesty and freedom of the lower class. Cicely, for example,
                  sings of her freedom “From high birth and all its fetters” which allows her, in contrast
                  to Lady Elinor who is bound in an arranged marriage, to choose the “youth I love”
                  (III.iii). Edward and Adela ridicule aristocratic pretensions in their duet, “Will
                  great lords and ladies” (I.iii). The conflict between upper and lower class is given
                  full expression in the sestetto, “Alas! behold the silly maid” (II.iv), and more directly
                  in the cat-fight duet with Adela and Lady Elinor, “Begone! I discharge you!” (III.iii).</p>

               <p>Sade’s setting was contemporary. Cobb changed the setting back to the time of William
                  the Conqueror. In adapting <em>The Haunted Tower</em>, I brought the time forward again to the reign of George III in order to make the
                  references to the French Revolution more evident. Among other changes, I restored
                  the opening dialogue between Juliette and Louise (Lady Elinor and Cicely), which provides
                  at the very beginning of the play the explanation of the haunting. I also restored
                  the scene in which an attempt is made to persuade Grouffignac, the tax collector,
                  to enter the haunted tower. Here I made the further change of giving the task of seducing
                  the tax collector to two village girls rather than to Juliette and Louise.</p>
               <p>Much of the humor of the play derives from differences in manner and speech between
                  French and English, and between upper and lower classes. These differences are compounded
                  by the many role reversals. Having fled as a young boy to France, the exiled Lord
                  William has survived as the Frenchman Sir Palamede, is concealed in the De Courcy
                  estate dressed as a girl by Cicely, and presented at the English court as a Jester.
                  In his role as the usurping Baron, Edmund the ploughman is boorishly clumsy in affecting
                  grand airs, and obnoxious in his presumption of sexual liberties. To marry her beloved
                  Edward, Adela must disguise herself as Lady Elinor, and Lady Elinor, to avoid marriage
                  to Edward, pretends to be her own maid-in-waiting.</p>

                  highly stylized and artificial. The strangeness of period conventions, however, soon
                  became familiar with practice. Typical of these exercises were the enactment Doubt
                  and Apprehension in the manner of John Philip Kemble’s performance of Hamlet’s soliloquy:

               <p>The pace and the movement of arms are synchronized with the movement of the mind:
                  now moving slowly, now irregular, now agitated and quick. “The moment that a difficulty
                  presents itself, the play of the hands entirely ceases – the eye, which, as well as
                  the head, had a gentle and placid motion, while the thought was easy, and unfolded
                  itself without labour, [...] in this new situation looks straight forward, and the
                  load falls on the heart, until, after the first shock of doubt [...] suspended activity
                  resumes its former walk.” The pace, the tilt of head, the movement of the hands and
                  arms, must undergo a transformation from agitation to control. As if he catches himself,
                  he stops still, gathers composure, then delivers his soliloquy. Hamlet’s reflections
                  bring him to a crux: “To die, to sleep;/ To sleep, perchance to dream” (III.i). Hamlet
                  comes to a full halt, pauses a moment, then exclaims “ay, there’s the rub,” and at
                  the same moment should give the exterior sign of that which his interior penetration

                  a conservative dignity:</p>

                  they are called upon by the lecherous Baron to seduce Grouffing, the tax-collector,
                  in order to persuade him to fetch the chest of gold stored in the haunted tower. For
                  this scene, in which they sing “Attune the pipe,” their modest peasant dresses must
                  be modified into seductive attire.</p>

               <p>In the comedies of the period, an heiress and her maid are often depicted as companions:
                  the lady demur and modest, the maid daring, witty, and saucy. The relationship between
                  Lady Elinor and her maid Cicely adheres to this pattern, except that Cicely is several
                  degrees more assertive and commanding. She constantly interrupts Lady Elinor, gives
                  orders to Sir Palamede, and directs their actions. Her solo in Act I, “Nature to woman
                  still so kind,” based on a Welch folk tune, asserts her sense of a woman’s advantage.</p>

                  addressing other servants. In Act I, scene ii, as depicted, she is insulting in her
                  rude dismissal of Maud, the village girl who has offered shelter and guidance to the
                  newly arrived party from France. The gestures, it may be noted, are those prescribed
                  by Engel/Siddons: Palamede’s contemplative curiosity, Maud’s offended astonishment,
                  Cicely’s arrogant authority.</p>

               <p>The role of Lord William is, in effect, several roles in one. He was but a boy of
                  twelve when the false slander against his father, the Baron of Oakland, forced him
                  into exile. Following the death of his father, a distant cousin, Edmund the ploughman,
                  has seized power as usurping Baron. In France, William took on the disguise of Palamede,
                  and matured into a promising young soldier in service to De Courcy. Here he fell in
                  love with Lady Elinor and she with him. Her father, however, has pledged her in marriage
                  to the heir of the Baron of Oakland. Lord William, of course, is the rightful heir,
                  but he dare not make that claim until he has received the official pardon from the
                  King. He thus must remain docile and submissive, even to the demands of Cicely. Assisting
                  him to gain access to Lady Elinor’s quarters in her father’s estate, Cicely has disguised
                  him as Lily, a maid-in-waiting. As Lily, William/Palamede was also able to make the
                  crossing in the same ship with Lady Elinor. He is caught in the dilemma of asserting
                  his masculinity while Cicely teasingly reminds him of his female role. Whatever other
                  roles he is forced to assume, the audience must perceive that he is indeed his own
                  man and capable heir to his father’s lands. When he steps forth from the haunted tower
                  dressed in his father’s armor, singing the powerful aria, “Spirit of my sainted sire”
                  (III.iv), he has fully assumed his proper heroic stature. The backflashes that explain
                  the usurpation and exile are provided, first, by the village girl Maud, then by Hugo,
                  faithful servant of the family. Cicely’s abrupt dismissal of Maud in the above depicted
                  scene (I.ii) is motivated by her anxiety that she will lose control of the situation
                  if Maud reveals too much of William’s eminent restoration. When William is introduced
                  as De Courcy’s court jester, the Baron ridicules his debased status, but deftly turns
                  the tables with a satirical song laughing at the Baron’s impotent and ineffectual
                  prowess. </p>

                  <p>As noted above, Cobb and Storace fortified the Englishness of their adaptation by
                     introducing traditional English themes in their songs. How the entrance and exit of
                     a chorus was managed at Drury Lane I could discover neither in Kelly’s account in
                     his <em>Reminiscences</em> nor in Genest’s commentary on the premier performance.

                     </div> My solution was to present a quartet (two sopranos, an alto, and a tenor) with changes
                     in costume but always the same as characters. For the opening chorus (I.i) they were
                     costumed as fishermen, as huntsmen led in song by Robert (I.iii), as servants to the
                     false Baron (I.iii), as cooks, again led by Robert in singing the “Roast Beef of Old <span class="name">England</span>”(II.vii), and as soldiers (I.iv and III.vi). The chorus thus had four costume changes,
                     but they were instructed always to synchronize their movements and gestures, as in
                     the above scene as huntsmen. The one exception was their signature entrance: they
                     would march on stage perfectly coordinated, then stumble and bump into each other
                     when they came to a halt.</p>

                  <p>The comic center of <em>The Haunted Tower</em> is the lecherous and self-aggrandizing fake Baron. He exploits and abuses the lower
                     classes as mere objects of his desires. Just clever enough to be aware of his own
                     clumsiness in pretending to nobility, he constantly suspects that others of rank and
                     power are laughing at his pretensions and attempting to undermine his authority. His
                     suspicions are not ill-founded. In the scene depicted above (III.i), the Baron expresses
                     to De Courcy his fears that a revolution, led by De Courcy’s court jester, is at hand.
                     De Courcy, of course, perceives that the court jester is Sir Palamede, one of his
                     own retinue. He knows Palamede’s affections for his sister, yet he has assumed that
                     Lady Elinor would not dishonor her father’s pledge that she marry the son of the Baron
                     of Oakland. In performing the role of the false Baron, Greg Cragg followed my cues
                     in adapting several of Robert Baddeley’s mannerisms, including what Michael Kelly
                     described as Baddeley’s “habit of smacking his lips always when speaking.”

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At the beginning of Act III, De Courcy finally meets Adela, the peasant girl who has
                     been impersonating his sister. Edward, son of the false Baron, is in love with the
                     peasant girl Adela. Just as Lady Elinor must accept her father’s decision that she
                     marry the heir of the Baron of Oakland, Edward must comply with his father’s eager
                     pursuit of the marriage which will lend legitimacy to his own claims of nobility.
                     Edward contrives the plot to disguise Adela as Lady Elinor and thus consummate the
                     marriage before the real Lady Elinor arrives. The real Lady Elinor arrives too early,
                     but is readily persuaded by Cicely to play along with the hoax in order to escape
                     an unwanted marriage to Edward. This scene commences with De Courcy in pursuit of
                     Sir Palamede, whom he now fears has turned traitor and seeks to elope with his sister.
                     After the false Baron informs him that a revolution is underway, Edward arrives half-drunk
                     from his tryst with Adela, whom he has introduced into the Oakland court as Lady Elinor.
                     Considering his sister’s honor insulted by Edward’s overly familiar claims of intimacy
                     with “my wife that is to be,” De Courcy is about to draw his sword. At this moment
                     Adela arrives, and is greeted as “Lady Elinor” by the Baron and his son. Suspecting
                     that this false identity must be a plot of Palamede’s, De Courcy declares, “I perceive,
                     my lord, you have been imposed on, but you shall soon be avenged.” Edward and Adela
                     stand aside looking guilty and exposed, while the Baron tries to puzzle out how he
                     might have been “imposed on.” Not suspecting his son’s ruse and unable to determine
                     any source of imposition, he follows after De Courcy to “ask whether I ought to be
                     in a passion or not.” The scene closes with Adela singing a plaintive love song to
                     Edward, “Love from the heart” (III.i). In referring to the penultimate scene (III.v),
                     when “the Baron enters with his sword drawn, and some old armour awkwardly put on,”
                     Genest cites Hannah Cowley’s remarks on Baddeley’s performance: “a great actor, holding
                     a sword in his left hand, and making awkward passes with it, charms the audience;
                     and brings down such applauses as the bewitching dialogue of Farquhar pants for in
                     vain.”

                              as acted at the Theatre-Royal, Covent Garden (London: Printed by G. Woodfall, for
                              T. N. Longman, 1795), p. vi.</span></div>
                     </div> The implication would seem to be that by some degradation of popular taste, the comedy
                     of gesture has gained an unwarranted advantage over the comedy of witty dialogue.
                     The charge is not without truth: Romantic comedy is not particularly noted for its
                     clever dialogue, and it does rely frequently on body language, indeed more and more
                     so with the increasing popularity of pantomime and melodrama. But this was not a passing
                     phase. The Baron frantically waving his sword still brings down the house. Nevertheless
                     it is also true that the dialogue contains a great deal of allusive irony concerning
                     the politics of revolution.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Although the performers were well cued on pacing their delivery to allow that irony
                  to emerge, many of the potential laugh-lines were missed by the student audiences
                  during our four performances at UCLA. The cast and crew were therefore pleased and
                  surprised by the much more responsive audience of literary scholars attending the
                  performance on March 9, at the 41st Annual Comparative Literature Conference, California
                  State University, Long Beach. The success of our performances were due entirely to
                  the talent and dedication of the students involved. Gifted singers like Schuyler Hudak
                  as Adela, Kristin Crawford as Lady Elinor, and Lauren Cheak as Cicely brought Storace’s
                  score to life, and Stephen Pu as vocal director enabled the entire cast to achieve
                  excellence in virtuoso solos as well as complex choral pieces.</p>
               <p>In the final scene (III.vi), Lord William is revealed as rightful Baron of Oakland.
                  He reconciled with De Courcy who affirms that no obstacle interferes with his father’s
                  pledge of Lady Elinor’s hand in marriage. Edward is free to marry Adela. The comic
                  opera concludes with the first Grand Finale to be performed on a London Stage: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">The banished ills of heretofore</div>
                     <div class="l">At happy distance viewing;</div>
                     <div class="l">Of the past we’ll think no more,</div>
                     <div class="l">While future bliss pursing. <br/> (III.vi)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Crucial here is that Lord William exonerates the false Baron of all crimes related
                  to his usurpation and committed under his rule. The “happy ending” reconciles French-English
                  animosities and class conflict at the very moment in history, immediately following
                  the outbreak of the French Revolution, when these tensions were at a peak. Whether
                  or not the audience saw any contemporary relevance in this doctrine of reconciliation,
                  the finale gave an optimistic “feel good” conclusion to a comedy of disguise, deceit,
                  and sadistic exploitation.</p><br/><br/><div>Audio files for <em>The Haunted Tower</em> can be found <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/douglass/music/album-haunted.html">here</a>.</div>

               by two weeks to perform (four performances on the UCLA campus, followed by invitational

               'Love, listen to my sorrow' evokes Adela’s 'Whither, my love!' (I.iii) in Cobb’s libretto.
               Both pieces depict long-suffering heroines yearning to be reunited to their long-lost
               lovers in lyrics that evoke images of bondage, lovers’ tokens, and an obsession with
               the lover’s image. Lorville’s lament recalling his leaving his lover behind, 'Oh!
               Juliette' is echoed in Cobb’s libretto with Charles’s 'My native land I bade adieu'
               (I.iv), in which the noble servant character philosophizes about the girl he left
               behind. In both airs, the characters singing imagine that the intensity of emotion
               has changed on the part of the women involved. In the English work, Charles accepts
               the situation with wry humor; in the French, Lorville responds melodramatically in
