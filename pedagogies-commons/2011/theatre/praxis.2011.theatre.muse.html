               <p>“Holy Theatre” is a term known to drama students and theatre practitioners primarily
                  from Peter Brook’s treatment of it in his 1968 classic, <em>The Empty Space</em>. It is, Brook says, “the Theatre of the Invisible – Made – Visible” (42); it is the
                  kind of theatre that arises from a deeply felt urge to “capture in our arts the invisible
                  currents that rule our lives” (45). Christopher Innes, in his study <em>Holy Theatre</em>, observes that its “hallmark” is an “aspiration to transcendence, to the spiritual
                  in its widest sense” (3) and that it attempts to “transcribe subjective experience
                  directly into stage terms” (29). The effect is meant to be communal: a theatre “that
                  brings its spectators into emotional harmony with one another by celebrating their
                  common identity as human beings” (Auslander 13).

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Innes’s and Auslander’s descriptions may strike readers as very Romantic and therefore
                           familiar, but some further clarification may be in order since the term “holy theatre”
                           can be misleading and, for some, off-putting. It does not mean, for instance, a “religious”
                           drama; indeed, much of Artaud’s and Grotowski’s work in the twentieth century (and
                           Ibsen’s and Strindberg’s, for that matter) was considered sacrilegious, even blasphemous.
                           Most theatre that meets the criteria I discuss in this essay is no longer given the
                           label of “holy,” and a look at the scholarship of Christopher Innes is instru…</span></div>
                  </div> Brook took the term “holy” from Antonin Artaud’s vision of theatre as “a metaphysical
                  force,” “holy rite and quasi-religious practice” (Esslin, <em>Antonin Artaud</em> 101). Artaud’s work was in part a return to and a nostalgia for the prehistory of
                  theatre, the ancient cult rituals and goat-songs that developed into Greek drama,
                  and that were celebrated as the “Dionysian” split from “Apollonian” harmony, rationalism,
                  and sculpture in Nietzsche’s highly influential <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> (1872). This metaphysical or “holy” impulse in theatre has a long history, and can
                  be seen as one of the “master currents” of dramatic literature and theatre theory.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As is well known, the study of European drama has greatly favored the master current
                  that flows toward realism and naturalism, a narrative of progress that celebrates
                  the late nineteenth century arrival of the “well-made play” and the “problem play”
                  (ushered in by the reigning triumvirate of Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov, with the
                  frequent addition of Shaw), dramas that work from the “bottom up,” grounded in the
                  material world and social issues. Plays that endeavor something else, namely to stage
                  subjective states, have been dropped into the valley of the unstageable and unstageworthy.
                  These are the plays of the master current of the holy theatre. They tend to get labeled
                  “closet dramas,” “symbolist,” “impressionist” or “expressionist,” “experimental” or
                  “avant garde.” Philosophical plays concerned with revealing states of mind, consciousness,
                  dreams, ghosts, magic, they work from the “top down” and begin in abstraction, “sojourning
                  through consciousness and affecting the ‘reality’ of the material world beneath it,”
                  as William Demastes explains in <em>Staging Consciousness: Theater and the Materialization of Mind</em> (15). The plays are an exploration of the human condition, but from the “inside out”
                  rather than the social realism approach of “outside in.” (However, plays with the
                  greatest lasting impact tend to be a combination of both these traditions, from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Death of a Salesman</em> to <em>Angels in America</em>.)

                           of Mind (Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 2002) that “either consciousness or materiality
                           is not really a choice. Inevitably, theater uses a both/and proposition of confronting
                           consciousness integrally through materialism rather than discretely through mystical
                           or spiritual channels” (41). I have borrowed the useful terms “bottom up” and “top
                           down” from his work.</span></div>

               <p>The dramatists of this lineage (loosely defined) were also deeply invested as theorists
                  of the theatre (or, put differently, this way of seeing theatre attracted theorists
                  who became dramatists to test their theories). We see this pattern very clearly in
                  the emergent Romantic theatre of the eighteenth century in Germany (e.g., in the work
                  of Lessing, Schiller, Tieck, and Kleist) and in early nineteenth-century England in
                  the staged theories of Joanna Baillie and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

               <p>In this drama course we examine some of the major dramatic texts that could be said
                  to make up a holy theatre tradition, with Coleridge’s <em>Remorse</em> (1813) and Baillie’s <em>Orra</em> (1812) representing Romantic drama.

                           been neglected), but the approach I outline in this essay could certainly be used
                           for an entire course on Romantic drama. Plays such as Manfred and Prometheus Unbound
                           obviously fit the paradigm of exploring consciousness. For this course I have chosen
                           to include Orra and Remorse because of their intriguing relationship to Shakespeare,
                           the Gothic, and the avant garde, and for the opportunities they present for examining
                           notions of “high” and “low,” “avant garde” and “popular.” They are also both included,

                  </div> Alongside these plays we read theatre theory and study developments in stagecraft
                  that allowed dramatists to explore subjective states onstage. In this context students
                  are encouraged to see Romantic drama as inspired by the vision and techniques learned
                  from Shakespeare’s plays (rather than weak imitations of Shakespeare), as a reworking
                  and transformation of the Gothic, and as the birthplace of the modern avant garde.
                  To many Romanticists this is going to look (suspiciously, perhaps) like the “old”
                  approach to Romantic drama—that is, Romantic drama as “mental theatre,” a label under
                  which it has not tended to fare well in criticism. However, when studied within the
                  lineage of holy theatre, Romantic drama can stand out as a peak—rather than a valley—in
                  the history of dramatic literature and theatre theory.

            <p>There are several tributaries of the master current of holy theatre: one focuses on
               pure form (we see this in the modernist avant garde in particular, e.g., in the theatrical
               experiments of Gertrude Stein and Wassily Kandinsky), another on myth and ritual (which
               points up the ancient origins of holy theatre, running from Euripides’s <em>The Bacchae</em> to Peter Shaffer’s <em>Equus</em>). In order to highlight the stream of holy theatre attempting the revelation of consciousness,
               this version of the course begins with Shakespeare’s “strategic opacity” and <em>Hamlet</em>, the Ur-text of the dramatic representation of consciousness.</p>
            <p>To Romantics and their followers, the conditions of the Elizabethan theatre (and the
               thereby conditioned Elizabethan audiences) were ideal because they drew upon the imagination,
               truly created a “theatre of the mind.” Those early modern audiences viewed a virtually
               bare stage with no external lighting (at the outdoor theatres such as the Globe, anyway);
               the language of the plays frequently remind them to imagine the scene that is being
               played out before them. Shakespeare’s eighteenth-century admirers developed a new
               form of literary criticism—“character criticism”—in response to the complexity and
               seeming humanness of his characters, and gave us the now-familiar figure of the natural
               genius Shakespeare who had discovered the secret to how to reveal interiority on the
               stage. A. W. Schlegel’s image from his 1808 lectures is a familiar one: Shakespeare’s
               characters are like “watches with crystalline plates and cases, which, while they
               point out the hours as correctly as other watches, enable us at the same time to perceive
               the inward springs whereby all this is accomplished” (“A Course of Lectures on Dramatic
               Art and Literature” 362). More recently, Stephen Greenblatt has echoed this language
               in <em>Will in the World</em> when he argues that Shakespeare “perfected the means to represent inwardness” (299)
               through the innovation of the soliloquy, in particular what Greenblatt refers to as
               “strategic opacity,” or a new technique of “radical excision” in which Shakespeare
               took out a “key explanatory element, thereby occluding the rationale, motivation,
               or ethical principle that accounted for the action that was to unfold” (323-24). Relying
               on “inner logic” rather than causal events, Shakespeare “fashioned an inner structure
               through the resonant echoing of key terms, the subtle development of images, the brilliant
               orchestration of scenes, the complex unfolding of ideas, the intertwining of parallel
               plots, the uncovering of psychological obsession” (324). Greenblatt’s Shakespeare
               is remarkably Romantic, and effectively introduces holy theatre dramaturgy; strategic
               opacity was “not only a new aesthetic strategy,” but “expressed Shakespeare’s root
               perception of existence, his understanding of what could be said and what should remain
               unspoken, his preference for things untidy, damaged, and unresolved over things neatly
               arranged, well made, and settled” (324).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Both <em>Hamlet</em> (1600-01) and <em>The Tempest</em> (1610-11) exhibit the Renaissance view of the world as a stage and faith in theatre
                  as a means of revealing truth. Thanks in large part to Romantic writers and critics—Goethe,
                  Lamb, Hazlitt, Coleridge—<em>Hamlet</em> has come to be considered a play about consciousness, and Hamlet the “prince of the
                  inward insurrection” (Greenblatt 303). When read as a foundational text of holy theatre,
                  what comes into focus are Hamlet's conversation with the Ghost and the unfolding of
                  Hamlet’s consciousness through the soliloquies, tracing the fluctuations of his mind
                  from his first appearance to Act V. The course then moves to <em>The Tempest</em>, which, among its dominant interpretations, can be seen as a play about the magical
                  power of theatre to bring about reconciliation and forgiveness. It also provides an
                  excellent entrance into Coleridge’s <em>Remorse</em>, as both plays use an act of magic, of dramatic illusion, to prick the conscience
                  of and draw remorse from a wayward brother.

                           which is similarly “hauntological” and includes an apparition as well as “living ghosts,”
                           characters who are, like Orra in the final scene of the play, psychologically haunted
                           and poised between death and life. Moreover, Strindberg’s desire for an intimate performance
                           space that could capture the nuances of his plays—which resulted in the founding of
                           the Intimate Theater in Stockholm in 1907—carries startling echoes of Baillie’s “…</span></div>

               <p>The main plotline of <em>Remorse</em> echoes themes in <em>The Tempest</em>; in both, an ambitious and rebellious younger brother (Antonio in <em>The Tempest</em>, Ordonio in <em>Remorse</em>) plots to kill a virtuous older brother (Prospero, Alvar) and sends that virtuous
                  brother into exile. (The differences can be illuminating to discuss. Prospero can
                  set up circumstances to awaken Antonio to his wrongdoing, but cannot ultimately transform
                  Antonio’s inner self; while Prospero expresses forgiveness in the end, Antonio does
                  not appear to express remorse.) In <em>Remorse</em>, while Alvar is gone (Ordonio had arranged to have him killed, and assumes him dead),
                  Ordonio tries to win over Alvar’s beloved, Teresa. She wants nothing to do with Ordonio,
                  and, anyway, is waiting with hope for Alvar’s eventual return, since his body has
                  never turned up. Ordonio designs a spectacular illusion to convince Teresa of Alvar’s
                  death: a glowing altar which will summon the image of the dead Alvar. Unbeknownst
                  to all (except the audience), Alvar is not dead; he had escaped the assassin and has
                  returned with a plot to awaken Ordonio to his evil deeds. Notably, this plan is <em>not</em> to seek revenge on Ordonio, but to bring him to remorse. Alvar manipulates the altar
                  trick, making it boomerang on Ordonio: the altar bursts into flames to reveal a picture
                  of the assassination attempt on Alvar, masterminded by Ordonio. Thus Ordonio realizes
                  (1) Alvar is still alive, and (2) he knows about the plot to kill him.</p>

                  <p><em>Remorse</em> (1813) is a reworking of an earlier revolution-oriented play entitled <em>Osorio</em> (1797) into a deeper, more psychological study of consciousness: the revision of title
                     alone gives us a clue. In <em>Remorse</em> Coleridge is staging a shift in consciousness, which brings about a change in conscience.

                              Jeffrey Cox points out that Coleridge's work, as one in the second wave of Gothic
                              popularity, reassesses the theme and can be read as a “culminating work in the Gothic
                              tradition” (30). Cox charts two major surges of Gothic drama, the first in the 1790s,
                              which Coleridge catches onto with Osorio (1797), the second hitting its peak in 1815,
                              which Coleridge anticipates with Remorse (1813). Cox links these two surges to political
                              issues surrounding the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, particularly the fall

                     </div> In the <em>Table Talk</em> jottings, Coleridge expressed a special fondness for <em>Remorse</em>: “the ‘Remorse’ is certainly a great favourite of mine,” he stated, “the more so
                     as certain pet abstract notions of mine are therein expounded” (II: 360). Exactly
                     what those pet abstract notions were was never explicitly stated, but reading <em>Remorse</em> within the communality that is characteristic of holy theatre illuminates the play
                     as a tragedy intended to wake not just the character Ordonio but the audience from
                     their dogmatic slumbers or wrongdoings and force them to confront the Otherness that
                     exists inside as well as outside themselves. As has been discussed in a number of

                     </div> in order to present this concept effectively, Coleridge drew upon the spectacular
                     stagecraft of the popular Gothic drama, which contradicts his theoretical writing,
                     where he finds the Gothic weak and even dangerous.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As a companion text, students can read “Letter II” of “Satyrane’s Letters”—included
                  in Chapter XXII of the 1816 <em>Biographia Literaria</em> but written in 1798—where Coleridge as much as accuses the Gothic theatre of inciting
                  terror. He found the self-reflection of Gothic drama dangerous on at least two counts.
                  The Gothic drama had a tendency merely to reflect, rather than to challenge, the selves
                  of the audience; the values often reflected an easy morality that kept the audiences
                  complacent and inert. Also a dangerous aspect of facile self-reflection, and a more
                  tempting one for Coleridge and others, was, as Jeffrey Cox notes in his discussion
                  of North's <em>The Kentish Barons</em>, that the emotions can be “more deeply rooted by reflection,” a feature much glamourized
                  in Gothic hero/villains. One ideally wants neither passive reflection nor the dangerous
                  inward turn to self-consciousness, both of which can result in fixation and a resistance
                  to change, but instead a self-consciousness which has its ultimate origin in a moral
                  relation to others and which develops dialectically in continual relation to others.
                  One way to break out of a potentially solipsistic cycle is to engage with others,
                  and for a writer, the stage is therefore an ideal medium. Coleridge was frustrated
                  with the limitations of the commercial stage of his day, but he knew that that was
                  the means through which to present such ideas visibly and publicly, and to reach the
                  widest audience for his ideas. As William Galperin points out in <em>The Return of the Visible in British Romanticism</em>, issues of the visible continually verge upon issues involving <em>community</em> (164) and, though Coleridge in his criticism may have occasionally demonstrated an
                  anti-theatrical bias, he reached for the visible to present the transformation of
                  a consciousness to and for a community. In <em>Remorse</em> he adapted the Gothic formula to his own purpose, and used the Gothic spectacle to
                  affect his audiences, as he advises in “Satyrane’s Letters,” “in union with the activity
                  both of [their] understanding and imagination” (XXII:437).</p>
               <p>The Drury Lane playbill for <em>Remorse</em> advertises all new sets, which, according to the dictates of the stage directions,
                  included “wild and mountainous” country scenery and a desolate cavern dripping with
                  water; the setting is the Spanish Inquisition, a remote and terror-ridden time. Coleridge
                  commissioned a score from Michael Kelly, who had composed the music for the most successful
                  of all Gothic dramas, Matthew Lewis’s <em>The Castle Spectre</em> (1797). As Paula Backscheider has noted, “Gothic drama used music in sophisticated
                  ways to engage the senses while subliminally both exercising and containing anxieties”
                  (173); it was as crucial to the play as scores are to film and, increasingly, theatre
                  today. The dramatic structure of the play, however, is focused on Ordonio's consciousness.
                  Coleridge wastes no time getting to his purpose; very little exposition is given before
                  Alvar declares that he has returned to confront his brother and “rouse within him
                  / REMORSE!” in order to “save him from himself” (I.i.18-19). Preparations begin at
                  once for the visible spectacle which will force upon Ordonio a cathartic experience,
                  described by Alvar as “the punishment that cleanses hearts” (I.ii.319)—remorse, rather
                  than revenge. This experience is designed to raise Ordonio's self-consciousness which
                  will in turn prick his conscience and force him to face his transgressions. The visual
                  elements are crucial: Alvar queries his servant Zulimez concerning what they need,
                  “Above all, the picture / Of the assassination—.” “—Be assured / That it remains uninjured,
                  Zulimez answers him (I.i.92-4). The spectacle will work in such a way, Alvar discloses
                  when alone, that “That worst bad man shall find / A picture, which will wake the hell
                  within him, / And rouse a fiery whirlwind in his conscience” (II.ii.172-74).</p>

                  <p>In order to understand how Gothic techniques can work to present onstage the awakening

                     audience—try staging the key scene of the play in your classroom. This is the moment
                     of the climactic trick that boomerangs on Ordonio, the overwhelming spectacle that
                     results in the first awakening of his conscience.

                              is that Ordonio (like Claudius) has been aroused to the point where he is conscious
                              that someone is working on him, and so he becomes watchful. He feels guilty, yes,
                              but only to the extent that, again, like Claudius, he is anxious to rid himself of
                              the external causes of his pain; in other words, he seeks to kill the “traitors” (Isidore,

                     elements were spared. Thomas Barnes’s review of the play (included in the <em>Broadview Anthology of Romantic Drama</em>) provides an eyewitness description: “the altar flaming in the distance, the solemn
                     invocation, the pealing music of the mystic song, altogether produced a combination
                     so awful, as nearly to overpower reality, and make one half believe the enchantment
                     which delighted our senses” (392). Barnes’s choice of words—“mystic,” “awful,” “overpower
                     reality,” and “half believe the enchantment”—are all central to the desired effect
                     of the holy theatre.</p>

               <p>In this exercise students will perform Act III, scene I of <em>Remorse</em>, recreating the Gothic setting for the “altar scene” in order to understand how the
                  stagecraft works to convey an experience of an awakening of consciousness. You will
                  need at least six actors to play Alvar, Ordonio, Teresa, Valdez, Monviedro, and a
                  few “familiars of the Inquisition” who act but don’t have speaking parts. Others can
                  create music “expressive of the movements and images” of the scene, play it according
                  to the stage directions, and sing the Chorus parts. A third crew can construct the
                  altar spectacle.</p>

                  <li class="item" id="d30e536">From the text, gather information about the stage setting and recreate this in your
                     classroom. For instance, Coleridge's stage directions call for <em>“a Hall of Armory, with an Altar at the back of the Stage”</em> and <em>“soft music from an instrument of Glass or Steel.”</em></li>

                  <li class="item" id="d30e543">The music should score their dialogue and action. Beginning at about III.i.62, a “voice
                     behind the scenes sings ‘Hear, sweet spirit’” during (the disguised) Alvar’s incantation
                     to raise up the soul of Alvar.</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e544">The goal of the altar spectacle is to awaken Ordonio’s consciousness, so the actor
                     playing Ordonio needs to convey a change over the course of the scene. In the early
                     stages of Alvar’s presentation, for instance, Ordonio still thinks that <em>he</em> is controlling the action, and comments that it would be a joy to see Alvar again.
                     Alvar then begins to unleash upon him a verbal barrage and throughout the scene addresses
                     his lines “still to Ordonio,” heedless of Valdez's interruptions, protesting this
                     assault, which culminates with the stinging “it gives fierce merriment to the damned,
                     / To see these proud men, that loath mankind, / At every stir and buzz of coward conscience,
                     / Trick, cant, and lie, most whining hypocrites!” Alvar then turns away, shooing him
                     “Away, away!” Then, like a director perfectly timing his dramatic effects, he orders,
                     “Now let me hear more music" (III.i.110-14).</li>
                  <li class="item" id="d30e548">Music cue: the stage directions read “The whole Music clashes into a Chorus.” The

                     on the altar takes fire suddenly, and an illuminated picture of Alvar's assassination
                     is discovered, and having remained a few seconds is then hidden by ascending flames.”</li>

               <p>Shelley’s sonnet “Lift not the painted veil” (1818) provides an effective lead-in
                  to this reading of <em>Orra</em> because holy theatre, like Orra herself, seeks to lift the painted veil, with often
                  (and necessarily) painful—or, as Artaud later famously phrased it, <em>cruel</em>—results. Baillie’s tragedy on <em>fear</em> in the <em>Plays on the Passions</em>, <em>Orra</em>’s dramaturgical concept is to show the progression of fear in Orra, which starts
                  in a somewhat playful fashion with the enjoyment of ghost stories, and ends in a terrible
                  madness; this aspect of the play takes precedence over the plotline about Orra’s resistance
                  to a forced courtship. <em>Orra</em> shows Orra’s internal state; the audience doesn’t physically see any ghosts, but
                  instead watches the actor playing Orra unveil her hauntedness, or, in other words,
                  react to fear.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Julie Carlson’s essay “Baillie’s <em>Orra</em>: Shrinking in Fear” (included in the recent collection <em>Joanna Baillie, Romantic Dramatist</em>) works well as a contemporary supplement to the play. Carlson proposes the idea that
                     “hauntology” rather than ontology describes our current being and time, and writes
                     that <em>Orra</em> is a haunted and haunting play; it is the exception rather than the rule in the <em>Plays on the Passions</em> and undermines Baillie’s usual emphasis on rational morality. Orra herself is a “spectral
                     subject” in the play (216), a position between the “twos” of binaries (much like Baillie’s
                     own unusual situation in Romanticism and theatre history—not yet acknowledged as a
                     truly “major” figure, yet too major to be “minor”).

                     </div> Like <em>Remorse</em>, <em>Orra</em> draws upon the conventions of the Gothic and of Romantic medievalism, and similarly,
                     the spectacle is utilized, Carlson argues, as a way of transporting us to a psychic
                     space of sensory perceptions—a “before-human” state that precedes meaning-making (217)—a
                     technique used in Artaud’s twentieth-century performance events that gave audiences
                     a “sensory overload” to break down their habitual rational responses. Gothic spectacle
                     provided “a way of exploring the psychological even before twentieth-century constructions
                     of it,” and “becomes linked to the internal state of the characters’ minds as authors
                     explore how individuals react in times of great stress,” Christine Colón explains
                     (xxiii). Furthermore, since the Gothic “compels an audience to derive pleasure from
                     fear,” it “clearly allies itself with the idea of the sublime”; and “for a playwright
                     like Baillie who desperately wishes to stir her audience members’ imaginations and
                     compel them to transform their lives, the spectacle of the Gothic sublime would have
                     been appealing. It had the potential to awaken audiences and cause them to act” (Colón

                     </div> (Both are excerpted in <em>The Broadview Anthology of </em> <em>Romantic Drama</em>.) As do the other dramatist-theorists in the holy theatre tradition, Baillie is writing
                     a manifesto: creating drama for a theatre that could be—that is, the theatre she wants
                     rather than the theatre she has. It is in the “Introductory Discourse” that Baillie
                     develops the idea for which she’s become best known, that of “sympathetic curiosity.”
                     She does not just make the point that we are curious about other humans, especially
                     when they are experiencing emotional trauma, but that we want to fix our eyes on the
                     manifestation of such trauma on their bodies and faces—to observe their <em>symptoms</em>, as it were. To take just one example that works well with teaching <em>Orra</em>, Baillie writes that one of the things humans are most curious about, yet most scared
                     of, are ghosts. “No man wishes to see the Ghost himself, which would certainly procure
                     him the best information on the subject, but every man wishes to see one who believes
                     that he sees it, in all the agitation and wildness of that species of terror” (359).
                     In other words, we are more interested in reactions to ghosts, in witnessing the experience
                     of having seen a ghost, than in the ghosts themselves. We are aware that it is rude
                     to stare at people, yet we have an overwhelming urge to watch people in distress:
                     “how sensible are we of this strong propensity within us, when we behold any person
                     under the pressure of great and uncommon calamity!” Out of courtesy we will turn our
                     eyes away, yet “the first glance we direct to him will involuntarily be one of the
                     keenest observation, how hastily soever it may be checked; and often will a returning
                     look of enquiry mix itself by stealth with our sympathy and reserve” (359). In short,
                     we enjoy staring at others who are experiencing emotional turmoil; while we restrain
                     ourselves, and offer merely expressions of sympathy, we covertly observe in minute
                     detail the features and physicality that indicate the person’s suffering. Such gazes
                     are inappropriate in polite society; however, our sympathetic curiosity is satisfactorily
                     aroused and exercised by attending the theatre. It gives spectators the opportunity
                     to vicariously steal into the closet—and into the mind—of another. For, as Baillie
                     writes, “there is, perhaps, no employment which the human mind will with so much avidity
                     pursue, as the discovery of concealed passion, as the tracing the varieties and progress
                     of a perturbed soul” (360).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The success of Baillie’s designs to allow audiences to trace the varieties and progress
                  of Orra’s perturbed soul depend heavily on the skill and style of the actors, and
                  thus it is no surprise that her script is filled with detailed prescriptions for gesture
                  and movement to convey the internal state of the character. Here, too, she is advocating
                  for a transformed, intimate theatre in opposition to the conventional performance
                  spaces of her day, which were growing ever larger; in “To the Reader” she writes that
                  the “department of acting that will suffer most under these circumstances, is that
                  which particularly regards the gradual unfolding of the passions, and has, perhaps,
                  hitherto been less understood than any other part of the art—I mean Soliloquy” (375).
                  The plays she is creating need actors who can exhibit “the solitary musings of a perturbed
                  mind” with “muttered, imperfect articulation which grows by degrees into words” or
                  “that rapid burst of sounds which often succeeds the slow languid tones of distress”
                  (375). These precisely observed descriptions remind us of what may be most remarked
                  upon about Baillie’s playwriting, in her own day as well as ours: her diagnostically
                  observant eye and analytic, “anatomical” dramaturgy. The reviewer from <em>Edinburgh Magazine</em> writes in 1818 (excerpted in the <em>Broadview Anthology of Romantic Drama</em>) that “no one” except Baillie ever thought of giving, in dramatic form, “an anatomical
                  analysis, a philosophical dissection of a passion” (381). Her plays work as a kind
                  of “microscope, by means of which she seems to think that she has brought within the
                  sphere of our vision things too minute for the naked intellectual eye” (381-2). The
                  reviewer thinks this is the “radical defect” of her plays, but today it is considered
                  perhaps her most brilliant endeavor, an innovative theatrical experiment.</p>
               <p>The names of Joanna Baillie and Constantin Stanislavski are rarely, if ever, linked,
                  but he too taught a form of anatomical observation, telling his students that, when
                  creating a role, they should first read the text carefully for the “physical truths”
                  about the character. The fame of American Method acting’s “inside out” approach has
                  obscured other ways of building characters and distorted part of Stanislavski’s original
                  teachings; he instructs his actors not to “truncate” the “inner line” of a role and
                  replace it with their own “personal line,” but to begin with the “physical life” of
                  the character, which is tangible. “The spirit cannot but respond to the actions of
                  the body, provided of course that these are genuine, have a purpose, and are productive,”
                  he explains (<em>Creating a Role</em> 149). Put differently, instead of the later Method acting technique of drawing on
                  the actor’s own emotional and sense memory, the actor was to take on the physical
                  stance, gestures, posture that signaled the emotional feeling of the character. By
                  putting oneself into the physical position, the emotion would follow.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the eighteenth century, the use of ritualized gestures and poses to convey specific
                     states of emotion had been made popular, codified in acting manuals that illustrated
                     the proper appearance of the gesture or pose and explained what each indicated. (This
                     often seems oddly nonrealistic to us. Similarly, in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
                     avant garde theatre, actors would strike archetypal poses, rather than move and pause
                     in the realistic manner that’s familiar to us now; these poses were meant to convey
                     certain emotional effects, indeed to heighten the emotional effect altogether.)

                     </div> The unveiling or revelation of a character’s internal state was a primary feature
                     of late eighteenth-century and Romantic acting theories; the matter of expressing
                     a character’s “passion” is considerably more complicated than having the actors constantly
                     emoting onstage, which would eventually result in a flattened-out performance and
                     not move the audience. To express internal states convincingly, performers developed
                     a number of techniques that included drawing upon their own memories, thoughts, and
                     emotions and transferring them to the character; focusing on communicating explicitly
                     the specific <em>shifts</em> of feeling of thought that a character experiences from one moment to the next; and
                     cultivating an attitude of sympathy among the triangle of character, performer, and
                     viewer by finding the vulnerability of the character and inviting the audience to
                     experience it. As we see featured in <em>Orra</em>, one way an actor would reveal the interiority of a character was by focusing on
                     the way the character <em>reacted</em> to the dramatic situation. As Jonathan Bate has written, the popular view among Romantic
                     theatre artists was that “the essence of human nature is to be found in reaction,
                     not action, and so it was that their performances were most intense at certain moments
                     of reflection” (“The Romantic Stage” 97).</p>

               <p>What did performing the gestures and actions feel like? Did you ever feel fear rising
                  in yourself simply from doing the physical gestures associated with a person feeling
                  fear? If so, when in particular did you feel it? Of Baillie’s descriptions of a person
                  becoming overwhelmed with fear, in what ways were they <em>accurate</em> and in what ways merely <em>literary</em>?</p>
               <p>How did others look when they played Orra? Which gestures or postures most effectively
                  conveyed fear? Which looked most outdated or stagy?</p>
               <p>The final scene of <em>Orra</em> makes a nice pairing with Strindberg's <em>The Ghost Sonata</em> (1907). Orra returns to the stage, completely mad, and tells her guardian Hughobert,
                  upon hearing the news that his son died, that “the damn’d and holy / The living and
                  the dead, together are / In horrid neighbourship. – ‘Tis but thin vapour, / Floating
                  around thee, makes the wav’ring bound” (V.ii.208-12). <em>The Ghost Sonata</em> also takes up the notion that the living and dead are in “horrid neighbourship” together,
                  with only the finest boundary between them, although it does so to more psychological
                  ends. In the second act’s famous “ghost supper,” the characters “look like ghosts”
                  and have been drinking tea together for twenty years, “always the same people, saying
                  the same things, or else too ashamed to say anything” (279). “God, if only we could
                  die! If <em>only</em> we could die!” the character named the Mummy cries (283). <em>Remorse</em> can be reintroduced at this point because it also pairs well with <em>The Ghost Sonata</em> when the characters seek to make Jacob Hummel (“Old Man” in the <em>dramatis personae</em>) awaken to his past evil actions and feel remorse for them. Like <em>Remorse</em> and <em>Orra</em>, <em>The Ghost Sonata</em> is rather Gothic and could profitably be brought into a discussion of distinctions
                  between “Gothic,” “Romantic,” “symbolist,” and “expressionist,” for the same elements
                  of stagecraft are alternately labeled “Gothic” when describing <em>Remorse</em>, <em>Orra</em>, and many other Romantic dramas and are thus often considered “low,” pandering to
                  the masses’ love of being surprised with special effects; or they are labeled “Romantic,”
                  “experimental,” or “avant garde,” and then considered “high art.”</p>

                  <p>When works of the modern avant garde are studied immediately after <em>Remorse</em> and <em>Orra</em>, the kinship with Romantic drama becomes clear in both the shared vision of theatre
                     and the stagecraft employed to realize it. As Peter Brook explains, the holy theatre
                     does not only <em>present</em> the invisible in drama, it “also offers <em>conditions that make its perception possible</em>” (56), such as theatrical spectacle, lighting, a use of ritualistic devices, dance
                     and movement, musical scores and other kinds of sound, and even, in some cases, smell.

                     whether labeled Gothic, Romantic, or Holy, are employed to lift or transcend reality.
                     Paula Backscheider writes in <em>Spectacular Politics</em>, in a discussion of <em>The Castle Spectre</em>, that Gothic playwrights who added the word “romance” to their titles “signaled their
                     freedom from the referential, veridical world of realist texts and allied themselves
                     with a highly symbolic art, often reaching for a higher reality or a deeper psychology”
                     (156). Theorists of the Gothic, Backscheider continues, have argued that the form
                     “is best distinguished by the experience its readers or spectators have, and it is
                     now widely accepted as an expression of dissatisfaction with the possibilities of
                     conventional literary realism” (156). This dissatisfaction leads to the modern avant
                     garde tendency to elevate mood over plot, or internal over external states, presaged
                     by Baillie’s work in particular.</p>

                     audiences conditioned to irony uncomfortable. Contemporary traces of holy theatre
                     are difficult to find; we see them more in rave music, light shows, art installations,

                     so changed the tenor of much of the aesthetic that when consciousness is examined
                     in contemporary performance, the tendency has been toward a deconstruction rather
                     than a search for universals and communality. An important response comes in the form
                     of Jill Dolan’s argument for “reanimating humanism (after we’ve deconstructed the
                     blind, transcendent universalisms it once espoused)” (163) and her conceptualization
                     of “utopian performatives” in <em>Utopia in Performance: Finding Hope at the Theater</em> (2005).</p>

               <p>Film is probably the most engaging and accessible contemporary porthole for entering
                  the realms of the holy theatre tradition. As Bert Cardullo notes of modernist avant-garde
                  plays, Romantic dramas would perhaps have been “better suited to the screen than to
                  the stage, assaulting as they did the theater’s traditional objectivity or exteriority
                  and its bondage to continuous time and space” (3). Film is a medium that has been
                  friendly to experiments with the concerns of holy theatre—consciousness, dream states,
                  alternative realities, magic—as can be seen in the popularity of films about consciousness,
                  such as Richard Linklater’s <em>Waking Life</em> (2001) and the documentary <em>What the Bleep Do We Know?</em> (2004), critical acclaim for Julian Schnabel’s evocation of human consciousness in
                  <em>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</em> (2007), the work of Michel Gondry (<em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> [2004], <em>The Science of Sleep</em> [2006]), and Christopher Nolan’s <em>Inception</em> (2010), to name just a few recent examples. A work like <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820), for example, seems to call out for a film adaptation (although the first
                  known staging, by the Rude Mechanicals theatre company in Austin, Texas, in 1998 would
                  challenge that statement. It was excellent.) While film lacks the communality in liveness
                  called for in holy theatre, it can conjure the images and experience of transcendence
                  that were desired onstage. Students probably bring a curiosity about the philosophical,
                  scientific, and psychological matters explored in these films, which may raise interest
                  in seeing how Romantic drama attempts to explore them, too, with the result that Romantic
                  drama is seen as relevant, even prescient, to our artistic concerns, and as a fertile
                  ground for theatrical experimentation.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Innes’s and Auslander’s descriptions may strike readers as very Romantic and therefore
               familiar, but some further clarification may be in order since the term “holy theatre”
               can be misleading and, for some, off-putting. It does not mean, for instance, a “religious”
               drama; indeed, much of Artaud’s and Grotowski’s work in the twentieth century (and
               Ibsen’s and Strindberg’s, for that matter) was considered sacrilegious, even blasphemous.
               Most theatre that meets the criteria I discuss in this essay is no longer given the
               label of “holy,” and a look at the scholarship of Christopher Innes is instructive
               for understanding why. His book <em>Holy Theatre: Ritual and the Avant Garde</em> (1981) was revised and updated in 1992 under the title <em>Avant Garde Theatre 1892-1992</em>. While the content and organization of the book remain much the same in the course
               of a little over a decade, he felt it necessary to change his title: the term “holy
               theatre” had apparently run its course. Did it seem hopelessly dated, a hangover from
               the 1960s, like “groovy” and “far out”? The clue is found in Innes’s initial definition
               of his book’s subject. In the 1981 <em>Holy Theatre</em> his introduction describes a number of qualities (e.g., exploration of dream states,
               interest in ritual) that the works of this master current of theatre share, and observes
               that “it is in light of these qualities that the term coined by Antonin Artaud is
               so apt: ‘the Holy Theatre’” (3). However, in 1993’s <em>Avant Garde Theatre 1892-1992</em>, following the same description of qualities, Innes remarks that “Antonin Artaud’s
               pretentious claim to a ‘Holy Theatre’—picked up by various avant garde artists . .
               . is revealing” (3). Perhaps there’s little talk of a holy theatre, then, because
               the idea (and the ideal?) of a holy theatre has become pretentious. It is considered
               affected, showy, claims more than it can actually demonstrate. This course is hoping
               to revive the term for its evocative power—or at least to revive an interest in this
               theoretical approach to theatre and its plays.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">William Demastes argues in <em>Staging Consciousness: Theater and the Materialization of Mind</em> (Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 2002) that “<em>either</em> consciousness <em>or</em> materiality is not really a choice. Inevitably, theater uses a both/and proposition
               of confronting consciousness integrally through materialism rather than discretely
               through mystical or spiritual channels” (41). I have borrowed the useful terms “bottom
               up” and “top down” from his work.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Theatre and consciousness studies have only grown more popular in recent years, alongside
               and as a result of the rise of cognitive sciences in humanities research. In addition
               to Demastes’s <em>Staging Consciousness</em>, see Ralph Yarrow, <em>Sacred Theatre</em> (2007) and Yarrow and Peter Malekin’s <em>Consciousness, Literature, and Theatre</em> (1997) as well as Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe’s <em>Theatre and Consciousness</em> (2005), <em>Performing Consciousness</em> (2010), edited with Per Brask, and his edited issue, “Drama and Consciousness,” for
               <em>Studies in the Literary Imagination</em> (34.2: Fall 2001). Within Romantic studies, Alan Richardson’s work is essential reading,
               from his 1988 <em>A Mental Theater: Poetic Drama and Consciousness in the Romantic Age</em> to his more recent <em>British Romanticism and the Science of the Mind</em> (2005) and <em>The Neural Sublime: Cognitive Theories and Romantic Texts</em> (2010).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">My argument is to incorporate Romantic drama into courses on drama (where it has long
               been neglected), but the approach I outline in this essay could certainly be used
               for an entire course on Romantic drama. Plays such as <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> obviously fit the paradigm of exploring consciousness. For this course I have chosen
               to include <em>Orra</em> and <em>Remorse</em> because of their intriguing relationship to Shakespeare, the Gothic, and the avant
               garde, and for the opportunities they present for examining notions of “high” and
               “low,” “avant garde” and “popular.” They are also both included, most conveniently,
               in Jeffrey N. Cox and Michael Gamer’s <em>Broadview Anthology of Romantic Drama</em> (2003).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

                  made visible, in which states of mind are explored onstage, and what is most prized
                  is not verisimilitude, mimesis, the staging and working out of a dramatic conflict,
                  psychological characterization, and dialogue on social issues, but instead the unveiling
                  of the hidden, the representation of internal states of mind and feeling, and symbolic
                  presentation of psychological issues. Furthermore, in these plays, language is used
                  at its height not for witty stichomythia, political speechifying, or ironic distancing,
                  but for the revelation of internal states, the representation of being, and startling
                  the audience into communal feeling. A charting of “peaks” and “valleys” might show
                  <em>Remorse</em>, <em>Orra</em>, <em>Manfred</em>, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, and <em>A Dream Play</em> as peaks, and <em>The Way of the World</em>, <em>A Doll’s House</em>, and <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> as valleys.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">My idea here is not to denigrate the plays in the new “valley”; I’ve deliberately
                  selected excellent, “classic” plays to point out the absurdity of doing so. It is
                  instead to question the idea of constructing a historical narrative of peaks and valleys,
                  “golden ages” and “dark ages.” Categorizing dramas by their affinities with parallel
                  “master currents,” grouping them by their primary concerns and the approaches to staging
                  those concerns (the “top down” and “inside out” versus “bottom up” or “outside in”
                  methods mentioned above) may prove a more effective method. </p> 
               <p class="noCount">One key reason Romantic drama has been seen as odd is because of the way theatre history
                  was produced and, later, reproduced in teaching. As Jacky Bratton has written, “the
                  continuing strength of the received way of reading theatre history can be gauged from
                  the difficulties critics, performers and historians still have when they attempt to
                  recuperate anything from the early nineteenth-century stage” (<em>New Readings in Theatre History </em>12). My long-range goal is to re-see dramatic history and encourage the reorganization
                  of courses in theatre history and dramatic literature. For instance, instead of the
                  standard two-semester survey that moves chronologically from the ancient Greeks to
                  the present, we could teach a course in two master currents of world drama, the “holy”
                  and the “rough,” to use Peter Brook’s terms, or the “top down” and “inside out” interest
                  in consciousness, versus the “bottom up” and “outside in” interest in social realism.
                  While the typical historical timeline reveals the dialectical development of theatre
                  and drama between “outside in” and “inside out” approaches, the “master currents”
                  approach avoids the conception of peaks and valleys, and may allow students to see
                  more clearly patterns of influence between particular playwrights and other theatre
                  artists, and of approaches to playwriting and theatre. Core differences on the <em>function</em> of drama and theatre come into focus, and this master current challenges some fundamental
                  assumptions of drama and theatre, such as whether there is even a natural relationship
                  between drama and the theatre—that a dramatic text is indeed intended expressly for
                  and only completed upon performance.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">For an argument similar to my own, see Jeffrey N. Cox’s discussion of Romanticism’s
                  “counter-theatre of ‘virtuality’” (177) in “The Death of Tragedy; or, The Birth of
                  Melodrama,” <em>The Performing Century: Nineteenth-Century Theatre’s History</em>, ed. Tracy C. Davis and Peter Holland (Hampshire and New York: Palgrave Macmillan,

               <em>The Ghost Sonata</em>, which is similarly “hauntological” and includes an apparition as well as “living
               ghosts,” characters who are, like Orra in the final scene of the play, psychologically
               haunted and poised between death and life. Moreover, Strindberg’s desire for an intimate
               performance space that could capture the nuances of his plays—which resulted in the
               founding of the Intimate Theater in Stockholm in 1907—carries startling echoes of
               Baillie’s “Introductory Discourse.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Jeffrey Cox points out that Coleridge's work, as one in the second wave of Gothic
               popularity, reassesses the theme and can be read as a “culminating work in the Gothic
               tradition” (30). Cox charts two major surges of Gothic drama, the first in the 1790s,
               which Coleridge catches onto with <em>Osorio</em> (1797), the second hitting its peak in 1815, which Coleridge anticipates with <em>Remorse</em> (1813). Cox links these two surges to political issues surrounding the French Revolution
               and Napoleonic Wars, particularly the fall of the Bastille and the fall of Napoleon.

               <em>Hamlet</em> in that the consequence is that Ordonio (like Claudius) has been aroused to the point
               where he is conscious that someone is working on him, and so he becomes watchful.
               He feels guilty, yes, but only to the extent that, again, like Claudius, he is anxious
               to rid himself of the external causes of his pain; in other words, he seeks to kill
               the “traitors” (Isidore, and the “sorcerer” [the disguised Alvar]) rather than experience
               fully the internal pain and attempt to alleviate it through conversion and reformation.
               However, others notice the experience he underwent, and become players in the process
               of forcing his essential confrontation with what he tried to do to Alvar, which finally
               occurs in V.i. Unfortunately, Ordonio has hardly begun to experience the pangs of
               true remorse when Alhadra and a band of Morescos enter and demand Ordonio's life in
               exchange for his murder of Isidore, a conclusion that comes far too quickly for many
               spectators (and readers) to feel the full impact of the remorse, and undercuts Coleridge’s
               apparent design.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               a larger number of articles, it seems, appears on Baillie, and Catherine Burroughs’s
               <em>Closet Spaces</em> (1997), Judith Bailey Slagle’s critical biography <em>Joanna Baillie: A Literary Life</em> (2002), and Thomas C. Crochunis’s edited collection of essays, <em>Baillie, Romantic Dramatist</em> (2004) have all been major contributions. Excerpts or complete versions of her “Introductory
               Discourse” have been anthologized for some time in collections of Romantic-era writing,
               particularly of women’s writing, e.g., <em>The (Other) Eighteenth Century</em> (1991) and <em>Women Critics 1660-1820</em> (1995), and in Peter Duthie’s edition of the 1798 <em>Plays on the Passions</em> (2001). However, she is not yet included in the major, much-used critical studies
               or anthologies of theatre theory or dramatic criticism such as Marvin Carlson’s <em>Theories of the Theatre</em>; Daniel Gerould’s <em>Theatre/Theory/Theatre</em> or Bernard Dukore’s <em>Dramatic Theory and Criticism</em>. She has been given a paragraph in the latest (tenth) edition of the standard textbook
               <em>History of the Theatre</em>, by Oscar Brockett and Franklin Hildy, but as a playwright, not a theatre theorist.
               Furthermore, while scholarship on Baillie has been impressive, it hasn’t yet penetrated
               drama scholarship deeply to show Baillie’s influence on the modern avant garde. For
               instance, one description of expressionist drama is not just that it is a highly subjective
               art form in which “internal acts become externalized,” but, more specifically, that
               the “drama becomes concentrated to a point of ‘pure’ emotion” (Innes, <em>Holy Theatre</em> 44, 45), an innovation of Baillie’s.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Sam Shepard told the cast of <em>Angel City</em>, one of his earliest experimental plays (written right before <em>Suicide in B Flat</em> and predating his turn to more naturalistic family dramas with <em>Curse of the Starving Class</em> and <em>Buried Child</em>): “Instead of the idea of a ‘whole character’ with logical motives behind his behavior
               which the actor submerges himself into, he should consider instead a fractured whole
               with bits and pieces of character flying off the central theme . . . . In other words,
               more in terms of collage construction or jazz improvisation” (105). See Don Shewey,
