				<p rend="noCount"> Use the following prompts to guide your thinking and writing. Be specific in your response, and cite direct
					quotations from the plays and/or reviews in-text parenthetically. Remember to write about a play or plays that could be integrated
					into your Researched Critical Analysis, if you can. </p>
				<list type="unordered">
					<item>We might read <name ref="BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</name>’s 1798 tragedy <emph>De Monfort</emph> as a
						problem play about mental illness or as an interiorized, psychological drama in which <name ref="BaillieJoanna"
							>Baillie</name> exaggerates the passion of “hatred” in order to show its consequences. Discuss the play as a case study in
						psychology or mental illness, with particular attention to how and why <name ref="BaillieJoanna">Baillie</name>
						inverts the period’s expectations of a gendered mentality in the context of codified descriptions of masculinity and
						femininity. </item>

					<item>We might read <name ref="BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</name>’s 1798 tragedy <emph>De Monfort</emph> as a play
						that challenges the heterosexual romance (fairy tale) plot with its motifs of incest and homoeroticism. How does <name
							ref="BaillieJoanna">Baillie</name>’s drama manipulate the Jane/De Monfort/Rezenvelt romance triangle? How do
						the Count and Countess Freberg function as the heterosexual comic foil to De Monfort and Rezenvelt? What might this “play on
						the passions” be exploring or challenging about the period’s expectations of courtship and marriage, the self-loathing
						generated by cultural expectations of heterosexuality? </item>

					<item>We might read <name ref="BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</name>’s 1798 tragedy <emph>De Monfort</emph>, as Daniel
						Watkins has, as a play about the waning aristocratic class’s resentment towards the emerging bourgeoisie at the end of the
						eighteenth century. This approach to the drama suggests that De Monfort’s hatred for Rezenvelt is generated by his own sense
						of loss of class privilege and his recognition that men like Rezenvelt will soon wield political and social power. Demonstrate
						how the play explores the issue of British class struggles displaced onto medieval Germany. </item>

					<item><name ref="BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</name>’s 1812 gothic tragedy <emph>Orra</emph> critiques the
						courtship/marriage contract of the early nineteenth century in its reworking of the conventional rescue (fairy tale) story as
						a nightmare, what Orra calls “dreadful waking.” How is <emph>Orra</emph> a drama about the “heroine’s” fear of her own
						sexuality (femininity) disguised as ignorance, darkness, and superstition? How is feudal romance and chivalry (St. Michael’s
						Eve) depicted to be as oppressive as the marriage contract? </item>

					<item><name ref="PurintonMarjeanD">Marjean Purinton</name> has argued that medical explanations for gendered diseases
						(such as hysteria and hypochondria) are rendered “science fictions” (fables) in the stagings of ghosts and the tellings of
						ghost stories in <name ref="BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</name>’s 1812 gothic tragedy <emph>Orra</emph>, a play
						about fear. Discuss the motif of hysteria and madness that is featured in the play. What does Orra’s thrill-seeking, vicarious
						scare, and gendered fear reveal about the emergent medical explanations of insanity at the beginning of the nineteenth
						century?</item>

					<item>We might read <name ref="BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</name>’s 1812 gothic tragedy <emph>Orra</emph> as a play
						about legitimacy. Who is the legitimate heir? Who is the culture’s (Suabian forest on the border of Germany and Switzerland)
						outlaw? Who has authority over Orra? What happens if Orra marries Theobald rather than Glottenbal? Why is Rudigere not an
						appropriate suitor for Orra? How might all this anxiety over medieval German legitimacy constitute anxiety about British class
						dissolutions during the early nineteenth century? How might all this anxiety over borders (geographical, sexual, familial)
						constitute early nineteenth-century British anxieties about the breaches of commercial and colonial borders?</item>

					<item>We might read <name ref="ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</name>’s 1814 tragedy
							<emph>Remorse</emph> as a play that explores the question of identity. How does this play deploy theatricality and
						disguise to examine the issue of identity? How does the play deploy gender-bending and gender slippages as a way of exposing
						how identity was in a major state of crisis? How does the play invert the conventional order of things in order to
						disassociate conventional meanings from their signifiers and identification from identity?</item>

					<item>As <name ref="CarlsonJulieAnn">Julie Carlson</name> has shown, the female characters in <name
							ref="ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</name>’s 1814 tragedy <emph>Remorse</emph> are
						problematic and complex. How is the newly emerging bourgeois woman (Teresa) held up as the feminine ideal? How does the play
						challenge Teresa as somehow missing the ideal mark? How might spectators and readers view Alhadra’s gender-bending
						characterization? Is the play fundamentally hostile towards women? Is <emph>Remorse</emph> a fundamentally misogynist
						tragedy?</item>

					<item>Like <name ref="CowleyHannah">Hannah Cowley</name>’s 1783 comedy <emph>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</emph>, <name
							ref="ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</name>’s 1814 tragedy <emph>Remorse</emph> is set in
						Spain. By 1814, however, the British “othering” of the East was an act of colonial privilege, and so <emph>Remorse</emph> uses
						its setting in more serious and sinister ways than the earlier comedy had. The conflict between Muslim Moors and Spanish
						Catholics depicted in the background of Coleridge’s play recapitulate cultural understandings of inferior/superior complexions
						articulated in the Black Legend, for example, of British conflicts with its colonized Near East and Far East subjects. How
						does <emph>Remorse</emph>, then, displace contemporary colonial issues onto the landscape of Spain in 1569? </item>

					<item>We can read <name ref="ShelleyPercyBysshe">P. B. Shelley</name>’s 1819 tragedy <emph>The Cenci</emph> as a
						family story, the story of a dysfunctional family, the story of familial abuse. But it is a family story that is hard to tell,
						as Beatrice discovers in her inability to name what has happened to her and her inability to describe what she is. Can
						Beatrice construct a survivor’s story, or does she lack the means? Is she grappling with bodily disgust that paralyzes her
						abilities to articulate what has happened and how she feels? Why does she insist that she is innocent? Discuss the ways in
						which the tragedy dramatizes the limitations of language and how Beatrice has to find agency in other venues than language and
						speech. </item>

					<item>We can read <name ref="ShelleyPercyBysshe">P. B. Shelley</name>’s 1819 tragedy <emph>The Cenci</emph> in a
						performative context. After all, <name ref="ShelleyPercyBysshe">P. B. Shelley</name> (with the help of Mary
						Shelley’s translation) is rehearsing the actual story of Beatrice Cenci in dramatic form. But in the drama, is Beatrice ever
						herself or does she perform the identity and the role of others around her? Is her conduct modeled on her own sense of
						morality, or does she adopt Cenci’s methods in her design to play the “avenging angel”? Does she assimilate patterns of
						behavior from the assassins? Does she absorb the role of the Judge and Cardinal Camillo? How does she act in the presence of
						Lucretia? Does Beatrice try to replace her departed mother? Discuss the theatricality and performativity in <emph>The
							Cenci</emph>.</item>

					<item>We can read <name ref="ShelleyPercyBysshe">P. B. Shelley</name>’s 1819 tragedy <emph>The Cenci</emph> as a play
						about madness and criminality at multiple levels in Italian society in 1599. What does the tragedy reveal about the hegemony
						of the male public body as the seat of authority? What happens to religious and civil order when there is no justice, no
						checks and balances? Is parricide more criminal than incest? Is Francesco Cenci more of a “mad” monster than Beatrice Cenci?
						Have the assassins gone mad? How are we to feel at the end of the play? </item>

					<item>Devise your own writing prompt, especially one that brings one or more of these tragedies into discussion that will benefit
						you in your work on the Critical Analysis. You may also wish to discuss more than one play from the perspective of any of the
						prompts I have constructed. </item>
