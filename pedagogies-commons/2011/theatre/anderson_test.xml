            <p>This essay addresses two questions that motivated the design of my new graduate
               seminar: why I extended the survey to include romantic drama, and why I believe
               romantic drama is particularly suited to a discussion of the pedagogical process. In
               the introduction to <title level="j">Romantic Pedagogy Commons</title>, the editors
               explain that <quote rendition="#indent2">this journal presents articles about how
                  teaching works. Occasionally, in an essay about teaching, the writer of the essay
                  will say, 'Then I get students to see that . . . .' Sometimes whatever follows the
                  'that' is in fact less significant than what has been elided. What's missing is an
                  answer to the question, HOW? How do you get students to see what you see in a
                  text? (<ref target="people.html#MandellLaura">Mandell</ref>)</quote><lb/> This apt
               observation underlines that, when we teach or talk about our teaching, it is much
               easier to focus on our goal, <emph>what</emph> we want to teach our students, than on
               the process by which we achieved that goal. Pedagogy defies definition, in part
               because our teaching truly is a performance—scripted to a certain extent, but
               dependent on mood, on audience, on time—and so bounded by the rules of performance.
               Our teaching can never be repeated exactly the same way each time we do it, and the
               act of teaching is always slipping determinedly into the past. We emerge from a good
               class, or a bad one, with a record of what we have conveyed yet only a memory of how
               we have done so.</p>
            <p>Of course, none of these factors mean that we cannot discuss how we teach (only
               why these discussions are difficult), and I have always found that teaching drama
               gives me a model for how to reflect on my own teaching practice. Teaching a genre
               contingent upon performance reminds me that we cannot understand "what" without
               talking about "how." Teaching drama trains me to comprehend theory and practice
               simultaneously, and as a result I'm more ready to bring this approach to the subject
               of teaching itself. But recently, as I began to work more with those plays classified
               as "romantic dramas," I discovered that drama could be more than a model. Romantic
               drama in particular seems interested in how theatrical practice works as a
               pedagogical strategy, so that the "what" these plays are all about becomes the "how"
               that we as scholars and teachers tend to efface. For instance, when <ref
                  target="people.html#PurintonMarjeanD">Marjean D. Purinton</ref> presents the
               metatheatrics of <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref>'s
               comedy <title level="m">The Tryal</title> as "a pedagogical strategy offering women
               an alternative relationship to power" (133), her statement suggests the point of the
               play rests not just in what women are taught, but in the method by which women are
               taught it: through theater. This focus then reflects metatheatrically on the function
               of <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</ref>'s play, such that
                  "<title level="m">The Tryal</title> makes its own pretense as theatre ironically
               powerful as a teaching tool" (<ref target="people.html#PurintonMarjeanD"

            </p>
            <p>So what should romantic drama teach us? "The Drama improves us by the knowledge
               we acquire of our own minds, from the natural desire we have to look into the
               thoughts, and observe the behaviour of others," <ref
                  target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref> states in the introductory
               preface to her <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title> (90). <ref
                  target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref> here seems to outline first a
               method and then a goal: by observing the "varieties of the human mind," by "examining
               others," we may in turn "know ourselves" ("Preface" 76, 74). Both her choice to write
               drama and her insistence that her plays were intended for the stage make sense in
               light of these methods, as the observation and examination of others would seem to be
               best fulfilled in the embodied realm of performance ("Preface" 108-9).<note
                  place="foot" resp="editors" n="1">Despite the vexed performance history of her
                  plays, <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref> insists she wrote
                  them to be performed. According to <ref target="people.html#BurroughsCatherineB"
                     >Catherine Burroughs</ref>, the playwright's stated intention disqualifies her
                  plays as "closet dramas." I'm citing <ref target="people.html#BurroughsCatherineB"
                     >Burroughs</ref>' talk "The Persistence of Closet Drama: Theory, History,

                     rendition="#sup">th</hi>, 2006. </note> But because of these methods, the
               "what" these plays are supposed to teach us—to know ourselves, to know our own
               minds—is a quantity always to be discovered, contingent as it is upon the infinite
               varieties and behaviors we can observe. More properly, <ref
                  target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref> is invested in teaching method:
               we learn from her plays <emph>how</emph> to know ourselves. When studied from this
               perspective, these plays reveal that self-knowledge, the pedagogical "goal" of <ref
                  target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref> and many other romanticists, is
               itself a process far more than a precept. And when studied from this perspective,
                  <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref>'s plays allow us to have
               methodologically oriented discussions that reflect more generally on the practice of
               teaching, itself. </p>
            <p>The links between subjectivity and pedagogy in the romantic period run wide and
               deep, and my graduate seminar builds to these links by situating <ref
                  target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref>'s plays at the end of a
               historical survey of drama. The survey has a practical function—my class is perhaps
               the only course in eighteenth-century literature that my graduate students will take,
               and I feel responsible for providing coverage—but it has an intellectual purpose as
               well. I want my students to experience the liminal moments in literary history, to
               make connections among literary periods sometimes presented as distinct. The survey
               format also means that, by the time we reach romantic drama, we can discuss why plays
               that reflect on the pedagogical benefits of performance are also suited to explore
               the issues of subjectivity and self-knowledge with which they engage.</p>
            <p>The stated rubric of my course is that eighteenth-century plays depict identity
               as both metaphorically and literally theatrical. Our readings from the eighteenth
               century, texts from <title level="m">The Rover</title>, to <title level="m">The
                  Beggar's Opera</title>, to <title level="m">The Belle's Stratagem</title>,
               illustrate that an awareness of actual theatrical practice informs the way characters
               stage their identities in the "offstage" regions of these plays. I want students to
               think about how these observations resonate in provocative ways with contemporary
               theories of gender and identity construction, and I also want students to think about
               how current scholars are using terms from theater history in more theoretical ways. I
               therefore pair our primary readings for each week with a specific keyword, taken from
               theater / performance / gender studies, that reinforces in some way with the themes
               of the text. Every student must choose one such word, research its theatrical and
               theoretical applications, and share a brief essay on their findings with the class.
               Keywords range from "ritual," to "masquerade," to "spectacle." By the time we get to
               "performativity," students recognize that we have already been using the word, in its
               current theoretical sense of acts or behaviors that construct the state of being they
               purport to express, to describe many acts of theatrical performance explored within
               these eighteenth-century plays. For example, we discuss the way a comedy such as <ref
                  target="people.html#CowleyHannah">Hannah Cowley</ref>'s <title level="m">The
                  Belle's Stratagem</title> explores the idea of pre-existing social roles by having
               its title character move through a series of different and overtly theatrical roles
               onstage. These connections between "performativity" and "performance" (and I have the
               presenting student read at least the introduction to the <ref
                  target="people.html#ParkerAndrew">Parker</ref> and <ref
                  target="people.html#SedgwickEveKosofsky">Sedgwick</ref> collection of essays on
               this topic) encourage us to read the ideas about subjectivity considered in these
               plays in terms of evolutions—or continuities—in theatrical practice. I then pair our
               final keyword, "theatricality," with <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna"
                  >Baillie</ref>'s <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title>, so that students
               will question the closeted nature of her plays and discuss to what extent
               theatricality can still characterize texts that are not actively performed. </p>
            <p>Thus, as we move into our romantic plays and challenge their delineation as
               "closet dramas," we also create the potential for more continuity between
               eighteenth-century and romantic conceptions of subjectivity than is currently
                  assumed.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">

                  who have helped trouble the delineation "closet drama." </note> Dror Wharman's
               recent book <title level="m">The Making of the Modern Self </title>offers one version

                  target="people.html#WahrmanDror">Wahrman</ref> argues that "selfhood" in the short
               eighteenth century (the version of the century that eschews the romantic period) was
               understood as something Protean, superficial, something <ref
                  target="people.html#WahrmanDror">Wahrman</ref> calls "socially turned" (168). Not
               until the end of the century, he claims, did identity come to be understood as
               something more essentialist and interior—the romantic idea of the self.<note
                  place="foot" resp="editors" n="3"> For <ref target="people.html#WahrmanDror"
                     >Wahrman</ref>, "identity" and "self" become interchangeable in the later
                  eighteenth century, as the point at which "identity became personal, interiorized,
                  essential, even innate." Once identity is something internalized, "it was made
                  synonymous with self" (276). </note> Yet <ref target="people.html#WahrmanDror"
                  >Wahrman</ref> mistakenly invokes eighteenth-century theater as illustrative of,
               even responsible for, this shift. He claims that "the [eighteenth-century] actor…was
               expected to believe in his own actual metamorphosis in order to achieve the ideal
               dramatic effect," so that if an eighteenth-century audience witnessed an actress in a
               breeches part, it would read the performance as indicative of "a playful splitting of
               identity, a splitting literal rather than metaphorical" (172, 176). Contrary to <ref
                  target="people.html#WahrmanDror">Wahrman</ref>'s assertions, the necessary
               identification of an actor with his or her part was in fact the subject of much
               debate in the eighteenth century, as our reading from Diderot's <title level="m"
                     ><foreign>Paradoxe sur le comédien</foreign></title> makes clear. At the same
               time, our dramatic readings showcase characters who do identify with the theatrical
               roles they adopt, but for very different reasons, and with very different results,
               than the ones <ref target="people.html#WahrmanDror">Wahrman</ref> suggests. Many of
               our plays include characters who adopt parts and put on roles, not always in an
               effort to reinvent themselves (<ref target="people.html#WahrmanDror">Wahrman</ref>),
               nor with the ability or desire to retain some theatrical detachment from the role
               they take up (Diderot), but in a conscious effort to convey sentiments that would
               otherwise be inexpressible. <ref target="people.html#CowleyHannah">Cowley</ref>'s
               Letitia Hardy fits into this characterization, as do <ref
                  target="people.html#BehnAphra">Behn</ref>'s Hellena and <ref
                  target="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</ref>'s Kate Hardcastle. As these
               characters flit from persona to persona, their roles are connected by a consistent,
               self-defining emotion that the various roles allow them to convey. Indeed, the <ref
                  target="people.html#GoldsmithOliver">Goldsmith</ref> and <ref
                  target="people.html#CowleyHannah">Cowley</ref> heroines make students think back
               to Eliza Haywood's heroine Fantomina, the titular character from one of the few
               non-dramatic pieces we read. In all these cases, the theatrical "splittings of
               identity" emerge as a characteristic performance strategy that creates a link, not
               simply a gap, between self and persona, with a relationship between the two that is
               not necessarily deceptive. </p>
            <p>The eighteenth-century "self" seems much less Protean in this context, much
               less superficial, and much more associated with the sense of coherence and
               interiority that accompanies later romantic models of subjectivity. By the same
               token, these characteristics of romanticism emerge as a continuation of, not a
               deviation from, the ideas about subjectivity embodied on the eighteenth-century
               stage. Yet within this continuum any sense of interiority is constructed by the
               reiteration of theatrical acts, a rather un-romantic revision of essentialism.
               Imagine, for instance, how a student coming from a survey of eighteenth-century plays
               would read the following passage from <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna"
                  >Baillie</ref>'s tragedy <title level="m">De Monfort</title>, the moment at which
               Lady Jane De Monfort has tracked her conflicted brother to his friend Count Freberg's
               residence. Desperate to learn why De Monfort has fled their home, Jane takes
               Freberg's advice and veils herself, so that she may accost her brother while her own
               identity is obscured: <quote rendition="#indent2"><lg>

                  </lg></quote><lb/> Jane's conduct in this passage is at once theatrical and
               experimental, as she dons a mask in an attempt to assess "the temper of [her
               brother's] mind" (2.1.104). But the effect of Jane's disguise is surprising, for it
               prompts De Monfort to compare her to the person she actually is. Her face, behind
               those sable folds, <emph>is</emph> exactly as fair as the face that De Monfort
               imagines, her kindly deeds measure up precisely to the obligations her brother
               praises. Jane's disguise also means she belies herself when she claims "all sisters
               are not to the soul entwin'd / with equal bands." The sisters she describes are
               actually only one sister, the bands she describes exactly equivalent. All sisters
               conflate within her sable folds, so that De Monfort when confronted with her veil may
               see—correctly—the sister of whom he speaks. </p>
            <p>Her performance says much about the evolution and nature of romantic
               subjectivity. First, students will recognize that Jane takes her cue from a slew of
               earlier dramatic heroines. Like Letitia's or Fantomina's acts of disguise, Jane's
               masking becomes an expressive not an obfuscating act, and De Monfort would be better
               served by taking her at face value than by seeking to see something different beneath
               her veil. But Jane's veil is expressive in that it is evocative of the self upon
               which it is layered. The theater's use of costumes and vizards provides a physical
               source for the metaphorical layering that occurs in theatrical presentation, so that
               as theatrical presentation provides a surface, it simultaneously suggests an element
               of depth. Theatrical performance becomes an efficacious form of expression in this
               scene as it offers up the very surfaces that reinforce a subject's depth and
               dimensionality; selfhood in this model remains internalized, even as its interiority
               is perpetuated by the theatrical acts that confirm it. </p>
            <p>Jane's masquerade also has a clear teaching purpose that reinforces this
               reading of subjectivity as consistently multi-layered. She may speak as a sister in
               this scene only because she is veiled, and thus only because De Monfort assumes he is
               not the brother of whom she speaks. She may express her familial feelings precisely
               because they are articulated during a performance, which suggests that even when the
               masks characters don are expressive and not obfuscating the interiority-producing
               layer of the mask is essential to maintain. Furthermore, it is crucial to De
               Monfort's reaction that he be "caught up in the act" without quite knowing that he
               has become so. Jane's theatrical display encourages in her brother neither catharsis
               nor even vicarious sympathy. De Monfort experiences something more psychoanalytic, as
               the act of witnessing Jane's performance brings his own latent passions to the
               surface and forces him to come to terms with them.<note place="foot" resp="editors"

                  sufferer," to gain some sense of <emph>his</emph> torments, <ref
                     target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref> asserts that "in examining
                  others we know ourselves" (74). </note>
            </p>
            <p>Yet performance becomes pedagogical only under specific conditions. As the
               wronged sister, Jane consciously adopts a role that communicates her own feelings.
               She performs her part with an unexpected emotional honesty, and her ultimate
               influence over her brother derives from the fact that she is not only like the sister
               of whom she speaks, but she is the sister herself. De Monfort, on the other hand,
               does not know he is participating in a performance until Jane unmasks. In <ref
                  target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref>'s play, acts of performance shift
               from entertaining to instructive when they are crafted so that their specific
               didactic purpose is somewhat obscured, and so that the intended student audience (in
               this case, De Monfort) is at least temporarily unaware of the scene's crafted
                  nature.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="5"><ref

                  illustrate this concept, though we do not have time to read them in my class.
               </note> For the typical theater audience tucked safely behind a fourth wall, the
               conditions of performance are both more apparent and less interactive. Yet by
               incorporating models of pedagogical performance within themselves, plays like <title
                  level="m">De Monfort</title> reflect suggestively on their own pedagogical
               function. Indeed, by framing pedagogical moments within the play as covertly
               didactic, the play reclaims its own generic conventions as advantageous to its
               didactic project. The broader convention of the stage, which seems to require that
               the theater audience observe yet not participate in the dialogues they witness, also
               insists that the play's pedagogical claims on its external audience be at least
               temporarily disguised. (In this model, <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna"
                  >Baillie</ref>'s "Introductory Discourse" becomes akin to the explication of
               Jane's unmasking.) The theater audience thus shares a position with DeMonfort, as
               both are unaware of exactly how they are engaged and implicated in the didactic
               project of the performance before them, while this temporary suspension of awareness
               is encouraged by and crucial to the pedagogical program outlined within the play
               itself. </p>
            <p>In the classroom, we are much more attuned to the fact that we are teaching or
               being taught, though here too we can be subtle about how our goals are advertised or
               achieved. For instance, I publicize my graduate course as a course on "staging
               identity," though my publicized interest in subjectivity and my closeted interest in
               pedagogy ultimately align. A tenet that remains consistent among rationalist and
               romantic ideas of education alike is that the preceptor is not a dictator so much as
               a guide (<ref target="people.html#RichardsonAlan">Richardson</ref>). The student must
               learn how to learn; they must, as <ref target="people.html#EdgeworthMaria">Maria
                  Edgeworth</ref> puts it, learn to "think and reason for [themselves]" (297). The
               educator in this model does not disseminate facts so much as lead students toward
               personal discoveries, so that students have for themselves the experience of proving
               theorems, of testing precepts. And for the student—be he a doctoral candidate or the
               tormented De Monfort—to learn from experience, he must be able to react to a staged
               circumstance with his own emotions. The good teacher both creates and obscures the
               conditions that enable this emotional reaction to occur. In other words, teaching,
               when done well, obscures its scripted nature.</p>
            <p>What I have learned, then, in teaching romantic drama is that students need
               guidance, but that they also need to reach conclusions on their own. In the case of
               my graduate seminar, they need to experience for themselves the instructive,
               constructive relationship of performance to subjectivity. So in addition to having my
               students attend productions of <ref target="people.html#BrechtBertolt">Bertolt
                  Brecht</ref>'s <title level="m">The Threepenny Opera</title> and a dramatic
               adaptation of <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> (which the USC School of
               Theatre very conveniently scheduled to overlap with my seminar), I have my class
               conclude with a student performance that coincides with their final reading
               assignment in Austen's novel <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>. As a class,
               they must agree upon one scene from all the plays we have read, cast the actors,
               decide on whatever props will be necessary, and rehearse to whatever extent they see
               fit. The preparation for the assignment asks them to review the plays and themes from
               throughout the semester, but it also asks them to mimic the process of decision and
               rehearsal that frames <title level="m">Mansfield Park's</title> controversial home
               theatricals. We have shared an experience with the Crawfords and the Bertrams and
               should never read the novel in quite the same way, again.</p>
            <p>More specifically, the actual staging gives us a chance to discuss how
               performance intensifies one's experience of a scene and why performance, in the
               nineteenth-century context of Austen's novel, might be considered risky. As we
               discuss, Fanny's discomfort with the playacting in the novel responds on some level
               to the fact that Austen's characters pair off in a manner that reflects their real
               life affections, so that the rehearsals become a chance to act on the flirtatious
               impulses that might otherwise be kept in check. And as the strategic space between
               actor and role is lost, the personal expressions of these actors—more than
               theatricality itself—become the subject of Austen's critique. </p>
            <p>So unlike <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna">Baillie</ref>'s play, in
               which the assumed discrepancy between actor and role provides Jane De Monfort the
               space and opportunity for self-expression, Austen's novel depicts an unmediated
               understanding of performance, and the theater in this novel is disbanded exactly when
               it has become recognized as an expressive more than a performative space. But as we
               approach this novel at the end of our survey of texts, and concurrent with our own
               attempts to choose and enact roles, we find ourselves discussing expression and
               performativity as dialectical, not antithetical, concepts. Our historical survey
               shows us instead that what varies from play to play is not the project of the
               theater, so much as the audience sensitivity towards one or the other potential of
               theatrical performance and, correspondingly, an author's manipulation of this
               sensitivity through his or her framing of the act of performance itself.</p>
            <p>Yet by ending our seminar with a novel, we also end with a question: if
               performance and the associated behaviors of observation and participation were so
               crucial to a romantic program of education, why is it that the novel and the closet
               drama (genres that do not require performance) become the dominant genres for
               conveying pedagogy? The rise of the novel in all its didactic glory is something
               critics acknowledge, and this is a genre we discuss at least briefly in our class. I
               also want to mention here the plethora of "academic dramas" that marked the end of
               the century, the proliferation of dramatic dialogues that were seen as "lesson[s] in
               the guise of play[s]" though plays that were never meant to be performed.<hi
                  rend="sup">
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors" n="6"> The term "academic dramas" is from Marta
                     Strazinicky, 426; the quoted phrase is from Hannah More's closet drama <title

                     For examples of these "lesson[s] in the guise of play[s]," see (among others)

               </hi> Why does pedagogy become increasingly associated with the closet drama,
               increasingly detached from actual performance? </p>
            <p>This shift reveals, I believe, that the key to romantic pedagogy is not
               embodiment, per se, but mediated experience: physical observation or interaction is
               ultimately less crucial to romantic pedagogies than the notion that <hi
                  rend="underline">we learn about ourselves through others</hi>. This claim offers
               an alternate reading of romantic drama, one that reveals the pedagogical potential of
               theater to rest in more than just its ability to encourage audience observation of
               embodied roles. If we go back to <ref target="people.html#BaillieJoanna"
                  >Baillie</ref>'s play, we see that Jane's physical presence is actually less
               important to De Monfort's epiphany (indeed, he does not know that Jane is present)
               than the means by which she communicates with her brother: from behind a mask, and by
               directing her explanation for the mask—not to her brother, for whom both mask and
               explanation are clearly meant—but to Count Freberg, the very man who advocated the
               disguise. In this scene, Jane highlights a key component of all playacting, and a
               characteristic of theatricality: not embodiment, but mediation. The act of acting is
               by definition the act of conveying ideas or thoughts via intermediate roles. And yet,
               on the stage this process is often all too overt, especially if the theatrical nature
               of a performance must be obscured for it to function in a pedagogical manner. Closet
               drama (and, I would argue, a novel such as <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>,
               which juxtaposes its own generic conventions to the current unmediated conventions of
               the Bertram's theater) interrupt what <ref target="people.html#PuchnerMartin">Martin
                  Puchner</ref> calls the "unmediated theatricality of the stage" (22). The closet
               drama insists that the theatrical process itself be mediated; paradoxically enough,
               it restores the theatricality to drama and thus drama's pedagogical potential.</p>
            <p>I therefore believe that romantic drama can teach us much about teaching and
               even more about why we teach literature, of any genre or period. As students,
               teachers, and lovers of books—a body of people who often struggle to define the value
               of theorizing about imaginary heroines, dead authors, and subjective readings—we
               learn from romantic drama to focus on the benefits, indeed the necessity, of learning
               about ourselves through others. Additionally, these plays remind us that teaching is
               not about a set of definitions but about shared methods, experiences, and a
               collective process of discovery. We are passionate about what we read and teach
               because we have felt the benefit of emotional and intellectual engagement with what
               we read and teach. And we know that literature, as that which provides such an
               experience, can teach us something about ourselves. </p>
