				<p n="2">As an introduction to the drama of 1780-1830, with emphasis on production and performance, English 97H: <emph>Romantic Drama.
					Production and Performance</emph>, includes practice in acting styles of the period (gesture, elocution, delivery), historical theater
					construction, period costumes, and stage design. Although a large number of theater majors, music majors, and English majors turn
					out, auditions are open to all students. They are asked to prepare a monologue, a song, and to provide a “cold” reading of a
					dramatic passage. In selecting the play to be performed each year, the primary concerns are to find a play that will challenge
					student abilities, that will be accessible to our audiences, that will be rich in historical relevance, and that will depict the
					temper and tastes of the period. Because the theater of the period is musical theater, there is also the difficulty of securing a
					musical score. Many productions relied on interpolated songs, and even where full scores exist, those score were often altered
					with changes in the cast from one season to the next. Obviously the music, then as now, had to suit the abilities of the cast.</p>
				<p n="3">As offered during the Winter Quarter (January through March) 2006, the course actually began with enrollment/auditions at the
					end of November in the preceding term. The course description was also the call to auditions.<note place="foot" n="3"

					and the libretto by <name ref="CobbJames">James Cobb</name> (1756-1818). Opening at <name

					<title level="m">The Haunted Tower</title> provides an excellent example because of its particularly rich fabric of historical,
					social, theatrical, and musical issues. Having in previous years directed <name ref="InchbaldElizabeth">Elizabeth
						Inchbald</name>’s <title level="m">Animal Magnetism</title> and <name ref="CowleyHannah">Hannah Cowley</name>’s
						<title level="m">A Bold Stroke for a Husband</title>, I was ready to prompt students to give special attention to disguise and
					role-playing as a dramatic means of exposing prejudicial assumptions about gender, class, and national character. <title level="m"
						>The Haunted Tower</title> proved a good choice both pedagogically and dramatically, providing insight into social issues,
					political tensions, national and international turmoil. The representation of English-French relations on the very eve of the
					Revolution would, in itself, amply justify the focus on <title level="m">The Haunted Tower</title>. The fact that it is also a
					play adapted from the French of the <name ref="Sademarquisde">Marquis de Sade</name> for performance on the English
					stage gives it an added dimension of political complexity.</p>

					<p n="8">During the Fall term I set to work with the necessary adaptations. First, I turned to <name
							ref="HolmesBrian">Brian Holmes</name> (San Jose State University) to adapt the musical score for performance
						by a chamber ensemble (violin, viola, flute, keyboard) rather than a full orchestra. Brian also provided an additional song
						for a scene that had been omitted by <name ref="CobbJames">Cobb</name> (“My love is not a problem” II.vi). This
						song is sung by a tax collector, whom two young ladies are trying to persuade to enter the Haunted Tower (“Attune the pipe”
						II.vi). The first week began with discussion of plot, character, and acting styles, and many improvisation exercises in period
						acting accompanied scene by scene blocking of the play. For the first several weeks vocal rehearsals were held separate from
						acting rehearsals, but because this production is so extensively musical, the two had to be integrated by the fourth week.
						Additional time was required for vocal rehearsals right up to the time of performance at the end of the eighth week. For our
						final dress/tech on Thursday, March 1, we had the benefit of an exclusive audience of specialists: <name

					<p n="9">The great advantage of utilizing performance and production in teaching Romantic Drama is that the students learn the
						material literally from the inside out. They gain an understanding of the language, the acting, and the music that mere
						reading cannot provide. With this particular play, the students were made aware of gender issues, as well as national tensions
						(French vs. English) and social tensions (aristocracy vs. lower classes) that prevailed during the period. As the only work of
						the <name ref="Sademarquisde">Marquis de Sade</name> to be performed on the London stage during his own lifetime,

						to the Baron’s estate, “plain Edward the ploughman” introduces his beloved Adela, a cottager, into court disguised as Lady
						Elinor. Meanwhile, to avoid the unwanted marriage, Lady Elinor pretends to be her own maid-in-waiting and Lord William passes
						himself off as a court jester. As jester, Lord William mocks the false Baron, who can only pretend to sexual attraction and
						prowess, but is still rich enough to pay for flattery and other services: </p>

					<p>Several songs express the honesty and freedom of the lower class. Cicely, for example, sings of her freedom “From high birth
						and all its fetters” which allows her, in contrast to Lady Elinor who is bound in an arranged marriage, to choose the “youth I
						love” (III.iii). Edward and Adela ridicule aristocratic pretensions in their duet, “Will great lords and ladies” (I.iii). The

					<p n="14">Much of the humor of the play derives from differences in manner and speech between French and English, and between

						suspended activity resumes its former walk.” The pace, the tilt of head, the movement of the hands and arms, must undergo a
						transformation from agitation to control. As if he catches himself, he stops still, gathers composure, then delivers his
						soliloquy. Hamlet’s reflections bring him to a crux: “To die, to sleep;/ To sleep, perchance to dream” (III.i). Hamlet comes

						appear as modest peasants. In Act II, scene vi, however, they are called upon by the lecherous Baron to seduce Grouffing, the

					<p n="19"> In the comedies of the period, an heiress and her maid are often depicted as companions: the lady demur and modest, the

						Cicely is several degrees more assertive and commanding. She constantly interrupts Lady Elinor, gives orders to Sir Palamede,
						and directs their actions. Her solo in Act I, “Nature to woman still so kind,” based on a Welch folk tune, asserts her sense

						</figure> The role of Lord William is, in effect, several roles in one. He was but a boy of twelve when the false slander
						against his father, the Baron of Oakland, forced him into exile. Following the death of his father, a distant cousin, Edmund
						the ploughman, has seized power as usurping Baron. In <name ref="France">France</name>, William took on the
						disguise of Palamede, and matured into a promising young soldier in service to De Courcy. Here he fell in love with Lady
						Elinor and she with him. Her father, however, has pledged her in marriage to the heir of the Baron of Oakland. Lord William,
						of course, is the rightful heir, but he dare not make that claim until he has received the official pardon from the King. He
						thus must remain docile and submissive, even to the demands of Cicely. Assisting him to gain access to Lady Elinor’s quarters
						in her father’s estate, Cicely has disguised him as Lily, a maid-in-waiting. As Lily, William/Palamede was also able to make
						the crossing in the same ship with Lady Elinor. He is caught in the dilemma of asserting his masculinity while Cicely
						teasingly reminds him of his female role. Whatever other roles he is forced to assume, the audience must perceive that he is
						indeed his own man and capable heir to his father’s lands. When he steps forth from the haunted tower dressed in his father’s
						armor, singing the powerful aria, “Spirit of my sainted sire” (III.iv), he has fully assumed his proper heroic stature. The
						backflashes that explain the usurpation and exile are provided, first, by the village girl Maud, then by Hugo, faithful
						servant of the family. Cicely’s abrupt dismissal of Maud in the above depicted scene (I.ii) is motivated by her anxiety that
						she will lose control of the situation if Maud reveals too much of William’s eminent restoration. When William is introduced
						as De Courcy’s court jester, the Baron ridicules his debased status, but deftly turns the tables with a satirical song
						laughing at the Baron’s impotent and ineffectual prowess. <figure n="7">

						solution was to present a quartet (two sopranos, an alto, and a tenor) with changes in costume but always the same as
						characters. For the opening chorus (I.i) they were costumed as fishermen, as huntsmen led in song by Robert (I.iii), as
						servants to the false Baron (I.iii), as cooks, again led by Robert in singing the “Roast Beef of Old <name
							ref="England">England</name>”(II.vii), and as soldiers (I.iv and III.vi). The chorus thus had four costume
						changes, but they were instructed always to synchronize their movements and gestures, as in the above scene as huntsmen. The
						one exception was their signature entrance: they would march on stage perfectly coordinated, then stumble and bump into each
						other when they came to a halt. <figure n="8">

					</p>

					<p n="20">The comic center of <title level="m">The Haunted Tower</title> is the lecherous and self-aggrandizing fake Baron. He
						exploits and abuses the lower classes as mere objects of his desires. Just clever enough to be aware of his own clumsiness in
						pretending to nobility, he constantly suspects that others of rank and power are laughing at his pretensions and attempting to
						undermine his authority. His suspicions are not ill-founded. In the scene depicted above (III.i), the Baron expresses to De
						Courcy his fears that a revolution, led by De Courcy’s court jester, is at hand. De Courcy, of course, perceives that the
						court jester is Sir Palamede, one of his own retinue. He knows Palamede’s affections for his sister, yet he has assumed that
						Lady Elinor would not dishonor her father’s pledge that she marry the son of the Baron of Oakland. In performing the role of
						the false Baron, Greg Cragg followed my cues in adapting several of Robert Baddeley’s mannerisms, including what <name
							ref="KellyMichael">Michael Kelly</name> described as Baddeley’s “habit of smacking his lips always when
							speaking.”<note place="foot" n="20" resp="editors">

					</p>

					<p n="21">At the beginning of Act III, De Courcy finally meets Adela, the peasant girl who has been impersonating his sister.
						Edward, son of the false Baron, is in love with the peasant girl Adela. Just as Lady Elinor must accept her father’s decision
						that she marry the heir of the Baron of Oakland, Edward must comply with his father’s eager pursuit of the marriage which will
						lend legitimacy to his own claims of nobility. Edward contrives the plot to disguise Adela as Lady Elinor and thus consummate
						the marriage before the real Lady Elinor arrives. The real Lady Elinor arrives too early, but is readily persuaded by Cicely
						to play along with the hoax in order to escape an unwanted marriage to Edward. This scene commences with De Courcy in pursuit
						of Sir Palamede, whom he now fears has turned traitor and seeks to elope with his sister. After the false Baron informs him
						that a revolution is underway, Edward arrives half-drunk from his tryst with Adela, whom he has introduced into the Oakland
						court as Lady Elinor. Considering his sister’s honor insulted by Edward’s overly familiar claims of intimacy with “my wife
						that is to be,” De Courcy is about to draw his sword. At this moment Adela arrives, and is greeted as “Lady Elinor” by the
						Baron and his son. Suspecting that this false identity must be a plot of Palamede’s, De Courcy declares, “I perceive, my lord,
						you have been imposed on, but you shall soon be avenged.” Edward and Adela stand aside looking guilty and exposed, while the
						Baron tries to puzzle out how he might have been “imposed on.” Not suspecting his son’s ruse and unable to determine any
						source of imposition, he follows after De Courcy to “ask whether I ought to be in a passion or not.” The scene closes with
						Adela singing a plaintive love song to Edward, “Love from the heart” (III.i). In referring to the penultimate scene (III.v),
						when “the Baron enters with his sword drawn, and some old armour awkwardly put on,” <name ref="GenestJohn"
							>Genest</name> cites <name ref="CowleyHannah">Hannah Cowley</name>’s remarks on Baddeley’s performance: “a
						great actor, holding a sword in his left hand, and making awkward passes with it, charms the audience; and brings down such
						applauses as the bewitching dialogue of Farquhar pants for in vain.”<note place="foot" n="22" resp="editors">
							<name ref="GenestJohn">Genest</name>, <title level="m">The English Stage</title>, 6:588; <name
								ref="CowleyHannah">Hannah Cowley</name>, Preface, <title level="m">The Town Before You: a Comedy, as
								acted at the Theatre-Royal, Covent Garden</title> (London: Printed by G. Woodfall, for T. N. Longman, 1795), p.
							vi.</note> The implication would seem to be that by some degradation of popular taste, the comedy of gesture has gained an
						unwarranted advantage over the comedy of witty dialogue. The charge is not without truth: Romantic comedy is not particularly
						noted for its clever dialogue, and it does rely frequently on body language, indeed more and more so with the increasing
						popularity of pantomime and melodrama. But this was not a passing phase. The Baron frantically waving his sword still brings
						down the house. Nevertheless it is also true that the dialogue contains a great deal of allusive irony concerning the politics
						of revolution.</p>
					<p n="22">Although the performers were well cued on pacing their delivery to allow that irony to emerge, many of the potential
						laugh-lines were missed by the student audiences during our four performances at UCLA. The cast and crew were therefore
						pleased and surprised by the much more responsive audience of literary scholars attending the performance on March 9, at the
						41st Annual Comparative Literature Conference, California State University, Long Beach. The success of our performances were
						due entirely to the talent and dedication of the students involved. Gifted singers like Schuyler Hudak as Adela, Kristin
						Crawford as Lady Elinor, and Lauren Cheak as Cicely brought <name ref="StoraceStephen">Storace</name>’s score to
						life, and Stephen Pu as vocal director enabled the entire cast to achieve excellence in virtuoso solos as well as complex
						choral pieces.</p>
					<p n="23">In the final scene (III.vi), Lord William is revealed as rightful Baron of Oakland. He reconciled with De Courcy who
						affirms that no obstacle interferes with his father’s pledge of Lady Elinor’s hand in marriage. Edward is free to marry Adela.
						The comic opera concludes with the first Grand Finale to be performed on a London Stage: <quote>
							<lg>
								<l>The banished ills of heretofore</l>
								<l>At happy distance viewing;</l>
								<l>Of the past we’ll think no more,</l>
								<l>While future bliss pursing. <lb/>
									(III.vi)</l>
							</lg>
						</quote> Crucial here is that Lord William exonerates the false Baron of all crimes related to his usurpation and committed
						under his rule. The “happy ending” reconciles French-English animosities and class conflict at the very moment in history,
						immediately following the outbreak of the French Revolution, when these tensions were at a peak. Whether or not the audience
						saw any contemporary relevance in this doctrine of reconciliation, the finale gave an optimistic “feel good” conclusion to a
						comedy of disguise, deceit, and sadistic exploitation.</p>
