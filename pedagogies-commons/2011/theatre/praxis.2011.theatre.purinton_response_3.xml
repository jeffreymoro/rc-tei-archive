				<ab>
					<emph>Part 1</emph>
				</ab>
				<p rend="noCount">Use the following prompts to guide your thinking and writing about the plays we have read at the end of the
					semester. Make your response brief.</p>
				<ab>Use in-text citations of primary sources.</ab>
				<list type="unordered">
					<item>Joanna Baillie’s <emph>Count Basil</emph> (1798), Lord <name ref="ByronGeorgeGordonByronBaron">Byron</name>’s
							<emph>Sardanapalus</emph> (1821), George Colman the Younger’s <emph>Blue-Beard; or Female Curiosity </emph>(1798), and
						Matthew Lewis’s <emph>Timour the Tartar; A Grand Romantic Melo-drama in Two Acts</emph> (1811) all focus on issues of national
						leadership and the “masculine” qualities of those put in positions of leadership. Discuss this motif in these plays.</item>

					<item>All four plays represent generic oddities emerging during the Romantic period. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these
						dramas that bend the generic rules.</item>

					<item>All four plays engage in negotiations with Orientalism—their settings, their characters and characterizations, and their
						dramatic “special effects” reify or challenge emergent British ideals of colonialism and imperialism. Discuss the Orientialism
						embedded in these plays.</item>

					<item>All four plays re-write quasi-historical or folkloric tales for the stage. What are the effects of adapting popular culture,
						knowledge already a part of the collective cultural consciousness, and re-casting it for the theatre? Why might Romantic
						playwrights turn to these stories as material for their plays? </item>
				</list>

				<ab>
					<emph>Part 2</emph>
				</ab>
				<p rend="noCount">Use the following prompts to guide your thinking and writing about the entire semester, our course in British
					Romantic drama, the plays we’ve read, discussed, written about. Use this opportunity to share with me something that you have
					learned or discovered, something about the learning process that I might not otherwise recognize from our previous assignments. Be
					honest and candid in both this course assessment and self-assessment.</p>
				<list type="unordered">
					<item>What have you learned about Romanticism that you did not know before this class? What have you learned about drama that you
						did not know before this class?</item>

					<item>What have you learned about yourself from this course? </item>

					<item>If you were to teach this course, what plays would you definitely keep, and what plays might you delete from the syllabus?
						What assignments would you keep, and what assignments might you modify? How? Why?</item>

					<item>In what ways has the course enriched your degree program as an English major? Would you like to see this course offered
						regularly? If I were to teach the course again, what recommendations would you make as someone who has experienced its “pilot”
						version?</item>

					<item>At the beginning of the semester, I made it clear that you would encounter feminist pedagogy in this course. Comment on the
						effectiveness of this pedagogy for you. One of the features of feminist pedagogy is to build community among the class
						members, but this community building can happen only when we have all class members coming to class regularly. Why is
						attendance a problem for a senior-level course (therefore a course students elect to take and are not required to take)? What
						can we do to foster better attendance and so enhance community building? </item>

					<item>Are there some affective experiences (as opposed to intellectual or cognitive) that the drama or the course prompted that
						you find useful to share? Have the dramas and class caused you to feel differently about anything than you did before the
						course began?</item>

					<item>I invite you to share anything else about the course, its readings, its assignments, its instructional delivery, and your
						role in the learning-teaching dynamic that might be useful to me as I render evaluations for individuals and as I assess the
						course in general. Since my presidential address at the fall meeting of the International Conference on Romanticism will focus
						on the <emph>praxis</emph> of teaching British Romantic Drama and teaching Romanticism through and with the drama, your
						comments will be helpful to my scholarship as well as to my teaching. </item>
