				</head>
				<p rend="noCount"> Use the following prompts to guide your thinking and writing. Be specific in your response, and cite direct
					quotations from the plays and/or reviews in-text parenthetically. Remember that this Response Paper may be the beginnings of your
					Critical Analysis, and so make it useful. </p>
				<list type="unordered">
					<item>Discuss the ways in which <emph>A Bold Stroke for a Husband, Everyone Has His Fault, </emph>and/or<emph> The Tryal</emph>
						explore and expose the limitations on women imposed by courtship customs and the marriage contract. How do these comedies
						ridicule the double standard of gendered behavior in courtship and marriage? How do the women characters take control of their
						lives and deploy clever machinations in order to circumvent the artificial decorum that they find binding? How is the “woman
						as property” notion questioned? </item>

					<item>Discuss the role of geography in <emph>A Bold Stroke for a Husband, Everyone Has His Fault, </emph>and <emph>The
							Tryal</emph>. Why would <name ref="CowleyHannah">Hannah Cowley</name>, <name ref="InchbaldMrs"
							>Elizabeth Inchbald</name>, and <name ref="BaillieJoanna">Joanna Baillie</name> locate their comedies in
						Madrid, <name ref="London">London</name>, and Bath? How do they use these settings to complement the themes of
						their plays, especially the latent critiques raised by plays written and staged in the 1780s and 1790s, in the midst of
						political revolutions, class destabilizations, commerce and industry?</item>

					<item>Discuss the gender-bending made possible by disguise, cross-dressing, masquerades, and mistaken identities in <emph>A Bold
							Stroke for a Husband, Everyone Has His Fault, </emph>and/or <emph>The Tryal</emph>. What can characters—especially female
						characters—accomplish in disguise that they cannot as themselves? What do the plays’ uses of disguise reveal about play-acting
						and about the meta-theatrical nature of these comedies? How do these manipulations of stage effects address matters of women’s
						rights? </item>

					<item>Discuss the legal critiques exposed in <emph>Everyone Has His Fault</emph> and or <emph>The Tryal</emph> (e.g., marriage,
						divorce, custody laws, bankruptcy and robbery, the law profession, courtroom practices). How do the comedies expose the
						masculine privilege embedded in late eighteenth-century legal institutions and activities? How do the comedies satirize the
						legal profession? What is the effect of that satire? </item>
					<item>Discuss the ways in which <emph>A Bold Stroke for a Husband, Everyone Has His Fault, </emph>and/or <emph>The Tryal</emph>
						exploit the motif of madness to create humor at the manifest level of content and to challenge the popular medical notions of
						hysteria as a feminine quality at the latent level of content? At this time of political frenzy, “madness” took on
						connotations associated with government, economics, and society as well as medicine, and so it was a useful trope for
						expressing chaos on multiple levels. Show us how that occurs in these comedies. </item>

					<item>Compare and contrast Victoria and Olivia from <emph>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</emph> with Agnes and Mariane from <emph>The
							Tryal</emph> as women who arrange their marital affairs in contrast to those of the prevailing culture. How do the women
						manipulate the men to achieve their ends? How do you think women in the theatrical audience would have perceived these brazen
						characters? What kind of moral example are they acting out for the audience? What would have been revolutionary about what
						they did, what they represented? </item>

					<item>Compare and contrast Don Caesar from <emph>A Bold Stroke for a Husband</emph>, Captain Irwin from <emph>Everyone Has His
							Fault</emph> and Harwood from <emph>The Tryal</emph> as men who are sorely tested in the comedies by <name
							ref="CowleyHannah">Cowley</name>, <name ref="InchbaldMrs">Inchbald</name> and <name
							ref="BaillieJoanna">Baillie</name>. How is each man humbled for his foibles and reformed by strong female
						characters? What do they reveal about the stereotypes of masculinity and the crisis of masculinity at the end of the
						eighteenth century? </item>

					<item>Compare and contrast the reading of <emph>A Bold Stroke for a Husband, Everyone Has His Fault</emph>, and/or <emph>The
							Tryal</emph> with your participating in the production or viewing as a spectator a recent (within the last three months)
						play. What happens in reading a play that does not occur on the stage? How does the spectacle of performance and production
						alter the reading script? Think about the ways our class readings and the listening of eighteenth-century theatrical music
						enriched your reading of the play, and comment on those dimensions. What do these comedies’ reviews indicate about the dynamic
						between the stage and “closet” version of drama? </item>

					<item>Create your own prompt. Please feel free to discuss anything you are thinking about with me. </item>
